    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it&#x27;s smell particularly impressive or offensive</li>
            <li>In addition, it has a wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Their pomade is also awesome.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE, ITEM, VERY GOOD FOR TRAVEL!</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this shampoo is great.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Suave or VO5, which has pleasant smells</li>
            <li>Plus, the shampoo and conditioner has a pleasant smell, which often lingers on my hair for hours after use.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant without being overbeing.  </li>
            <li>Its aroma is pleasant, too.</li>
            <li>This conditioning shampoo smells good and softens hair without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells so good.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some reviewers, I liked the frangrance.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is nice to the touch</li>
            <li>Plus there was a nice shine to it.  </li>
            <li>and she liked it</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used this bottle of shampoo by Motions and I have to say that it is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Great for a quick wash after the gym.</li>
            <li>I did use it once but had to re wash my hair three times to get the very strong smell out of my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo my hair feels full and has body - always a good thing.  </li>
            <li>The result is silky soft hair, wonderfully manageable and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>Good shampoo, it smell good and leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Gotta love motions.</li>
            <li>On colored hair, it is more tricky.</li>
            <li>Since my  research re price shows it cost more I may not use it again.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t like most shampoos and is picky about what types of products it will work with.  </li>
            <li>This almost made it to my favorite shampoos list.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of a 2-in-1 shampoo.</li>
            <li>This worked better in the summer months for me.</li>
            <li>If you buy I hope you are happy with the product and thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
            <li>I swim most days, so I wash my hair a lot</li>
            <li>Then again, I don&#x27;t think that is a concern most men have.  </li>
            <li>This is the second product I have used by Motions and I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product because it leaves your hair looking and feeling great...</li>
            <li>AND MOST IMPORTANTLY DOES THE JOB OF BOTH SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li>, it was not too strong or overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this has a nice scent, and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I found that for my own hair--it gives too much body, but I have wavy hair and am always trying to control it.</li>
            <li>Motions Lavish Conditioning Shampoo is gentle yet effective to use on my hair every day.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo, I was impressed by the nice lather for a small amount of shampoo.</li>
            <li>and my hair did not feel as squeaky clean, using it.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo my hair felt clean.  </li>
            <li>Our hair came out clean, the luster and shine and</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair squeaky clean</li>
            <li>Considering that it&#x27;s less than 1/3 of the price, I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>I think in our world of politically correctness we are missing a great deal of joy for lack of celebrating each others differences or cultures.</li>
            <li>coarse hair try this product and they loved it.</li>
            <li>Nothing earth-shattering, but it&#x27;s definitely not bad.</li>
            <li>I found it completely adequate but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have been a lucky guy when it comes to shampoo.  </li>
            <li>of us can say that our hair was more lustrous or shiny or full or any other superlatives of that kind.</li>
            <li>(even if it&#x27;s just to say, Hi!&amp;quot;) feel free to post it below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It suds up nicely for a deep clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure women will have a different opinion on the product, because they are expecting it to do more for them, but for me I want a shampoo that lathers well, leaves me feeling clean, and has a decent scent to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is something like buying a generic product: you&#x27;d get it if the price were attractive, but with one big positive factor, which is that you&#x27;ll know it won&#x27;t be a \\&quot;dud\\&quot; or below-average product like many generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In many ways I feel that probably will have a huge influence the outcomes I expect from shampoo and my overall review.  </li>
            <li>If you are male, honestly, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have any issues with it.  </li>
            <li>I love the strength of my natural hair</li>
            <li>do not feel I am the right person to review this item as it was not for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Motions left my hair feeling silky smooth, and strong.  </li>
            <li>The scent put me off at first because it smelled too &#x27;sweet&#x27;, but I got used to it and now don&#x27;t mind it much.</li>
            <li>It smells good (better than PM, actually) and left my hair soft, manageable, and tangle-free all day.  </li>
            <li>The first time or two I used this shampoo</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the shampoo, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t push it to a back corner of the shower and decided to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>Shorter, more manageable hair can totally use the shampoo alone.  </li>
            <li>First of all...</li>
            <li>Our verdict was pretty unanimous.</li>
            <li>but I found it pretty so-so.</li>
            <li>gave the product four stars because there are simply some products that I like better.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo gets the saltwater out and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>The result was quite nice on the teenage boy&#x27;s hair because they naturally try to avoid conditioners.</li>
            <li>First, let me say I&#x27;m a guy with short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It is generic enough to be great for natural hair and probably more greasy hair that dry colored.</li>
            <li>(I realize that since I have fairly short hair this may be an easy thing to accomplish).  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine color treated hair and a lot of coarse gray hair under the color.</li>
            <li>This is shampoo, it feels and works like shampoo, it&#x27;s more than adequate for washing hair (whether male or female)</li>
            <li>The smell has grown on me and now I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo gets really foamy and sudsy, which I like.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has an unusual smell.  </li>
            <li>No matter who this was intended for, the smell is just way too much for me</li>
            <li>This shampoo works really well on the swimmers&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>and I feel as if my hair is much cleaner.</li>
            <li>and I had a visitor ( who is very picky,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it did much of a conditioning job.</li>
            <li>A few family members tried out this shampoo and added their opinions to my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the shapmoo left my head feeling clean and fresh, it made my hair soft and managable</li>
            <li>particular product comes in a pack of six.</li>
            <li>In fact I thought my hair felt more dry and coarse after using it.</li>
            <li>First I must admit that as a guy I have short hair, and I don&#x27;t have high requirements for a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I use less conditioner and my hair has body and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>I think it is fine but not exciting.</li>
            <li>We tried this shampoo on colored hair of adult female and fine hair of teenage boy.</li>
            <li>This is important for me because I like a product that will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it clearly was so by the directions.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair that is fairly straight and on the thick side.  </li>
            <li>It detangles a bit because of the conditioner and loosens thicker, naturally textured hair grades.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to find a natural one that doesn&#x27;t contain an allergen and leaves my hair manageable.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair.  </li>
            <li>but when it dries it is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo for women who&#x27;re getting back to their &#x27;natural state of hair&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Finally the shampoo had a decent scent</li>
            <li>We usually need a LOT of conditioner to make it smooth, so it is not the shampoo&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>It is not exactly flowery, but it has an almost chemical smell that is pretty strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the product&#x27;s ads show a woman of African ancestry which I am not (as far as I know!), the shampoo works well for me.</li>
            <li>Even after repeated rinsing, hair feels slick and greasy and just doesn&#x27;t seem to come clean and</li>
            <li>As a reader of this review I encourage you if you are a woman to read a few of the other reviews that could probably tell you more in terms of how women might feel about this product.  </li>
            <li>That was enough to work up a decent lather, and wash my entire head.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it contains some ingredients of questionable toxicity, but to be fair, most shampoos do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended if the price is right, otherwise, a little ho-hum.</li>
            <li>It was easy to comb through when wet and after it dried.  </li>
            <li>then that it&#x27;s pretty bland.</li>
            <li>I have (strange) long, dark blonde hair that easily tangles if not treated well.  </li>
            <li>would you say about a shampoo that really has no special distinguishing features?</li>

            <li> As a reader of this review I encourage you if you are a woman to read a few of the other reviews that could probably tell you more in terms of how women might feel about this product.  </li>
            <li> That was enough to work up a decent lather, and wash my entire head.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it contains some ingredients of questionable toxicity, but to be fair, most shampoos do.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have (strange) long, dark blonde hair that easily tangles if not treated well.  </li>
            <li> would you say about a shampoo that really has no special distinguishing features?</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use it a couple of times without conditioner because of running out of conditioner and it is the only shampoo that leaves my hair moisturized in the absence of using a conditioner.</li>
            <li> While I thought the shampoo got my hair clean, compared to my usual shampoo from Costco - the Kirkland brand I found it less foamy</li>
            <li> i did very much like the container&#x27;s shape as it is much easier to handle than the awkward shape of the Kirkland containers</li>
            <li> I realize that sounds sort of strange.  </li>
            <li> You can get away without using conditioner after this shampoo, but if you have incredibly dry, tangly, long hair, I&#x27;d still keep the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my hair felt not much different from the other shampoos that I have used.</li>

            <li> To me the smell of this was just plain offensive, it actually made me feel nauseous.</li>

            <li> /&gt;First the shampoo does lather well, I found that a small amount, a little larger than a quarter, did the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> It can be used with or without a secondary conditioner and on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> so on was, well, average.</li>
            <li> the conditioner that they use does not weigh my hair down and make it feel oily.</li>
            <li> Products that leave a lot of residue in my hair leave it flat and dull looking.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a bad product at all, I&#x27;ve used it on my daughter who has significantly longer hair</li>

            <li> It left my hair heavy feeling and unpleasant smelling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good shampoo, it smell good and leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Generally I&#x27;m not a huge fan of \\&quot;combination\\&quot; shampoo/conditioners. But this has a nice scent, and it seems to work pretty well. Nothing earth-shattering, but it&#x27;s definitely not bad.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, ITEM, VERY GOOD FOR TRAVEL! AND MOST IMPORTANTLY DOES THE JOB OF BOTH SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER. WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Gotta love motions. If you have hair, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product comes in a pack of six. Can&#x27;t hurt to subscribe. The bottles are just as they would be in market. The product is up to standard. Motions Lavish Conditioning Shampoo is a thick, creamy wash. It detangles a bit because of the conditioner and loosens thicker, naturally textured hair grades. It can be used with or without a secondary conditioner and on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The first time or two I used this shampoo I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the shampoo, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t push it to a back corner of the shower and decided to continue using it.  The smell has grown on me and now I really like it.  Hair also feels noticeably softer after the shampoo is rinsed out.  The shampoo gets really foamy and sudsy, which I like.  You can get away without using conditioner after this shampoo, but if you have incredibly dry, tangly, long hair, I&#x27;d still keep the conditioner.  Shorter, more manageable hair can totally use the shampoo alone.  I definitely would recommend this product.  The packaging (which doesn&#x27;t affect quality) just seems a little dated to me.</li>
            <li> I use less conditioner and my hair has body and easy to comb. I like the feel. I was not sure of the smell but with a conditioner I don&#x27;t have the shampoo smell stay with me.  I think it is fine but not exciting.</li>
            <li> Although, the scent was delectable, I&#x27;m not a fan of the Motions Lavish Conditioning Shampoo.  My hair was difficult to untangle and it left a residue on hair/scalp.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this shampoo even if it were on sale.</li>
            <li> This review is for the manufacture of the item and for the customer that saw the avertisement and was misled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel I am the right person to review this item as it was not for my hair type. No where on the label or in the advertizing did it say that it was for African American men or women but it clearly was so by the directions. I think in our world of politically correctness we are missing a great deal of joy for lack of celebrating each others differences or cultures. I am a German American woman and this product does nothing for me because my hair happens to be different from my African American brothers and sisters. I threw the product away but I would hope that an African American would get the product and give it a raving review.</li>
            <li> We tried this shampoo on colored hair of adult female and fine hair of teenage boy. The result was quite nice on the teenage boy&#x27;s hair because they naturally try to avoid conditioners. This conditioning shampoo smells good and softens hair without making it look greasy. On colored hair, it is more tricky. We usually need a LOT of conditioner to make it smooth, so it is not the shampoo&#x27;s fault. It is generic enough to be great for natural hair and probably more greasy hair that dry colored.</li>
            <li> While I thought the shampoo got my hair clean, compared to my usual shampoo from Costco - the Kirkland brand I found it less foamy and my hair did not feel as squeaky clean, using it. Since my  research re price shows it cost more I may not use it again. i did very much like the container&#x27;s shape as it is much easier to handle than the awkward shape of the Kirkland containers</li>
            <li> I have (strange) long, dark blonde hair that easily tangles if not treated well.  It doesn&#x27;t like most shampoos and is picky about what types of products it will work with.  This one worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Paul Mitchell and this was a not-so-distant second for me.  Considering that it&#x27;s less than 1/3 of the price, I was pretty impressed. It smells good (better than PM, actually) and left my hair soft, manageable, and tangle-free all day.  The budget-conscious side of me might actually encourage me to switch to this permanently. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem like it would mind, which is next to a miracle.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was not a big hit in our home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an unusual smell.  It is not exactly flowery, but it has an almost chemical smell that is pretty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a greasy feeling residue.  Even after repeated rinsing, hair feels slick and greasy and just doesn&#x27;t seem to come clean and rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually like 2 in 1 shampoos because of the convenience and ease of using only one product.  However this shampoo just didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> This almost made it to my favorite shampoos list. Unfortunately, it contains some ingredients of questionable toxicity, but to be fair, most shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it leaves my hair. Although the product&#x27;s ads show a woman of African ancestry which I am not (as far as I know!), the shampoo works well for me. I chose this because (a) I got a sample to review and (b) it does not contain wheat or aloe, both of which I am allergic to. It also does not contain appear to contain formaldehyde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does have some ingredients that the Environmental Working Group says to avoid such as fragrance and parabens. I would prefer a shampoo with fewer chemicals but I have yet to find a natural one that doesn&#x27;t contain an allergen and leaves my hair manageable. For now I am mixing a tad of lemon juice in filtered water for a final rinse in hopes of removing anything harmful.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of a 2-in-1 shampoo. Great for a quick wash after the gym. Though the product only recommend weekly use, I had no problem using it daily. I do find that I needed extra conditioning now that the weather is cooler and drier on my hair. This worked better in the summer months for me. The scent put me off at first because it smelled too &#x27;sweet&#x27;, but I got used to it and now don&#x27;t mind it much.</li>
            <li> First of all... I&#x27;m male.  In many ways I feel that probably will have a huge influence the outcomes I expect from shampoo and my overall review.  After using this shampoo my hair felt clean.  I didn&#x27;t find it&#x27;s smell particularly impressive or offensive and I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to use tons of it to get a proper outcome.  As a reader of this review I encourage you if you are a woman to read a few of the other reviews that could probably tell you more in terms of how women might feel about this product.  If you are male, honestly, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have any issues with it.  If you buy I hope you are happy with the product and thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
            <li> To me the smell of this was just plain offensive, it actually made me feel nauseous. I did use it once but had to re wash my hair three times to get the very strong smell out of my hair. Apparently this is for coarse ethnic hair which was not clear from the description but when I went to the product website it shows only models of color. After learning that, it of course was not intended for fine blond hair, so I won&#x27;t bother with details on how bad it performed on my hair type, lets just say I looked like I stuck my finger in an electric outlet! No matter who this was intended for, the smell is just way too much for me but thats just my opinion.</li>
            <li> A few family members tried out this shampoo and added their opinions to my own. Our verdict was pretty unanimous. This is shampoo, it feels and works like shampoo, it&#x27;s more than adequate for washing hair (whether male or female) but it&#x27;s definitely nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of us can say that our hair was more lustrous or shiny or full or any other superlatives of that kind. Our hair came out clean, the luster and shine and so on was, well, average. The \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the shampoo, even the appearance of the bottle, was thoroughly average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would you say about a shampoo that really has no special distinguishing features? This one is something like buying a generic product: you&#x27;d get it if the price were attractive, but with one big positive factor, which is that you&#x27;ll know it won&#x27;t be a \\&quot;dud\\&quot; or below-average product like many generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if the price is right, otherwise, a little ho-hum.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works really well on the swimmers&#x27; hair. Their hair is washed twice per day and takes a beating in the pool. I found that for my own hair--it gives too much body, but I have wavy hair and am always trying to control it.</li>
            <li> First, let me say I&#x27;m a guy with short, fine hair.  I&#x27;m probably not the intended purchaser of this type of shampoo (it is intended for hair that is courser than mine), but it works well on my hair.  Unlike some reviewers, I liked the frangrance.  The fragrance did not linger in may hair after washing it.  My only complaint is that it seemed like it was difficult to rinse out of my hair.  I suppose that is the conditioning aspect of the shampoo, as it did leave my hair softer than usual.  I should note that this is intended for weekly use, but I used it daily without a problem.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets the job done but I found it pretty so-so. I prefer Suave or VO5, which has pleasant smells and I feel as if my hair is much cleaner. This shampoo is nice to the touch but other then that it&#x27;s pretty bland. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it if I had the choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> I have tested the Motions At Home Lavish Conditioning Shampoo for the last month. I found it completely adequate but nothing special. In fact, my hair felt not much different from the other shampoos that I have used.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair.  I haven&#x27;t had any chemicals put in my hair in years.  I love the strength of my natural hair and I&#x27;m always looking for something to help me maintain that strength.  Motions left my hair feeling silky smooth, and strong.  It was easy to comb through when wet and after it dried.  Plus there was a nice shine to it.  I highly recommend this shampoo for women who&#x27;re getting back to their &#x27;natural state of hair&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so good.  Makes your hair feel so silky.  I highly recommend this product because it leaves your hair looking and feeling great...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and I had a visitor ( who is very picky, still thinks \\&quot;Prell\\&quot; is the only shampoo)with  coarse hair try this product and they loved it. I find I need very little help from conditioners with this shampoo. It does add some shine and the conditioner that they use does not weigh my hair down and make it feel oily. Even though it is designed for medium to coarse hair, it worked well for me!</li>
            <li> Motions Lavish Conditioning Shampoo is gentle yet effective to use on my hair every day.  The result is silky soft hair, wonderfully manageable and easy to style.  Plus, the shampoo and conditioner has a pleasant smell, which often lingers on my hair for hours after use.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo, I was impressed by the nice lather for a small amount of shampoo. I have a lot of fine color treated hair and a lot of coarse gray hair under the color. This is a conditioning shampoo so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair squeaky clean but when it dries it is soft and manageable. I&#x27;ve used it several times and don&#x27;t notice any buildup and my hair is looking healthier.</li>
            <li> This shampoo just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me. I didn&#x27;t like the smell. I didn&#x27;t think it did much of a conditioning job. In fact I thought my hair felt more dry and coarse after using it.</li>
            <li> This product advertises itself as a lavishing shampoo.  First I must admit that as a guy I have short hair, and I don&#x27;t have high requirements for a shampoo.  I&#x27;m sure women will have a different opinion on the product, because they are expecting it to do more for them, but for me I want a shampoo that lathers well, leaves me feeling clean, and has a decent scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the shampoo does lather well, I found that a small amount, a little larger than a quarter, did the trick for me.  That was enough to work up a decent lather, and wash my entire head.  This is important for me because I like a product that will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the shapmoo left my head feeling clean and fresh, it made my hair soft and managable (I realize that since I have fairly short hair this may be an easy thing to accomplish).  Finally the shampoo had a decent scent, it was not too strong or overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product four stars because there are simply some products that I like better.  This wasn&#x27;t a bad product at all, I&#x27;ve used it on my daughter who has significantly longer hair and she liked it and it worked well for her.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing shampoo. I&#x27;ve had to use it a couple of times without conditioner because of running out of conditioner and it is the only shampoo that leaves my hair moisturized in the absence of using a conditioner. The scent is pleasant without being overbeing.  I like the shampoo and daily hair care products by Motions.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans hair without leaving it feeling like straw (unlike some of the harsher products on the market).  Its aroma is pleasant, too.</li>
            <li> I swim most days, so I wash my hair a lot and I have to be careful of products that dry out my hair.  This shampoo gets the saltwater out and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  I have light brown hair that is fairly straight and on the thick side.  Products that leave a lot of residue in my hair leave it flat and dull looking.  After using this shampoo my hair feels full and has body - always a good thing.  Since I like using a separate conditioner, I use this shampoo every other time I wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you&#x27;d also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it&#x27;s just to say, Hi!&amp;quot;) feel free to post it below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Claire</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was for ethnic hair when I selected the product to review.  It left my hair heavy feeling and unpleasant smelling. I gave it to my daughter who said that it was \\&quot;really weird shampoo\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have been a lucky guy when it comes to shampoo.  I have yet to find a brand that \\&quot;undermines\\&quot; my hair.  Then again, I don&#x27;t think that is a concern most men have.  Anyway, I used this bottle of shampoo by Motions and I have to say that it is really nice.  It leaves my hair clean and soft.  In addition, it has a wonderful fragrance.  I believe this is what allures me about this product.  I can&#x27;t seem to pin point the actually smell.  The aroma sort of reminds me of Joop, the cologne and a bit like a candy that I can&#x27;t seem to identify.  I realize that sounds sort of strange.  Nevertheless, this shampoo is great.  It suds up nicely for a deep clean.  I would attain this product again.  This is the second product I have used by Motions and I am very impressed.  Their pomade is also awesome.</li>
