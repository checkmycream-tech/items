    <ol>
            <li>so maybe that is why they seem to work perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The price for this 3 piece set is very good.</li>
            <li>given they were incredibly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>these work great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>great buy.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a good deal.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good quality and they don&#x27;t break or anything.</li>
            <li>this kind of price, i&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;since</li>
            <li>Good for me</li>
            <li>I had read one review that these were flimsy and didn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li>but they may not be an ideal fit for everyone.</li>
            <li>I found clippers at my local drug store for .99 that worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I bought this set and put a clipper in each bathroom so that no one will steal mine any more.  </li>
            <li>They bend nails more than they cut them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d could do better using my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would spend more and get a better set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had others that feel more robust, while these feel a bit more cheap.</li>
            <li>All are very light weigh and cheap.</li>
            <li>but they did ship fast and were good nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>There is a reason these are the cheapest nail clippers available.  </li>
            <li>Ok, it was cheap, so maybe I should expect much.  </li>
            <li>Arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.</li>
            <li>The large one is more prone to this</li>
            <li>For the price, these clippers get the job done, but besides that they&#x27;re nothing special.</li>
            <li>With the end fully depressed you would be lucky for it to clip the nails.</li>
            <li>The price is great but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>Not at all worth the money.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even worth returning</li>
            <li>but hey, you never know right?</li>
            <li>Well, they were right.</li>
            <li>cheap imports do not last  best advice spend a little more and get something that will last longer and not so flimsy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really find nail clippers to be anything special</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly losing my nail clippers, so I was happy to find this set at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I used them the first day I got them</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a first world problem, but does EVERYONE have to steal my nail clippers?  </li>
            <li>Spend some more coin and get something that actually works.</li>
            <li>A good thing is that these haven&#x27;t developed any rust like some of my other clippers have.</li>
            <li>I would order it in the future if it could cut a little more easily!</li>
            <li>This is a nice little refresher pack.</li>
            <li>and they were sturdy and very functional.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy like the others said.</li>
            <li>These do not cut very well.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re going straight into the trash can.</li>
            <li>(cost as much to ship it as I paid).  </li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t cut too well, but I can&#x27;t complain too much</li>
            <li>it was very flimsy and did not do the job as well as the Trim clippers</li>
            <li>They are OK at clipping nails but are not sharp enough to clip cuticles.  </li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t stay sharp and the handles easily deform under pressure.</li>
            <li>would definitely not recommend these to anyone as I&#x27;m sure there are others out there that cut as expected.</li>
            <li>There are three of them, exactly as shown, the biggest one is obviously for toes.  </li>
            <li>Glad I only lost a buck and a half.</li>
            <li>nails!&lt;br /&gt;I could return them but huge PIA for a few bucks.</li>
            <li>Stay clear.</li>
            <li>Maybe for my old toenails I need bolt cutters.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t seem all that sharp to begin with and they don&#x27;t have that handy little nail cleaner attachment.</li>
            <li>My old ones had gotten dull, and I kept forgetting to buy new ones at the store, and these fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thought it was a decent deal, but when you can&#x27;t use the regular sized trimmer as it won&#x27;t cut then why bother?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s three classic nail clippers in different sizes.  </li>
            <li>But it can bare cut my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried the so-called &#x27;toenail clipper&#x27; on my 62 yr old  toenails.</li>
            <li>They will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;But barely.</li>
            <li>Well, they are made of amazingly soft, flexible metal, barely were able to cut my nails and just a total disappointment.</li>

            <li> as other posters have said, these won&#x27;t open up far enough for even the trimmest of finger nails.</li>
            <li> - it was like the time Amazon asked me to rate a hammer that I bought, I mean, really, a hammer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer to use baby nail clippers, personally, but handing the bigger ones over means no one uses my little Gerber set out of desperation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read the back and seen that it has &#x27;a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm&#x27;</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product, but I don&#x27;t find the blades sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that they are not very sharp.</li>
            <li> Not much to be said about them.</li>
            <li> Received package and the clipper set was open, and one of the clippers was missing.  </li>
            <li> Very flimsy and poorly made.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son tried using them and complained they would not cut, so I went to help and found even when pressed 100% down</li>
            <li> Finally upgraded my reliable pair of clippers from the past 15 years or so...</li>
            <li> I am a female with small hands</li>
            <li> These ones just aren&#x27;t that sharp.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct in saying that they are too flimsy.  </li>
            <li> the other one with my roommate</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning</li>
            <li> I just threw them in the trash can after a few tries.</li>
            <li> the lever bends down and does not cut through my nails.</li>
            <li> But on both big toe&#x27;s nails it was unable to cut the entire width..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I missed the other reviews.</li>
            <li> In my book, this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again and have already broken one and likely to throw out the others</li>
            <li> waste your time.</li>
            <li> but the small one is almost useless to an adult.</li>
            <li> They can barely cut a nail and are essentially useless.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> well, the blade(?) clips too hard + stiff but</li>
            <li> There seems to be a slight chip in the cutting edge on the larger one making it tear instead of cut the nail.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for plain nail clippers--these are for you!  </li>
            <li> Not strong at ALL!  </li>
            <li> They are dull and over priced.  </li>
            <li> They must be purposely made dull for babies, but they rip the nail instead of snipping it.</li>
            <li> The medium clipper was dull and didn&#x27;t even pierce the nail.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t enough pressure to force the cutting edges to clip through the nail.</li>
            <li> neanderthal toenails are no more!</li>
            <li> I mean, how can you rate something like this &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These clippers lack the strength to bite through anything serious.  </li>
            <li> The flexing is so bad in the medium one it feels as if it may break or bend and not go back into shape.</li>
            <li> I have very thick fingernails, and</li>
            <li> I got SO TIRED of the drama.  </li>
            <li> These nail clippers are made out of poor quality metal.  </li>
            <li> They were over $8 but are worse than dollar store quality.</li>
            <li> very weak for my nails.</li>
            <li> Turns out I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> So what&#x27;s wrong with these?</li>
            <li> Very poor nailclippers that would not cut nails well.</li>
            <li> even the largest nail clippers in this set just bend instead of cutting.  </li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Total junk. Doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Finally upgraded my reliable pair of clippers from the past 15 years or so... these work great.  I am a female with small hands so maybe that is why they seem to work perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. There seems to be a slight chip in the cutting edge on the larger one making it tear instead of cut the nail. Even the ones which don&#x27;t have the chip in them seem to require enough force that the metal flexes/bends when making a clip. The flexing is so bad in the medium one it feels as if it may break or bend and not go back into shape.</li>
            <li> I thought all nail clippers were made the same.  Turns out I was wrong.  These ones just aren&#x27;t that sharp.  They are OK at clipping nails but are not sharp enough to clip cuticles.  They just end up tearing them.</li>
            <li> These do not work! They are dull and over priced.  I found clippers at my local drug store for .99 that worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers all have the part that rotates out and serves as a nail file and a cuticle edger.  These do not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly losing my nail clippers, so I was happy to find this set at such a reasonable price. I used them the first day I got them and they were sturdy and very functional. I&#x27;m going to buy a second set to keep as a spare. These clippers worked as well as the higher priced ones that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. The price for this 3 piece set is very good.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t seem all that sharp to begin with and they don&#x27;t have that handy little nail cleaner attachment. I should have just picked up some at the store.</li>
            <li> They work just like they are supposed to!  Don&#x27;t know about you, but these things disappear around my house.  This is a nice little refresher pack.</li>
            <li> Very poor nailclippers that would not cut nails well. With the end fully depressed you would be lucky for it to clip the nails. I just threw them in the trash can after a few tries.</li>
            <li> I got SO TIRED of the drama.  I know it&#x27;s a first world problem, but does EVERYONE have to steal my nail clippers?  I bought this set and put a clipper in each bathroom so that no one will steal mine any more.  I prefer to use baby nail clippers, personally, but handing the bigger ones over means no one uses my little Gerber set out of desperation.</li>
            <li> Not at all worth the money. They are too flimsy and fail to cut most of the time. The large one is more prone to this but the small one is almost useless to an adult.</li>
            <li> The price is great but don&#x27;t waste your money. Any nail that has some thickness won&#x27;t actually cut in these clippers. There isn&#x27;t enough pressure to force the cutting edges to clip through the nail.</li>
            <li> Cheap. They bend nails more than they cut them.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy like the others said. Only the big one works at all. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a good deal.</li>
            <li> Not strong at ALL!  Wouldn&#x27;t even cut through my two-year-old&#x27;s nails.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Thought it was a decent deal, but when you can&#x27;t use the regular sized trimmer as it won&#x27;t cut then why bother?

            <li> These do not cut very well.  They must be purposely made dull for babies, but they rip the nail instead of snipping it.</li>
            <li> I guess i should have know by the price these weren&#x27;t going to work but hey, you never know right? Well, they are made of amazingly soft, flexible metal, barely were able to cut my nails and just a total disappointment. Wasn&#x27;t even worth returning so I just tossed them. Stay clear.</li>
            <li> I bought these at Aco Hardware for $1.50, and I regret it. The medium clipper was dull and didn&#x27;t even pierce the nail. I&#x27;d could do better using my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;d read the back and seen that it has &#x27;a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm&#x27;, they would have stayed on the shelf. I won&#x27;t even recycle them. They&#x27;re going straight into the trash can. I can&#x27;t believe what they&#x27;re charging here for them. Glad I only lost a buck and a half.</li>
            <li> For the price, these clippers get the job done, but besides that they&#x27;re nothing special. I&#x27;ve had others that feel more robust, while these feel a bit more cheap. A good thing is that these haven&#x27;t developed any rust like some of my other clippers have.</li>
            <li> Junk the only one that cut was the toe nail clippers. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nail clippers. Not much to be said about them. They&#x27;re good quality and they don&#x27;t break or anything. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> PASS this one by...as other posters have said, these won&#x27;t open up far enough for even the trimmest of finger nails. Spend some more coin and get something that actually works.</li>
            <li> I added this to my order as an Amazon &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34;.  Received package and the clipper set was open, and one of the clippers was missing.  Not worth returning (cost as much to ship it as I paid).  There was no tampering with the shipping box, so it was shipped in this condition.  Not acceptable.  I don&#x27;t recommend you buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> Ok, it was cheap, so maybe I should expect much.  But it can bare cut my fingernails.  In my book, this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The mid sized clipper won&#x27;t open enough to work. All are very light weigh and cheap. What one gets for ordering unsight and unseen.</li>
            <li> Maybe I could use them as a paper-cutter, but they don&#x27;t open wide enough for adult finger nails!&lt;br /&gt;I could return them but huge PIA for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really find nail clippers to be anything special but they did ship fast and were good nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and poorly made. Would not buy again and have already broken one and likely to throw out the others</li>
            <li> well, the blade(?) clips too hard + stiff but&lt;br /&gt;at this kind of price, i&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;since it comes in 3 pcs I kept 2 for myself and&lt;br /&gt;sharing the other one with my roommate now.&lt;br /&gt;A great buy.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product, but I don&#x27;t find the blades sharp enough.  I would order it in the future if it could cut a little more easily!</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are made out of poor quality metal.  The blades don&#x27;t stay sharp and the handles easily deform under pressure.</li>
            <li> cheap imports do not last  best advice spend a little more and get something that will last longer and not so flimsy</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t even cut my toenails. The metal bends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I missed the other reviews. Don&#x27;t buy these. I didn&#x27;t know it was possible to make defective nail clippers but JMK somehow managed to. So what&#x27;s wrong with these? They don&#x27;t cut nails. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re made of aluminum foil.</li>
            <li> These clippers stick. They were over $8 but are worse than dollar store quality. I was embarrassed putting them in stocking for stuffer</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t cut too well, but I can&#x27;t complain too much given they were incredibly inexpensive.  Good for me but they may not be an ideal fit for everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s three classic nail clippers in different sizes.  My old ones had gotten dull, and I kept forgetting to buy new ones at the store, and these fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neanderthal toenails are no more!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for plain nail clippers--these are for you!  They work just like advertised and there are 3 different sizes.  Only complaint is that they are not very sharp.</li>
            <li> The package says a toenail clipper, fingernail and children&#x27;s nail clippers are included. I have only tried the so-called &#x27;toenail clipper&#x27; on my 62 yr old  toenails. It cut satisfactorily on the 4 smaller toes of each foot. But on both big toe&#x27;s nails it was unable to cut the entire width.. Beats nothing..that is about all. I would never buy these again. Maybe for my old toenails I need bolt cutters.</li>
            <li> very weak for my nails. the lever bends down and does not cut through my nails.</li>
            <li> it was very flimsy and did not do the job as well as the Trim clippers</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware! There is a reason these are the cheapest nail clippers available.  These clippers lack the strength to bite through anything serious.  I have very thick fingernails, and even the largest nail clippers in this set just bend instead of cutting.  In addition, they don&#x27;t have nail cleaners or nail files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nail clippers - I mean, how can you rate something like this &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; - it was like the time Amazon asked me to rate a hammer that I bought, I mean, really, a hammer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  There&#x27;s nothing fancy about them, they&#x27;re freakin&#x27; nail clippers.  There are three of them, exactly as shown, the biggest one is obviously for toes.  Arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.</li>
            <li> I had read one review that these were flimsy and didn&#x27;t work good. Well, they were right. They will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;But barely. I would spend more and get a better set.</li>
