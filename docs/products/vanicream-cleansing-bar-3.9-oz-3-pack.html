            <li>This soap helped me so much during my pregnancy with all my skin issues i recommend if you have eczema  also.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>This was one of a couple gentle cleansing products recommended for my face by an allergist a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t make it worse, which at that time was a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li>Excellent deal compared with local stores that either don&#x27;t have them in stock -- or are much more expensive even for a single bar.  </li>
            <li>Very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>My already sensitive skin and become even more sensitive recently.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, i order 4 jars and two of them had opened up and spilled all over my new (now greasy) yoga mat! )</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist highly recommended this line of products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin or allergies to certain preservatives or fragrance, this is something you should try.  </li>
            <li>Very well packaged and got here 2 days early.</li>
            <li>Eventually I found something that was able to control the eczema, but I have continued using this soap because I don&#x27;t need all the other stuff in regular soaps that might cause another flare up or irritate my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap if you want clear soft skin.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was expensive, but the bar lasts much longer than most bar soaps do.</li>
            <li>Besides being a mild soap with no perfumes or harsh chemicals, it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased these on the recommendation of my dermatologist for sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li>I developed a very severe case of eczema on my hands a few years back, and found out I had developed allergies to products containing formaldehyde derivatives, fragrances, and some other additives in most soaps, lotions and shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand of products, especially for children.</li>
            <li>but what I have at times is what I consider normal especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>They last pretty long as well.  </li>
            <li>The only soap that I can use on my 3 year old&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only cleanser I can use on my highly sensitive, eczema-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Works well, applies smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on the skin, and the bar last a long time.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dry or itchy skin since using the product.  </li>

            <li> Great bar of soap for your skin if you have very sensitive skin you should try to use this and it is unscented.  I would highly recommend this soap if you want clear soft skin.</li>
            <li> Can the manufacturer do something to the odor? The smell of this bar soap makes me want to puke. How about making it smell like vanicream? The odor aside, it seems to work fine. Good thing the odor will wash away with plenty of rinsing.</li>
            <li> Great for eczema skin.  The only soap that I can use on my 3 year old&#x27;s skin.</li>

            <li> This soap was recommended by my dermatologist.  The Vanicream lotion has been great for my sensitive skin so I decided to try the soap bar as well.  So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dry or itchy skin since using the product.  It leaves no smell whatsoever, which is a good thing, because you don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals infused in your soap.  Highly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li> I have dermatomyositis and have to use this soap for my face and my body. Besides being a mild soap with no perfumes or harsh chemicals, it lathers very well. At first I thought it was expensive, but the bar lasts much longer than most bar soaps do. I&#x27;m glad that my dermatologist recommended it for me. I plan to use it the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap for people with rosacea</li>

            <li> We love this soap. It is wonderful and non allergenic.</li>
            <li> Perfect soap for someone who does not want fragrance in their product.  Works well, applies smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on the skin, and the bar last a long time.  I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> This is the only cleanser I can use on my highly sensitive, eczema-prone skin. I am so thankful for it!</li>
            <li> I have eczema on the palms of my hands sometimes when I get stressed during the fall/winter months.  My allergist recommended using this soap and the Vanicream hand cream exclusively.  Yes, I am fully committed when I have flare-ups - keeping a bar of soap at every sink in the house and schlepping a bar to and from work in a portable soap dish.  This product works beautifully. I also use it on my face and body. My only complaint is that the soap gets mushy from being wet and it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like (probably because it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals?!).  The items were received as described.  Fast shipment.  I have the Prime membership.  Very happy with my experience!</li>
            <li> This was one of a couple gentle cleansing products recommended for my face by an allergist a couple years ago.  I tried three of the products he mentioned and liked this the best.  I have continued to use it.</li>
            <li> Helped my wife&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My son is prone to eczema and this soap has made all the difference. We also use the lotion, shampoo and conditioner and sun screen. I highly recommend this brand of products, especially for children.</li>
            <li> a very gentle product for my face and body. I struggle with dry (and aging) skin plus allergies.  I also have the cream. wonderful!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> I never use soap and Vanicream is not soap. I use this product for body &amp; face..it is fabulous cleanser</li>
            <li> Gentle, fragrance free, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Works well for exzema.</li>
            <li> Best soap for my grandson. His skin looks a lot lot lot lot better with the soap then with out it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for dry skin My skin is very dry to a condition called S&#x60;jogren&#x27;s Syndrone in the winter using the forced air heater causes lost of moisture in the house so I switch my soaps to Vanicream this helps I got a sample from my dermatologist so I ordered at Amazon to use taking a shower and washing my face daily.&lt;br /&gt;Louise F.</li>
            <li> My already sensitive skin and become even more sensitive recently.  My dermatologist highly recommended this line of products.  Love them and since switching to this line I don&#x27;t have the skin irritation that I did with other mainstream products.</li>
            <li> Good price and timely delivery</li>
            <li> Excellent for my skin .  Its the only bar of cleansing cream for my skin .Love this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased these on the recommendation of my dermatologist for sensitive skin issues. It&#x27;s been over three months with excellent results -- no irritation, itching, or dryness like I had with harsher soaps.  They last pretty long as well.  Excellent deal compared with local stores that either don&#x27;t have them in stock -- or are much more expensive even for a single bar.  The three pack is a great buy.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I developed a very severe case of eczema on my hands a few years back, and found out I had developed allergies to products containing formaldehyde derivatives, fragrances, and some other additives in most soaps, lotions and shampoos.  The dermatologist recommended this soap and all products of this company, so I tried the soap, shampoo, conditioner and skin lotions.  They didn&#x27;t make it worse, which at that time was a welcome relief.  Eventually I found something that was able to control the eczema, but I have continued using this soap because I don&#x27;t need all the other stuff in regular soaps that might cause another flare up or irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin or allergies to certain preservatives or fragrance, this is something you should try.

            <li> The product is a good one. It is the ONLY thing I can use on my skin without getting a serious rash. HOWEVER, i order 4 jars and two of them had opened up and spilled all over my new (now greasy) yoga mat! ) -:  What a mess!!</li>
            <li> Great product for people with allergies.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, will do again.</li>
