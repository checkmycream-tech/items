            <li>I could not be more</li>
            <li>but I am sure it will be.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer in 2000, it&#x27;s now 2013 and still running strong.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly light as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through so many brands and Panasonic wins without a doubt.</li>
            <li>So precise</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great clipper in every way, except the rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing and very durable.</li>
            <li>You pay for what you get, great close cut and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>So far it is performing great, it&#x27;s a smooth operating motor and cuts my hair very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>I have purchased two of these prior to this one and have had great success with them.</li>
            <li>Amazing and quiet.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Being a barber stylist, I use them on a regular basis so I need a reliable rechargeable clipper trimmer to do the fine tuning on my work and have been satisfied with this brand more than any other in over thirty</li>
            <li>I bought my first ER121 almost 8 years ago in Dubai.  </li>
            <li>Great clipper better than any other Cordless small clipper on the market.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s 2015 and they are still running strong as ever, I can&#x27;t use a razor on my face so I&#x27;ve been using these trimmers for 15 years 2 to 4 times a week and still using the same blade, of all the hundreds of electronic gadgets I&#x27;ve had this trimmer puts them all to shame.</li>
            <li>Sure this is kind of expensive</li>
            <li>Is lightweight and fits nicely in your hand with very little to no vibration.</li>
            <li>Another reason I chose this hair trimmer is because it came with dual voltage options and I travel quite a bit overseas, I would highly recommend this item to a friend.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable product:)</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.this replaces the same trimmer that I had for about 14 years.</li>
            <li>Of course you have to do the maintenance on it like any other electric trimmer product (i.e.: clean and oil it).  </li>
            <li>Bait and switch, complete lack of integrity and</li>
            <li>If anyone is searching for a hair trimmer that cuts evenly and is of high quality, than look no further.</li>
            <li>I use it daily as a professional Barber.</li>
            <li>and I was a little cautious about paying this much</li>

            <li> I am not a professional, I use it for personal use.</li>
            <li> It was way too smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand, the charging base is convenient for use.</li>
            <li> We love this trimmer and it&#x27;s getting nearly impossible to replace.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer thinks it&#x27;s a big dog</li>

            <li> Performs as well  as them  , but with less weight.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Even with fully charged, trimmer power is so weak that hair gets stuck in the blades...</li>
            <li> Precision cutting in half the time.</li>
            <li> difficult to return to say the least....</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product....</li>

            <li> Bottom line is you can&#x27;t go wrong with the ER121.</li>
            <li> But  one is Bad Item.</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> you know how it can be painful and annoying....</li>
            <li> I found out that the charging base will charge the Soniccare elite brush &amp; the toothbrush base will charge the battery in the trimmer as well.</li>
            <li> Where can I buy just the trimmer without the base ?</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for over ten years.  I could not be more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ER121 is a Great trimmer.</li>
            <li> clippers did not charge and had to return . difficult to return to say the least.... :((</li>
            <li> Made in Japan, I could not believe my eyes. Short, very very short battery life . The charge indicator never changes color or goes off.</li>
            <li> good clipper and delivery on time</li>
            <li> excellent product, worth the money, light weight but very durable!!</li>
            <li> Amazing and quiet. Precision cutting in half the time. Pricey but worth it. Incredibly light as well. I&#x27;ve been through so many brands and Panasonic wins without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and after my trimmers stopped working I borrowed these from my coworker. LOVE them! So precise and they last a long time without having to recharge them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer in 2000, it&#x27;s now 2013 and still running strong.  I just suggested to my son that he should buy one for him self.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing a review simply because I purchased my panasonic er121 trimmers in 2000 and and it&#x27;s 2015 and they are still running strong as ever, I can&#x27;t use a razor on my face so I&#x27;ve been using these trimmers for 15 years 2 to 4 times a week and still using the same blade, of all the hundreds of electronic gadgets I&#x27;ve had this trimmer puts them all to shame. Unbelievable product:)</li>
            <li> I cut my hair with these.  You pay for what you get, great close cut and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these prior to this one and have had great success with them. Being a barber stylist, I use them on a regular basis so I need a reliable rechargeable clipper trimmer to do the fine tuning on my work and have been satisfied with this brand more than any other in over thirty years.&lt;br /&gt;Did not yet rate it five star since I just bought but I am sure it will be.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find.....We love this trimmer and it&#x27;s getting nearly impossible to replace.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great clipper in every way, except the rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t last.  My two Panasonic clippers have this same problem.  Now I can only use them with a plugged in cord.</li>
            <li> Best cordless trimmer in the market.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and eficient for kids and bald-head´s.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice finishing around the ears and neck.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.this replaces the same trimmer that I had for about 14 years. woeks like a charm.</li>
            <li> Great clipper better than any other Cordless small clipper on the market. Quick delivery Very Happy with its performance. I use it daily as a professional Barber.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product the photo was of a bigger trimmer, a proper hair trimmer. What I received is no larger than a beard trimmer. Shaving my head with this will be tiresome and time consuming. 100 dollar beard trimmer...laughable... Avoid this product and this seller. Bait and switch, complete lack of integrity and why shopping online is getting harder and harder.</li>
            <li> This is a quality unit. I would buy it again. It feels good in the hand, the charging base is convenient for use. I am not a professional, I use it for personal use. The cut is precise and the power is good.</li>
            <li> I bought my first ER121 almost 8 years ago in Dubai.  Of course you have to do the maintenance on it like any other electric trimmer product (i.e.: clean and oil it).  It wasn&#x27;t until recently did it start giving me problems, so of course I found and purchased another one on Amazon.  This product is amazing and very durable. Bottom line is you can&#x27;t go wrong with the ER121.</li>
            <li> It was way too smaller than what I expected. It is pricey and does not work well as previous model. Even with fully charged, trimmer power is so weak that hair gets stuck in the blades... you know how it can be painful and annoying....My husband complaints about it and stops using it all together after 5 months of using it. I am not happy with this product....Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer thinks it&#x27;s a big dog and it is ! Performs as well  as them  , but with less weight. I found out that the charging base will charge the Soniccare elite brush &amp; the toothbrush base will charge the battery in the trimmer as well. Where can I buy just the trimmer without the base ? (Ha!).</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this hair trimmer a 4 and not a 5 was because I have only had it for a month or so. So far it is performing great, it&#x27;s a smooth operating motor and cuts my hair very close to the skin. Is lightweight and fits nicely in your hand with very little to no vibration. If anyone is searching for a hair trimmer that cuts evenly and is of high quality, than look no further. Sure this is kind of expensive and I was a little cautious about paying this much but it&#x27;s well worth the price. It&#x27;s an item that I feel will last  a few years and beyond. Another reason I chose this hair trimmer is because it came with dual voltage options and I travel quite a bit overseas, I would highly recommend this item to a friend.</li>
            <li> Works great but wont keep a charge</li>
            <li> One is Good. But  one is Bad Item.</li>
