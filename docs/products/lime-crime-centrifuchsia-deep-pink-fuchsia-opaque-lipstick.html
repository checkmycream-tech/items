            <li>My daughter was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The lipstick is darker than the swatch on the lips, but if you look at the tube it matches the color of the lipstick perfectly.</li>
            <li>Awesome lipstick.</li>
            <li>this color is beautiful on me.</li>
            <li>This color pops and the lipstick is great.</li>
            <li>Their sticks feel great on lips.</li>
            <li>Still, the color is very nice and it lasts longer than some lipsticks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>they are smooth and perfect</li>
            <li>LOVE THE COLOR!</li>
            <li>Not only that, the color is great for both the summer and winter months because it&#x27;s bright and charming and makes brunettes look incredibly alluring...</li>
            <li>The lipstick is amazing.</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic and bright.</li>
            <li>It also smells lovely and is nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is quickly becoming my favorite shade to wear!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Lime Crime from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>I love love love the color</li>
            <li>love the color so glad my friends helped me pick it out</li>
            <li>i love lime crime</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>I love Limecrime products.</li>
            <li>Perfect pink color, love how color lasts, is a vegan product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely pigmented &amp; very pretty on.</li>
            <li>I think this lipstick looks great alone or with a clear gloss.</li>
            <li>Perfect Pink!</li>
            <li>While it is darker than the photo, it is still very bold.</li>
            <li>Good color - a bit brighter than the photo, but is a beautiful, bright, deep pink, almost berry-like color.</li>
            <li>Very gorgeous and long</li>
            <li>It smells good like any other Lime Crime lipstick and feels good on my lips.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC lipstick, with strong color, as described in ad.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color, lasts all night long!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite lipstick!</li>
            <li>Thick, rich and beautiful!</li>
            <li>but I still love it and just love lime crime in general.</li>
            <li>I use, Glamor 101, Geradium, Centrafuscha and the bright red one (forget the name).</li>
            <li>I use it in place of a bright red lip with winged eye liner</li>
            <li>This purchase made me check out the full line.</li>
            <li>instead I really disapointed because I really wanted this color, however, de orange color is a nice color I have never seen before, but disapointed I did not received this centrifuchsia.</li>
            <li>The color lasts a good long while too.</li>
            <li>Fine for some looks, but I love that these lipsticks are moderately shiney as well.</li>
            <li>Pretty color and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>It can go on very vibrant or applied lightly for a nice, but subtle, brightness.</li>
            <li>So I went in search of a youngish line that would still give me the shade I wanted with the ability to survive the daily torture I put my lipsticks through.  </li>
            <li>It wears well and is very well pigmented.</li>
            <li>This is really wearable fuchsia lipstick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very creamy and may have a bit of staining, but nothing out of control.</li>
            <li>When opaque lipstick became popular a few years ago, all we could get was matte.</li>
            <li>However, it rather easily broke off at the bottom so the product is loose in the tube, I took one star off for that.</li>
            <li>The lip is a true hot pink.</li>
            <li>This has alot of pigment and very moisturizing, only issue is that it does not stay long, but it is the exact color with MAC Flat out fabulous!</li>
            <li>Given their other colors are so soft &amp; full of moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter in color &amp;\\&quot;very\\&quot; sheer and moist.</li>
            <li>like you got some kind of secret you&#x27;re not sharing with anyone.  </li>
            <li>I love the packaging and it has a subtle vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this lipstick and would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>Pretty long lasting, but does wear off with eating and drinking - thought maybe it would last longer.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is not a lipstick for someone who wants just a little bit of color.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li> If your lips tend to dry out from lipsticks use a balm under this.</li>
            <li> I want to point out that you will have to go over the color a few times, this isn&#x27;t a problem for me because I do that with every lipstick, but I know some people only want to swipe on one layer.</li>
            <li> It is a tad (just a tad) bit dryer than some of the other colors from Lime Crime.</li>
            <li> This small difference Is definitely not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product anytime and look forward to using other Lime Crime products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 53 yr old professional and this lipstick isn&#x27;t crazy looking (unless you want it to be) at all.</li>
            <li> Like title of review says, It is slightly darker than the picture</li>
            <li> I find I just need to re-apply a little after a meal.</li>
            <li> I had once seen an expensive ad for a fashion designer that had listed her signature color as fuschia.  </li>

            <li> This color pops and the lipstick is great. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li> Arrived in timely fashion &amp; well packaged. But, the picture doesn&#x27;t display the color well. It&#x27;s much lighter in color &amp;\\&quot;very\\&quot; sheer and moist.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I had once seen an expensive ad for a fashion designer that had listed her signature color as fuschia.  Unfortunately, her makeup line targeted celebrities with healthy, fat wallets.  So I went in search of a youngish line that would still give me the shade I wanted with the ability to survive the daily torture I put my lipsticks through.  I fell in love with Lime Crime from the beginning.  I ate, sweat, licked, bit and pursed and the color stayed. It even maintains its moisture without melting or smooshing like cheaper lipsticks.  Not only that, the color is great for both the summer and winter months because it&#x27;s bright and charming and makes brunettes look incredibly alluring...like you got some kind of secret you&#x27;re not sharing with anyone.  Yeah.  It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is darker than the swatch on the lips, but if you look at the tube it matches the color of the lipstick perfectly. I looked up swatches before hand and knew what I was getting. It wears for a really long time. I suggest priming your lips before using this. If your lips tend to dry out from lipsticks use a balm under this. I love the packaging and it has a subtle vanilla scent. This color is very similar to MAC Girl About Town, so you may want to look at swatches of both online. Overall I really like this lipstick and would definitely order it again. This is not a lipstick for someone who wants just a little bit of color. While it is darker than the photo, it is still very bold. I want to point out that you will have to go over the color a few times, this isn&#x27;t a problem for me because I do that with every lipstick, but I know some people only want to swipe on one layer. I think this lipstick looks great alone or with a clear gloss.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this color. The lipstick is amazing. This purchase made me check out the full line. The lip is a true hot pink. Very gorgeous and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Def buying again</li>
            <li> I bought the color orange (2) and ask for this color centrifuchsia but I received a red one instead I really disapointed because I really wanted this color, however, de orange color is a nice color I have never seen before, but disapointed I did not received this centrifuchsia.</li>
            <li> Like title of review says, It is slightly darker than the picture but I still love it and just love lime crime in general.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE COLOR! It wears well and is very well pigmented. However, it rather easily broke off at the bottom so the product is loose in the tube, I took one star off for that.</li>
            <li> Pretty color and lasts longer. It smells good like any other Lime Crime lipstick and feels good on my lips.</li>
            <li> This is really wearable fuchsia lipstick. It can go on very vibrant or applied lightly for a nice, but subtle, brightness. It also doesn&#x27;t make your teeth look yellow, or yellower. It&#x27;s also very creamy and may have a bit of staining, but nothing out of control.</li>
            <li> I love love love the color but i have to keep reapplying all night! even when i did a lip primer, lip liner AND this lipstick it still doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> Awesome lipstick. Thick, rich and beautiful! I use, Glamor 101, Geradium, Centrafuscha and the bright red one (forget the name). I&#x27;m a 53 yr old professional and this lipstick isn&#x27;t crazy looking (unless you want it to be) at all. When opaque lipstick became popular a few years ago, all we could get was matte. Fine for some looks, but I love that these lipsticks are moderately shiney as well.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC lipstick, with strong color, as described in ad.  Bought 2 colors!!</li>
            <li> love the color so glad my friends helped me pick it out i love lime crime they are smooth and perfect</li>
            <li> This has alot of pigment and very moisturizing, only issue is that it does not stay long, but it is the exact color with MAC Flat out fabulous!</li>
            <li> This lipstick rocks in terms of color. It&#x27;s nicely pigmented &amp; very pretty on. It is a tad (just a tad) bit dryer than some of the other colors from Lime Crime. Given their other colors are so soft &amp; full of moisture. Their sticks feel great on lips. This small difference Is definitely not a deal breaker. The four (4) star &amp; not give (5) is because of the constant reapplying &amp; the price. If u pay over ten ($10) for any brand lipstick, it should last for the mist part if the day if not all of the day. Other than that, I highly recommend. You&#x27;ll love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Perfect Pink! Beautiful color, lasts all night long! Would recommend this product anytime and look forward to using other Lime Crime products</li>
            <li> this color is beautiful on me. I use it in place of a bright red lip with winged eye liner</li>
            <li> I adore this lipstick. The color is fantastic and bright. I get compliments all the time! It also smells lovely and is nice and moisturizing. The color lasts a good long while too. I find I just need to re-apply a little after a meal. I love Limecrime products. I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite lipstick!</li>
            <li> Good color - a bit brighter than the photo, but is a beautiful, bright, deep pink, almost berry-like color. I especially like it paired with Lime Crime&#x27;s wine color. Pretty long lasting, but does wear off with eating and drinking - thought maybe it would last longer. Still, the color is very nice and it lasts longer than some lipsticks. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Perfect pink color, love how color lasts, is a vegan product. This is quickly becoming my favorite shade to wear!</li>
