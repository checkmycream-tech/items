            <li>great product!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, great price!</li>
            <li>This numbing cream works GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful laser TriaðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>and a beautiful tattoo  without pain</li>
            <li>I still achieved great results without the saran wrap</li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>The best is I can use it pain free.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but waiting 45 minutes for the numbing to begin is the reason why I give a 4</li>
            <li>This dose not fully take the pain away but numbs it up good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Its to lesson the amount of pain experienced you have to endure in areas that hurt more than others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first numbing crÃ¨me I&#x27;ve used and it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>This products really works perfect for micro needling facials.</li>
            <li>Even the ULTRA sensitive neck area numbed up wonderfully with no saran wrap.  </li>
            <li>(not harder) will produce the best results.</li>
            <li>It is the best if you hurt from one pimple, or acne in general.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 1mm and 1.5 mm derma roller for my face and legs and so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>It makes my rolling sessions much more beneficial because I can go deeper and going deeper</li>
            <li>so I guess I&#x27;m able to tolerate tattoos better than derma rolling.  </li>
            <li>Wow! Works surprisingly well!</li>
            <li>Frankly, I found it more comfortable to micro-needle without it.</li>
            <li>It surprised my customers it works great.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind a derma rolling session on each part of the body goes by very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I read the directions and did everything, but it just wasn&#x27;t that strong I guess.</li>
            <li>Worked OK but wore off too quickly.</li>
            <li>I was able to use much more pressure than I ever have before with the roller, allowing pinpricks of blood to be visible after each area was complete.</li>
            <li>Trying to secure saran wrap onto your face isn&#x27;t easy and honestly (for me) not necessary.  </li>
            <li>But then I have two sleeves and two full side pieces and never used numbing for my tattoos</li>
            <li>Sweet Jesus, I cannot feel my face.</li>
            <li>Honestly not the best.</li>
            <li>I put a good amount on and left it there for 2hrs.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily under the eyes, eyebrow bones and forehead because those are the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I had a tattoo started on my thigh and did not want to work on it until i got something to mildly take away the pain.  </li>
            <li>I was touching up a tattoo on my ankle and and it still hurt just as much as the first.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying such a good product.</li>
            <li>didnt last more the 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>they really works!</li>
            <li>World great for numbing but didn&#x27;t last as long on me the box says</li>
            <li>I found that the product worked better if I used saran wrap to cover numbing product as it further activates the numbing properties of the lidocaine.</li>
            <li>this product really didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works</li>
            <li>Good for hair removal, not good for piercings.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old</li>
            <li>At first there was a slight burning sensation but it was very bearable.</li>
            <li>It is a numbing cream, soft and does not make you red if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It gradually get&#x27;s more numb instead of so fast that you are drooling all over yourself and it still allows you to feel pressure which is a big plus because you do need to have an indication of where you are rolling.</li>
            <li>If using for derma rolling with smaller needles you don&#x27;t typically need to use it on the whole face.</li>

            <li> noticed that pain came back very soon after I rolled an area, even if it was super numb to begin with.</li>
            <li> but I could tell the forehead was more numb, probably by 10-15%.</li>
            <li> For that reason I would hesitate to use it for a long procedure like a tattoo.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for about an hour and a half prior to my piercing but it never numbed my skin.</li>
            <li> For areas of the body that somehow become so itchy that you can&#x27;t stand it or pain....for small isolated areas on the skin.  Don&#x27;t ingest it directly or get in the eyes.</li>
            <li> I used the entire tube on my face, but I feel half a tube would work just as well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying to get a little more money for a stronger numbing cream, especially for piercings as painful as belly button piercings.</li>
            <li> Deep Numb worked really well, but I didn&#x27;t put enough.</li>
            <li> This is as yood as any of the other products offered.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do much overall, and really made my lips tingle painfully.  </li>
            <li> If I could rate less than one star I would.</li>
            <li> It works but is to little I have to buy moreðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ </li>
            <li> It just took a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I needle my face and this cream numbs so well that I have to be careful not to press too hard with my needle roller because you don&#x27;t feel a thing once this cream takes effect.</li>
            <li> I use a 1.5 millimeter roller and in the past have just sucked up the pain and rolled using no numbing crÃ¨me.</li>
            <li> Deep Numb kept my skin numb long enough to use my 2mm dermaroller.</li>
            <li> I will carry my deep numb.</li>
            <li> The area on the inside was completely numb but the outside wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Crap doesn&#x27;t work I put a layer and another on and waited for 4 whole hours still nothing</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use plastic wrap (I mean, wrapping my face</li>
            <li> I got this to numb the area around my belly button for a belly button piercing, and it was numb for like 10 minutes, then when I actually went to get it pierced, I almost cried because I was shocked at how much pain I had with this &amp;#34;numbing cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was having such painful intercourse.</li>
            <li> 10g deep numb cream!  </li>
            <li> I bought this to numb my face before micro-needling.  </li>
            <li> If I ever get a neck piece though, you can bet it will numb to the hilt with something.</li>
            <li> I use to dread using the roller derma because it hurt so bad. .</li>

            <li> It works but is to little I have to buy moreðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  I used it one time and it finished</li>
            <li> didnt last more the 5 minutes.</li>

            <li> great product!!!  and a beautiful tattoo  without pain might i add,,,lol</li>
            <li> I received a sample to use with my roller derm . I use to dread using the roller derma because it hurt so bad. . I am 67 years old and yes I have acne. The doctor&#x27;s wanted to put me on meds. I refused I use the roller derm and it is going away. The doctor is surprise. The best is I can use it pain free. Granny is considering a tattoo. I will carry my deep numb. I will be ordering this product for use with my roller derm. Thanks Amazon for carrying such a good product.</li>
            <li> Worked so well I couldn&#x27;t feel my face for hours. So, it does it&#x27;s job well! I bought this for my 1mm and 1.5 mm derma roller for my face and legs and so glad that I did. If using for derma rolling with smaller needles you don&#x27;t typically need to use it on the whole face. I use it primarily under the eyes, eyebrow bones and forehead because those are the most sensitive areas. It makes my rolling sessions much more beneficial because I can go deeper and going deeper (not harder) will produce the best results. I didn&#x27;t need to use plastic wrap (I mean, wrapping my face just wasn&#x27;t going to happen, I like to breathe!) and it still worked in about 30-45 min and lasted for about 4 hours. It gradually get&#x27;s more numb instead of so fast that you are drooling all over yourself and it still allows you to feel pressure which is a big plus because you do need to have an indication of where you are rolling. I&#x27;d imagine this would work well with tattoos even though I haven&#x27;t tried that route, but needles are still the same, feel the same, and if you can alleviate the pain of it well then you have it made. Beauty is pain, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be!</li>
            <li> I bought this to numb my face before micro-needling.  It didn&#x27;t seem to do much overall, and really made my lips tingle painfully.  Frankly, I found it more comfortable to micro-needle without it.</li>
            <li> It surprised my customers it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a skin numbing agent for derma rolling.  I use a 1.5 millimeter roller and in the past have just sucked up the pain and rolled using no numbing crÃ¨me. Around the eyes, over the lips, and the neck, however, were too unbearable to continue with at 1.5 mm without numbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first numbing crÃ¨me I&#x27;ve used and it worked wonderfully.  The only place I used saran wrap was on my forehead, secured with my beanie while I waited 1.5 hours for the numbing agents to do their work.  I still achieved great results without the saran wrap but I could tell the forehead was more numb, probably by 10-15%. Trying to secure saran wrap onto your face isn&#x27;t easy and honestly (for me) not necessary.  Even the ULTRA sensitive neck area numbed up wonderfully with no saran wrap.  Keep in mind a derma rolling session on each part of the body goes by very quickly.  My goal wasn&#x27;t to feel nothing (although on my forehead I didn&#x27;t), it was to make the rolling bearable.  My skin was so nice and numb I was able to use much more pressure than I ever have before with the roller, allowing pinpricks of blood to be visible after each area was complete. (It sounds barbaric but trust me, derma rolling can transform your skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that pain came back very soon after I rolled an area, even if it was super numb to begin with. Perhaps this is because the increased blood flow to the &amp;#34;injury&amp;#34; immediately after rolling speeds the medicine in the numbing agent away from the skin.  For that reason I would hesitate to use it for a long procedure like a tattoo.  But then I have two sleeves and two full side pieces and never used numbing for my tattoos so I guess I&#x27;m able to tolerate tattoos better than derma rolling.  If I ever get a neck piece though, you can bet it will numb to the hilt with something. Needles on the neck be they from derma rolling or tattooing are unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> It does a good job, but waiting 45 minutes for the numbing to begin is the reason why I give a 4</li>
            <li> Crap doesn&#x27;t work I put a layer and another on and waited for 4 whole hours still nothing</li>
            <li> This worked just like what I received at my dermotologist.  It just took a little longer.  It is quality stuff.</li>
            <li> I had a tattoo started on my thigh and did not want to work on it until i got something to mildly take away the pain.  Deep Numb worked really well, but I didn&#x27;t put enough. So next time I will be putting it on for 2 hours instead of 1 and on the outside of where the tattoo will be.  The area on the inside was completely numb but the outside wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Wow! Works surprisingly well!</li>
            <li> I got this to take some of the pain away when I derma roll my face an it did the trick. This dose not fully take the pain away but numbs it up good. I got this a bit earlier then estimated. I recommend this product. I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> Sweet Jesus, I cannot feel my face. I use this numbing cream for derma rolling and didn&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
            <li> Honestly not the best. I got this to numb the area around my belly button for a belly button piercing, and it was numb for like 10 minutes, then when I actually went to get it pierced, I almost cried because I was shocked at how much pain I had with this &amp;#34;numbing cream&amp;#34;. I read the directions and did everything, but it just wasn&#x27;t that strong I guess. I would recommend trying to get a little more money for a stronger numbing cream, especially for piercings as painful as belly button piercings.</li>
            <li> this product really didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> I luv it but just wish it was a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> It worked 4 stars thank you!!!</li>
            <li> they really works! excelent product!</li>
            <li> World great for numbing but didn&#x27;t last as long on me the box says</li>
            <li> This numbing cream works GREAT!  Dang!  This stuff numbs your skin.  I needle my face and this cream numbs so well that I have to be careful not to press too hard with my needle roller because you don&#x27;t feel a thing once this cream takes effect.</li>
            <li> 10g deep numb cream!  Not just for tattoos!  It is the best if you hurt from one pimple, or acne in general.  I use it at night.  It is a numbing cream, soft and does not make you red if you have sensitive skin.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with tattoos or acne.</li>
            <li> Worked well. Deep Numb kept my skin numb long enough to use my 2mm dermaroller. I found that the product worked better if I used saran wrap to cover numbing product as it further activates the numbing properties of the lidocaine. I also used a hair dryer with medium heat to warm up the product every ten minutes while I waited for my skin to numb which takes about 1 hour and 10 minutes. I used the entire tube on my face, but I feel half a tube would work just as well. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> For areas of the body that somehow become so itchy that you can&#x27;t stand it or pain....for small isolated areas on the skin.  Don&#x27;t ingest it directly or get in the eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was having such painful intercourse. Once I got it in the mail I immediately tried it out. It numbed me within 20 min and lasted all night. At first there was a slight burning sensation but it was very bearable. This stuff really works</li>
            <li> Wonderful laser TriaðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> This product did not work on me whatsoever. I used it before I got my nosed pierced. I left it on for about an hour and a half prior to my piercing but it never numbed my skin. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Didnt work. I put a good amount on and left it there for 2hrs. I was touching up a tattoo on my ankle and and it still hurt just as much as the first. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This products really works perfect for micro needling facials. Definitely will be repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Good product. Worked great.</li>
            <li> This is as yood as any of the other products offered.  Tattoos hurt with or without the cream, Its to lesson the amount of pain experienced you have to endure in areas that hurt more than others.</li>
            <li> Did esactly what directions said and didn&#x27;t work at all. If I could rate less than one star I would. Dont get this item.</li>
