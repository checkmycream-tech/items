            <li>Remarkably, those areas seemed to heal (close the skin)</li>
            <li>Keeps his skin, as he says, nice and moisturized!</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Good to make soap with.</li>
            <li>Tamanu Oil has many uses and this is great.</li>
            <li>I love this oil!  </li>
            <li>the results are amazing</li>
            <li>One of my sisters who had surgery introduced me to the whole tamanu oil, saying that this is one of the best treatment out there for scar recovery.</li>
            <li>so I expect that it will come in quite handy over time.</li>
            <li>I have found it to be very healing and an excellent anti inflammatory.</li>
            <li>Fast ship and great oil!!!</li>
            <li>kinda slimy is the best way I can describe haha.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...</li>
            <li>for Tamanu itself, my hypersensitive skin tolerates it well, and I love the nutty smell of it.</li>
            <li>Look up the uses, there are many.  </li>
            <li>to nothing, is brown and does not smell as good and fresh.  </li>
            <li>plus, my skin comes out feeling softer and looking more refreshed with this</li>
            <li>course I apply an SPF moisturizer on top since this doesn&#x27;t contain any SPF, and living in Florida does make that a must.</li>
            <li>I need more time on this to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;6)</li>
            <li>I need more time on this to be sure.</li>
            <li>But WOW!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil is like magic in a bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>will update after more time has passed.</li>
            <li>Great oil really helps lighten the acne and carpal tunnel.</li>
            <li>as well I love the price and the results thank you</li>
            <li>I bought this item after reading some rave reviews about the healing benefits of this oil for many skin conditions, one of them being acne and acne scarring.  </li>
            <li>The best for any skin especially for those with eczema.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I received this item very quickly from this seller and the Tamanu Oil seems to work.  </li>
            <li>The ordor is a bit strong</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Tamanu does have a strong smell, so I recommend using it at nite.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes use a light application on my arms as well, and at 3 weeks in, I have almost used up this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I sometimes use a light application on my arms as well, and at 3 weeks in, I have almost used up this bottle.</li>
            <li>If I get a pimple, I can massage a bit of Tamanu oil on and by next day, it has diminished greatly.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It has a strong woody type aroma to it, but it goes away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Bought it to use as part of my daily oil routine and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Probably normal, but not the kind of oil</li>
            <li>Not as good as CAOH product, which costs more but is green, smells better, and pulls infection out into cotton.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at her speed of recovery and her scar had improved significantly after just 2 weeks applying this product.</li>
            <li>And on that note: I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant reduction in sunspots and aging since I started using this product weeks ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As postage to return will be a significant fraction of the cost, I guess this stuff goes to a landfill.</li>
            <li>soon as I can afford more, I am buying a large bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but so far, I&#x27;ve got to say that this oil is by far one of the best, mainly for its multi-use properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of this viscosity, one uses quite bit and a 2 ounce bottle can go rather quickly, depending on where all applied.</li>
            <li>Because of this viscosity, one uses quite bit and a 2 ounce bottle can go rather quickly, depending on where all applied.</li>
            <li>It does not soak in too quickly.  </li>
            <li>A mild nutty smell.</li>
            <li>As for the acne scaring, it is still noticeable, but maybe it will take more time for that to heal since I&#x27;ve had the acne scaring for many years, and have only been using this oil for 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s awesome that I can put some in a little portable travel bottle and take it with us on the road--- and even better, still double it up as a beauty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole oil scene, and just learning about the many that are out there.</li>
            <li>The oil is a thicker oil than most (popular) natural beauty oils, compared to emu, jojoba, argan, -has a similar viscosity to extra virgin Olive oil, and takes quite a while (about 1 hour) to be completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>Smells funny.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Tamanu oil by an oil cleansing method blog and started doing research.</li>
            <li>for the first time in a looong time ....</li>
            <li>We have already used it in many different ways ....</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I get</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>All SKIN now softer, nearly free of fungi, itching less, better looking toenails.</li>
            <li>For all reasons mentioned above, I will most certainly purchase again, and highly recommend it!</li>

            <li>/&gt;Another thing I really like about this oil in particular is that I can use it as a first aid remedy as well.</li>
            <li>I notice such a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>When I use it in washed hair it turns it into very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil has a distinct earthy scent: I liken it to a mixture of: cold-pressed, Extra-Virgin Olive oil, Patchouli, and anything else that is wild &amp; earthy-smelling, -though</li>

            <li>this really it?</li>
            <li>Well packaged and arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though, I think this product works really well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I really was expecting</li>
            <li>Tried this brand twice and it really burned my eyes.  </li>
            <li>To soft and moist!!!  </li>
            <li>product has become not only my favorite, but an absolute and essential oil for me.</li>
            <li>This product has become not only my favorite, but an absolute and essential oil for me.</li>
            <li>Mainly by trial and error-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been such a tremendous time saver-</li>
            <li>I do not notice a whole lot of improvement or change in the texture of my skin, likely because my skin is already very good from long-term usage with other oils, except I do think I seem to notice a slight fading of the brown spots on my face (3 weeks in).</li>

            <li>and I would highly recommend this oil to others.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>have spent so much money trying soooo many different oils and lotions!!  </li>
            <li>This oil has the same smell and texture as the bottle I bought at Whole Foods, but has a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what I can say about this brand of tamanu specifically as I&#x27;ve only ever used one other, but it appears to be a great quality oil.</li>
            <li>, I just read that it helps clear up</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any marked difference in 8 months of using...</li>
            <li>but the smell is like old wood.</li>
            <li>It works very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li>The very next day, my acne completely cleared up!  </li>
            <li>First and foremost, one should be very careful with applying it to areas around the eyes where it can travel (as skin warms) into the eyes.</li>
            <li>have only just started with it, but it is clear that it is working!!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I bought this a few weeks ago and began using it right away.</li>
            <li>Oily, dry, desert dry, cracked, old, young, acne, psoriasis, and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>It did nothing - good or bad.  </li>

            <li> Good to make soap with.</li>
            <li> Thick and oily.  Smells funny.  Probably normal, but not the kind of oil I&#x27;m looking for to make my skin blends.</li>
            <li> This oil has the same smell and texture as the bottle I bought at Whole Foods, but has a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Bought it to use as part of my daily oil routine and it is amazing! I added it to the oil combination I use as moisturizer for my face and also use it as spot treatment on blemishes and it begins clearing things up that same day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I think this is a farse and I regret buying it.  It did nothing - good or bad.  Don&#x27;t be a sucker for every gimmick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if this product is all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be......only time will tell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best oil to fade scars on the face. Applied and left overnight it works wonders over a period of time. Don&#x27;t expect results overnight. Give it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...Just wish it came in a larger amount!</li>
            <li> The ordor is a bit strong can overwhelm you if not used to such a smell especially if using colonge</li>
            <li> I have only used this a little so far. I have some places on my arms and hands and i hope it will help either lighten them or get rid of them. not sure if they are age marks or got them from the sun in the garden. We will see how it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I can say about this brand of tamanu specifically as I&#x27;ve only ever used one other, but it appears to be a great quality oil. I like that it&#x27;s organic, unrefined and cold-pressed -- just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a generous size for the price and dispenses well out of the push-top dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;As for Tamanu itself, my hypersensitive skin tolerates it well, and I love the nutty smell of it. I use it mixed with other oils for after-shower body conditioning, and, by itself for scars (altho I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any marked difference in 8 months of using... it&#x27;s certainly not hurting!)</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times now. This oil has a superb texture and fragrance. It works for some may skin problems I can&#x27;t imagine being with out it.</li>
            <li> Look up the uses, there are many.  Among others I use it for skin irritation and in my hair.  When I use it in washed hair it turns it into very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil on minor cuts, blemishes, and existing scars.</li>
            <li> Not as good as CAOH product, which costs more but is green, smells better, and pulls infection out into cotton.  This did&lt;br /&gt;next to nothing, is brown and does not smell as good and fresh.  What can I say, have ordered three bottles now of the other (CAOH) brand,&lt;br /&gt;and I recommend that brand, not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a month for scarring in various areas. So great! I notice such a huge difference in my skin. This oil works and I plan on making it a staple product forever.</li>
            <li> One of my sisters who had surgery introduced me to the whole tamanu oil, saying that this is one of the best treatment out there for scar recovery. I was amazed at her speed of recovery and her scar had improved significantly after just 2 weeks applying this product. I&#x27;m new to the whole oil scene, and just learning about the many that are out there. Mainly by trial and error- but so far, I&#x27;ve got to say that this oil is by far one of the best, mainly for its multi-use properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, my beauty regimen has mainly consisted of applying something for acne, then another product for scars, then another for correcting dark spots, then another for firming and/or anti-aging properties, then another (usually an oil) for soft, supple skin and finally my moisturizer. Of course, each applicant requires time to absorb into the skin, and it seems to take forever! BUT--- with this Tamanu oil, that&#x27;s it!! All in one shot, I get each of the benefits in this one bottle as I do with almost a dozen others. It&#x27;s been such a tremendous time saver- plus, my skin comes out feeling softer and looking more refreshed with this alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I apply an SPF moisturizer on top since this doesn&#x27;t contain any SPF, and living in Florida does make that a must. And on that note: I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant reduction in sunspots and aging since I started using this product weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I really like about this oil in particular is that I can use it as a first aid remedy as well. I&#x27;ve got kids- boys, at that- so I expect that it will come in quite handy over time. Considering that diluting it is said not to affect the effectiveness of its healing properties- I think it&#x27;s awesome that I can put some in a little portable travel bottle and take it with us on the road--- and even better, still double it up as a beauty agent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some other the remarkable characteristics I noted:&lt;br /&gt;1) First and foremost, one should be very careful with applying it to areas around the eyes where it can travel (as skin warms) into the eyes. BURNS. It also has a somewhat caustic taste as well.&lt;br /&gt;2) The oil is a thicker oil than most (popular) natural beauty oils, compared to emu, jojoba, argan, -has a similar viscosity to extra virgin Olive oil, and takes quite a while (about 1 hour) to be completely absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;3) Because of this viscosity, one uses quite bit and a 2 ounce bottle can go rather quickly, depending on where all applied. I sometimes use a light application on my arms as well, and at 3 weeks in, I have almost used up this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;4) Tamanu oil has a distinct earthy scent: I liken it to a mixture of: cold-pressed, Extra-Virgin Olive oil, Patchouli, and anything else that is wild &amp; earthy-smelling, -though this blend isn’t unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;5) I do not notice a whole lot of improvement or change in the texture of my skin, likely because my skin is already very good from long-term usage with other oils, except I do think I seem to notice a slight fading of the brown spots on my face (3 weeks in). I need more time on this to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;6) I read that this oil can promote the growth of new skin, so I applied it to a fresh laceration on my leg, and also a fresh painful raw, torn hangnail. Remarkably, those areas seemed to heal (close the skin) overnight with 1 application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has become not only my favorite, but an absolute and essential oil for me. For all reasons mentioned above, I will most certainly purchase again, and highly recommend it!where it can travel (as skin warms) into the eyes. BURNS.

            <li> works well on my psoriasis</li>
            <li> I like it used it on my hair only tiny amount needed to tame frizz but the smell is like old wood. I didn&#x27;t like the small at all but it didn&#x27;t last long. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin yet.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Tamanu oil by an oil cleansing method blog and started doing research. This product satisfies at an excellent price. I have found it to be very healing and an excellent anti inflammatory. If I get a pimple, I can massage a bit of Tamanu oil on and by next day, it has diminished greatly. I will never go back to harsh acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  A little bit of this oil goes a long way and it does not have a greasy feel to it.  It also has a pleasant smell.  I used this on an eczema spot and could see results in a couple of days.  I also use a drop of this in my face moisturizer each day.  This is an oil I will continue to use and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Cleared up psoriasis well</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle of oil .... So this may be premature ..... But WOW!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil is like magic in a bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;In our family of 9, we have several different skin types and &amp;#34;issues.&amp;#34; Oily, dry, desert dry, cracked, old, young, acne, psoriasis, and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;We have spent so much money trying soooo many different oils and lotions!!  and we are always looking for something new for my poor 8 year old, who has the worst skin!  I am so tired of slathering her in cortisone!!!&lt;br /&gt;But for the first time in a looong time .... Her skin felt AMAZING after just one application!!!!!!! Wooo hoooo Only those with horrible skin can understand the joy in that.  Her skin when from hard and dry .... Like sandpaper .... To soft and moist!!!  IN ONE APPLICATION!! I&#x27;m just amazed.&lt;br /&gt;My baby girl not being itchy for once in her life is HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;Is this really it? Finally after all this time?!?!&lt;br /&gt;We have only just started with it, but it is clear that it is working!!&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a loooong way so you can put a few drops in lotions or can use a carrier oil. We have already used it in many different ways .... Depending on the person. I used it straight on the really bad spots.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel it on the surface of your skin.  It does not soak in too quickly.  It has a strong woody type aroma to it, but it goes away fairly quickly.  It seems to me that one or two applications a day is enough for daily maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I can afford more, I am buying a large bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I will update after more time has passed. Im trying it on all the different skin problems we have in the house .... To include my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Great oil really helps lighten the acne and carpal tunnel.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and began using it right away. It works very well on dry skin. I will definitely buy more when I get l;ow.</li>
            <li> So far so good. A mild nutty smell. Deep green color may be offputting, but it doesn&#x27;t stain your skin.</li>
            <li> Tamanu Oil has many uses and this is great.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell.  It took a bit of time to get used to.  I use it on my face and it is really wonderful.</li>
            <li> Well packaged and arrived in a very timely manner. I have been using this product for almost a year on several toes with toe nail fungus. I have had the oral medications, prescription fungicide creams and laser treatments several times with little or no effect. After using this for almost a year, results have shown a dramatic improvement. I am a registered nurse and would not recommend any &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; treatment that I had not personally verified. I will continue to use this product as improvement is continuing.</li>
            <li> This oil has healed my acne and reduced the scars on my face even when im not using it the results are amazing I find this is a great base for makeup in the winter since I m not as oily however this goes in to my skin wonderfully and the fact that it is USDA Certified is Amazing as well I love the price and the results thank you</li>
            <li> I received this item very quickly from this seller and the Tamanu Oil seems to work.  I bought this item after reading some rave reviews about the healing benefits of this oil for many skin conditions, one of them being acne and acne scarring.  Since I have acne prone skin and acne scaring on my face,  I thought I would give this oil a try.  Although I have already tried almost every acne and scar curing product on the market which offered minimal to no results,  I decided to give this product a try.  Before having applied the Tamanu oil on my face, I had ordered another online acne product which I had been using for a couple of days and which caused my entire face to break out in acne!.  I was horrified and I immediately stopped using that other acne product.  Since I had the Tamanu oil, I applied it to my face to see if it would help with the acne.  Wow!, was I surprised!!!  The very next day, my acne completely cleared up!  I have since been using the Tamanu oil  twice a day for 4 weeks, and I have noticed a vast improvement since having used it.  What a relief!!!  My skin has since cleared up and it looks and feels smoother.  As for the acne scaring, it is still noticeable, but maybe it will take more time for that to heal since I&#x27;ve had the acne scaring for many years, and have only been using this oil for 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I think this product works really well and I would highly recommend this oil to others.</li>
            <li> Fast ship and great oil!!!</li>
            <li> The best for any skin especially for those with eczema. I buy unrefined organic shea butter and mix the 2 together for my grandson&#x27;s eczema. Keeps his skin, as he says, nice and moisturized! I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Happy with this oil! Really like it!</li>
            <li> this is great skin lotion</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  So great for the skin [Research it!!]  Company is great!! Tamanu does have a strong smell, so I recommend using it at nite.  I actually like mixing it with a little coconut oil, and lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I ordered this so I can mix it with some almond and evening primrose oil. I don&#x27;t know what I really was expecting, I just read that it helps clear up acne.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s green and kinda slimy is the best way I can describe haha. It doesn&#x27;t seem to smell bad, so I can tolerate it well. We shall see how it helps over time.</li>
            <li> I have used Tamanu oil before to remove eye makeup.  Tried this brand twice and it really burned my eyes.  I don&#x27;t know what caustic ingredient is in this &amp;#34;100% refined&amp;#34; oil but don&#x27;t think I would use on any part of my body.  If it&#x27;s caustic enough to irritate my eyes and continues to burn after washing eyes with contact lens fluid, something is really wrong.&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted the supplier I was told that their product was the highest purity but that I could return.  They then denied my return request through Amazon.  When reminded of their initial email, I received a return address to send package to.  As postage to return will be a significant fraction of the cost, I guess this stuff goes to a landfill.</li>
            <li> Purchased 4 weeks ago, received quickly, constant use showing tangible results for ped-impediments like fungi and dry skin problems.  All SKIN now softer, nearly free of fungi, itching less, better looking toenails.</li>
