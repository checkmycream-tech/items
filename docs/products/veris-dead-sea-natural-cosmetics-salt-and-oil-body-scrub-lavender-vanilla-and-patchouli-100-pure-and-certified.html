            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin, and the smell is pleasant, not too strong, and not too weak.</li>
            <li>That said, it is a lovely product leaving the skin very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering some more!</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and makes showers invigorating.</li>
            <li>This product works wanders on your skin soft for days price is grate no lotion needed love this stuff</li>
            <li>Took a while to get here, but it is imported so understandable...but totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Have to be care full, for makes the tub very slippery</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth, soft, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>but l9ike it so well that I am willing to deal with the oil.</li>
            <li>I used this last night for the first time and thought about ordering five more as soon as I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>The oils also make your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>You will feel like pure velvet</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it several times each week</li>
            <li>I got the product really fast, I noticed that it&#x27;s a LOT darker in color</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and this helps to exfoliate the scales making my skin perfectly ready for treatment.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t smell any lavender in it and there was way too much oil, in comparison to salt.</li>
            <li>I have used the facial salts for 2 days now and it makes my facial skin feel clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The smell of essential oils are relaxing &amp; your skin is smooth &amp; soft after you scrub them with a gentle moisturizing product.</li>
            <li>I had to use it as soon as it came because it smelled so good, even though I had just showered a few hours earlier!</li>

            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Made a nice gift for someone who is hard to shop for.</li>
            <li>I look forward to updating this review after a few more uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bit too oily for me, as I have to be careful getting out of the tub and making sure the tub is not oily for the next person.</li>
            <li>I have tried many salt &amp; sugar scrubs that are rough and dry your skin out, but you will be amazed how this scrub hydrates your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Gail</li>
            <li>Actually, I would give this 5 stars except the packaging could be a little better.  </li>
            <li>This will soften dry skin up quickly, but be sure to give the shower an extra rinse after using because the oil makes everything it touches slick.</li>
            <li>It makes skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s natural even if it requires some attention to apply.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and glowing :-0</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and moisturized when I step out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>This product does not smell natural.</li>
            <li>and you need to scrub down your tub right away.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Salt &amp; Oil Body Scrub (Lavender, Vanilla, Patchouli) for the last week and my skin has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li>but so far it has not mixed well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like I get too much oil and that by the time I get to the bottom of the jar there may only be salt left and not enough oil.</li>
            <li>Also, be careful when using it in the shower because it makes the tile very slippery.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s only a problem the 1st few times when the container is really full;  </li>
            <li>I use this product along with their Dead Sea Mud Mask, and I&#x27;ll stay loyal to both as long as they make/distribute.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> have a feeling this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a minor problem though</li>
            <li> My hands, especially, are always rough in the cooler months and the salt scrub gets rid of the roughness, however, it needs to be used daily for results.  </li>
            <li> but the salt is kinda rough or gross for skin !</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly and the smell lingers long after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very slippery and would be hard to use in shower for me due to the container</li>
            <li> Do be careful after shower or bathing--as tub and/or shower will be slippery.  </li>
            <li> My husband had very rough elbows</li>
            <li> Think lavender with a little warmth.</li>
            <li> I like to use this scrub on my feet a few times per week.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit messy to use.</li>
            <li> so I am going to transfer some into a small container to take into shower with</li>
            <li> I have used the body scrub in the past.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, and perhaps its impossible to do anything about it, is that the oil and salt separate making it a bit harder to use.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that I shared it one time with my house hold</li>
            <li> Basically the worst smelling product I have bought so far.</li>
            <li> I hate the container.</li>
            <li> and it makes the base of the shower slippery</li>
            <li> that horrible perfume smell lasted all day and gave me a head ache.</li>

            <li> Originally I was purchasing this for myself but I don&#x27;t like the combination of scents-lavendar, vanilla, and patchouli. I gave it to one of my nieces and she likes it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Salt &amp; Oil Body Scrub (Lavender, Vanilla, Patchouli) for the last week and my skin has never felt so soft! The scent is fabulous and the amount you get for the price is well worth it! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I could not stand the smell of this scrub. It didn&#x27;t smell like any of the things listed. It literally made me gag.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth, fragrances my bath and me! I really enjoy using it several times each week</li>
            <li> This product arrived really quickly.  It is darker than the picture shows.  It is a deep purple color.&lt;br /&gt;The smell to me is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The oil separates from the salt and I have been stirring it and putting in the fridge but so far it has not mixed well.&lt;br /&gt;It is very slippery and would be hard to use in shower for me due to the container so I am going to transfer some into a small container to take into shower with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling this will last a long time.  I look forward to updating this review after a few more uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I have since learned not to try and mix it.  As you use it it starts to settle nicely.  It appears there is too much oil on the top when you get it but you will find it is not too much once you use.&lt;br /&gt;THis stuff in wonderful. It makes skin so soft.  I use a lot of oils but none have the same effect on skin this one has.  You will feel like pure velvet</li>
            <li> Great price for a great scrub - Exactly what I wanted for a very reasonable price.  Keeps skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with their Dead Sea Mud Mask, and I&#x27;ll stay loyal to both as long as they make/distribute.  I love it.  What grabbed my attention was the combination of my favorite fragrances, then the quality of the scrub and the way my skin felt was phenomenal.  Others have commented about the separation of oil/salt and yes, you need to stir it each time.  But it&#x27;s only a problem the 1st few times when the container is really full;  I like that it&#x27;s natural even if it requires some attention to apply.  And it does leave a slippery coat on the bottom of the shower tile, like any good quality oil will do.  This is the best scrub I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s affordable.  No brainer.</li>
            <li> I like to use this scrub on my feet a few times per week. It moisturizes and exfoliates my skin simultaneously. This will soften dry skin up quickly, but be sure to give the shower an extra rinse after using because the oil makes everything it touches slick. I ordered the lavender fragrance and it is ok. Think lavender with a little warmth.</li>
            <li> Actually, I would give this 5 stars except the packaging could be a little better.  The oil leaks out leaving a purple ring underneath the container.  That said, it is a lovely product leaving the skin very soft and moisturized.  Stir to blend the oil and salt, don&#x27;t shake.  The blend of essentials oils is refreshing.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I got the product really fast, I noticed that it&#x27;s a LOT darker in color then the picture shows. I love the way it feels on my skin, and the smell is pleasant, not too strong, and not too weak. The only downside is that no matter how well i shake it/mix it there&#x27;s always a ton of liquid on top of the salt, so it&#x27;s a bit messy to use. I have psoriasis and this helps to exfoliate the scales making my skin perfectly ready for treatment. I love this product and I will surely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> The scent of this scrub is wonderful! I had to use it as soon as it came because it smelled so good, even though I had just showered a few hours earlier! My only complaint, and perhaps its impossible to do anything about it, is that the oil and salt separate making it a bit harder to use.  Even though I tried shaking it up really good it immediately separates. I feel like I get too much oil and that by the time I get to the bottom of the jar there may only be salt left and not enough oil. It&#x27;s only a minor problem though and I would definitely buy it again for the scent if nothing else. Also, be careful when using it in the shower because it makes the tile very slippery.</li>
            <li> A bit too oily for me, as I have to be careful getting out of the tub and making sure the tub is not oily for the next person. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! I was worried that the patchouli would be too strong, but it&#x27;s not too noticeable. It doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a hippy. I hate the container. The top is difficult to remove and it&#x27;s always leaking.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the purple dye. The packaging looks purple online but I didn&#x27;t expect the contents, along with my skin and tub to turn purple.</li>
            <li> Very good price for certified Dead Sea product.  Made a nice gift for someone who is hard to shop for.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My skin breaks out on my back and this has cleared it up ,even though it contains oil. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth, soft, and refreshed. Very, very pleased! Fragrance is light, pleasant and never overpowers.&lt;br /&gt;Intend to repurchase frequently.</li>
            <li> This product is just nummy and delicious all around. It smells fresh and makes showers invigorating. Its a wonderful gentle and effective exfoliator. The oils also make your skin super soft. I would love to use this product for life.</li>
            <li> Thought product was just scented with lavender, but it is a bath oil with bath salts. Have to be care full, for makes the tub very slippery and you need to scrub down your tub right away.</li>
            <li> I have been in the beauty business for 40 years &amp; have tested a lot of products, I highly recommend this amazing product. The smell of essential oils are relaxing &amp; your skin is smooth &amp; soft after you scrub them with a gentle moisturizing product. I have tried many salt &amp; sugar scrubs that are rough and dry your skin out, but you will be amazed how this scrub hydrates your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Gail E.</li>
            <li> very, very effective - accomplishes everything you want from a salt scrub (great exfoliating, soft/smooth skin and very pleasant fragrance)</li>
            <li> The product arrived with most of the oil leaked out al over the package.</li>
            <li> The best scrub I have ever used in my life. This scrub is amazing from the time it hits your skin it&#x27;s like and instant spa treatment for skin. It&#x27;s very luxurious smells great and sells on amazon for a really good price. I will continue to buy religiously</li>
            <li> Smells nice, leaves skin soft. . . . . If you use it in the shower becareful it is oily</li>
            <li> Very nice smell but the salt is kinda rough or gross for skin !</li>
            <li> This product is the true spa experience. It makes my skin feel soft and I look forward to using it each and every time.</li>
            <li> This product works wanders on your skin soft for days price is grate no lotion needed love this stuff</li>
            <li> Amazing price and awesome product! Took a while to get here, but it is imported so understandable...but totally worth the wait. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have used the facial salts for 2 days now and it makes my facial skin feel clean and smooth.  I have used the body scrub in the past. My hands, especially, are always rough in the cooler months and the salt scrub gets rid of the roughness, however, it needs to be used daily for results.  I would recommend these products to anyone who needs skin smoothing.</li>
            <li> Awesome scrub, leaves skin sooo smooth. Only thing is it is very slippery and oily, but if used in the shower it works great!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It always leaks in the shipping but l9ike it so well that I am willing to deal with the oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  The only bad thing is that I shared it one time with my house hold and now they are using it up!  My husband had very rough elbows now they are smooth.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling great!  I will definitely be ordering some more!</li>
            <li> I love this product smells really good and the salt in the products really make my skin soft and smooth. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great body scrub :-0  Just wish the Patchouli fragrance came through a touch stronger--other than that this scrub is a great exfoliater (SP) and skin moisturizer.  Do be careful after shower or bathing--as tub and/or shower will be slippery.  Leaves skin soft and glowing :-0</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied!  Love the way it smells and how it makes your skin feel. Only negatives--it should come with a spoon and it makes the base of the shower slippery</li>
            <li> I have tried many salt and body oil scrubs after my husband bought me a gift set many years ago.  Veris Dead Sea Naturals is absolutely the BEST EVER.  The oil and salt combination are proportioned perfectly.  My skin is soft and moisturized when I step out of the shower.  The scent of this particular scrub is exquisite.  All of the scents blend beautifully together.  I have recommended this to my friends and family and will use it exclusively.  Thank you for this Salt &amp; Oil Body Scrub.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for this type of product.  Don&#x27;t look any further!</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot even put into words how great this smells. I used this last night for the first time and thought about ordering five more as soon as I got out of the shower. I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave reviews often, but I love this stuff. It smells heavenly and the smell lingers long after use.</li>
            <li> As a scrub freak I expected a considerable more from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be as satiated as you would think after reading the product description.</li>
            <li> I ordered the French perfume! Basically the worst smelling product I have bought so far. I was so excited to use it so I used it on my hands that horrible perfume smell lasted all day and gave me a head ache. I would not recommend this product. However I wish I ordered the unscented one.</li>
            <li> would like to buy this again, love the scent. Item as described. leaves skin silky smooth. Very enjoyable product and arrived in great condition</li>
            <li> This product does not smell natural. I didn&#x27;t smell any lavender in it and there was way too much oil, in comparison to salt. I will not buy it again.</li>
