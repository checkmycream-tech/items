            <li>Love this hand cream, and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and the fragrance</li>
            <li>Smells lovely but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a scent I can&#x27;t stand, none of their scents are too strong and overpowering like so many creams.</li>
            <li>I bought three items that I knew she would enjoy and use.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells really good plus it also makes your hands really soft.  </li>
            <li>First found this while on a vacation and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the best lavender lotion I have tried, ever.</li>
            <li>I love this particular scent too.  </li>
            <li>The perfuming agent leaves a lovely soft scent.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Thymes makes extremely good products, check out their other scents too.</li>
            <li>Very dependable.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much this is the 5th tube I have ordered.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love this hand cream for how soft it makes your skin, but I swear I&#x27;ve never had longer, stronger nails than when I used this lotion.</li>
            <li>This has a great consistency and a small dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but Thymes smells rich and doesn&#x27;t irritate your nose and the fragrence stays for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Nice medium thick handcream.  </li>
            <li>Like this cream better than their body lotion, which I only found to be average.</li>
            <li>I put it on my hands a few times a day and just breath deep and smile!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several tubes of this product. Smells lovely but not too strong. Not sticky. Absorbs well.Will order again. Try it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is so smooth and silky and the fragrance is so beautiful and calming. I put it on my hands a few times a day and just breath deep and smile!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This has a great consistency and a small dab goes a long way. The perfuming agent leaves a lovely soft scent. I like to use it after washing my hands all year round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three of the Thymes hand creams...Lavender, Jasmine and Clary Sage. This is by far my favorite. the next would be Jasmine. I did not care for the latter.</li>
            <li> nice aroma. very happy with it.</li>
            <li> First found this while on a vacation and fell in love with it. Can&#x27;t find it locally, so I get it here. Like this cream better than their body lotion, which I only found to be average. Plus, they are way above average in the way they scent their products. I haven&#x27;t found a scent I can&#x27;t stand, none of their scents are too strong and overpowering like so many creams. This is my favorite scent, though.</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream, and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the fragrance</li>
            <li> love it, love it, use it every night before bed -- smells so good and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Whoever makes this needs to find out what lavender smells like. I was going to give this as a gift, took a whiff and immediately went to buy L&#x27;Occtaine.</li>
            <li> I use Thymes hand cream, lavender scent, all the time.  Love the fragrance and find that it is good for my cuticles also.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This was part of a gift for my sister who has just moved into an assisted living apartment.  I bought three items that I knew she would enjoy and use.  She is 87.</li>
            <li> Love the smell  and great cream</li>
            <li> Not only do I love this hand cream for how soft it makes your skin, but I swear I&#x27;ve never had longer, stronger nails than when I used this lotion.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of lavender products out there but Thymes smells rich and doesn&#x27;t irritate your nose and the fragrence stays for a long time.  I like the Thymes other stuff too.</li>
            <li> Have been using thymes products for years.  Very dependable.  Nice medium thick handcream.  Absorbs well.  Wonderful fragrance.  Arrived on time and packaged well from seller.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream ever!  I love this particular scent too.  I have extremely dry skin and this works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, the best lavender lotion I have tried, ever. Not greasy, Intoxicating smell. Worth every penny. Treat yourself or give as a gift. Thymes makes extremely good products, check out their other scents too.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really good plus it also makes your hands really soft.  It&#x27;s the best hand lotion I have used in years.  It might seem a little expensive but then you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for purchase.  I like it so much this is the 5th tube I have ordered.</li>
