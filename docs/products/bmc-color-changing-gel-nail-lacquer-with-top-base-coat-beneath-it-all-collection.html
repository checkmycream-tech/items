            <li> This stuff does work better then expected for the price.  Application is easy,  cure time is normal.  Only complaints I have is the largest size glitter (which there isn&#x27;t much of)  makes bumps in the polish that are probably only noticeable to me and the removal is not easy (30 min soak time)  that being said it&#x27;s awesome for what it is.  The cheapest gel polish out there.  Shipping was lightning fast as well.  It&#x27;s good enough that I will definitely buy more and will most likely order  other things from bundle monster again.</li>
            <li> Have used it multiple times, good quality, top coat a bit stinky. Overall very good bundle!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors I love it !!!!</li>
            <li> Really good quality and the color change is fun.</li>
            <li> I really like this product; however, was a little disappointed that I received two top coats and no base coat. I&#x27;m hoping that when I get a base coat, this will work great. I love the color and the way it changes with temperature.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I have tried countless gel polishes and this one works great! I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This stuff IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;They should not even sell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;And I am being very very honest...</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!! SO FUN! and really changes colors!!! Better than opi gel.</li>
            <li> its okay.  I didn&#x27;t like how thick the color was but loved the top and base coat.  I also am not a big fan of glitter and this has a lot of big glitter flakes as i thought they would be very small to give it a shimmery effect.</li>
            <li> Goes on thin (Like it is supposed to) The color is vibrant and changes easily. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Love this color changing polish! And so did everyone who saw it!</li>
            <li> Bon produit je l&#x27;aime beaucoup</li>
            <li> color is beautiful but odor from them are horrendous. I just imagine it going into my nail bed as it takes a while to dry and have to use heat lamp with the gel polish.</li>
            <li> I love these very much!!</li>
            <li> I absolute love this!!! It is so beautiful.</li>
            <li> Great colors works great</li>
            <li> Pretty cool but a lot of work. The polish peels off after a week.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks when my nails change and all but it didn&#x27;t stay on well. The manicure takes me a good 45 minutes and only lasts a week. Gelish is the way to go for home manicures.</li>
            <li> Love the color of this but the temperature change part is not a nice look. I never had it turn ombr√© as in the picture, only patchy &amp; splotchy dark pink on the white very random &amp; ugly looking. I do love their other, regular color, sets though, just not this thermal change one.</li>
