            <li>THE BEST opi!!!!!</li>
            <li>O.P.I did a great job on this color though.</li>
            <li>I paid the best price for it right here!</li>
            <li>I take that as a good thing, it won&#x27;t come off easily!</li>
            <li>This is very catching when you put it on shinny and very full of color</li>
            <li>Glitter polishes have a tendency to kind of eat the shine of top coat!</li>
            <li>it stays on looks amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing glittery opaque polish.</li>
            <li>I ended up loving it, have it on now.</li>
            <li>some more opi did good with this . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>I own the Nicole by OPI \\&quot;follow me</li>
            <li>Liked it üëç</li>
            <li>I love the sparkles, goes on well.  </li>
            <li>I love Nicki and this color</li>
            <li>Buy it, you wont regret! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>This color is perfect in every way possible!</li>
            <li>love this nail polish gotta buy</li>
            <li>I love the nail polish and so does everyone around me.</li>
            <li>I like the silver glitter better than the multi colored glitter :)</li>
            <li>and I love it a lot.  </li>
            <li>I love the glitter affect for my toes in the summer.  </li>
            <li>VERY cool nail polish color,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible because I like the look it gives after a few coats, but it is not the best formula.</li>
            <li>This is fine for a night out</li>
            <li>is SUPER TOO!</li>
            <li>Accurate to the description.</li>
            <li>It has a great visual effect but the staying power isn&#x27;t what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>good color but hard to take over, very nice shade lasts very very long.so</li>
            <li>I received this right away and in tact!</li>
            <li>and it still wasn&#x27;t good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Well instead of being sent metallic 4 life full bottle I was sent the mini bottles collection that said \\&quot;metallic 4 life on the box\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I really like if it stayed on more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li>i recomend this one not bad</li>
            <li>I will say it did look very pretty for those couple of days.</li>
            <li>but then you need two, maybe 3 coats, looks good when done and stays on for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to enjoy it just as much if you give it a try.</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest putting black polish on first so that you get the best effect from this polish.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color I like to use it as an accent color</li>
            <li>but it is exactly what I wanted for my daughter.</li>
            <li>First of all it took 4 coats for it to really show</li>
            <li>so you might want to put one coat of black under two coats of Metallic For Life, this will make it so that it looks darker without wasting any drops of this amazing polish.</li>
            <li>It really does shine and the black and silver glitter look amazing together.  </li>
            <li>I am usually very happy with OPI products however this polish was highly disappointing.</li>
            <li>It takes a few coats to get a nice opacity.</li>
            <li>black and silver are my favorite</li>
            <li>It is better than the Manic Panic black and silver.</li>
            <li>I bought this polish because I love anything black and silver and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This product is decent.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I would buy it if it was a normal product</li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is because I wear flats to work all of the time but the polish started chipping off in decent size pieces after only two days of having this polish on my toes.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t even mind having to do extra coats of a polish</li>
            <li>Just know you need to put at least two coats of clear on it to make it smooth and to make it shine.  </li>
            <li>So far it has lasted a week which is long for a glitter polish.</li>
            <li>but I had to get two bottles because the first one dried out after one use \\&quot;strange\\&quot;</li>

            <li> Black is the new black.</li>
            <li> This is a semi clear black polish with black and silver glitter in it.  </li>
            <li> actually darker black,</li>
            <li> Package came before due date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sparkly black, and now I&#x27;ve found one.</li>
            <li> waste your money to buy it.</li>

            <li> It is a little hard to remove as is any polish with glitter.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a black polish underneath as this is rather thin and not as black as the bottle makes it seem.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I put a base coat on and then had to put three coats of this polish for it to look opaque</li>

            <li> I did have a hard time keeping it on my nails.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sparkly black, and now I&#x27;ve found one. I love the color and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> THE BEST opi!!!!! two coats and its all glitter! it stays on looks amazing i will deff be rebuying this!</li>
            <li> I was actually not going to use this polish at the salon because it is &#x27;endorsed&#x27; by Nicki Minaj. I don&#x27;t &#x27;do&#x27; celebrity products but black and silver are my favorite so I had to try it. I ended up loving it, have it on now. It is better than the Manic Panic black and silver. So far it has lasted a week which is long for a glitter polish. I would buy it if it was a normal product but I just can&#x27;t support this chick, don&#x27;t like her and don&#x27;t like her music. O.P.I did a great job on this color though.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish because I love anything black and silver and shiny.  The first time I tried it, I put a base coat on and then had to put three coats of this polish for it to look opaque and it still wasn&#x27;t good enough for me.  After the fourth coat, I finally got the desired shaded that I had hoped for.  It really does shine and the black and silver glitter look amazing together.  I would definitely suggest putting black polish on first so that you get the best effect from this polish.  I did have a hard time keeping it on my nails.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because I wear flats to work all of the time but the polish started chipping off in decent size pieces after only two days of having this polish on my toes.  It has a great visual effect but the staying power isn&#x27;t what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> VERY cool nail polish color, actually darker black, but then you need two, maybe 3 coats, looks good when done and stays on for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it is time to take it off, it really wasn&#x27;t even that difficult with all of the glitter in it!</li>
            <li> I love the sparkles, goes on well.  It is a B* to remove off your nails, but all sparkles are.  I take that as a good thing, it won&#x27;t come off easily!</li>
            <li> I love Nicki and this color is SUPER TOO! its kinda thin on the black though so you might want to put one coat of black under two coats of Metallic For Life, this will make it so that it looks darker without wasting any drops of this amazing polish. Buy it, you wont regret! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> good color but hard to take over, very nice shade lasts very very long.so i recomend this one not bad</li>
            <li> I just got this nail polish today. It looks like a  fake nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Such awful quality at a ridiculous price.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money to buy it.</li>
            <li> Pretty color I like to use it as an accent color but I had to get two bottles because the first one dried out after one use \\&quot;strange\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is very catching when you put it on shinny and very full of color I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> Black is the new black. This polish goes with everything. I wear it all the time. It is a little hard to remove as is any polish with glitter. Just have some patience. Only regret is I didn&#x27;t buy two.</li>
            <li> Amazing glittery opaque polish. Its a must have!</li>
            <li> Well instead of being sent metallic 4 life full bottle I was sent the mini bottles collection that said \\&quot;metallic 4 life on the box\\&quot; but however inside the collection it was \\&quot;save me\\&quot; instead of metallic 4 life. This order was wrong 2x</li>
            <li> This color is perfect in every way possible! I wear it all the time an I paid the best price for it right here!</li>
            <li> love this nail polish gotta buy some more opi did good with this . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish and so does everyone around me. I recieve compliments everywhere I go. I own the Nicole by OPI \\&quot;follow me glitter\\&quot;(Kardashian Kollection)but I perfer this one. I like the silver glitter better than the multi colored glitter :)</li>
            <li> I am usually very happy with OPI products however this polish was highly disappointing. First of all it took 4 coats for it to really show and it began to chip off within a couple of days. I will say it did look very pretty for those couple of days. I would suggest using a black polish underneath as this is rather thin and not as black as the bottle makes it seem. I normally don&#x27;t even mind having to do extra coats of a polish I really like if it stayed on more than a couple of days. This is fine for a night out and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Package came before due date. Accurate to the description. Brand new. Liked it üëç</li>
            <li> This product is decent. It takes a few coats to get a nice opacity. However, it didn&#x27;t last long. My other OPI polishes last about a week before they start chipping, however, this lasted 3 days. It&#x27;s not horrible because I like the look it gives after a few coats, but it is not the best formula.</li>
            <li> This is a semi clear black polish with black and silver glitter in it.  I have put it on my toes and I love it a lot.  I have yet to put it on my hands but will next time I get them done.  Just know you need to put at least two coats of clear on it to make it smooth and to make it shine.  Glitter polishes have a tendency to kind of eat the shine of top coat!</li>
            <li> I love the glitter affect for my toes in the summer.  You&#x27;re going to enjoy it just as much if you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I received this right away and in tact! Have not used yet but it is exactly what I wanted for my daughter.</li>
