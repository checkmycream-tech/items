            <li>EXCELLENT, Barbershop DIY!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the ideal setup for clippers.</li>
            <li>I am one happy camper with this product.</li>
            <li>I want to proudly say, this set has lasted me 3 years and counting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for hair-cuts and styling, but it has been a great product to me ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>..looks great.</li>
            <li>The case that is included is very nice.</li>
            <li>Took a bit of oil for the blades to work good.</li>
            <li>All of the attachments can help a skilled haircutter produce a great haircut.</li>
            <li>You do have to keep a nice even pace.</li>
            <li>The comb worked fine, and the clips worked good like they should.</li>
            <li>True, they work good, but they broke after maybe 12 hours of use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works well, I did nice haircut to my husband.</li>
            <li>The clippers are a shiny chrome and the on-off switch is on the side not the top.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an adjusting lever on the side that adjusts the top blade&#x27;s depth, push it forward and the top cutters move forward.</li>
            <li>The top cutter seemed to detach from the rest of the cutter head and was flopping around.</li>
            <li>As the motor spins, the shaft moves the top cutter side to side.</li>
            <li>A torsion spring acts to return the cutters and provide some stability to the top cutter.</li>
            <li>I should have paid a bit more for some better clippers...</li>
            <li>I just saw that I&#x27;m still able to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ususally my mom is the person who cut her hair, my mom love this haircut kit.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I liked that feature quite a bit, and the lever was pretty sturdy and held their position.  </li>
            <li>Most products that are made in china now a-days does not affect the quality of the product, however that does not hold true for this item.</li>
            <li>They cut just fine</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I think I got my money&#x27;s worth for these clippers &amp; they will cut  more efficiently if you know how to use them.</li>
            <li>: I recently used it on my brother who has finer and thinner hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have a few of the larger numbered combs, and the scissors aren&#x27;t all that great, but it all fits inside the case nicely and the razor works well, all in all</li>
            <li>The brush is pitiful and only good for cleaning the hair residue out of the cutter head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The guides snapped onto the clippers just fine and stayed on pretty securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does seem to heat up rather quickly.</li>
            <li>this recommendation is that the product I received filled the expectations of the order, good performance and quality in comparison with others of the same species and very durable</li>
            <li>the Vidal was around $45 many years ago, I had lost all but two of the combs and needed a new machine...</li>
            <li>They are a good quality and work on both my human and canine animals thanks</li>
            <li>I will be using it for light personal use, anything more than that</li>
            <li>You could tell they&#x27;re cheap, made from cheap steel, not very sharp, and marginally cut hair.</li>
            <li>Good clippers have an electromagnetic reciprocating system that&#x27;s much more reliable and provides a more positive cutting motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this haircutter, doesnt have enough power to cut hair, after 3 haircuts, i was irritaded that this didnt cut anymore, very cheap.</li>
            <li>thick hair great</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of getting my haircuts at home, and at this price, it only take a couple of haircuts to recoup the investment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to use it 3x&#x27;s and already lost its sharpness.</li>
            <li>It did pull my husbands hair the first time I used it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first haircut machine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically unfixable unless you buy the whole spring assembly, which might cost more than the entire trimmer kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The motor inside doesn&#x27;t spin too terribly fast so the cutter head doesn&#x27;t go very fast.</li>
            <li>but,after you oil the blades,&amp; adjust the power level you have to go ahead &amp; cut your hair with some speed because these clippers get hot fast no matter how you adjust the power level.</li>
            <li>for this price is good, bu t not more.  </li>
            <li>and he has really fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Even though this razor is very inexpensive it lacks in performance.</li>
            <li>If you get going to fast it stops the blades.</li>
            <li>I used it, you can not cut hair very well.</li>
            <li>The Conair clippers have been very reliable and easy to use, and they&#x27;ve lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>There are other $10 clippers I&#x27;ve bought from amazon that worked way better.</li>
            <li>I would have to say that these clippers are better for personal use if you want them to last for a while.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Vidal machine...</li>
            <li>The clippers are complete junk.</li>
            <li>old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>This product is made in china and directly contributes to America&#x27;s $103 BILLION trade deficit in consumer products.    </li>
            <li>After my old Conair hair clippers wore out after years of use, we bought another one to replace it.</li>
            <li>halfway thru the cut, the pc had to be switched to a lower number making the haircut incredibly short...very disappointed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved from the Bronx, NY , to two different cities in New Jersey in that time.</li>
            <li>I took the clippers apart to investigate to see if it was just something that came loose, but on further inspection, one of the return springs for the cutters had snapped completely in two.</li>

            <li> Only down fall so far is that the longest comb is 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li> They trimmed my thick beard (beard hairs are much tougher than actual hair) like it wasn&#x27;t there and cut hair with no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Just used for trimming my bald head every two or three weeks, but does not have much power and even with oiling got dull and started pulling.</li>
            <li> and you should be able to start cutting hair with it after some practice.</li>
            <li> That is due to metal fatigue and over time, the spring got stressed and finally broke at the fatigue point.</li>
            <li> I think the extent of its use was a couple (botched) haircuts and me using it to trim my beard (lots faster than my little Panasonic trimmer), which I&#x27;ve been doing for probably the last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present we got a few years ago.</li>
            <li> clippers did their job and worked as I expected to.</li>
            <li> The kit includes six cutting guides in various lengths from around 1/2 inches down to 3/16 or 1/8 inches (I forget), two hair clips, some barber&#x27;s style scissors and guide comb, a tiny bottle of oil for the trimmer blades, blade cover, and a tiny brush for cleaning off the cutter assembly.</li>
            <li> but when I slowed down and work with his curls it worked like a dream.</li>
            <li> I would like a little longer ones</li>
            <li> The oil bottle is small and won&#x27;t last a long time, but you don&#x27;t have to go crazy with the oil.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> No More waiting in shop for me!  </li>
            <li> When I opened it two small plastic clips off some attachments had broken off.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t a bad purchase if you have low expectations and do not rely on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People speak so badly of Conair products, especially their hair-cutting product line.</li>
            <li> It vibrates excessively making it impossible to hold for longer than a few seconds without your hand</li>
            <li> The only thing that I really hated was the shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The design of the cutter head is also questionable.</li>
            <li> Conair doesn&#x27;t make bad products, and I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve been redesigned to address the issue, but breakage after 12 hours of use in a hair clipper is ridiculous.</li>

            <li> I ran the clippers through my hair and rather than cutting it, it merely pushed my hair out of the way.</li>
            <li> But watch a video tutorial before start cutting somebody&#x27;s hair if you&#x27;ve never used a machine like this one before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one two weeks ago, and I absolutely hate it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go buy some Wahl&#x27;s and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was trimming my beard and then the clippers started making a terrible racket.</li>
            <li> This is the worst haircutter that I have ever tried.  </li>

            <li> with 2 dogs and lots of boys, I ordered a couple of these. They are a good quality and work on both my human and canine animals thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this haircutting kit last month. I have used the clippers about 6 or 7 times  already since I bought the clippers.They cut just fine but,after you oil the blades,&amp; adjust the power level you have to go ahead &amp; cut your hair with some speed because these clippers get hot fast no matter how you adjust the power level.All of the attachments can help a skilled haircutter produce a great haircut.I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these clippers for daily use. I would have to say that these clippers are better for personal use if you want them to last for a while.I think I got my money&#x27;s worth for these clippers &amp; they will cut  more efficiently if you know how to use them. The only thing that I really hated was the shipping.I paid for1 day shipping,&amp; I recieved my clippers 4 days later (((Amazon.com))) I want my money back!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Vidal machine... my job requires me to cut my hair short... the Vidal was around $45 many years ago, I had lost all but two of the combs and needed a new machine... I bought this because it was the biggest bang for the buck. It works. Nothing fancy though.</li>
            <li> this haircutter, doesnt have enough power to cut hair, after 3 haircuts, i was irritaded that this didnt cut anymore, very cheap. you pay what you get</li>
            <li> This set has saved me from having to spend $17 for each haircut my son gets.  It would have been nice to have a few of the larger numbered combs, and the scissors aren&#x27;t all that great, but it all fits inside the case nicely and the razor works well, all in all I am one happy camper with this product.</li>
            <li> Had this for a couple years. Just used for trimming my bald head every two or three weeks, but does not have much power and even with oiling got dull and started pulling.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, Barbershop DIY! No More waiting in shop for me!  Guards actually help you achieve the cut you desire, lines are a bit tricky though!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present we got a few years ago. I think we&#x27;ve had it for about 4 years? I don&#x27;t know, but it sat unused for quite a while. I think the extent of its use was a couple (botched) haircuts and me using it to trim my beard (lots faster than my little Panasonic trimmer), which I&#x27;ve been doing for probably the last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a kit that includes lots of stuff and you should be able to start cutting hair with it after some practice. The kit includes six cutting guides in various lengths from around 1/2 inches down to 3/16 or 1/8 inches (I forget), two hair clips, some barber&#x27;s style scissors and guide comb, a tiny bottle of oil for the trimmer blades, blade cover, and a tiny brush for cleaning off the cutter assembly. It comes in a plastic container to hold all the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the picture on the listing is different than what I had. The clippers are a shiny chrome and the on-off switch is on the side not the top. The clipper itself looks different as well (maybe Conair redesigned it?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers did their job and worked as I expected to. There&#x27;s an adjusting lever on the side that adjusts the top blade&#x27;s depth, push it forward and the top cutters move forward. Pull it back and they retract. I liked that feature quite a bit, and the lever was pretty sturdy and held their position.  I kept it on the smallest setting to trim my beard to the length I like it and it worked fine. They trimmed my thick beard (beard hairs are much tougher than actual hair) like it wasn&#x27;t there and cut hair with no issues whatsoever. The blades are self-sharpening as well, and it isn&#x27;t noisy. The motor inside doesn&#x27;t spin too terribly fast so the cutter head doesn&#x27;t go very fast. The guides snapped onto the clippers just fine and stayed on pretty securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors were junk. You could tell they&#x27;re cheap, made from cheap steel, not very sharp, and marginally cut hair. The comb worked fine, and the clips worked good like they should. No complaints there. The oil bottle is small and won&#x27;t last a long time, but you don&#x27;t have to go crazy with the oil. Just a couple drops on the cutters to keep them lubed between uses. The brush is pitiful and only good for cleaning the hair residue out of the cutter head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the reason for two stars...The clippers are complete junk. True, they work good, but they broke after maybe 12 hours of use. I was trimming my beard and then the clippers started making a terrible racket. The top cutter seemed to detach from the rest of the cutter head and was flopping around. I took the clippers apart to investigate to see if it was just something that came loose, but on further inspection, one of the return springs for the cutters had snapped completely in two. That is due to metal fatigue and over time, the spring got stressed and finally broke at the fatigue point. It&#x27;s basically unfixable unless you buy the whole spring assembly, which might cost more than the entire trimmer kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the cutter head is also questionable. It&#x27;s based on the eccentric reciprocating design, where an eccentric plastic hub with a metal shaft that fits into a slot in the cutter head. As the motor spins, the shaft moves the top cutter side to side. A torsion spring acts to return the cutters and provide some stability to the top cutter. This isn&#x27;t the ideal setup for clippers. Good clippers have an electromagnetic reciprocating system that&#x27;s much more reliable and provides a more positive cutting motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clippers performed good&lt;br /&gt;Cuts thick hair great&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable cutter depth&lt;br /&gt;Includes six cutter guides, hair clips and comb and scissors&lt;br /&gt;Instruction manual and how-to for haircuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap clippers&lt;br /&gt;Cheap scissors&lt;br /&gt;Clippers broke after 12 hours of use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s not a professional-grade clipper set, but unless you&#x27;re a barber or stylist, you probably don&#x27;t need anythingbetter unless you&#x27;re brand-specific. They do what you want them to do, cut hair, and they just work. Conair doesn&#x27;t make bad products, and I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve been redesigned to address the issue, but breakage after 12 hours of use in a hair clipper is ridiculous.

            <li> I should have paid a bit more for some better clippers... I am regretting it now! These wouldn&#x27;t even cut my 4 yr. old&#x27;s hair and he has really fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> WARNING: This product is made in china and directly contributes to America&#x27;s $103 BILLION trade deficit in consumer products.    Review: Most products that are made in china now a-days does not affect the quality of the product, however that does not hold true for this item. When I opened it two small plastic clips off some attachments had broken off. No biggie since they still are functional to an extent and are attachments I do not plan on using. It does seem to heat up rather quickly. The case that is included is very nice. I will be using it for light personal use, anything more than that I would recommend a more expensive model. For the price (after-all, it is Chinese...) this isn&#x27;t a bad purchase if you have low expectations and do not rely on this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product years ago!!! I just saw that I&#x27;m still able to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People speak so badly of Conair products, especially their hair-cutting product line. I want to proudly say, this set has lasted me 3 years and counting. I&#x27;ve moved from the Bronx, NY , to two different cities in New Jersey in that time. The product has never given me an issue. I use the kit for an overall body grooming when need be. I don&#x27;t use it for hair-cuts and styling, but it has been a great product to me ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;Arturo Moises</li>
            <li> After my old Conair hair clippers wore out after years of use, we bought another one to replace it. My wife cuts my hair every two weeks with the clippers. The Conair clippers have been very reliable and easy to use, and they&#x27;ve lasted a long time. I love the convenience of getting my haircuts at home, and at this price, it only take a couple of haircuts to recoup the investment.</li>
            <li> This is the worst haircutter that I have ever tried.  It vibrates excessively making it impossible to hold for longer than a few seconds without your hand hurting.&lt;br /&gt;It makes you wonder whether Conair bothers to test their products.</li>
            <li> Even though this razor is very inexpensive it lacks in performance. I&#x27;ve only been able to use it 3x&#x27;s and already lost its sharpness.</li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting to cut my hair with it. I was terribly disappointed! I took the clippers out of the packaging, followed the instructions to properly handle the clippers, and began too \\&quot;cut\\&quot; my hair. I ran the clippers through my hair and rather than cutting it, it merely pushed my hair out of the way. I had to borrow a different pair of clippers just to fix the damage from these.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> This thing scares me every time I use it. It sets of the circuit breaker in my bathroom almost every time. It seems to use a lot of electricity. There are other $10 clippers I&#x27;ve bought from amazon that worked way better. Go with some Andis clippers.</li>
            <li> ES UN EXCELENTE PRODUCTO C O N CALIDAD GARANTIZADA LO RECOMIENDO CON LOS OJOS CERRADOS 100 % DESDE VALENCIA, VENEZUELA</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother, because she is disability, she can&#x27;t go to salon to have her hair cut. Ususally my mom is the person who cut her hair, my mom love this haircut kit. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Took a bit of oil for the blades to work good. It did pull my husbands hair the first time I used it but when I slowed down and work with his curls it worked like a dream. Great value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I recently used it on my brother who has finer and thinner hair and it works great. No snagging and pulling. You do have to keep a nice even pace. If you get going to fast it stops the blades. Only down fall so far is that the longest comb is 1/2 inch. I would like a little longer ones but oh well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first haircut machine but I love it. Easy to use, works well, I did nice haircut to my husband. But watch a video tutorial before start cutting somebody&#x27;s hair if you&#x27;ve never used a machine like this one before.</li>
            <li> this recommendation is that the product I received filled the expectations of the order, good performance and quality in comparison with others of the same species and very durable</li>
            <li> I purchased this one two weeks ago, and I absolutely hate it!&lt;br /&gt;One word to describe: do not buy it!</li>
            <li> halfway thru the cut, the pc had to be switched to a lower number making the haircut incredibly short...very disappointed</li>
            <li> order two of this product and one of them was damaged not served ensender ... did not want to report it because they do not know how to do that.</li>
            <li> This product is value for money. Works well ..looks great. Just caused the electric socket to trip a couple of times. Not sure why.</li>
            <li> avarage.  for this price is good, bu t not more.  I used it, you can not cut hair very well.</li>
