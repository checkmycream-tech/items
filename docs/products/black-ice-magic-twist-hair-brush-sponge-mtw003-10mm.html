            <li> My hair is naturally curly but this brings it to another level instantly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you have kinky hair (black hair).</li>
            <li> Sponge seems sturdy and thick not but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> But let me warn you this might attract white people to want to touch your hair, sometimes it can get pretty creepy</li>
            <li> Works just like expected!</li>
            <li> All in all less than 10 min.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re tired like me of a traditional fro style</li>
            <li> I advise if you have small hair to get the 7mm version instead of this one.</li>
            <li> On WET not damp hair I applyed my fav styler and twisted counter clockwise for added definition you can finger twist some sections.</li>
            <li> boring  </li>

            <li> Dont see alot of women talking about this even on youtube but this is an awesome product. I have a twa and was looking for a easier way to twist my sides and back.I tried the brush method but it didn&#x27;t work. I was happy to see this option was much cheaper than the other twist sponges I&#x27;ve seen in the past. This worked on my whole head which at its longest point is 5-6 inches but worked best On shorter hair. Its like hitting the easy button. On WET not damp hair I applyed my fav styler and twisted counter clockwise for added definition you can finger twist some sections. All in all less than 10 min. Sponge seems sturdy and thick not but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how long it will last. But its a sponge so I&#x27;m cool with the $10 purchase even every few months.</li>
