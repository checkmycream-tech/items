            <li> I love this foot cream and this brand!!. It moisterizes my dry feet without making them feel oily. The moister stayls locked in all day.</li>
            <li> Works quite well to keep my feet moisturizer and is undocumented, which I prefer for any kind of.body lotion.  I also use it on my elbows and hands at times.</li>
            <li> This works really well! It absorbs well, I found it worked best out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Perfect for diabetic feet. Very rich and smells good. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product and at a very competitive price.  This product works better than a more expensive product that a local nail shop recommended for me.  Use this products it really works</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronically dry heels which tend to crack open in the cold weather. A couple of years ago I purchased from my local natural foods market Shikai&#x27;s Borage Therapy Dry Skin Lotion. It worked amazingly well on my feet; but was not 100% effective. Recently I noticed on Amazon the foot cream from the same company: looking at the ingredients I noticed the only difference was that the dry skin lotion had some added purified water. Apparently the foot cream is a more concentrated version of the dry skin lotion; so I purchased it. After using it for a few weeks I&#x27;ve found it to be more effective on my dry heels. To date I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems. Both products are very good: in the future I&#x27;ll be using the dry skin lotion for general use when needed, and the foot cream for my feet.</li>
            <li> I tried everything on my dry cracked heels over the years. when I came across the shikai dry skin therapy foot cream I was astonished that within a couple of weeks my feet were smooth and clean looking. I will never use anything else again. I am 69 years old and finally found something that really does work.</li>
            <li> This is a great non toxic foot cream.  Everything that goes on the soles of our feet is absorbed into our body and this cream contains no toxic chemicals.  Softens and feels great</li>
            <li> This is great foot cream. Soaks in easily doesn&#x27;t leave the floors a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I, however, do not like the smell.</li>
            <li> Excellnt product! I have very dry skin and I use it on arms legs and hands. Lasts all day and my skin looks so much better. My daughter shared hers while we were on a vacation. I came home and bought 5!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best foot cream I have found.&lt;br /&gt;It really helps with dry cracking skin on the feet, especially the heels, where seasonal changes inflict skin cracking on some folk.&lt;br /&gt;( By the way, do NOT use it on the eyes, as it is NOT designed for use on fragile or moist internal surfaces of the eyes and other orifice)&lt;br /&gt;Also,this formulation is so effective a dry skin moisturizer, that a tube of this cream lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;So the price is quite fair for what one gets.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with this product. I usually love Shikai products. I&#x27;ve found their company to have a lot of integrity in their products and their business practices. This product has great ingredients and Shikai is still a great company. This foot cream just wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; enough to handle the dryness in my feet. I get much better results with Collective Wellbeing&#x27;s Foot Butter. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase and use many of Shikai&#x27;s other products though...They just missed the boat with this one, imho.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I have ever used --- I have really dry skin that can crack.  This has helped clear it up wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with the skin on the heels of my feet. Although I drink a lot of water, i was getting painful cracks on my heels. After one week of using this lotion, all cracks were healed and none have returned. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am fragrance sensitive. This has virtually no smell. It has good ingredients and no parabens, no artificial colors, no fragrance, no mineral oil. The first ingredient is certified organic aloe vera gel.&lt;br /&gt;It does soften skin effectively. I apply it at night &amp; put on little socks to sleep in. I had no dry heels this winter. I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> My husband has dry feet and is a diabetic controlled with diet. Every night, I use a foot cream and massage his feet well to keep his feet healthy. This cream is one of many I have used, and it does not do well. It would look great at the time of use, but he would have dry feet again every morning. We have had much better results with Andalou Naturals body lotion and with Vanicream.</li>
            <li> Really helps the dryness</li>
            <li> This would normally get five stars from me.  In the past this product has NEVER failed me.  I&#x27;ve purchased it and given it to friends and they are all using it now.  Unfortunately, they either changed the formulation or I got a funky batch.  It&#x27;s so thin it almost runs out without a squeeze.  My husband commented on it and he doesn&#x27;t notice ANYTHING.  Coupled with the fact that the last tube that I used through a Wisconsin winter kept my feet like a babies bottom and this one is not working on summer feet - something asmiss! What&#x27;s up Shikai???  BOO!</li>
            <li> Very thin. Pours out more like a lotion without even squeezing.  Wanted a cream.</li>
