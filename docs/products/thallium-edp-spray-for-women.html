            <li>Delivered fast, as promised, great price and scent.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a simple but sexy smell and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>so I was very much satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some lovely comments on it.</li>
            <li>It has a real mild smell but very sweet.</li>
            <li>This is quickly becoming my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I love the musky yet sweet scent of this perfume!</li>
            <li>Great smell for young adults!</li>
            <li>i think its a good perfume, but you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It has a rich, misterious sweet smell--very nice.</li>
            <li>Powdery and sweet, this has elements of Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s Pour Femme and I loved it at first spritz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the men&#x27;s Thallium (Blue Box) is great.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is worth more than what it sells for.</li>
            <li>Amazing the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>Meh, I gived it a try because of so many stars you all give but overall is not that good.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, nothing spectacular like the male version.  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful light scent for year round wear.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Never expected it to be as good considering the price.</li>
            <li>It does not have this light flowery smell like most of the modern fragrances.</li>
            <li>nothing amazing...use it when i just want to smell clean and regular..bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li>As a good part - I could smell it on myjacket a week later after m would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Great gift for someone that likes sweet smells</li>
            <li>Purchased as a Christmas present for my daughter she loved it.  </li>
            <li>As usual she loved it!</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, original item.</li>
            <li>I had to buy 2 bottles because the price is right</li>
            <li>I laughed, came home and ordered it from Amazon for less than $15.</li>
            <li>It was a gift from my husband and when I check the scent is too strong and old fashion scent for me..</li>
            <li>Be aware, also, that the one I received is Thallium by  Ives de Sistelle and not by Jacques Evard</li>
            <li>Still a great price, quality sucks in my opinion though.</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>real bummer</li>
            <li>Since this brand isn&#x27;t sold in stores I had no way of really knowing what it would smell like.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this amazing perfume at such a low cost.</li>
            <li>it smelled better than I expected.</li>
            <li>older generation fragrance, but</li>
            <li>This perfume is very soft and very feminine and I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Takes several sprays, and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you that long, but overall a good amount of perfume for the price</li>
            <li>New fragrance I tried.</li>
            <li>The female version is just okay to me, not long lasting either.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft &amp; sensual.</li>
            <li>WoW ia</li>
            <li>Far from it..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like fitted for old woman to wear...and later it has a musky smell which is for men scent.</li>

            <li> I like it a lot, I get lots of compliments from little older ladies.</li>
            <li> only thing is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would like it to...</li>
            <li> i wear this all the time and it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> i also wear other more expensive Fragrances from Paco Rabanne, Aqua de Gio, BVLGARI, Hugo Boss, Polo, Guerlain, etc.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t  last at all :(</li>
            <li> The scent is not very strong, so it is really hard for me to really smell it and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> When we wear it we can&#x27;t get enough of smelling each other.</li>
            <li> An opening of pink pepper, vanilla &amp; rose; middle notes of mandarin orange, violet, musk, jasmine, coffee blossom, iris &amp; peach; with base notes of pineapple &amp; sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is highly reminiscent of the Black Amethyst spray by Bath &amp; Body Works, if that&#x27;s helpful to anyone considering buying this.</li>
            <li> and it came sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast&lt;br /&gt;Product came intact</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll either love it or hate</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wonderful fragrants hands down..</li>
            <li> It is heavy and I feel like I am 70 yo.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical ordering this perfume from Amazon because you just never know what you&#x27;ll get..</li>
            <li> but it was not a good kick.</li>
            <li> Def unusual and very annoying.</li>
            <li> If not I am not happy with this misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> and you just can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to find Eau De Parfum below $50.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this perfume, it smells so good.  I had to buy 2 bottles because the price is right and you just can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t  last at all :( real bummer</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive this is. It smells amazing and I WILL be buying more. So worth it.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my sister. As usual she loved it!</li>
            <li> Meh, I gived it a try because of so many stars you all give but overall is not that good. It&#x27;s just a regular winteer eau de parfum. I won&#x27;t buy it again. Not my type.  Be aware, also, that the one I received is Thallium by  Ives de Sistelle and not by Jacques Evard so you&#x27;ll probably get the same!</li>
            <li> great smelling and swift delivery. no problems whatsoever! Came with box and smells amazinggggg. Anyone that likes the smell of dolce of gucci should invest.</li>
            <li> i love love love this fragrance it is so tantalizing and uplifting. i wear this all the time and it last a very long time. love it....</li>
            <li> I loved the men&#x27;s version of Thallium so I assumed the women&#x27;s would just be as amazing smelling as the men&#x27;s. But I was wrong. Since this brand isn&#x27;t sold in stores I had no way of really knowing what it would smell like. But after a waft of this, I knew I would not wear it. There&#x27;s this kick to the scent but it was not a good kick. Everyone has different tastes. I just didn&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
            <li> Scent smells good, but disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> Def unusual and very annoying. It does not have this light flowery smell like most of the modern fragrances. It is heavy and I feel like I am 70 yo. As a good part - I could smell it on myjacket a week later after m would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> WoW ia all that I can say!  Love it 10 Stars.  Even the men&#x27;s Thallium (Blue Box) is great.  We had that shipped to our Arizona vacation rental house and I started wearing it.  I just ordered the sport, we will have the whole line in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful fragrants hands down..</li>
            <li> older generation fragrance, but I like it a lot, I get lots of compliments from little older ladies.</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this amazing perfume at such a low cost. I will be ordering this perfume again!  It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li> I use Thallium for Men by Yves De Sistelle 3.3 Ounce EDT. i also wear other more expensive Fragrances from Paco Rabanne, Aqua de Gio, BVLGARI, Hugo Boss, Polo, Guerlain, etc. But My girl friend recognize the smell of Thallium every time I wear it and she loves it. So I decided to buy its female version for her. Now I see why she loves it when I wear it. It&#x27;s almost impossible to find Eau De Parfum below $50.</li>
            <li> Great product perfect.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells AWESOME! I get compliments all the time when I wear it. I saw it at the mall and the lady said it was $99, but she would give it to me on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for $39....I laughed, came home and ordered it from Amazon for less than $15. This is quickly becoming my favorite scent. Really lovely.</li>
            <li> I give this to my wife and she&#x27; like it&amp;#34;am going to order again,,,</li>
            <li> I love this smell. This is a compliment to the man&#x27;s version. When we wear it we can&#x27;t get enough of smelling each other.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, nothing spectacular like the male version.  The female version is just okay to me, not long lasting either.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it. i think its a good perfume, but you really get what you pay for. Takes several sprays, and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you that long, but overall a good amount of perfume for the price</li>
            <li> Great shipping, perfume lasts several hours and the GF loved it. It has a rich, misterious sweet smell--very nice. Preferred for evening wear!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item, I specifically wanted &amp;#34;Thallium by Jacques Evard&amp;#34;, but when it arrived, it was &amp;#34;Thallium by Yves de Sistelle&amp;#34;.  Is this the same company?  If not I am not happy with this misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast, as promised, great price and scent. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> New fragrance I tried.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and it smells great on me. Everytime I wear it people ask what are you wearing.</li>
            <li> Comes in retail packaging. Great smell for young adults!</li>
            <li> It was a gift from my husband and when I check the scent is too strong and old fashion scent for me..it&#x27;s like fitted for old woman to wear...and later it has a musky smell which is for men scent. So I just return it and get the product that I want.  and the perfume product is from yves de sistille.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for the price. Thallium is a great fragrence and for the cost, you cant beat it. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to smell as good as the Thallium for Men by Yves De Sistelle. Far from it..it says in the description that it is a Parfum, but no way with all that alcohol smell that came out when I sprayed it. The scent is not very strong, so it is really hard for me to really smell it and doesn&#x27;t last long. I realize now that it is made by a different brand. Still a great price, quality sucks in my opinion though.</li>
            <li> only thing is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would like it to...but it&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast&lt;br /&gt;Product came intact&lt;br /&gt;Great gift for someone that likes sweet smells</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, original item. I was looking everywhere online but this looked the best. I was not disappointed. This perfume is very soft and very feminine and I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> My husband wears the one for men.  I decided to try the Thallium for women. It great and my husband loves it and thats what counts</li>
            <li> My son likes this one</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas present for my daughter she loved it.  It has a real mild smell but very sweet. I purchased the men&#x27;s cologne for her husband.</li>
            <li> The best woman fragrance</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so amazing. I was looking for a simple but sexy smell and this is perfect. I was alittle nervous about ordering a perfume online that I didn&#x27;t know how it smelled but when I receieved it (on time I should add) it smelled better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and it came sooner than expected so I was very much satisfied with it. I knew that the scent was going to be great considering that the Thallium for mens smell great, my girlfriend loves the perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Wish it lasted longer ..good price.  Pretty bottle. Would buy again  my mother likes it too.  Makes a nice gift.</li>
            <li> This scent is delightful for about 10 seconds, then quickly evaporates.  It just doesn&#x27;t have any staying power and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This perfume arrived on time in the box that it is pictured in. I love the musky yet sweet scent of this perfume! It is highly reminiscent of the Black Amethyst spray by Bath &amp; Body Works, if that&#x27;s helpful to anyone considering buying this.</li>
            <li> Good Quality !!! Great Price !!!</li>
            <li> Powdery and sweet, this has elements of Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s Pour Femme and I loved it at first spritz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think buyers deserve to have an idea what they&#x27;re in for and since perfume smells slightly different on everyone I&#x27;ll list the notes here. An opening of pink pepper, vanilla &amp; rose; middle notes of mandarin orange, violet, musk, jasmine, coffee blossom, iris &amp; peach; with base notes of pineapple &amp; sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this is a gourmand dream and I adore gourmands. Very safe scent - good for the office, out to lunch, snuggling on the couch. Also a lot of juice for a great price, this is a good bargain I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who likes powdery/musky scents.</li>
            <li> Great size bottle..smells fresh..nothing amazing...use it when i just want to smell clean and regular..bottle lasts a while. Great size for price</li>
            <li> awesome product. bought it from a perfume store for like 40 bucks and that was supposed to be a &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34;... I was so glad to find it on here for a great price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Great price!</li>
            <li> Never expected it to be as good considering the price. This fragrance is worth more than what it sells for. It is great!!!! I recommend as well Thallium male fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely smell</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical ordering this perfume from Amazon because you just never know what you&#x27;ll get..&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll either love it or hate it.&lt;br /&gt;It truly is a beautiful scent! It&#x27;s not overpowering...it&#x27;s very soft &amp; sensual.</li>
            <li> Very bright floral scent. Gives me a nice pick me up. I&#x27;ve had some lovely comments on it. Amazing the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance to compliment the Thallium for men that I bought my husband.  It is a wonderful light scent for year round wear.</li>
