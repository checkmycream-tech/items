            <li>Look how much that drawer holds!!!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be investing in more of these soon!!</li>
            <li>Everything is so easily accessible.  </li>
            <li>First off, I love makeup.  </li>
            <li>I really love this so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it!.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s good-looking enough to sit on top of a vanity or bathroom counter, if you have that kind of space</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s able to hold a lot of items without taking up much space.  </li>
            <li>The top part of the organizer actually is capable of holding quite a lot of products.  </li>
            <li>It is very organized and looks quite elegant with my stuff in it.</li>
            <li>It is made of very strong plastic that is crystal clear!</li>
            <li>So when I was given a chance to review this Cosmetic Organizer and Makeup Storage I was very excited to see how much it helped delete some of my unwanted clutter in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I love how the drawers are clear, making it easy to know where things are at quickly.  </li>
            <li>The drawers aren&#x27;t very deep at 1&amp;#34; but this is a great organizer to keep your everyday go-to makeup in and display it nicely on your vanity or bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li>it has done a great job at keeping my jewelry and other items out of the way of my children.</li>
            <li>the drawers are quite shallow, but work perfect for my brushes and eye products (mascara, liners, eyebrow pencil, etc.)</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>I love that the top part is detachable, so I can split the two up or even stack a second one!</li>
            <li>This one is super shiny and cut to perfection.</li>
            <li>are super</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very very pleased with the super high quality of this makeup organizer, and I highly recommend getting one for</li>
            <li>picking it up in the box I thought there was just a lot of padding, but it was fit very snugly and all of the weight was from the organizer itself!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this makeup organizer and will be purchasing another once I get a bigger vanity.&lt;br /&gt;Organizer provided by HerPow at a promotional price for testing and review.</li>
            <li>At first glance I was worried that my eyeshadow palettes wouldn&#x27;t fit (Tarte, Stilla, etc.)</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how much fit inside of this organizer!</li>
            <li>there is enough space for most of my make up!</li>
            <li>It would make a fantastic gift for yourself, or since Christmas is coming up, it would be a really nice gift for your teen who is just getting into makeup or for someone who has too much makeup and needs some organization!</li>
            <li>The lower part does have little notches on the top of it however that will securely hold the TOP section in place</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact enough to fit under the sink of a tiny vanity, which works great for me.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth having if you have a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>i  love the fact that it stores my things but is clear</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a clear color</li>
            <li>Love that the drawers come completely out</li>
            <li>The material is nice and sturdy and definitely quality made.  </li>
            <li>The drawers slide easily and it looks high quality.</li>
            <li>The drawers all slide in and out easily making it easy to get to stuff as well as clean and dry it.</li>
            <li>just right and everythings neat and organized and in one place.</li>
            <li>this is just right for you.</li>
            <li>Now its right in front of me.</li>
            <li>glosses - right at your fingertips!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The acrylic is high quality and feels very strong and the seams of each piece are connected seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Many times have I bought something used it once and then lost it right away in my vanity, to be found months later right before the expiration date.</li>
            <li>The drawers come out completely for easy cleaning or filling up with all your goodies.</li>
            <li>They are smaller than i thought but surprisingly fit so much in them!!!</li>
            <li>Pretty.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these organizers to anyone who loves makeup as much as I do!</li>
            <li>Love that you have the option to stack it or set it up in different areas.</li>
            <li>I was able to participate in a promotion where I got this at a deep discount, and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li>Second, I love organization.  </li>
            <li>The top is removable with lots if different size compartments.</li>
            <li>so I can see into the drawers and know exactly what I have in them.</li>
            <li>You can also remove the top if you want a different look.</li>
            <li>This organizer is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>like the quality of this piece - much better than I have seen in beauty stores for close to the same price.</li>
            <li>The top sections I use for lip sticks and glosses, and eye liners as well as facial serums, tinted moisturizers and sample sized products.</li>
            <li>The top section can actually be removed and placed separately from the bottom drawer area.</li>
            <li>This makes my mornings so much easier!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s one of the first reviews I&#x27;ve submitted this way.  </li>
            <li>Of course I am sure that I will find something to put in the extra space.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are considering purchasing this organizer, please be aware of the depth of the drawers so that you can manage expectations.  </li>
            <li>That is my first response.</li>
            <li>Very nice thick jewelry organizer.</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is the fact that I have so many little lipgloss pieces and other single eye make up things that the storage is great for them.</li>
            <li>This little cosmetic storage is perfect to fit in my tiny corner space over my toilet counter.</li>
            <li>The acrylic is high quality, I can tell because I&#x27;ve bought several before via Amazon and most have come cracked.</li>
            <li>Each drawer is one inch deep and has a crystal-clear ball for easy opening.</li>
            <li>It is well built with plenty of space for even large pallets in the drawers.</li>
            <li>also can seperate the organizer if you wish, they are two seperate pieces instead of one large piece!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have quite a large collection that I&#x27;ve accumulated</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to purchase a few more to accommodate all of my makeup!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a decently priced, sturdy, pretty piece to organize my makeup products.  </li>
            <li>Drawers open easy and hold surprisingly more than I expected!  </li>
            <li>For me, this has made a huge difference in organizing my daily makeup and hair needs.  </li>
            <li>cuz I have SO much of it</li>
            <li>The organizer feels very sturdy and is made well.  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and comes in two pieces.</li>
            <li>I can put a lot of my make up in the organizer and even some jewelry cause its very multifunctional.</li>
            <li>This organizer is well made and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li>I have so much clutter put away now</li>
            <li>so this is a really neat product</li>
            <li>cosmetics are very organized.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This organizer has really made my bathroom neater and it sturdy.</li>
            <li>The top sits on, with minimal movement.</li>
            <li>The storage unit is very durable and comes in (2) Pieces.</li>
            <li>It came very well packaged, and in 2 pieces.</li>
            <li>have included some pictures so that you can see what this is capable of holding.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much prettier to have in one consolidated area versus spread all over the place.  </li>
            <li>This saves me so much time in the morning not having to search.</li>
            <li>It is very durable and sturdy.</li>
            <li>mascara wands can fit into the smaller drawers.</li>
            <li>really sturdy and fits just about anywhere.</li>
            <li>I love hove the little slots on the right</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone that needs a better way to organize their make up or other products that need organization.</li>
            <li>The top section (where the lipsticks and such go) is not attached to the rest of the container so if you have enough room it can actually sit next to the bottom section thus giving you more space to store creams and serums and such on top.</li>
            <li>Although you can&#x27;t stack them on top of each other.  </li>
            <li>It comes in two pieces which you can stack them on top of each other or use side by side or in separate areas.</li>
            <li>A full sized palette can fit into the larger drawers and several lip or eye pencils as well as</li>
            <li>Really well made, high quality acrylic organizer.</li>
            <li>Also, my 2 year old doesn&#x27;t get into my makeup as much as when it was just all sitting in a bag!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this organizer.  </li>
            <li>Would like to have a little more room.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to find what I&#x27;m looking for with the clear drawers.  </li>
            <li>because us busy mommies have so much to do, we don&#x27;t have time to hunt around for what we need, and that goes for make up, craft supplies and jewelry.  </li>
            <li>The drawers open easily and had enough room for my palettes, eyeliners and mascaras.</li>
            <li>They are deep enough to hold all my brushes upright and easily display them</li>
            <li>It is large enough to fit all of the things I&#x27;ve needed it to, and small enough to fit on my vanity!</li>
            <li>The bottom two are the same size, the whole width, the top two drawers are one half the width.</li>
            <li>The rectangular area can be used for all your bigger makeup that doesn&#x27;t fit in the squares, 2 smaller rectangular areas for eyeliners, makeup brushes, etc.  </li>
            <li>actually comes in two pieces, which is nice if you have a thin shelf you are trying to fit the drawer part on and can use the open section somewhere else.</li>
            <li>The larger section of the organizer makes it possible to hold skincare items that are larger and usually harder to find good storage space for.  </li>
            <li>Wow wow!</li>
            <li>It has 4 drawers, 2 large and 2 smaller.</li>
            <li>I love the little nobs, making it easier to open.</li>
            <li>it is also clear and no fogginess to the acrylic.</li>
            <li>For the price, I am completely amazed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually looks like glass and is very durable.</li>
            <li>I can not say that anymore, with dimensions of 9.4 x 5.9 x 7.32 and drawer sizes that are 1 inch deep, I have too much storage now.</li>
            <li>I was giving the opportunity to try this makeup organizer for free and since I was in the process of getting control of my ridiculous stash of makeup arsenal, I reached out to this company based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Urban Decan Vice palettes, or comparable sized palettes) won&#x27;t fit in the drawers, but they really do work extremely well for the skinner or smaller</li>
            <li>I own a few other acrylic organizers but they don&#x27;t compare to this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to hold a variety of items - basically your daily wear.</li>
            <li>This organizer has 4 drawers and several openings for large and smaller products.</li>
            <li>I can stick all my glosses and eye pencils on the top along with some other odds and ends that do not fit inside the drawers.</li>
            <li>I have saw organizers like this but didn&#x27;t get it cause the too little space and compartments just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>However, the drawers are large enough to also hold long and skinny shadow palettes.  </li>
            <li>However, the drawers are large enough to also hold long and skinny shadow palettes.  </li>
            <li>Small enough that both can fit on bath vanity.</li>
            <li>The lipstick section is great to also double for little perfume vials and other small samples</li>
            <li>The drawers are larger than I expected and slide open and closed easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by how much this holds based on how little room it takes up on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>I have always used a little rubbermaid to keep my makeup in and this cosmetics organizer is so much easier!</li>
            <li>Organization of my make up products is exactly what was missing in my life.</li>
            <li>Not long ago, I purchased a similar organizer to this one, the only major difference between that organizer and this one is the look of the front of the drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>My only wish was that it was bigger.. deeper drawers and just taller and wider in general.  </li>
            <li>no more freaking out not being able to find stuff I use and need everyday...</li>
            <li>The drawers open and close easily, and don&#x27;t stick like other organizers I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>

            <li> I was able to put the majority of two boxes I had sitting on my vanity into this storage container.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li> The top two drawers have a depth of 1&amp;#34;, 4&amp;#34; length, and 5&amp;#34; width.</li>

            <li> I love the versatility of having two separate pieces.</li>
            <li> This is really well made and looks very nice on my bathroom counter.</li>

            <li> Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to provide my honest feedback!</li>
            <li> The top of the makeup organizer isn&#x27;t attached to the drawers which makes for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> The drawers slide out easily and it&#x27;s more spacious than it appears.  </li>
            <li> With the crystal-clear finish, you are able to see through the drawers so you can find everything easily.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit all of my makeup in it and now am easily able to find what product and color</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m extremely excited to have this on my vanity and to have things better in order.  </li>
            <li> And it makes it easy to also  rotate any of my make up.</li>

            <li> The top part is great for my face lotion and serums, along with any extra brushes and lipsticks/</li>
            <li> Easy to give as a gift.  </li>

            <li> I am enjoying this product so very much!  </li>
            <li> This organizer is made with strong CLEAR ACRYLIC , it&#x27;s a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love that it is clear it makes looking for my favorite items easier to find!</li>
            <li> This is finely made and it does not have that &#x27;cheap&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit all my makeup</li>
            <li> All edges are smooth</li>
            <li> Can also be a great  back to college</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The compartments hold a lot and they fit all my makeup needs.</li>
            <li> Pens and pencils as well as paper clips or post its will fit in there.</li>
            <li> Look how much that drawer holds!!!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be investing in more of these soon!!</li>
            <li> Everything is so easily accessible.  </li>
            <li> First off, I love makeup.  </li>
            <li> I really love this so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it!.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s good-looking enough to sit on top of a vanity or bathroom counter, if you have that kind of space</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s able to hold a lot of items without taking up much space.  </li>
            <li> The top part of the organizer actually is capable of holding quite a lot of products.  </li>
            <li> It is very organized and looks quite elegant with my stuff in it.</li>
            <li> It is made of very strong plastic that is crystal clear!</li>
            <li> So when I was given a chance to review this Cosmetic Organizer and Makeup Storage I was very excited to see how much it helped delete some of my unwanted clutter in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love how the drawers are clear, making it easy to know where things are at quickly.  </li>
            <li> The drawers aren&#x27;t very deep at 1&amp;#34; but this is a great organizer to keep your everyday go-to makeup in and display it nicely on your vanity or bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li> it has done a great job at keeping my jewelry and other items out of the way of my children.</li>
            <li> the drawers are quite shallow, but work perfect for my brushes and eye products (mascara, liners, eyebrow pencil, etc.)</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> I love that the top part is detachable, so I can split the two up or even stack a second one!</li>
            <li> This one is super shiny and cut to perfection.</li>
            <li> are super</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very very pleased with the super high quality of this makeup organizer, and I highly recommend getting one for</li>
            <li> picking it up in the box I thought there was just a lot of padding, but it was fit very snugly and all of the weight was from the organizer itself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this makeup organizer and will be purchasing another once I get a bigger vanity.&lt;br /&gt;Organizer provided by HerPow at a promotional price for testing and review.</li>
            <li> At first glance I was worried that my eyeshadow palettes wouldn&#x27;t fit (Tarte, Stilla, etc.)</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how much fit inside of this organizer!</li>
            <li> there is enough space for most of my make up!</li>
            <li> It would make a fantastic gift for yourself, or since Christmas is coming up, it would be a really nice gift for your teen who is just getting into makeup or for someone who has too much makeup and needs some organization!</li>
            <li> The lower part does have little notches on the top of it however that will securely hold the TOP section in place</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact enough to fit under the sink of a tiny vanity, which works great for me.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth having if you have a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> i  love the fact that it stores my things but is clear</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a clear color</li>
            <li> Love that the drawers come completely out</li>
            <li> The material is nice and sturdy and definitely quality made.  </li>
            <li> The drawers slide easily and it looks high quality.</li>
            <li> The drawers all slide in and out easily making it easy to get to stuff as well as clean and dry it.</li>
            <li> just right and everythings neat and organized and in one place.</li>
            <li> this is just right for you.</li>
            <li> Now its right in front of me.</li>
            <li> glosses - right at your fingertips!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The acrylic is high quality and feels very strong and the seams of each piece are connected seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Many times have I bought something used it once and then lost it right away in my vanity, to be found months later right before the expiration date.</li>
            <li> The drawers come out completely for easy cleaning or filling up with all your goodies.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than i thought but surprisingly fit so much in them!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these organizers to anyone who loves makeup as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Love that you have the option to stack it or set it up in different areas.</li>
            <li> I was able to participate in a promotion where I got this at a deep discount, and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Second, I love organization.  </li>
            <li> The top is removable with lots if different size compartments.</li>
            <li> so I can see into the drawers and know exactly what I have in them.</li>
            <li> You can also remove the top if you want a different look.</li>
            <li> This organizer is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> like the quality of this piece - much better than I have seen in beauty stores for close to the same price.</li>
            <li> The top sections I use for lip sticks and glosses, and eye liners as well as facial serums, tinted moisturizers and sample sized products.</li>
            <li> The top section can actually be removed and placed separately from the bottom drawer area.</li>
            <li> This makes my mornings so much easier!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s one of the first reviews I&#x27;ve submitted this way.  </li>
            <li> Of course I am sure that I will find something to put in the extra space.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are considering purchasing this organizer, please be aware of the depth of the drawers so that you can manage expectations.  </li>
            <li> That is my first response.</li>
            <li> Very nice thick jewelry organizer.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is the fact that I have so many little lipgloss pieces and other single eye make up things that the storage is great for them.</li>
            <li> This little cosmetic storage is perfect to fit in my tiny corner space over my toilet counter.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is high quality, I can tell because I&#x27;ve bought several before via Amazon and most have come cracked.</li>
            <li> Each drawer is one inch deep and has a crystal-clear ball for easy opening.</li>
            <li> It is well built with plenty of space for even large pallets in the drawers.</li>
            <li> also can seperate the organizer if you wish, they are two seperate pieces instead of one large piece!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have quite a large collection that I&#x27;ve accumulated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to purchase a few more to accommodate all of my makeup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a decently priced, sturdy, pretty piece to organize my makeup products.  </li>
            <li> Drawers open easy and hold surprisingly more than I expected!  </li>
            <li> For me, this has made a huge difference in organizing my daily makeup and hair needs.  </li>
            <li> cuz I have SO much of it</li>
            <li> The organizer feels very sturdy and is made well.  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and comes in two pieces.</li>
            <li> I can put a lot of my make up in the organizer and even some jewelry cause its very multifunctional.</li>
            <li> This organizer is well made and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> I have so much clutter put away now</li>
            <li> so this is a really neat product</li>
            <li> cosmetics are very organized.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This organizer has really made my bathroom neater and it sturdy.</li>
            <li> The top sits on, with minimal movement.</li>
            <li> The storage unit is very durable and comes in (2) Pieces.</li>
            <li> It came very well packaged, and in 2 pieces.</li>
            <li> have included some pictures so that you can see what this is capable of holding.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much prettier to have in one consolidated area versus spread all over the place.  </li>
            <li> This saves me so much time in the morning not having to search.</li>
            <li> It is very durable and sturdy.</li>
            <li> mascara wands can fit into the smaller drawers.</li>
            <li> really sturdy and fits just about anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love hove the little slots on the right</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that needs a better way to organize their make up or other products that need organization.</li>
            <li> The top section (where the lipsticks and such go) is not attached to the rest of the container so if you have enough room it can actually sit next to the bottom section thus giving you more space to store creams and serums and such on top.</li>
            <li> Although you can&#x27;t stack them on top of each other.  </li>
            <li> It comes in two pieces which you can stack them on top of each other or use side by side or in separate areas.</li>
            <li> A full sized palette can fit into the larger drawers and several lip or eye pencils as well as</li>
            <li> Really well made, high quality acrylic organizer.</li>
            <li> Also, my 2 year old doesn&#x27;t get into my makeup as much as when it was just all sitting in a bag!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this organizer.  </li>
            <li> Would like to have a little more room.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to find what I&#x27;m looking for with the clear drawers.  </li>
            <li> because us busy mommies have so much to do, we don&#x27;t have time to hunt around for what we need, and that goes for make up, craft supplies and jewelry.  </li>
            <li> The drawers open easily and had enough room for my palettes, eyeliners and mascaras.</li>
            <li> They are deep enough to hold all my brushes upright and easily display them</li>
            <li> It is large enough to fit all of the things I&#x27;ve needed it to, and small enough to fit on my vanity!</li>
            <li> The bottom two are the same size, the whole width, the top two drawers are one half the width.</li>
            <li> The rectangular area can be used for all your bigger makeup that doesn&#x27;t fit in the squares, 2 smaller rectangular areas for eyeliners, makeup brushes, etc.  </li>
            <li> actually comes in two pieces, which is nice if you have a thin shelf you are trying to fit the drawer part on and can use the open section somewhere else.</li>
            <li> The larger section of the organizer makes it possible to hold skincare items that are larger and usually harder to find good storage space for.  </li>
            <li> Wow wow!</li>
            <li> It has 4 drawers, 2 large and 2 smaller.</li>
            <li> I love the little nobs, making it easier to open.</li>
            <li> it is also clear and no fogginess to the acrylic.</li>
            <li> For the price, I am completely amazed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually looks like glass and is very durable.</li>
            <li> I can not say that anymore, with dimensions of 9.4 x 5.9 x 7.32 and drawer sizes that are 1 inch deep, I have too much storage now.</li>
            <li> I was giving the opportunity to try this makeup organizer for free and since I was in the process of getting control of my ridiculous stash of makeup arsenal, I reached out to this company based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Urban Decan Vice palettes, or comparable sized palettes) won&#x27;t fit in the drawers, but they really do work extremely well for the skinner or smaller</li>
            <li> I own a few other acrylic organizers but they don&#x27;t compare to this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to hold a variety of items - basically your daily wear.</li>
            <li> This organizer has 4 drawers and several openings for large and smaller products.</li>
            <li> I can stick all my glosses and eye pencils on the top along with some other odds and ends that do not fit inside the drawers.</li>
            <li> I have saw organizers like this but didn&#x27;t get it cause the too little space and compartments just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> However, the drawers are large enough to also hold long and skinny shadow palettes.  </li>
            <li> However, the drawers are large enough to also hold long and skinny shadow palettes.  </li>
            <li> Small enough that both can fit on bath vanity.</li>
            <li> The lipstick section is great to also double for little perfume vials and other small samples</li>
            <li> The drawers are larger than I expected and slide open and closed easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by how much this holds based on how little room it takes up on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I have always used a little rubbermaid to keep my makeup in and this cosmetics organizer is so much easier!</li>
            <li> Organization of my make up products is exactly what was missing in my life.</li>
            <li> Not long ago, I purchased a similar organizer to this one, the only major difference between that organizer and this one is the look of the front of the drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> My only wish was that it was bigger.. deeper drawers and just taller and wider in general.  </li>
            <li> no more freaking out not being able to find stuff I use and need everyday...</li>
            <li> The drawers open and close easily, and don&#x27;t stick like other organizers I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> vanity has been super messy - makeup all over, no organization to anything and boxes full of random nail tools, lip glosses, makeup brushes, eye shadow duo&#x27;s, tweezers and grooming tools.</li>
            <li> The top detachable part of the organizer has 12 spaces for lipsticks, a spot for larger items like your foundation or moisturizer and deeper spots in the back for eye liners, makeup brushes, primers, or any other thin tubed products you have.</li>
            <li> You get 2 large drawers, 2 small drawers, 12 slots for your lipsticks/lipglosses and several other compact little areas that you can fit perfumes, lotions or other makeup.</li>
            <li> To give you an example, I use one drawer for hair ties and clips, 1 for mascaras, 1 for eye shadow palettes, and 1 for my Bare Minerals loose powder.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is high quality and not cheaply produced.</li>
            <li> Very convenient  in my small cabinets.</li>
            <li> The drawer handles are easy to grab and pull while others are small and hard to pull open.</li>
            <li> 1 large square in front giving at least 20 spaces for storage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t hold all of my makeup because I clearly have a lot, but it holds my everyday essentials that I use.</li>
            <li> If you are not completely satisfied, the company offers a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one for a long time, but was hesitant.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised on the weight of this organizer, it is very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> The construction is really solid - I was surprised by how thick the Lucite is.  </li>
            <li> I prefer them stacked as I am working with limited space.</li>
            <li> and it seriously still looks brand new!</li>
            <li> I have a big bulky black makeup case that I use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a big black hole that makeup gets lost in and doesn&#x27;t stay organized and is a pain to wash.</li>
            <li> I like that it has little drawers, I&#x27;m using this for the makeup I use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Each piece is carefully shrink wrapped and divided with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> It is make from high quality, thick acrylic!</li>
            <li> The spaces are wide enough for my brushes, and small palettes.</li>
            <li> the pictures, the bottom three drawers are a separate organizer and bought separately, but as you can see, it is compatible with other storage and is stackable and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This organizer contains 4 drawers, 12 lipstick holders, and 4 other organized areas for miscellaneous items.</li>
            <li> organizer can hold a variety of things other than makeup.</li>
            <li> Plus other odds and ends..</li>
            <li> I can see this being used for crafts, sewing items and lots of other ideas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already considering purchasing another one for my other bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The entire back side was broken so the drawers won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> You really can not go wrong with this organizer.</li>
            <li> Only complaint would be the height of the drawers.</li>
            <li> I figure I&#x27;ll continue to use the black case for the extras and a spot to rotate items (fall/summer/spring colors).</li>
            <li> My previous review for this was deleted.</li>
            <li> The other ones I have are dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of heavy acrylic but looks like glass!  </li>
            <li> but it arrived broken</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t, unfortunately).</li>
            <li> and it came in very poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Now if you are anything like me, I can&#x27;t stand for things to be unorganized, it just drives me crazy.  </li>
            <li> for holding quite a lot of random girly items!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this.  Holds everything perfectly.</li>
            <li> PERFECTION!!!!!!!! AMAZING PRICE!!!! Doesn&#x27;t fit all my makeup cuz I have SO much of it but it organizes so well!!! All my tweezers and scissors in one drawer...no more freaking out not being able to find stuff I use and need everyday... Pretty. Stackable. Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup storage! I&#x27;ve been wanting one for a long time, but was hesitant. When it arose that I was able to review this, you bet your bottom dollar I was going to! This doesn&#x27;t hold all of my makeup because I clearly have a lot, but it holds my everyday essentials that I use. I would recommend these organizers to anyone who loves makeup as much as I do! This has been the best so far!</li>
            <li> I was giving the opportunity to try this makeup organizer for free and since I was in the process of getting control of my ridiculous stash of makeup arsenal, I reached out to this company based on the positive reviews.  This organizer shipped quickly and it was packaged very securely. Unlike some organizers that I have seen in beauty supply stores, the quality of this organizer is very nice! The acrylic is high quality and not cheaply produced. The organizer isn&#x27;t too heavy and it is very sturdy. The roomy drawers slide in and out with ease. The top of the makeup organizer isn&#x27;t attached to the drawers which makes for easy cleaning. All in all, it is great organizer! I&#x27;ll need to purchase a few more to accommodate all of my makeup! Plus, the customer service is great! I had a question about their organizer and they responded in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome cosmetic organizer ! I am a makeup addict and I was able to neatly store all my most used items in the organizer. It is well built with plenty of space for even large pallets in the drawers. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received a sample for review all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product so very much!  It looks beautiful on my bathroom counter and holds EVERYTHING I need.  (skincare, makeup, hair products, etc)  I love hove the little slots on the right perfectly hold my lipsticks, essential oils, and mascaras.  Everything is so easily accessible.  I would definitely recommend this product to others!  It is make from high quality, thick acrylic!</li>
            <li> This is just what my growing makeup stash needed. This cosmetics organizer is awesome. Sturdy and quality made. Love that you have the option to stack it or set it up in different areas. The drawers come out completely for easy cleaning or filling up with all your goodies. This is something every woman who has a makeup collection needs. It would make the perfect gift.&lt;br /&gt;This is actually in two parts. You can have them separate or stack them. I prefer them stacked as I am working with limited space. I can stick all my glosses and eye pencils on the top along with some other odds and ends that do not fit inside the drawers. The drawers were perfect for all of my mascaras and eyeshadow pots. It is definitely worth having if you have a lot of makeup. I will be purchasing myself one and my mom one soon! I was able to participate in a promotion where I got this at a deep discount, and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> What a perfect addition to my vanity!  I am seriously in love with this cosmetic organizer!  First off, I love makeup.  Second, I love organization.  I&#x27;m extremely excited to have this on my vanity and to have things better in order.  The organizer feels very sturdy and is made well.  For the price, I am completely amazed.  Drawers open easy and hold surprisingly more than I expected!  Check out the pictures below!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the pictures, the bottom three drawers are a separate organizer and bought separately, but as you can see, it is compatible with other storage and is stackable and sturdy. Look how much that drawer holds!!!  I received this product in exchange for my honest review (and I freaking love it!).</li>
            <li> This Cosmetic Organizer is GREAT. It has all the spaces for a great makeup storage. What I love about this product is the fact that I have so many little lipgloss pieces and other single eye make up things that the storage is great for them. I used to put everything in my medicine cabinet and then it would all fall out and drive me bonkers. I am one that likes everything to be in one place so when I need it I have it. This is great for even storing your bottles of perfume. I find this fits on my dresser just right and everythings neat and organized and in one place. I totally love this organizer and storage. If you are one that has alot of makeup this is just right for you. I received this product in exchange for an honest unbiased review which is 100% my own and may differ from yours or others</li>
            <li> Amazing caddy that holds so much more than it seems! It is not tiny, and holds quite a lot! My liners and lipsticks finally have a proper home!</li>
            <li> this is really nice. its very well made and sturdy and came at a great value. it matches my cosmetic case and looks really great on my dresser. it was just what i needed for my items i wanted to keep safe. it has done a great job at keeping my jewelry and other items out of the way of my children. i  love the fact that it stores my things but is clear so i dont have to dig around when i need something.</li>
            <li> Love this well made organizer. The organizer came well packed, in a nice handled box. I am very impressed with this quality product. The top is removable with lots if different size compartments. The bottom is 4 drawers, with nice handles to pull the compartment drawers out. The bottom two are the same size, the whole width, the top two drawers are one half the width. I think it would compliment and organize any make up collection, or could be used for jewelry, hair ties, pins. There a million uses for this organizer, even in the kitchen or garage. I will be purchasing more, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Organization of my make up products is exactly what was missing in my life. I keep all my make up in a big box in my closet and it gets fustrating to keep get it out at times. This organizer is perfect! It is very sturdy and comes in two pieces. I love how you can see through it. I have saw organizers like this but didn&#x27;t get it cause the too little space and compartments just wasn&#x27;t worth it. I can put a lot of my make up in the organizer and even some jewelry cause its very multifunctional. And it makes it easy to also  rotate any of my make up. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space so I can leave it in my bedroom or my bathroom with no problems. I recommend this to anyone that needs a better way to organize their make up or other products that need organization. I&#x27;m gladly leaving my honest opinion for this product that I received.</li>
            <li> This is my SECOND one of these I purchased. They are smaller than i thought but surprisingly fit so much in them!!! I love it and would recommend it to everyone...definitely a great way to keep makeup organized!</li>
            <li> This organizer is well made and very sturdy.  It fits on my bathroom shelf perfectly and keeps my makeup and brushes organized.  I love that it&#x27;s a clear color so I can see into the drawers and know exactly what I have in them.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this awesome makeup organizer!  I&#x27;ve been searching for a decently priced, sturdy, pretty piece to organize my makeup products.  I am thrilled with this product! It&#x27;s the perfect size, is very sturdy, and fits everything I need.&lt;br /&gt;Such a great piece! I can tell I will have this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Love this. My vanity is now organized!! I was very surprised on the weight of this organizer, it is very heavy duty. The best thing is the drawers open and close smoothly (i hate sticky drawers)!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a makeup freak like me and need some organization in your life, this product is the way to go. It&#x27;s inexpensive, sturdy, and spacious. I&#x27;m so satisfied that I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing another one for my sister&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better quality cosmetic organizers I have come across. You get 2 large drawers, 2 small drawers, 12 slots for your lipsticks/lipglosses and several other compact little areas that you can fit perfumes, lotions or other makeup. The acrylic is high quality, I can tell because I&#x27;ve bought several before via Amazon and most have come cracked. The seller is a dream to work with and truly cares about customer service. I highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> Awesome makeup organizer!!! Size was perfect... acrylic sturdy. Bought one for my two daughters. They love them too. Small enough that both can fit on bath vanity. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and organizes my makeup so well! I have so much clutter put away now</li>
            <li> I have a big bulky black makeup case that I use. It&#x27;s like a big black hole that makeup gets lost in and doesn&#x27;t stay organized and is a pain to wash. I have ALOT of makeup and have been looking for something to hold my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; items. I figure I&#x27;ll continue to use the black case for the extras and a spot to rotate items (fall/summer/spring colors). The container store makes acrylic makeup organizers that you have to build on your own. I  just didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on a makeup system without knowing if I was even going to like it. I&#x27;ve seen several people use plastic storage containers for makeup and that wasn&#x27;t for me. Since this is going to sit on my bathroom counter not only does it need to be functional it also needs to look good. This brings me to this organizer. It&#x27;s made with good quality acrylic so you don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to fall apart. The drawers all slide in and out easily making it easy to get to stuff as well as clean and dry it. The top section (where the lipsticks and such go) is not attached to the rest of the container so if you have enough room it can actually sit next to the bottom section thus giving you more space to store creams and serums and such on top. I have a cute brush container so I&#x27;m not using this for my brushes. I&#x27;m attaching 2 photos to show how I have mine organized. I&#x27;m actually thinking of ordering another one to keep downstairs with extra stuff in it. I know I&#x27;ll be ordering for a friend for her birthday. The price point is great.</li>
            <li> This make up organizer is great. I like that it has little drawers, I&#x27;m using this for the makeup I use on a daily basis. I like everything to be organized so this is a really neat product plus it&#x27;s looks really cute upon my counter. Before it took me forever to look for my mascara or lipstick. Now its right in front of me. This organizer is made with strong CLEAR ACRYLIC , it&#x27;s a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7603e5a9815239d1e530dcfed16586dc]]Such a great quality cosmetic organizer and makeup storage! I was very fortunate to receive this for a great deal for review purposes! As you can see in the video, I am not just using this as a makeup storage, I am also using it to store my jewelries. I love the crystal-clear finish which displays my jewelry neatly while it is safely secured in the drawers. You can also remove the top if you want a different look. This is finely made and it does not have that &#x27;cheap&#x27; look. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to provide my honest feedback! If you have jewelries, makeup or just office supplies that needs to be organized and displayed neatly, this is what you need!</li>
            <li> This isomething absolutely an amazing makeup organizer! I really love this so much! It is sturdy holds a lot of makeup! I love that it is clear it makes looking for my favorite items easier to find! Also, my 2 year old doesn&#x27;t get into my makeup as much as when it was just all sitting in a bag! I also find it visually appealing! I will definitely be investing in more of these soon!! I recieven this ateam a discounted price to test and review!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on these before purchasing and this one is ideal.  It&#x27;s quality and sturdiness are perfect plus it looks good as well as functions perfectly for my makeup.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a413cc32255b2355475f0330cfec3e92]] This little cosmetic storage is perfect to fit in my tiny corner space over my toilet counter. I would clutter up all my make up items in a bag but this makeup storage system has made my job so easy and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Its made of acrylic and is clear and transparent which makes it very good looking.It has enough compartments to store every thing that you need. In fact you can even store your jewellery in it.&lt;br /&gt;My cosmetics are very organized. I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> Beautiful acrylic organizer. Really well made, high quality acrylic organizer. It comes in two pieces and there is a ridge on the set of drawers that hold the top piece in place. It&#x27;s spacious and was just what I needed for my makeup. The drawers open easily and had enough room for my palettes, eyeliners and mascaras. The upper piece, held my lipsticks and foundations. It&#x27;s a really great piece and looks beautiful on my vanity. I am happy to recieve this organizer to review. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This organizer is exactly what I was looking for.  It is very sturdy and well made.  The drawers slide out easily and it&#x27;s more spacious than it appears.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is one sturdy piece! picking it up in the box I thought there was just a lot of padding, but it was fit very snugly and all of the weight was from the organizer itself! All edges are smooth which is nice because it won&#x27;t scratch my desk.&lt;br /&gt;It actually comes in two pieces, which is nice if you have a thin shelf you are trying to fit the drawer part on and can use the open section somewhere else. the drawers are quite shallow, but work perfect for my brushes and eye products (mascara, liners, eyebrow pencil, etc.) The top part is great for my face lotion and serums, along with any extra brushes and lipsticks/glosses - right at your fingertips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the quality of this piece - much better than I have seen in beauty stores for close to the same price. This will help keep my daily use makeup/ skincare at my fingertips, instead of fishing through my bag every morning for only the items I want to use that day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by how much this holds based on how little room it takes up on my bathroom sink. I was able to fit all of my makeup in it and now am easily able to find what product and color I&#x27;m searching for. To give you an example, I use one drawer for hair ties and clips, 1 for mascaras, 1 for eye shadow palettes, and 1 for my Bare Minerals loose powder. The top sections I use for lip sticks and glosses, and eye liners as well as facial serums, tinted moisturizers and sample sized products. This organizer has really made my bathroom neater and it sturdy.</li>
            <li> Well constructed with usable-size compartments and drawers. This holds a ton of stuff and I can actually find everything! It&#x27;s solid, not flimsy. I could use one of these in every room of the house.</li>
            <li> My previous review for this was deleted. So, here I am retyping it. This is the nicest acrylic organizer I have used. It is very sturdy, and beautifully crafted. I love the little nobs, making it easier to open. The top sits on, with minimal movement. The spaces are wide enough for my brushes, and small palettes. The drawers are deep enough for my mascara, and thicker eye shadow pencils. I can&#x27;t get over how nice this organizer is. there is enough space for most of my make up! It&#x27;s also very easy to clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> I have tons of makeup and I&#x27;m always looking for a good way to get organized. I&#x27;m a bit OCD and get stressed if I don&#x27;t have my things in order. I recently got the opportunity to try an acrylic cosmetic organizer. This cosmetic organizer has an exclusive injection-mold process that produces a heavy-duty, scratch-free acrylic case with a crystal-clear finish. With the crystal-clear finish, you are able to see through the drawers so you can find everything easily. It&#x27;s actually looks like glass and is very durable. This organizer contains 4 drawers, 12 lipstick holders, and 4 other organized areas for miscellaneous items. Each drawer is one inch deep and has a crystal-clear ball for easy opening. The organizer comes in two parts so you can stack or separate them. The overall size is 9.4 x 5.9 x 7.32. This organizer allows me to get my makeup in order without having to dig through a makeup bag or a box. I can leave this on the counter or simply slide it under the cabinets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer can hold a variety of things other than makeup. Use it for nail accessories, arts and crafts, desk organizer, jewelry and more. You can even separate the two parts and make it into two organizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift. The company makes sure that the organizer is safely packed. The cosmetic organizer comes in a nice box with a handle. Each piece is carefully shrink wrapped and divided with bubble wrap. If you are not completely satisfied, the company offers a 100% money back guarantee. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I&#x27;m so glad I did, now my makeup is all organized!</li>
            <li> Great quality makeup organizer! When I saw this makeup organizer, I just HAD to have it. I have been searching for a visually appealing way to store my chapsticks and eye and lip pencils for quite some time! This organizer has solved ALL of my problems. It is made of very strong plastic that is crystal clear! Absolutely gorgeous.. The drawers open and close easily, and don&#x27;t stick like other organizers I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It is large enough to fit all of the things I&#x27;ve needed it to, and small enough to fit on my vanity! I love that the top part is detachable, so I can split the two up or even stack a second one! It shipped out to me very quickly, and arrived in perfect condition! Not even a scratch on it! It came nicely packaged in a box that kept it super safe during shipment. To top things off, it has passed the test of time. I&#x27;ve had it for some time now and it seriously still looks brand new! Very very pleased with the super high quality of this makeup organizer, and I highly recommend getting one for yourself to organize your makeup hoarding pretties.. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> Built well. Looks nice.</li>
            <li> The product I love but it arrived broken and it came in very poor packaging. The entire back side was broken so the drawers won&#x27;t stay in place. Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:d8215d93b6b4861ba2187f4f71376390]]My vanity has been super messy - makeup all over, no organization to anything and boxes full of random nail tools, lip glosses, makeup brushes, eye shadow duo&#x27;s, tweezers and grooming tools. Plus other odds and ends.. I needed a better way to tidy up - Not by stuffing it away in boxes or drawers where I would never see or use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this cosmetic organizer and knew it would fit perfectly on my vanity/makeup area! The storage unit is very durable and comes in (2) Pieces. The top section can actually be removed and placed separately from the bottom drawer area. The lower part does have little notches on the top of it however that will securely hold the TOP section in place so it isn&#x27;t just going to slide off. I found that to be helpful, and a great feature that sets this organizer apart from the rest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME for holding quite a lot of random girly items! I was very surprised at how much fit inside of this organizer! I was able to put the majority of two boxes I had sitting on my vanity into this storage container. I love that the container is also see-through making it unbelievably easy to quickly locate what I need and most importantly see what I have. Many times have I bought something used it once and then lost it right away in my vanity, to be found months later right before the expiration date. I attached a video to show how I use my makeup storage organizer, I hope you find it helpful! Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> This Organizer is BEAUTIFUL!  It&#x27;s made of heavy acrylic but looks like glass!  It comes in 2 separate pieces so you use it together as one piece or you can seperate the organizer if you wish!  It has 4 drawers, 2 large and 2 smaller. 12 squares, 1 rectangular area 2 smaller rectangular areas. 1 large square in front giving at least 20 spaces for storage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual dimensions of &amp;#34;Usable&amp;#34; space:&lt;br /&gt;TOP drawers: 1&amp;#34; depth, 4&amp;#34; (Side to Side) and just under 5&amp;#34; Front to Back&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Two Drawers Seem to be about the same size: 1&amp;#34; depth, Over 8&amp;#34; side to side and just under 5&amp;#34; Front to Back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawers are great for storing liners, powder, blush, shadow singles, etc. However, the drawers are large enough to also hold long and skinny shadow palettes.  The squares are  perfect for mascara&#x27;s, lipstick, lip gloss, etc.  The rectangular area can be used for all your bigger makeup that doesn&#x27;t fit in the squares, 2 smaller rectangular areas for eyeliners, makeup brushes, etc.  Then 1 larger area for storing perfume, deodorant, nail polish, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 3 drawer cart and all of my makeup was stored inside 1 of the drawers.  I have included a picture of what I had in it and what is left in the drawer and pics of how the organizer can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this organizer.  It would make a fantastic gift for yourself, or since Christmas is coming up, it would be a really nice gift for your teen who is just getting into makeup or for someone who has too much makeup and needs some organization! :)  Can also be a great  back to college gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item complimentary for review purposes for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Received on time and product was packaged well.  This is a great solution to my unorganized makeup bag.  It&#x27;s much easier to find what I&#x27;m looking for with the clear drawers.  This makes my mornings so much easier!</li>
            <li> OMG I can&#x27;t get enough of these acrylic organizers! The best part, they stack with the other models perfectly! Love that the drawers come completely out so you can fill them all the way to the back and then just pull out the drawer you need. Came in great packaging, well protected from damage. *sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> Very nice thick jewelry organizer. I like that it is stackable or I can leave them seperate. Very convenient  in my small cabinets. The drawers slide easily and it looks high quality.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:caa54ee5f6219f66db1f695e530ffa81]] This is one of the best organizers I&#x27;ve used.  The product arrived nicely packaged.  Easy to give as a gift.  I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for awhile and am happy to have received this one.  The size is perfect.  It&#x27;s able to hold a lot of items without taking up much space.  I love how the drawers are clear, making it easy to know where things are at quickly.  I can see this being used for crafts, sewing items and lots of other ideas.  For me, this has made a huge difference in organizing my daily makeup and hair needs.  I&#x27;m already considering purchasing another one for my other bathroom.  Very glad to have this and I definitely recommend it.  I&#x27;ve included this video review of the product.  Please be nice, it&#x27;s one of the first reviews I&#x27;ve submitted this way.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful acrylic makeup organizer. This thing impressed me so much. I own a few other acrylic organizers but they don&#x27;t compare to this one. The other ones I have are dull. This one is super shiny and cut to perfection. The storage is great. The top organizer part is detachable from the drawers which is a nice plus in case you want to have them displayed differently. The top ftis perfectly on the drawer part as the drawers have a little space for the top to fit so it doesn&#x27;t slide around. The drawer handles are easy to grab and pull while others are small and hard to pull open. The drawers pull out nicely. The storage in the drawers is impressive. The top two drawers have a depth of 1&amp;#34;, 4&amp;#34; length, and 5&amp;#34; width. The bottom drawers have the same depth of 1&amp;#34; but they&#x27;re of course 8&amp;#34; in length. The drawers aren&#x27;t very deep at 1&amp;#34; but this is a great organizer to keep your everyday go-to makeup in and display it nicely on your vanity or bathroom counter top. The top detachable part of the organizer has 12 spaces for lipsticks, a spot for larger items like your foundation or moisturizer and deeper spots in the back for eye liners, makeup brushes, primers, or any other thin tubed products you have. I&#x27;m very pleased with this makeup organizer and will be purchasing another once I get a bigger vanity.&lt;br /&gt;Organizer provided by HerPow at a promotional price for testing and review.</li>
            <li> Now if you are anything like me, I can&#x27;t stand for things to be unorganized, it just drives me crazy.  That is because us busy mommies have so much to do, we don&#x27;t have time to hunt around for what we need, and that goes for make up, craft supplies and jewelry.  So when I was given a chance to review this Cosmetic Organizer and Makeup Storage I was very excited to see how much it helped delete some of my unwanted clutter in my bathroom. All I can say is WOW!!! This is the BEST cosmetic organizer I have ever used! It came very well packaged, and in 2 pieces. I don&#x27;t have a lot of make up in my makeup bag, and that is because I have no room. I can not say that anymore, with dimensions of 9.4 x 5.9 x 7.32 and drawer sizes that are 1 inch deep, I have too much storage now. Of course I am sure that I will find something to put in the extra space.&lt;br /&gt;So you don&#x27;t wear makeup? No problem this is such a versatile organizer, you can use it for art supplies, craft supplies, jewelry, the sky is the limit!!! I love that you can use the top for cosmetics, and use the bottom somewhere else if you like for jewelry or what not. You really can not go wrong with this organizer.</li>
            <li> My wife was delighted with this. Looks great and stops her leaving her cosmetics everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really compact but holds a lot of product s really good.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my makeup haul!  The material is nice and sturdy and definitely quality made.  My only wish was that it was bigger.. deeper drawers and just taller and wider in general.  At first glance I was worried that my eyeshadow palettes wouldn&#x27;t fit (Tarte, Stilla, etc.) however they all do!  Although you can&#x27;t stack them on top of each other.  Each has to be stored in their own drawer.  I will be buying another set for the rest of my makeup :)</li>
            <li> This is really well made and looks very nice on my bathroom counter. Only complaint would be the height of the drawers. Would like to have a little more room. Great product regardless!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this organizer!  Not long ago, I purchased a similar organizer to this one, the only major difference between that organizer and this one is the look of the front of the drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also can seperate the organizer if you wish, they are two seperate pieces instead of one large piece!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual dimensions of &amp;#34;Usable&amp;#34; space:&lt;br /&gt;TOP drawers: 1&amp;#34; depth, 4&amp;#34; (Side to Side) and just under 5&amp;#34; Front to Back&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Two Drawers Seem to be about the same size: 1&amp;#34; depth, Over 8&amp;#34; side to side and just under 5&amp;#34; Front to Back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering purchasing this organizer, please be aware of the depth of the drawers so that you can manage expectations.  They aren&#x27;t extremely deep, but depending on the type of products that you need to store, it can give you a lot of storage space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included some pictures so that you can see what this is capable of holding.  The top part of the organizer actually is capable of holding quite a lot of products.  The larger section of the organizer makes it possible to hold skincare items that are larger and usually harder to find good storage space for.  The lipstick section is great to also double for little perfume vials and other small samples you may receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawers are great for storing liners as well as shadow singles, etc.  However, the drawers are large enough to also hold long and skinny shadow palettes.  You larger palettes (ie. Urban Decan Vice palettes, or comparable sized palettes) won&#x27;t fit in the drawers, but they really do work extremely well for the skinner or smaller Too Faced palettes you may have in your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the storage space that this provides for my beauty stuffs.  I have quite a large collection that I&#x27;ve accumulated and it&#x27;s so much prettier to have in one consolidated area versus spread all over the place.  I thihnk the drawer pulls are super cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Sample Provided For Review Purposese!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Sample Provided For Review Purposes</li>
            <li> I love my cosmetic and jewelry case. I like how I can either stack it or set it side by side. It is very organized and looks quite elegant with my stuff in it. It&#x27;s beautiful. It is also easy to clean and sturdy. The drawers slide in and out nicely. I am very happy with my case.</li>
            <li> This is a well-made, sturdy piece that comes well-packaged and easy for gift-giving.  The top piece and bottom drawers are separate units that fit together nicely.  The construction is really solid - I was surprised by how thick the Lucite is.  It&#x27;s large enough to hold a variety of items - basically your daily wear. Plus the drawers are generous enough for instruments, applicators, cotton balls and Q-tips.  It&#x27;s compact enough to fit under the sink of a tiny vanity, which works great for me.  Although it&#x27;s good-looking enough to sit on top of a vanity or bathroom counter, if you have that kind of space (I don&#x27;t, unfortunately).</li>
            <li> Wow wow! That is my first response. I have always used a little rubbermaid to keep my makeup in and this cosmetics organizer is so much easier! I don&#x27;t need to dig to find what I need. This saves me so much time in the morning not having to search. Everything has a spot and is neatly organized I like how sturdy the organizer is I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as great as it is. My daughter keeps trying to steal it I will have to get her one of her own. It&#x27;s well worth it!.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome storage container. It is very durable and sturdy. It easily can hold everything I need and the drawers are easy to slide in and out of their slots. The compartments hold a lot and they fit all my makeup needs. They are deep enough to hold all my brushes upright and easily display them so I can get to them. This is a great professional looking storage container. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a8dfc90d3c54de683cf26200759145dc]]I received this acrylic organizer for review, however it does not effect my unbiased thoughts and opinions. I used this with my makeup collection and was pleased with how it organized my space. This organizer has 4 drawers and several openings for large and smaller products. The acrylic is high quality and feels very strong and the seams of each piece are connected seamlessly. it is also clear and no fogginess to the acrylic. It comes in two pieces which you can stack them on top of each other or use side by side or in separate areas. I like that it can be used in more than one way. The drawers are larger than I expected and slide open and closed easily. A full sized palette can fit into the larger drawers and several lip or eye pencils as well as mascara wands can fit into the smaller drawers. It is also nice if you wanted to place jewelry or even office supplies in your desk. Pens and pencils as well as paper clips or post its will fit in there. You could use the top portion on your vanity and the bottom portion on your desk. I love the versatility of having two separate pieces.</li>
            <li> really sturdy and fits just about anywhere. would definitely recommend it. I got it and it was already put together.</li>
