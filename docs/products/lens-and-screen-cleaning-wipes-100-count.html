            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Good company.  </li>
            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>Radians premoistened towelettes are as good as B &amp; L</li>
            <li>, the price was so good</li>
            <li>It is the perfect way for me to keep my glasses, IPhone, and computer screen clean, and it was delivered so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Good price I guess, and nice fancy packaging like what I&#x27;d want if I were an optician: dispenser box that is wall mountable.  </li>
            <li>They clean wonderfully and the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li>If they care that much to keep me happy, I&#x27;ll put up with a 100 packets in a baggie.  </li>
            <li>I have had the Wipes for about 2 weeks and they are very moist and work great.  </li>
            <li>The wipes leave a nice streak free surface.</li>
            <li>Sure hope that it contained the 100 items as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rocket science wrapped up in a wipe, but it works pretty good and cleans the lenses of my glasses, which is what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>These deliver a streak fee clean!</li>
            <li>These work just fine and 100 uses for a better price.</li>
            <li>Working out great so far.</li>
            <li>When I asked them about  the box they were supposed to be in, they said they&#x27;d do anything I liked to make it right.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Since the shipping was free, that&#x27;s probably why.  </li>
            <li>everyone else has said is spot on, they&#x27;re fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that they come in individual packets, so I can keep some in the car, some in the laptop bag, some at work, etc.  </li>
            <li>As I wear glasses I ordered them for home use and they keep my glasses scratch free as well as clean.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased these wipes to clean the screen on my laptop computer</li>
            <li>I like these glass cleaners they clean my glasses</li>
            <li>I got these to keep in my car to clean the inside of the windshield when it gets filmy.</li>
            <li>but I have also used them to clean my reading glasses and the screen on the TV.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how effectively these towelettes clean glasses.</li>
            <li>That was good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>so im going to order some more next month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these wipes for several years and love them.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I got these is because my boss needed more towellettes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered probably 20 boxes of these and won&#x27;t get any other kind.  </li>
            <li>thanks again amazon</li>
            <li>this is much easier  for me to pull out a wipe  </li>
            <li>A simple way to keep the glasses clean.</li>
            <li>Super product....excellent and large enough for eyeglasses and screens.</li>
            <li>The front panel which flips out for easy access is alot simpler than the other brand,and much easier to access the packets.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used them to clean the exterior of my cell  phone, camera, and remote controls.</li>
            <li>He said the Costco ones were smaller and that he really likes these by Radians, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m ready to give these to him.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have found glasses cleaners that actually work.</li>
            <li>These are the first wipes I&#x27;ve bought in the last 15 years.  </li>
            <li>Pretty low class for a company.</li>
            <li>These create an ultra sharp and ultra clean finish on my glasses.  </li>
            <li>I am completely  paralyzed on my  Whoe</li>
            <li>well- packets were not dried out, and they were sufficient to keep glasses clear.</li>
            <li>It used to be that you could clean glasses with a little water and some Kleenex (which, I am now told, can scratch the lenses).</li>
            <li>open it  as it is wet  to clean  glasses  </li>
            <li>I just got new glasses for reading and distance and shortly after I began wearing them</li>
            <li>I HAVE NO OTHER THING TO SAY</li>
            <li>You can use them on about two to three pairs of glasses before the cloth loses its ability to clean.  </li>
            <li>These lens wipes not only work miraculously, but they come in individually wrapped packets so the wipes never dry out.</li>
            <li>It is as if \\&quot;they\\&quot; took a hand full and placed in a plain ordinary (and not even new) baggie and sent.</li>

            <li> It makes the lens blurry. Not very pleased. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how effectively these towelettes clean glasses. I&#x27;ve also used them to clean the exterior of my cell  phone, camera, and remote controls.

            <li> I like these glass cleaners they clean my glasses good I dont have to use windex anymore and they last for 3 months so im going to order some more next month thanks again amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wipes for several years and love them.  They don&#x27;t dry out in the package (like some others I&#x27;ve tried).

            <li> I am completely  paralyzed on my  Whoe Left  side  my vision was affected  by acident  needing to wear glasses  this is much easier  for me to pull out a wipe  open it  as it is wet  to clean  glasses  sometimes I do my two  pair with one single wipe</li>
            <li> These are great for eyeglasses, phones, etc. I have tried other brands and this one is the best. I will definitely order these again!</li>
            <li> These deliver a streak fee clean!</li>
            <li> This stuff destroys dirt and grease. It&#x27;s like declaring Jihad on grease and dirt. Die dirt. Die grease. It&#x27;s like there is nothing in front of my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> They are good for cleaning glasses and phone screens.  I have noticed some scratching.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have found glasses cleaners that actually work. It used to be that you could clean glasses with a little water and some Kleenex (which, I am now told, can scratch the lenses). I just got new glasses for reading and distance and shortly after I began wearing them it was like looking through a greasy fog. These lens wipes not only work miraculously, but they come in individually wrapped packets so the wipes never dry out. BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rocket science wrapped up in a wipe, but it works pretty good and cleans the lenses of my glasses, which is what I had hoped for.  The company that shipped them, SAFETY TREE SUPPLIES, stuck a 100 packets in a baggie and shipped them that way.  Since the shipping was free, that&#x27;s probably why.  When I asked them about  the box they were supposed to be in, they said they&#x27;d do anything I liked to make it right.  That was good enough for me.  If they care that much to keep me happy, I&#x27;ll put up with a 100 packets in a baggie.  Good stuff.  Good company.  Good service.</li>
            <li> These are the first wipes I&#x27;ve bought in the last 15 years.  I usually just wash with soap and water every other week or so.&lt;br /&gt;What everyone else has said is spot on, they&#x27;re fantastic.  Good price I guess, and nice fancy packaging like what I&#x27;d want if I were an optician: dispenser box that is wall mountable.  The only reason I got these is because my boss needed more towellettes but I couldn&#x27;t find his brand.  I searched around and read the reviews and decided that he&#x27;d like these.  But in the time it took for these to ship, he bought a box from Costco of some other brand.  He said the Costco ones were smaller and that he really likes these by Radians, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m ready to give these to him.</li>
            <li> Working out great so far.</li>
            <li> I got these to keep in my car to clean the inside of the windshield when it gets filmy. They work great for that. No problem so far with any dried out wipes.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and papery.  Do not clean well.  Cannot recommend them.</li>
            <li> Radians premoistened towelettes are as good as B &amp; L the other manufacturer, for half the price. I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about making another purchase when I run low. It will be a little while though, the price was so good I bought four boxes.  The front panel which flips out for easy access is alot simpler than the other brand,and much easier to access the packets.</li>
            <li> Tried these for my glasses and found them to work well- packets were not dried out, and they were sufficient to keep glasses clear.</li>
            <li> Super product....excellent and large enough for eyeglasses and screens. Thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I have had the Wipes for about 2 weeks and they are very moist and work great.  Convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased these wipes to clean the screen on my laptop computer but I have also used them to clean my reading glasses and the screen on the TV. The wipes leave a nice streak free surface. My only complaint is that some of the towelettes were completely dry when the package was opened and rendered useless.</li>
            <li> These create an ultra sharp and ultra clean finish on my glasses.  You can use them on about two to three pairs of glasses before the cloth loses its ability to clean.  These are perfect for plastic coated lenses on my glasses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that they come in individual packets, so I can keep some in the car, some in the laptop bag, some at work, etc.  Usually when I buy a can of these lens wipes, the can dries out before I finish it. These are the way to go for lens/screen cleaners.  No need to buy the more expensive Wet and Dry packs from the Office Stores.  These work just fine and 100 uses for a better price.</li>
            <li> They did arrive a head of time. They are the individual cleaners.....  but they did not come in the box dispenser as shown, but instead in an average zip lock baggie. Sure hope that it contained the 100 items as advertised. It is as if \\&quot;they\\&quot; took a hand full and placed in a plain ordinary (and not even new) baggie and sent. Pretty low class for a company. I will just set the open baggie on the counter for people to reach in and get one! Rather embarrassing, but obviously they do not send out in a dispenser box as advertised.</li>
            <li> We use them at our Fire Dept. and they work great on all our visors etc. As I wear glasses I ordered them for home use and they keep my glasses scratch free as well as clean.</li>
