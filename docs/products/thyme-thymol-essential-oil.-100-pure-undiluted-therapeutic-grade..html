            <li>The internet has great things to say about Plant Therapy as a company, as well as the quality of the their oils, so I decided to give them a shot.</li>
            <li>Great fill-in to use with my doTerra oils.</li>
            <li>just this makes me feel good, and confident that its effect will be very good.  </li>
            <li>used it to get rid of wort , seemed to work good.</li>
            <li>but it did seem to be a good product.</li>
            <li>it is good for athlete foot and nail fungus.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thinking that smelling the bottle might not give the product a fair chance, I sprinkled two drops in my bath water.</li>
            <li>maybe you get good night sleep also</li>
            <li>it smells so good.</li>
            <li>A good value.</li>
            <li>The smell was good.</li>
            <li>The product arrived swiftly and seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li>This oil is very potent.  </li>
            <li>perfect product, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell (like thyme times 100), and it is very potent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a good use for it, but I can&#x27;t imagine what it is quite yet...</li>
            <li>The smell of this stuff is very strong, so I combined it with lime</li>
            <li>Fast service great price.</li>
            <li>(My sister is having nail fungus and have  never been able to fix it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is not the company who boost their image)</li>
            <li>I bought it because it is very helpful with sinus clogging, allergies, and breathing problems, and its&#x27; doing absolutely great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have found  Plant Therapy for my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Thyme oil has been used for many hundreds of years.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of these oils.</li>
            <li>I am sure this works well, but boy does it stink.</li>
            <li>My hair grows an inch and more within a month.</li>
            <li>MAke sure you use this product  in the day time</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy,  their oils and their customer service.</li>
            <li>Love this oil</li>
            <li>So, needs better bottle/drip valve.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping, good product.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this particular oil, but quality seems very good.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many Plant Therapy essential oils and I&#x27;ve been happy with all of them until now.</li>
            <li>It is strong though.</li>
            <li>Its a STRONG scent.</li>
            <li>The thyme does what it is supposed to do, and has a strong scent...not just a hint of thyme.  </li>
            <li>I have discovered that for me this smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>But, I imagine it would suit those who do like that strong smell.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this oil and would recommend it to anyone who loves EO but not at the price the major companies are selling it for.</li>
            <li>I might try the oil produced by other companies to see if there is one as effective as this oil but more pleasant.</li>
            <li>read many good feedback from people who seem to have more experience with Essential Oil</li>
            <li>Again though, this brand has worked out fine for me</li>
            <li>Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important because this oil is so strong.</li>
            <li>Very strong, and can be hot so always use a carrier.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy is an up and coming essential oil company that I trust to have quality oils, and great customer service.  </li>
            <li>Great essential oil to try out!!</li>
            <li>but the smell is  right on and the customer service is doing a close follow up to be sure we are satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use the thyme along with eucalyptus, tea tree, and peppermint to keep my home as well as classroom clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is good for other things</li>
            <li>I purchased this to make my own all natural disinfectant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the purported anti-viral capabilities are real or not, but this when I started inhaling steam with this oil in it, my symptoms took a decided turn for the better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, not too strong (for me) to put directly into my mouth and it seems to help with toenail fungus relatively quickly even in my sporadic application of it.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly and as promised</li>
            <li>It is super potent, only a drop or two is needed in most cases.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a lot of hair growth in a short time , then red thyme is the perfect product.</li>
            <li>Quick relief, and the bottle is well designed.</li>
            <li>And WOW who knew that this stuff could be so potent.</li>
            <li>But totally worth it for the benefits of the oil.</li>
            <li>Nice essential oil.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a great essential oil!  </li>
            <li>This oil may be good for other things, however I would not recommend it for the use of asthma.</li>
            <li>I had a very large ganglion cyst on my wrist.  </li>
            <li>You will need a dropper to apply the oil so it is not wasted or spilled (this stuff has a strong scent /</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how many women have the same problem &amp;#34;no sleeping at night&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I massaged it into the back of my neck and my chest every morning and evening for three days, and felt better than I had in a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several from Plant Therapy &amp; have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing from this company.</li>
            <li>This EO seems to be high quality and was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have done a ton of research on essential oils and was looking for a reliable, lower cost / good quality way to get the essential oils</li>
            <li>Again I have not had this product for very long but first of all I love the smell</li>
            <li>so this thing was pretty much killing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you want a wonderful warm smell of Thyme that you get from a slow cooking stew or something similar then this is way to harsh.</li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade, Sold by Posergy, llc</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I use this on infections and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>And the cost is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil -</li>
            <li>, they were wrapped really well</li>
            <li>reasonable to purchase.</li>
            <li>Intense scent.</li>
            <li>They really need to make this with an attached eye dropper to control the amount you dispense.</li>
            <li>But, based on what I can tell, this stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>You really must dilute it in a carrier oil before applying it, or it will burn your skin.</li>
            <li>i really like the sent</li>
            <li>Too much leaves a burning sensation on the skin.</li>
            <li>I did mix with carrier oil, but the stench is still too much for me to use this product.</li>
            <li>While the smell is very herby it does do its job</li>
            <li>I want that doTerra does not yet carry as well as purchasing larger bottle of the oils I use most frequently (namely Lavender and Peppermint).</li>
            <li>I also love that these are sold and shipped directly from Plant Therapy as everybody warns of tampering and use of fillers in EO&#x27;s sold by third parties.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure it has other applications, but I can recommend it for removing a stubborn wart if you&#x27;ve already tried the OTC removers without luck.</li>
            <li>you really have a reason for buying this particular</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to add too much as it can be strong.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Several of my oils were shipped very fast and all the bottles were packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I developed a plantar wart and tried some OTC wart removers without much luck.</li>
            <li>I totally trust this thyme essential oil from Plant Therapy to use in my own personal blends for its anti-bacterial and anti-biotic properties.</li>
            <li>Very strong and hard to get out of the bottle, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many other bottles of thyme oil of various brands.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand of oil, but this particular scent is gross.</li>
            <li>In general I enjoy trying the various scents of different varieties of thyme.</li>
            <li>strong odor is (or was, at least to him) very offensive.  </li>
            <li>Be extra cautious about essential oil blends, getting a bit of this on your skin really stings!!</li>
            <li>It literally burns skin off of you, naturally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wild and to be used cautiously.</li>
            <li>I can only take it for a couple hours at a time on my foot, then I have to remove the oil from my skin because the scent is bothering me too much.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that these essential oils were reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Completely took care of my daughter&#x27;s plantar&#x27;s warts (all 5 of them) with a q-tip application twice a day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;{I was looking for something to treat toenail fungus after finding the &#x27;Amoresse Thymol&#x27; product Sold by NutraGroup Inc. (NG, Inc.) - To be completely ineffective after 3 months of use.}&lt;br</li>
            <li>But sure enough it killed the wart on the bottom of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product speaks for itself very natural, pure in nature, did what i expected it to do for me</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, and you&#x27;re relatively new to essential oils, I would stay away from this one.</li>
            <li>Would probably go with a different brand next time as it is hard to control how many drops you are using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I started to see improvements after about three weeks, I know that it will take about 6 months to a year of daily application, for the problem to completely clear up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m apparently a wimp</li>
            <li>At first, nothing comes -- then a little gush.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to go to sleep when it&#x27;s fresh on your head</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it has other applications, but I can recommend it for removing a stubborn wart if you&#x27;ve already tried the OTC removers without luck.</li>
            <li> you really have a reason for buying this particular</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to add too much as it can be strong.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Several of my oils were shipped very fast and all the bottles were packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I developed a plantar wart and tried some OTC wart removers without much luck.</li>
            <li> I totally trust this thyme essential oil from Plant Therapy to use in my own personal blends for its anti-bacterial and anti-biotic properties.</li>
            <li> Very strong and hard to get out of the bottle, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many other bottles of thyme oil of various brands.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of oil, but this particular scent is gross.</li>
            <li> In general I enjoy trying the various scents of different varieties of thyme.</li>
            <li> strong odor is (or was, at least to him) very offensive.  </li>
            <li> Be extra cautious about essential oil blends, getting a bit of this on your skin really stings!!</li>
            <li> It literally burns skin off of you, naturally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wild and to be used cautiously.</li>
            <li> I can only take it for a couple hours at a time on my foot, then I have to remove the oil from my skin because the scent is bothering me too much.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that these essential oils were reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Completely took care of my daughter&#x27;s plantar&#x27;s warts (all 5 of them) with a q-tip application twice a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;{I was looking for something to treat toenail fungus after finding the &#x27;Amoresse Thymol&#x27; product Sold by NutraGroup Inc. (NG, Inc.) - To be completely ineffective after 3 months of use.}&lt;br</li>
            <li> But sure enough it killed the wart on the bottom of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product speaks for itself very natural, pure in nature, did what i expected it to do for me</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, and you&#x27;re relatively new to essential oils, I would stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> Would probably go with a different brand next time as it is hard to control how many drops you are using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I started to see improvements after about three weeks, I know that it will take about 6 months to a year of daily application, for the problem to completely clear up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m apparently a wimp</li>
            <li> At first, nothing comes -- then a little gush.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to go to sleep when it&#x27;s fresh on your head</li>
            <li> With the only other option being an expensive surgery, I think the small cost of the Thyme was a great deal.</li>
            <li> The smell is pungent, but the surrounding skin was unaffected, and it only took 2.5 weeks.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell…I&#x27;m not a fan of Thyme as a seasoning, so perhaps this is why the scent of the oil offends me so much.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We will see how long it will work.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> This happened when I put about four drops on the dry spot on my face.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a natural alternative to help remove a small planters wart on my foot.</li>
            <li> I used it on my toenails after filing them down, (all of them, even though I only needed it for one.)</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> After applying Thyme (red) Essential Oil for one and one half months the cyst is hardly noticible.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it did ultimately cure his wort</li>
            <li> have no doubt that the contents of this bottle will kill fungi, or any other living thing that comes in contact with it.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use to stop snoring, but have learned it has other beneficial uses as well.</li>
            <li> I had to cool the spot down with cold water.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help me concoct my own bug repellent</li>
            <li> My toenail finally started coming in without the thickness and peeling, unfortunately, this is RED thyme oil, and it stained my toenails orange.</li>
            <li> The odor tones down after few minutes.</li>
            <li> just a little scrubbing every day for a month.</li>
            <li> I am not very experienced with essential oils, so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell if I&#x27;ve received a quality product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s past 40 minutes and the skin on the spot calmed down.</li>
            <li> I have used prescription thymol in the past and was looking for a cheaper version.</li>
            <li> thing to remember is that things happen slow on the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an unpleasant odor, reminiscent of turpentine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of this red thyme is quite unpleasant.</li>
            <li> So, dispense and apply very small amount and do not use when your feel dryness nor on flaked skin.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s virtually impossible to get only a drop with this bottle.  </li>
            <li> it is no good for room fragrance and to use it for medicinal qualities its going to scare your friends 10 feet</li>
            <li> I was having a tough time.</li>
            <li> Problem is, it smells so bad, your toes will be the least of your worries.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was already in the water.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this product and meets every expectation of 5 star product, including price to value ratio.</li>
            <li> i wanted to buy some EO but sellers for YL and DoTerra were just too expensive.</li>
            <li> It tends to dribble out of the bottle, making it difficult to count drops.</li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I think it looks like nail color from a distance, It doesn&#x27;t look sickly, just tinted, so I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> A disappointment!  </li>
            <li> It has a horrible smell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it for scenting liquid soap. Smells great, and I can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Again I have not had this product for very long but first of all I love the smell just this makes me feel good, and confident that its effect will be very good.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast service great price. This was what we needed.</li>
            <li> This sent is not for wimps! I&#x27;m apparently a wimp it is no good for room fragrance and to use it for medicinal qualities its going to scare your friends 10 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really have a reason for buying this particular sent they you probably don&#x27;t mind. But if you want a wonderful warm smell of Thyme that you get from a slow cooking stew or something similar then this is way to harsh.</li>
            <li> Very strong and hard to get out of the bottle, but it does the job. Would probably go with a different brand next time as it is hard to control how many drops you are using.</li>
            <li> I had a very large ganglion cyst on my wrist.  After applying Thyme (red) Essential Oil for one and one half months the cyst is hardly noticible.  With the only other option being an expensive surgery, I think the small cost of the Thyme was a great deal.</li>
            <li> used it to get rid of wort , seemed to work good. just a little scrubbing every day for a month.</li>
            <li> I use this on infections and it works very well.  I would rather use this than a prescription medicine without side effects.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he has some sort of mole or wort on his foot and I have seen him try lots of different products. And WOW who knew that this stuff could be so potent. It literally burns skin off of you, naturally. It&#x27;s wild and to be used cautiously. Not sure if it did ultimately cure his wort but it did seem to be a good product.</li>
            <li> Order this oil after hearing the from Dr Oz it is good for athlete foot and nail fungus. (My sister is having nail fungus and have  never been able to fix it)&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t try it yet but the smell is  right on and the customer service is doing a close follow up to be sure we are satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I probably will order again from them, want to make homemade Vick Vapo Rub with Fall at our door.&lt;br /&gt;I read many good feedback from people who seem to have more experience with Essential Oil (when there is over 50-1000 feedback I&#x27;m sure it is not the company who boost their image)</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I bought it because it is very helpful with sinus clogging, allergies, and breathing problems, and its&#x27; doing absolutely great.  Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and as promised</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, not too strong (for me) to put directly into my mouth and it seems to help with toenail fungus relatively quickly even in my sporadic application of it. It is strong though. And the cost is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a natural alternative to help remove a small planters wart on my foot. It worked immediately. I&#x27;m totally sold on thyme oil working like a rock star! My only complaint is the smell…I&#x27;m not a fan of Thyme as a seasoning, so perhaps this is why the scent of the oil offends me so much. Its a STRONG scent. I can only take it for a couple hours at a time on my foot, then I have to remove the oil from my skin because the scent is bothering me too much. But totally worth it for the benefits of the oil.</li>
            <li> I like to use a blend of thyme oil and lavender oil in my bath. I&#x27;ve bought many other bottles of thyme oil of various brands. In general I enjoy trying the various scents of different varieties of thyme. That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t buy the brands I&#x27;ve bought before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product doesn&#x27;t smell like any thyme oil I&#x27;ve ever tried. It also doesn&#x27;t smell like any of the varieties of thyme that I&#x27;ve grown in my garden over the years. It&#x27;s an unpleasant odor, reminiscent of turpentine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking that smelling the bottle might not give the product a fair chance, I sprinkled two drops in my bath water. Unfortunately, I was already in the water. A thorough scrubbing in the shower has not removed the stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that the contents of this bottle will kill fungi, or any other living thing that comes in contact with it. If not permitted to return it, I will try using it in a spray for garden pests next summer.</li>
            <li> Snoring&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how many women have the same problem &amp;#34;no sleeping at night&amp;#34; because of husband can snore so laud than we have to go to sleep in living room.&lt;br /&gt;Well put 2 drop of thyme on my husband big toe and ...I was sleeping last night.!!&lt;br /&gt;We will see how long it will work.&lt;br /&gt;Try it maybe you get good night sleep also</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is an up and coming essential oil company that I trust to have quality oils, and great customer service.  I really like this oil - it smells great, and I look forward to using it in some of my homemade blends. I bought it to use to stop snoring, but have learned it has other beneficial uses as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this essential oil for a hair mask and I have to say that these essential oils were reasonably priced, they were wrapped really well so nothing broke in shipping which I greatly appreciate and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I developed a plantar wart and tried some OTC wart removers without much luck. I run 3-4 times a week so this thing was pretty much killing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a home remedy site I read that thyme oil can get rid of warts. Figuring why not, I gave it a shot. It stinks. Bad. But sure enough it killed the wart on the bottom of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it has other applications, but I can recommend it for removing a stubborn wart if you&#x27;ve already tried the OTC removers without luck.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help me concoct my own bug repellent and it did the job that I needed it to do!</li>
            <li> Works for us. Nothing wrong with this product and meets every expectation of 5 star product, including price to value ratio.</li>
            <li> I was under the misconception that this could be applied topically to the skin!  It burned like fire.  I will have to study to see how I can use it without pain!!</li>
            <li> Tried this for a wart but stings and did not work for me. I&#x27;m sure it is good for other things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to have found  Plant Therapy for my essential oils.  reasonable to purchase. A good value. Hope this helps someone else.</li>
            <li> I totally trust this thyme essential oil from Plant Therapy to use in my own personal blends for its anti-bacterial and anti-biotic properties.</li>
            <li> I was having a tough time. i wanted to buy some EO but sellers for YL and DoTerra were just too expensive. I am happy with this oil and would recommend it to anyone who loves EO but not at the price the major companies are selling it for.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff is very strong, so I combined it with lime (I used fractionated coconut oil as a carrier). They work fantastically together! I massaged it into the back of my neck and my chest every morning and evening for three days, and felt better than I had in a week.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many Plant Therapy essential oils and I&#x27;ve been happy with all of them until now. The smell of this red thyme is quite unpleasant. I personally would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thyme oil has been used for many hundreds of years. I saw this product on a health program on TV. I have used it on skin tags and they go away. The oil can also be use for nail fungus. it is applied to the surface of nails.  The Chinese and Egyptian people  have used this for over a thousand years. Dr. Oz has a program on this product and its&lt;br /&gt;benifits.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of these oils. I&#x27;ve purchased several from Plant Therapy &amp; have always been satisfied. I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Please use caution with all essential oils. This oil was a lot stronger than the regular thyme oil I buy from another name brand company.</li>
            <li> I feel this is a very good quality EO.</li>
            <li> In the war against toenail fungus, this is supposed to help.  Problem is, it smells so bad, your toes will be the least of your worries.  No thanks.</li>
            <li> Great for making chest vapor rubs. Intense scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help get rid of fungus on nails on my feet from being Diabetic.  Hope this will combat it.  If so I will purchase  mo</li>
            <li> this product speaks for itself very natural, pure in nature, did what i expected it to do for me i will definitely use this product again, and offer it to my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;NOVELY</li>
            <li> I am sure this works well, but boy does it stink.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping, good product.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product to deal with a nail fungus. I have used prescription thymol in the past and was looking for a cheaper version. This is not it. This product burns my skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as an anti-fungal agent. Bummer.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing from this company. I got several different oils.  I like the smaller sizes and the price is great.  They had every oil I was looking for that I needed for my recipe.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of oil, but this particular scent is gross. Is it just me? It smells like chemical. If you&#x27;re like me, and you&#x27;re relatively new to essential oils, I would stay away from this one. I&#x27;m sure there is a good use for it, but I can&#x27;t imagine what it is quite yet... Again though, this brand has worked out fine for me, it&#x27;s just this scent.</li>
            <li> Completely took care of my daughter&#x27;s plantar&#x27;s warts (all 5 of them) with a q-tip application twice a day. The smell is pungent, but the surrounding skin was unaffected, and it only took 2.5 weeks. I will use again for the same problem if it occurs!</li>
            <li> Oooh!!  A disappointment!  Bought it for my son to use for wart removal.&lt;br /&gt;The strong odor is (or was, at least to him) very offensive.  Thus, he&lt;br /&gt;chose not to use the product.  May have worked....but????&lt;br /&gt;Product packaged well, and arrived in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Just smelly!</li>
            <li> This product, has been working well to treat toenail fungus:&lt;br /&gt;Thyme (red) Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade, Sold by Posergy, llc (Plant Therapy Essential Oils)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{I was looking for something to treat toenail fungus after finding the &#x27;Amoresse Thymol&#x27; product Sold by NutraGroup Inc. (NG, Inc.) - To be completely ineffective after 3 months of use.}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing to remember is that things happen slow on the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep this in mind It you are treating nail fungus:&lt;br /&gt;While I started to see improvements after about three weeks, I know that it will take about 6 months to a year of daily application, for the problem to completely clear up. - I hope this helps others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the bottle the &#x27;Amoresse Thymol&#x27; came in to store this Red) Thyme oil... Because it has a dropper... You will need a dropper to apply the oil so it is not wasted or spilled (this stuff has a strong scent / odor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... Get a dropper bottle somewhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps too!.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make my own all natural disinfectant. I use the thyme along with eucalyptus, tea tree, and peppermint to keep my home as well as classroom clean. No worries about chemicals around the kids.</li>
            <li> Wife is using EO for variety of purposes.  This EO seems to be high quality and was shipped quickly.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This thyme oil is great. It is super potent, only a drop or two is needed in most cases. Be extra cautious about essential oil blends, getting a bit of this on your skin really stings!!</li>
            <li> This oil is very potent.  You only need a drop.  But it&#x27;s virtually impossible to get only a drop with this bottle.  At first, nothing comes -- then a little gush.  They really need to make this with an attached eye dropper to control the amount you dispense.</li>
            <li> I bought this produce to help me with my asthma. I was told if you  put thyme oil in a vaporizer it can help soothe the lungs. well this irritated my lungs. even just opening the bottle irritates my lungs. I almost had an asthma attack. This oil may be good for other things, however I would not recommend it for the use of asthma.</li>
            <li> perfect product, exactly what I wanted. excellent delivery, good price</li>
            <li> Great for killing fungus. I used it on my toenails after filing them down, (all of them, even though I only needed it for one.) My toenail finally started coming in without the thickness and peeling, unfortunately, this is RED thyme oil, and it stained my toenails orange. I think it looks like nail color from a distance, It doesn&#x27;t look sickly, just tinted, so I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. I suspect soaking in peroxide or wiping with a diluted bleach may lighten it, but I don&#x27;t want to try that.</li>
            <li> I am not very experienced with essential oils, so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell if I&#x27;ve received a quality product.  But, based on what I can tell, this stuff is the real deal.  It has a very strong smell (like thyme times 100), and it is very potent.  You really must dilute it in a carrier oil before applying it, or it will burn your skin.</li>
            <li> Great oil. Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> Remember the aftershave scene in the movie Home Alone? Literally I had the same facial expression as  Macaulay Culkin in that scene. This happened when I put about four drops on the dry spot on my face. I felt burning and stinging sensation immediately and instantly swelled! I had to cool the spot down with cold water. It&#x27;s past 40 minutes and the skin on the spot calmed down. So, dispense and apply very small amount and do not use when your feel dryness nor on flaked skin. Although it seems to help as antibacterial on my skin, you have to control the amount and get used to the smell. It may upset your stomach. I feel sort of nauseous every time I open the cap. The odor tones down after few minutes. I might try the oil produced by other companies to see if there is one as effective as this oil but more pleasant.</li>
            <li> texture and smell are correct - works well as part of mosquito repellant alongside peppermint and lavender</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a lot of hair growth in a short time , then red thyme is the perfect product. My hair grows an inch and more within a month. The only problem is when you put this on your scalp it goes to work immediately and feels like something is beating up your scalp but I guess that is the stimulating properties going to work. MAke sure you use this product  in the day time cause it&#x27;s hard to go to sleep when it&#x27;s fresh on your head</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the purported anti-viral capabilities are real or not, but this when I started inhaling steam with this oil in it, my symptoms took a decided turn for the better. Quick relief, and the bottle is well designed.</li>
            <li> Nice essential oil. I use it in my shampoo as it helps with hair growth and it smells great. Just be careful not to add too much as it can be strong.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy,  their oils and their customer service. I use the the thyme oil to thicken my hair. I mixed it in with grape and hemp oils, massage into my scalp, let set, then wash out. Very strong, and can be hot so always use a carrier.</li>
            <li> Love this oil i really like the sent</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a great essential oil!  The thyme does what it is supposed to do, and has a strong scent...not just a hint of thyme.  Thank you for a quality product.</li>
            <li> This product serves its purpose and I definitely would recommend this product to family and friends. This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> When I received the bottle, it was leaking. It wasn&#x27;t too bad. The smell was good. Will update on how well it works.</li>
            <li> Helped stop my hubby&#x27;s snoring! But... it doesn&#x27;t day &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; anywhere on the bottle as claimed on here.</li>
            <li> The product arrived swiftly and seems to be good quality. It tends to dribble out of the bottle, making it difficult to count drops. That&#x27;s important because this oil is so strong. Too much leaves a burning sensation on the skin. So, needs better bottle/drip valve. Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil to try out!!</li>
            <li> It has a horrible smell. I can&#x27;t even give my bottle away. I did mix with carrier oil, but the stench is still too much for me to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have done a ton of research on essential oils and was looking for a reliable, lower cost / good quality way to get the essential oils I want that doTerra does not yet carry as well as purchasing larger bottle of the oils I use most frequently (namely Lavender and Peppermint). The internet has great things to say about Plant Therapy as a company, as well as the quality of the their oils, so I decided to give them a shot. Several of my oils were shipped very fast and all the bottles were packaged very well. This is the first time I have used this particular oil, but quality seems very good. Great fill-in to use with my doTerra oils. I also love that these are sold and shipped directly from Plant Therapy as everybody warns of tampering and use of fillers in EO&#x27;s sold by third parties.</li>
            <li> I have discovered that for me this smell is too strong. Not favorable. Does it smell like Thyme? yes. Would I personally buy it again ? NO. But, I imagine it would suit those who do like that strong smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for greasy hair in the shower. While the smell is very herby it does do its job</li>
