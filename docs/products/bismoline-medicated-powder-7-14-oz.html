            <li>I love it, love it, love it.  </li>
            <li>Great, smooth texture, doesn&#x27;t feel cakey (is that a word?) and has a lovely gentle smell - a hint of roses - that doesn&#x27;t smell anything like normal &#x27;baby-scented&#x27; products which makes it great for adults.</li>
            <li>I have used Bismoline for many years and find it to be an outstanding medicated powder product, particularly here in South Carolina.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping</li>

            <li>I was recently in the hospital and the staff loved it and have never seen anything keep the skin so nicely dry and heal up little rashes and such so quickly.  </li>
            <li>While being medicated it is still gentle enough to use for every diaper change.</li>
            <li>Bismoline works really well for me on prickly heat, minor rashes and skin discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I am a large lady and have to keep all the creases and folds dry.  </li>

            <li> The best. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This does not clump and get sticky like a lot of powders do. I have used it for my son and now am using it for my daughter who just had diaper rash that did not go away with all my other creams. I am never without this!!!! I can buy it at a store in my area for about the same price as here. It&#x27;s worth paying the shipping if you have no other option.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years for myself, kids etc- it is awesome.. smoth as silk, works wonders and has a smell that is delicious but not feminine or too fruity,  GREAT STUFF- BUY IT</li>
            <li> Simply the best talc on the market. I use it instead of deodorant. Feel clean and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Great, smooth texture, doesn&#x27;t feel cakey (is that a word?) and has a lovely gentle smell - a hint of roses - that doesn&#x27;t smell anything like normal &#x27;baby-scented&#x27; products which makes it great for adults.</li>
            <li> I get heat rash on my belly and chest, always have. I remembered Bismoline from my younger years, and finally got some. Rash is gone!</li>
            <li> Bismoline works really well for me on prickly heat, minor rashes and skin discomfort.  The scent is much lighter than that of another medicated powder, and it seems to me that I do not have to reapply as often with Bismoline.</li>
            <li> As far as a powder is concerned this one is the only I will buy. It has currently replaced my baby powder after trying almost every diaper I could find and still having my son allergic to them a friend recommended this powder. Within a couple uses his allergy was clearing up. While being medicated it is still gentle enough to use for every diaper change.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and hard to find.  It took entirely too long to receive it.  I think it was close to a month.  I won&#x27;t order from this group again.</li>
            <li> Its the best for any skin issues even infants dosent cake up and soothing.i have used it since I was a child as did my mother.</li>

I am also an RN.</li>
