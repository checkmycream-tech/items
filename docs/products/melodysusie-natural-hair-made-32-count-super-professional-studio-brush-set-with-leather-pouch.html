            <li>great variety of brushes...</li>
            <li>a great buy at a great price</li>
            <li>There is a great selection of sizes/shapes of brushes in this set...but the quality is NOT what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>Great gift.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS A VERY NICE SET OF BRUSHES.  </li>
            <li>This is over all a very nice product.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality brushes as well.</li>
            <li>The pouch can be very handy while traveling and can hold a lot.</li>
            <li>Luv d brushes they come in very handy in anything</li>
            <li>:) I think it&#x27;s a great starter kit for her to become a wonderful make-up artist.</li>
            <li>now all of my make up goes on with a brush and this dynomite set from amazon is the best available to get the job done!</li>
            <li>I love the wonderful leather case they come in.</li>
            <li>Love it perfect kit.</li>
            <li>They are not the best makeup brushes but they are okay</li>
            <li>even though the selection is great, the quality isnt great... wish i got something better.</li>
            <li>So if your looking for good quality then look else where.</li>
            <li>They are a good quality brush, i haven&#x27;t used them yet though.</li>
            <li>the brushes are good and they do the job.</li>
            <li>The tools used do not matter if you are good at what you do.</li>
            <li>Price was good, planning on refilling when run out of pro</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good for glitter shadows.</li>
            <li>so they are not so good for blending eyeshadows, the rest are good... for the price</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved these brushes i have no complaints about the item itself</li>
            <li>She says they are good quality brushes</li>
            <li>My daughter loved these as they were a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The price is good but the brushes didnt met my expectations.</li>
            <li>Quality is just as good as Mac or Bobbi Brown brushes.  </li>
            <li>Good afternoon.</li>
            <li>This was a purchase for my daughter who really loved this item.</li>
            <li>There are a ton of good quality brushes in this set.</li>
            <li>mineral makeup needs a good brush set like this one...</li>
            <li>I read the good reviews on these brushes and thought that they should be fairly good for their price.</li>
            <li>But if you want good brushes for a good price, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for someone in Cosmotology school and she loved it.</li>
            <li>good carry case..</li>
            <li>The foundation and concealer brush in this set work good.</li>
            <li>Though I haven&#x27;t not used the makeup brushes the quality of them when they arrived felt good.</li>
            <li>I think I made a good buy...</li>
            <li>I used the brushes and loved the way they applied my make up..</li>
            <li>This is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>All in all the large variety is amazing, the sleek look is awesome and the price is incredible.</li>
            <li>I am able to apply makeup beautifully with these brushes...</li>
            <li>Great brush pouch, very light.</li>
            <li>but like I said they work great for blending :)</li>
            <li>but this is great someone who want to become better at make-up, as I.</li>
            <li>IM A 30+ YEAR HAIR AND MAKE-UP PERSON, AND IVE WORKED WITH MANY DIFF PRODUCTS, THESE ARE GREAT QUALITY AND</li>
            <li>and I must say I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>As my first set of pro brushes, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did buy it!</li>
            <li>The price and how many you get make this irresistible!  </li>
            <li>Fabulous set of brushes!!  </li>
            <li>I love these brushes, I would recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li>Strong brushes and great pouch.</li>
            <li>the brushes are nice and do not shed there are so many!</li>
            <li>These brushes are very nice, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>these brushes are amazing, some of them arent as well made as the rest</li>
            <li>Otherwise great brushes for cheap price.</li>
            <li>Not so good quality but ok</li>
            <li>But the presentation was nice.</li>
            <li>I gave this set as a gift and the recipient was thrilled with them.</li>
            <li>ok what is good about it said it will come the 15</li>
            <li>If you are just looking for a nice set to start off with or to have i would say go for it.</li>
            <li>... they are nice but the bristles are not the softest.</li>
            <li>These seem to be great brushes and love the fact that there are so many.</li>
            <li>But nice.</li>
            <li>Brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>and her sister actually liked it</li>
            <li>nice assortment of brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice just not the quality I wanted.</li>
            <li>Really nice quality and pouch.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These came sooner than I had planned and were in perfect condition (being new).  </li>
            <li>and i can live with it not being perfect.</li>
            <li>They are good quality, easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition and it&#x27;s awesome all the brushes that I have for only $15.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, perfect gift especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>they are ok ,but  sometimes the hair  is coming out :),but is a really good price for this amount of brushes</li>
            <li>It smells like plastic and leather and it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>but most of them are fantastic i love them!!</li>
            <li>and i feel in love 32 brushes and they are amazing</li>
            <li>But these are amazing :)</li>
            <li>They still kind of smell, but it&#x27;s ok now.</li>
            <li>So yeah, I think they are a very good brushes, but definitely need a good washing before use.</li>
            <li>I love the brush roll that comes with this set: it folds up nicely and keeps the brushes protected and safe.  </li>
            <li>Some brushes are good some of the brushes are made of really cheap material but for $20 I didn&#x27;t expect something outstanding</li>
            <li>the brushes i received were very cheap and some of them were bent.</li>
            <li>Very cheap price for the amount of brushes</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>There are a lot more brushes in this set than I would have ever thought about using.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the brushes is top notch.  </li>
            <li>It is so cheap!</li>
            <li>These brushes are okay they came on time and appeared as they did in the pic however the bristles tend to come off on my clients face.</li>
            <li>They get the job done but would be better if the bristles stayed on brush</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I will say the leather case is okay</li>
            <li>Many choices in brushes and the eyeshadow and and powders go on so well with them.</li>
            <li>I guess you can&#x27;t expect more for the price.</li>
            <li>Who could ask or need anything more?</li>
            <li>I wouldve been happier if the brushes that i use the most didnt start breaking.</li>
            <li>because I was so pleased by the results I had with a set I ordered at the beginning of the year.</li>
            <li>And I would most definetly recommend this product to my friends..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not shocking.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely happy it arrived so fast</li>
            <li>i recomend it you will love them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>She is absolutely in love with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I chose these.</li>
            <li>but I love doing makeup</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>

            <li>YOU RECEIVE MANY BRUSHES IN THIS SET</li>
            <li>i love this item.</li>
            <li>These are better than my Estee Lauder set (those frizzed and became brittle.)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t review an item that never arrived - wasn&#x27;t sure until yesterday which brand it was - talked to the person I gave the set to for Christmas</li>
            <li>---I &#x27;m sure this was on my statement -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more for gifts for friends.</li>
            <li>I spend more time rubbing off my makeup along w the shredded bristles.</li>
            <li>i bougt the brushes and was realy pleased with the majority of the product.</li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t a really good quality but for beginners I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The style of brushes were more than I imagined.  </li>
            <li>not too much more to say no problems worked out</li>
            <li>a okay .</li>
            <li>way better than i thought they would be...</li>
            <li>makeup goes on more even with these...</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are a big plus and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I purchased this pouch because I wanted more eyeshadow brushes and why not get the set?</li>
            <li>I love the leather pouch it came in</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better service or better brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>.. make sure u wash them before using them..</li>
            <li>Product okay.</li>
            <li>I have had the pack for over a year and is still enjoying the brushes.</li>
            <li>The makeup brush set it okay</li>
            <li>There are so many brushes of varying sizes.  </li>
            <li>I had bought these brushes thinking that they might be a better quality than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Most of the powder went flying into the floor</li>
            <li>They work great other than that and the case is great for keeping them together.</li>
            <li>my girl was soooo excited when she got these awesome professional make up brushes, she loves them.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing and even if you don&#x27;t like them as well as your MAC brushes, they are cheap and easy to replace. . ..</li>
            <li>these are pretty good...</li>
            <li>The case is nice and the brushes are really cool.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a professional or just for fun.  </li>
            <li>I got my brushes quick the case was nice</li>
            <li>Although it comes with a strong smell of chemical which is ok and tolerable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes themselves are nice and soft and there is a good variety.  </li>
            <li>well its pretty good, but i dont really know how to see if its made by good materials, or hair?..</li>
            <li>well good thing is that u get lots of brushes for a cheap price right?</li>
            <li>From the pictures, my wife thought the brushes would have been more fine.</li>
            <li>i thought, must not be very good for actual make up applying!</li>
            <li>This is a great gift for a young girl.</li>
            <li>and the brushes are great and soft.  </li>
            <li>ive never owned any real brushes before, and i have to say thease are beautiful, they are soft and apear to be well made, the case has a nice stylish look to it.  </li>
            <li>and I think this is a great price for a complete set for a non professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, easy payment, good product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li>the brush&#x27;s hair came out so easily.</li>
            <li>It was easy to fix though.</li>
            <li>I used a makeup brush shampoo to clean them and maybe make them softer, but the bristles became mangled and even more brittle.</li>
            <li>Really strong chemical smell when you it up...</li>
            <li>When you receive it, smells strongly of rubber.</li>
            <li>She is absolutely thrilled with them and the shipping was much faster than I thought!</li>
            <li>it is really nice and soft, the number of brushes made it easier for me and more interesting to apply my make up..</li>
            <li>They wash up quite well and, after drying, they are good as new.  </li>
            <li>i never notice there are so many different kind of those brushes!</li>
            <li>s fine to</li>
            <li>but they work just fine</li>
            <li>they are fine (not all of them)</li>
            <li>Shipped quick!</li>
            <li>SO I JUST NEEDED A CHEAP BRUSH SET</li>
            <li>and then these are fantastic.</li>
            <li>They work well and are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>The synthetic material of the bristles are easy to clean and resistant to staining.  </li>
            <li>and she confirmed that she got the Coastal Scents set</li>
            <li>pouch does smell like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Some brushes required a bit of trimming if you&#x27;re that precise about how a brush should look like</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and came extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>Other wise I love it!</li>
            <li>said that they were good quality and will order more in the future thanks!!!</li>
            <li>not as nice of quality as i expected kind of cheap looking and feeling brushes.</li>
            <li>Although these brushes may not be \\&quot;professional\\&quot; like they state in the description, for 22 brushes its worth the 13 bucks!</li>
            <li>Just got them today, I was so excited to get them, before any usage the bristles were already coming out and the handles were chiped .</li>
            <li>I got this set for Christmas and was pretty excited since there were so many.</li>
            <li>When I got them, I was so excited, until I opened up the roll...</li>
            <li>it comes in a pretty case i love</li>
            <li>I just got my brushes today and was excited to see them.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I got all of these brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to WASH the brushes first to get out all of the dye and chemical smell out of them.</li>
            <li>but hopefully after i clean them it won&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li>My wife was simple thrilled when I gifted this to her.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean it</li>
            <li>The vinyl (NOT LEATHER) case is cheap; the ties quickly fell apart.</li>
            <li>i love all the multi-brushes with individual plastic covering and their own pouch to be in.</li>
            <li>She was pleasantly surprise, hey, i definitely benefited from it......</li>
            <li>all was great, product worked as expected and required.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I&#x27;m really digging the variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good for an extra set..</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t blend well that we&#x27;ll or pick up product good enough for make up application</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good daily use brush set.  </li>
            <li>Arrived early and is nice and neat.</li>
            <li>Really reliable and precise brushes!</li>
            <li>Honestly don&#x27;t expect a professional brush set..</li>
            <li>Good part is there was a big variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>Good starter kit, but definitely not something I would ever consider buying again or recommending to a friend.</li>
            <li>Not bad for price</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t shed too much after I washed them the first time and they clean very easily.</li>
            <li>sure to wash/soak your brushes in warm to hot water and soap before you use them--it will help get out the red dye that is on some of the brush heads--so it won&#x27;t end up on your or your client&#x27;s face!</li>
            <li>But other than that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>but i enjoy my set very much.</li>
            <li>MORE THEN NORMAL BRUSHES.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and arrived exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>Sure it sounds like I can live without one brush</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty good value for the price.</li>
            <li>First off, the STINK!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this package, it took about a month to ship, and when I opened the package it straight up smelled like hazard chemicals!</li>
            <li>but these brushes are competitive and are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>worth the buy.</li>
            <li>They were bigger than i imagined and the casing was nice.</li>
            <li>But for the price (smile)</li>
            <li>The organizer is nice, but the brushes are definitely lacking.</li>
            <li>Some of the face brushes are useful, but bristles still fall out all the time.</li>
            <li>The first use i experienced a little fall out but</li>
            <li>The case makes them easy to transport and that came in handy on my recent vacation and will probably come in handy when I move in a few months.</li>
            <li>I WASHED THEM RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>But you get what u paid for right...</li>
            <li>go right ahead and get these.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t need this many because I&#x27;m not a gigantic makeup wearer, however I love these brushes because they were cheaper than some other sets that I saw and they had more brushes.  </li>
            <li>when you first get it they smell freshly painted and it doesn shed some.</li>
            <li>I had tried to grab some from my pallet and sweep it into the top of my hand and you could barely see anything.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great just as describe the bag smells like plastic but not too bad and really good for the money</li>
            <li>The leather case was nice and soft and the brushes were soft.  </li>
            <li>They were described as soft brushes, however, sand paper I think would be more gentle on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The larger brushes were all had lower quality bristles than the smaller brushes but they all had very nice stems.</li>
            <li>There is still nothing quite as satisfying as splurging on a new fabulous brush, but this collection is affordable and high quality and gives you a great basic set of brushes to cover all of the basics as well as a few specialty applications and are durable and will work for a variety of uses.</li>
            <li>Wrong they are perfect.</li>
            <li>You can buy better for the same price.</li>
            <li>well,was i shocked to open up this beautiful set of 32 brushes, stored in this just as beautiful leather pouch.</li>
            <li>So many different brushes I can use...</li>
            <li>but this was the first time I decided to try out a set of brushes with a brush roll.  </li>
            <li>and they are finally getting better.</li>
            <li>The eye brushes have worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>They include many different sizes along with a case for storage.</li>
            <li>The brush hairs were much more coarse than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Brushes are not neatly tirmed the are bushy and kind of rough ...</li>
            <li>Would recommend washing it hot water before use ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality of the brushes: You do have to wash them first, just leave them in the sink for an hour.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this kit is going to be a big help for me.</li>
            <li>and it works very well for blending/applying/anything you need to do for makeup!</li>
            <li>but if I paid for a set, I expect a whole set!</li>
            <li>I recently lost all my make up though, so I have not been able to use them yet.</li>
            <li>Many of the brushes are the same.</li>
            <li>Amaizing, my wife was speechless when she saw them the first time, but when they arrive, I can&#x27;t describe how she reacted, this product is amaizing.</li>
            <li>Shed consistently.</li>
            <li>So many different shapes and sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li>I use them every day ;)</li>
            <li>Some of the bristle was falling out the first time I used it .</li>
            <li>It is well worth the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My order was on time, product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>only thing that would make it better would be if came with an insurt that explaind what each brush was and how to use it.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 16 and this is her first make up brush set.</li>
            <li>but they smell funny</li>
            <li>the big brushes could been better but the small brushes are good..</li>
            <li>Other than that i enjoy using these brushes, since i got so many for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Upon arrival, they were clean and soft, then I started using them.</li>
            <li>These are middle of the line quality, they are no M.A.C. set, but that is good enough for me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing you will look like a real Hollywood Startlet!</li>
            <li>Other then that they are amazing high quality brushes for their price!</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft..</li>
            <li>The small brushes had very nice bristles (realy shiny and soft)</li>
            <li>Having such a large number of brushes on hand at one time allows you to do multiple makeup applications without having to clean or sanitize-a fresh set for each person!!</li>
            <li>I liked having a large variety of brushes to choose from but there are a few things I did not like about this product.</li>
            <li>I did see some of the hair fall out but not too much.</li>
            <li>My overall experience of buying was also fantastic....</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>I know have to save again for a gentle set of brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be really helpful.</li>
            <li>the shed wayy too much</li>
            <li>some hair fallout but not to much the blending brush works well.</li>
            <li>Its fun with all the different brushes and a teenage girl would love this.</li>
            <li>But I did not expect much anyway.</li>
            <li>Very concerned to use it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it myself, but she seems to really like it.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li>i saw they were cheaply made i wouldnt recommend this to anyone i only got it cause my friend wanted this set</li>
            <li>Blend very well for the price they cost me.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to any make-up artist!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Got two playsation batteries instead like really??</li>
            <li>i waited like 2 weeks and come to find out they made a mastake with my package with play station batteries really?</li>
            <li>Shipped fast  also</li>
            <li>but I have found cheaper brushes that don&#x27;t shed as much.</li>
            <li>It smelled very chemical-y or something.</li>
            <li>you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t have a real problem with hairs coming off brush except 2 brushes i don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t be really wasting much money.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for brushes to practice with or don&#x27;t care about makeup that much, then</li>
            <li>She really loves the set</li>
            <li>i really like it anyway.</li>
            <li>the blush brush tends to shed a lot, and the foundation brush doesn&#x27;t blend the product very well.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This set is amazing..there is so much to choose from.</li>
            <li>The brushes were very disapointing coz</li>
            <li>and I would not recommend this set to anyone who wants quality.</li>
            <li>Pleanty of different sizes for different uses, and the case is nice.</li>
            <li>Quality not Quantity!!!Although this brush set comes with many brushes the quality is really bad.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the brushes are really rough.</li>
            <li>This product contains a few face brushes which doesn&#x27;t come in handy</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll just save up the money for soft better brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying individual brushes here and there for a long time (MAC brushes are my favorite splurge!)</li>
            <li>I have not used this long enough to judge the durability of it, but it is a big variety and would be absolutely perfect for those who are just starting out in makeup or just want to keep things on a budget!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s fake leather, which is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to open it.</li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m in love being a long time user of Mac and Sephora Professional Studio brushes</li>
            <li>Some have said that the hairs fall out easily with these sets but after testing them for myself, I haven&#x27;t found a single lost hair -not even on the face brushes-.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently airing it out and am getting ready to give the brushes a quick washing with a recipe I got from makeup guru Michelle Phan.</li>
            <li>They are soft and work pretty well for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes before brush was good but this order was not good ani</li>
            <li>Not a big deal for me since the are full.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited at the beginning, but when I picked the first brush the little hairs started falling off.</li>
            <li>They, very quickly, became brittle and rough.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be getting top quality brushes when your paying such a low price.</li>
            <li>decent brush set for money paid.</li>
            <li>Never have I found such a fantastic makeup kit with so many applicators for so little money!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed much at all, and are also very soft.</li>
            <li>I DID EXPECT THEM TO BE A LITTLE BETTER QUALITY.</li>
            <li>Was just hopin for a little more</li>
            <li>As I expected, the brushes are fairly cheaply made.</li>
            <li>These brushes work great , just as well as my expensive ones.</li>
            <li>This product is far from what is described I am very un-happy</li>
            <li>the material is so cheap n rough...</li>
            <li>Use these brushes on occasion; I rarely get dressed up enough to use them.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I definitely want to get my moneys worth out of them..</li>
            <li>I currently recieved my brushes and must say that its worth the price.</li>
            <li>There were many brushes on my set that had uneven bristles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone is totally right about the smell when you open the package!  </li>
            <li>and i had to pay 50 dollars to ship them right back ..</li>
            <li>It wipes down easily if you get makeup all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i like my new brushes..</li>
            <li>The eyebrow/eyelash brush head popped off the first time I used it, but after a little super glue it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft -with</li>
            <li>but nothing I haven&#x27;t seen in some others very soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and don&#x27;t appear to shed at all.  </li>
            <li>they use them daily and like them very much.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your time or your money!</li>
            <li>Have I had better brushes in the past yes</li>
            <li>A lot of brushes are exactly the same but come on people</li>
            <li>the case that the brushed come in, have a funny smell.</li>
            <li>is because the hair shed a bit but only the first time i used them.</li>
            <li>The paste brushes are sooo soft and I have not had any shedding!</li>
            <li>I bought for the first time on one piece Next time 2 and those 2 were</li>
            <li>Use your money to buy a smaller, softer, higher end set.</li>
            <li>but I seem to notice that when I use the super soft bristles they hang on to more makeup (less makeup on my face) and dont last as long also they do not shed their bristles.</li>
            <li>Will last for a very long time and with so many different sizes, you won&#x27;t need anything else!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only certain brush&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Especially the large brushes for powder and foundation, bristles fall out and some bristles are uneven!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but luckily, I can replace it when other brushes in the pouch.</li>
            <li>The brush its totally disapointed coz the material is so cheap n rough...</li>
            <li>Thankfully though it&#x27;s nothing that cant be fixed.</li>
            <li>I gave them to my 3 year old to play with I</li>
            <li>Soft bristle</li>
            <li>But Im 30 and for everyday brushes, they&#x27;re cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Then the &amp;#34;soft hair&amp;#34; is about as soft as sandpaper on your lids.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money unless youve got both to spare</li>
            <li>Shipped directly from China and smells like chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft to the touch and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin</li>
            <li>bros i order this for early bday presnt  </li>
            <li>they are really soft</li>
            <li>BY FAR.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup student and</li>
            <li>it just surprised me.</li>
            <li>I bought them to replace my old ones, but now I kinda miss them.</li>
            <li>NOTHING WORKS LIKE NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li>the case is nice but has a kind of an odd smell, but it is very faint.</li>
            <li>The only downside I found is ,I would like to see more of the super soft bristle brushes and less of the various sized harder brushes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these brushes to anyone who wants a very broad range of brushes to use for quite a low price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice if youre not a professional and just use for personal everyday makeup.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes, which are all black, are way better in comparison to the larger brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall, a decent companion to my MUA Kit.  </li>
            <li>It comes in big, medium and small brushes for better application.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend especially for someone into make-up and brushes.</li>
            <li>So I expected a little more from these brush set according to the reviews I had read on them.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the overwhelming plastic/moth-ball smell of the case that seems to get on everything.</li>
            <li>I love these brush&#x27;s they feel heavy not like hollow or a plastic type feeling</li>
            <li>The one downfall but not a big deal is that some of the brissels on the face brushes are left on my face after haha</li>
            <li>Only have a small problem, some of the hair on some of brushes come off easily.</li>
            <li>I mean, its cool that i now have a million make up brushes, esp the eye brushes, but they arent very soft at all.  </li>
            <li>Most important they don&#x27;t hold any product, I&#x27;m so disappointed</li>
            <li>All of the brushes in the sets density are all the same way to soft.</li>
            <li>My wife was surprised by the amount of brushes that actually come with this package.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I have been spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on brushes from big names for years.</li>
            <li>I actually got this product 3 days early</li>
            <li>The bristles fall out all the time and they are really hard to clean.</li>
            <li>the exception of a few which are meant to be more stiff than the others- and came neatly wrapped in individual plastic coverings.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, and only have minimal shedding (1-3 hairs on only some brushes)</li>
            <li>If you need a set of extra not great quality then this should work fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them pretty extensively with very little fiber fallout.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>

            <li> they are awesome!</li>

            <li> great variety of brushes...</li>
            <li> a great buy at a great price</li>
            <li> There is a great selection of sizes/shapes of brushes in this set...but the quality is NOT what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> Great gift.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY NICE SET OF BRUSHES.  </li>
            <li> This is over all a very nice product.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality brushes as well.</li>
            <li> The pouch can be very handy while traveling and can hold a lot.</li>
            <li> Luv d brushes they come in very handy in anything</li>
            <li> :) I think it&#x27;s a great starter kit for her to become a wonderful make-up artist.</li>
            <li> now all of my make up goes on with a brush and this dynomite set from amazon is the best available to get the job done!</li>
            <li> I love the wonderful leather case they come in.</li>
            <li> Love it perfect kit.</li>
            <li> They are not the best makeup brushes but they are okay</li>
            <li> even though the selection is great, the quality isnt great... wish i got something better.</li>
            <li> So if your looking for good quality then look else where.</li>
            <li> They are a good quality brush, i haven&#x27;t used them yet though.</li>
            <li> the brushes are good and they do the job.</li>
            <li> The tools used do not matter if you are good at what you do.</li>
            <li> Price was good, planning on refilling when run out of pro</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for glitter shadows.</li>
            <li> so they are not so good for blending eyeshadows, the rest are good... for the price</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved these brushes i have no complaints about the item itself</li>
            <li> She says they are good quality brushes</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these as they were a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The price is good but the brushes didnt met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Quality is just as good as Mac or Bobbi Brown brushes.  </li>
            <li> Good afternoon.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my daughter who really loved this item.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of good quality brushes in this set.</li>
            <li> mineral makeup needs a good brush set like this one...</li>
            <li> I read the good reviews on these brushes and thought that they should be fairly good for their price.</li>
            <li> But if you want good brushes for a good price, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone in Cosmotology school and she loved it.</li>
            <li> good carry case..</li>
            <li> The foundation and concealer brush in this set work good.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t not used the makeup brushes the quality of them when they arrived felt good.</li>
            <li> I think I made a good buy...</li>
            <li> I used the brushes and loved the way they applied my make up..</li>
            <li> This is a good deal.  </li>
            <li> All in all the large variety is amazing, the sleek look is awesome and the price is incredible.</li>
            <li> I am able to apply makeup beautifully with these brushes...</li>
            <li> Great brush pouch, very light.</li>
            <li> but like I said they work great for blending :)</li>
            <li> but this is great someone who want to become better at make-up, as I.</li>
            <li> IM A 30+ YEAR HAIR AND MAKE-UP PERSON, AND IVE WORKED WITH MANY DIFF PRODUCTS, THESE ARE GREAT QUALITY AND</li>
            <li> and I must say I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> As my first set of pro brushes, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did buy it!</li>
            <li> The price and how many you get make this irresistible!  </li>
            <li> Fabulous set of brushes!!  </li>
            <li> I love these brushes, I would recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li> Strong brushes and great pouch.</li>
            <li> the brushes are nice and do not shed there are so many!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazing, some of them arent as well made as the rest</li>
            <li> Otherwise great brushes for cheap price.</li>
            <li> Not so good quality but ok</li>
            <li> But the presentation was nice.</li>
            <li> I gave this set as a gift and the recipient was thrilled with them.</li>
            <li> ok what is good about it said it will come the 15</li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a nice set to start off with or to have i would say go for it.</li>
            <li> ... they are nice but the bristles are not the softest.</li>
            <li> These seem to be great brushes and love the fact that there are so many.</li>
            <li> But nice.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> and her sister actually liked it</li>
            <li> nice assortment of brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice just not the quality I wanted.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality and pouch.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These came sooner than I had planned and were in perfect condition (being new).  </li>
            <li> and i can live with it not being perfect.</li>
            <li> They are good quality, easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition and it&#x27;s awesome all the brushes that I have for only $15.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, perfect gift especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> they are ok ,but  sometimes the hair  is coming out :),but is a really good price for this amount of brushes</li>
            <li> It smells like plastic and leather and it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> but most of them are fantastic i love them!!</li>
            <li> and i feel in love 32 brushes and they are amazing</li>
            <li> But these are amazing :)</li>
            <li> They still kind of smell, but it&#x27;s ok now.</li>
            <li> So yeah, I think they are a very good brushes, but definitely need a good washing before use.</li>
            <li> I love the brush roll that comes with this set: it folds up nicely and keeps the brushes protected and safe.  </li>
            <li> Some brushes are good some of the brushes are made of really cheap material but for $20 I didn&#x27;t expect something outstanding</li>
            <li> the brushes i received were very cheap and some of them were bent.</li>
            <li> Very cheap price for the amount of brushes</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> There are a lot more brushes in this set than I would have ever thought about using.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes is top notch.  </li>
            <li> It is so cheap!</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay they came on time and appeared as they did in the pic however the bristles tend to come off on my clients face.</li>
            <li> They get the job done but would be better if the bristles stayed on brush</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I will say the leather case is okay</li>
            <li> Many choices in brushes and the eyeshadow and and powders go on so well with them.</li>
            <li> I guess you can&#x27;t expect more for the price.</li>
            <li> Who could ask or need anything more?</li>
            <li> I wouldve been happier if the brushes that i use the most didnt start breaking.</li>
            <li> because I was so pleased by the results I had with a set I ordered at the beginning of the year.</li>
            <li> And I would most definetly recommend this product to my friends..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not shocking.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely happy it arrived so fast</li>
            <li> i recomend it you will love them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> She is absolutely in love with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I chose these.</li>
            <li> but I love doing makeup</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> ok so heres the cons and</li>
            <li> Perfect for a christmas present.</li>
            <li> Im glad this was what i chose among the others.</li>
            <li> So many to choose from that there is no way</li>
            <li> my girl love</li>
            <li> I love my brushes.</li>
            <li> YOU RECEIVE MANY BRUSHES IN THIS SET</li>
            <li> i love this item.</li>
            <li> These are better than my Estee Lauder set (those frizzed and became brittle.)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review an item that never arrived - wasn&#x27;t sure until yesterday which brand it was - talked to the person I gave the set to for Christmas</li>
            <li> ---I &#x27;m sure this was on my statement -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more for gifts for friends.</li>
            <li> I spend more time rubbing off my makeup along w the shredded bristles.</li>
            <li> i bougt the brushes and was realy pleased with the majority of the product.</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t a really good quality but for beginners I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The style of brushes were more than I imagined.  </li>
            <li> not too much more to say no problems worked out</li>
            <li> a okay .</li>
            <li> way better than i thought they would be...</li>
            <li> makeup goes on more even with these...</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are a big plus and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this pouch because I wanted more eyeshadow brushes and why not get the set?</li>
            <li> I love the leather pouch it came in</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better service or better brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> .. make sure u wash them before using them..</li>
            <li> Product okay.</li>
            <li> I have had the pack for over a year and is still enjoying the brushes.</li>
            <li> The makeup brush set it okay</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes of varying sizes.  </li>
            <li> I had bought these brushes thinking that they might be a better quality than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Most of the powder went flying into the floor</li>
            <li> They work great other than that and the case is great for keeping them together.</li>
            <li> my girl was soooo excited when she got these awesome professional make up brushes, she loves them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and even if you don&#x27;t like them as well as your MAC brushes, they are cheap and easy to replace. . ..</li>
            <li> these are pretty good...</li>
            <li> The case is nice and the brushes are really cool.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a professional or just for fun.  </li>
            <li> I got my brushes quick the case was nice</li>
            <li> Although it comes with a strong smell of chemical which is ok and tolerable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes themselves are nice and soft and there is a good variety.  </li>
            <li> well its pretty good, but i dont really know how to see if its made by good materials, or hair?..</li>
            <li> well good thing is that u get lots of brushes for a cheap price right?</li>
            <li> From the pictures, my wife thought the brushes would have been more fine.</li>
            <li> i thought, must not be very good for actual make up applying!</li>
            <li> This is a great gift for a young girl.</li>
            <li> and the brushes are great and soft.  </li>
            <li> ive never owned any real brushes before, and i have to say thease are beautiful, they are soft and apear to be well made, the case has a nice stylish look to it.  </li>
            <li> and I think this is a great price for a complete set for a non professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, easy payment, good product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li> the brush&#x27;s hair came out so easily.</li>
            <li> It was easy to fix though.</li>
            <li> I used a makeup brush shampoo to clean them and maybe make them softer, but the bristles became mangled and even more brittle.</li>
            <li> Really strong chemical smell when you it up...</li>
            <li> When you receive it, smells strongly of rubber.</li>
            <li> She is absolutely thrilled with them and the shipping was much faster than I thought!</li>
            <li> it is really nice and soft, the number of brushes made it easier for me and more interesting to apply my make up..</li>
            <li> They wash up quite well and, after drying, they are good as new.  </li>
            <li> i never notice there are so many different kind of those brushes!</li>
            <li> s fine to</li>
            <li> but they work just fine</li>
            <li> they are fine (not all of them)</li>
            <li> Shipped quick!</li>
            <li> SO I JUST NEEDED A CHEAP BRUSH SET</li>
            <li> and then these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> They work well and are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> The synthetic material of the bristles are easy to clean and resistant to staining.  </li>
            <li> and she confirmed that she got the Coastal Scents set</li>
            <li> pouch does smell like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Some brushes required a bit of trimming if you&#x27;re that precise about how a brush should look like</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and came extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> Other wise I love it!</li>
            <li> said that they were good quality and will order more in the future thanks!!!</li>
            <li> not as nice of quality as i expected kind of cheap looking and feeling brushes.</li>
            <li> Although these brushes may not be \\&quot;professional\\&quot; like they state in the description, for 22 brushes its worth the 13 bucks!</li>
            <li> Just got them today, I was so excited to get them, before any usage the bristles were already coming out and the handles were chiped .</li>
            <li> I got this set for Christmas and was pretty excited since there were so many.</li>
            <li> When I got them, I was so excited, until I opened up the roll...</li>
            <li> it comes in a pretty case i love</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes today and was excited to see them.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got all of these brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to WASH the brushes first to get out all of the dye and chemical smell out of them.</li>
            <li> but hopefully after i clean them it won&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li> My wife was simple thrilled when I gifted this to her.</li>
            <li> I tried to clean it</li>
            <li> The vinyl (NOT LEATHER) case is cheap; the ties quickly fell apart.</li>
            <li> i love all the multi-brushes with individual plastic covering and their own pouch to be in.</li>
            <li> She was pleasantly surprise, hey, i definitely benefited from it......</li>
            <li> all was great, product worked as expected and required.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I&#x27;m really digging the variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for an extra set..</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t blend well that we&#x27;ll or pick up product good enough for make up application</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good daily use brush set.  </li>
            <li> Arrived early and is nice and neat.</li>
            <li> Really reliable and precise brushes!</li>
            <li> Honestly don&#x27;t expect a professional brush set..</li>
            <li> Good part is there was a big variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> Good starter kit, but definitely not something I would ever consider buying again or recommending to a friend.</li>
            <li> Not bad for price</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t shed too much after I washed them the first time and they clean very easily.</li>
            <li> sure to wash/soak your brushes in warm to hot water and soap before you use them--it will help get out the red dye that is on some of the brush heads--so it won&#x27;t end up on your or your client&#x27;s face!</li>
            <li> But other than that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> but i enjoy my set very much.</li>
            <li> MORE THEN NORMAL BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and arrived exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> Sure it sounds like I can live without one brush</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good value for the price.</li>
            <li> First off, the STINK!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this package, it took about a month to ship, and when I opened the package it straight up smelled like hazard chemicals!</li>
            <li> but these brushes are competitive and are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> worth the buy.</li>
            <li> They were bigger than i imagined and the casing was nice.</li>
            <li> But for the price (smile)</li>
            <li> The organizer is nice, but the brushes are definitely lacking.</li>
            <li> Some of the face brushes are useful, but bristles still fall out all the time.</li>
            <li> The first use i experienced a little fall out but</li>
            <li> The case makes them easy to transport and that came in handy on my recent vacation and will probably come in handy when I move in a few months.</li>
            <li> I WASHED THEM RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> But you get what u paid for right...</li>
            <li> go right ahead and get these.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t need this many because I&#x27;m not a gigantic makeup wearer, however I love these brushes because they were cheaper than some other sets that I saw and they had more brushes.  </li>
            <li> when you first get it they smell freshly painted and it doesn shed some.</li>
            <li> I had tried to grab some from my pallet and sweep it into the top of my hand and you could barely see anything.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great just as describe the bag smells like plastic but not too bad and really good for the money</li>
            <li> The leather case was nice and soft and the brushes were soft.  </li>
            <li> They were described as soft brushes, however, sand paper I think would be more gentle on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The larger brushes were all had lower quality bristles than the smaller brushes but they all had very nice stems.</li>
            <li> There is still nothing quite as satisfying as splurging on a new fabulous brush, but this collection is affordable and high quality and gives you a great basic set of brushes to cover all of the basics as well as a few specialty applications and are durable and will work for a variety of uses.</li>
            <li> Wrong they are perfect.</li>
            <li> You can buy better for the same price.</li>
            <li> well,was i shocked to open up this beautiful set of 32 brushes, stored in this just as beautiful leather pouch.</li>
            <li> So many different brushes I can use...</li>
            <li> but this was the first time I decided to try out a set of brushes with a brush roll.  </li>
            <li> and they are finally getting better.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes have worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> They include many different sizes along with a case for storage.</li>
            <li> The brush hairs were much more coarse than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Brushes are not neatly tirmed the are bushy and kind of rough ...</li>
            <li> Would recommend washing it hot water before use ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality of the brushes: You do have to wash them first, just leave them in the sink for an hour.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this kit is going to be a big help for me.</li>
            <li> and it works very well for blending/applying/anything you need to do for makeup!</li>
            <li> but if I paid for a set, I expect a whole set!</li>
            <li> I recently lost all my make up though, so I have not been able to use them yet.</li>
            <li> Many of the brushes are the same.</li>
            <li> Amaizing, my wife was speechless when she saw them the first time, but when they arrive, I can&#x27;t describe how she reacted, this product is amaizing.</li>
            <li> Shed consistently.</li>
            <li> So many different shapes and sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li> I use them every day ;)</li>
            <li> Some of the bristle was falling out the first time I used it .</li>
            <li> It is well worth the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My order was on time, product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> only thing that would make it better would be if came with an insurt that explaind what each brush was and how to use it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 16 and this is her first make up brush set.</li>
            <li> but they smell funny</li>
            <li> the big brushes could been better but the small brushes are good..</li>
            <li> Other than that i enjoy using these brushes, since i got so many for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, they were clean and soft, then I started using them.</li>
            <li> These are middle of the line quality, they are no M.A.C. set, but that is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing you will look like a real Hollywood Startlet!</li>
            <li> Other then that they are amazing high quality brushes for their price!</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft..</li>
            <li> The small brushes had very nice bristles (realy shiny and soft)</li>
            <li> Having such a large number of brushes on hand at one time allows you to do multiple makeup applications without having to clean or sanitize-a fresh set for each person!!</li>
            <li> I liked having a large variety of brushes to choose from but there are a few things I did not like about this product.</li>
            <li> I did see some of the hair fall out but not too much.</li>
            <li> My overall experience of buying was also fantastic....</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> I know have to save again for a gentle set of brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be really helpful.</li>
            <li> the shed wayy too much</li>
            <li> some hair fallout but not to much the blending brush works well.</li>
            <li> Its fun with all the different brushes and a teenage girl would love this.</li>
            <li> But I did not expect much anyway.</li>
            <li> Very concerned to use it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it myself, but she seems to really like it.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li> i saw they were cheaply made i wouldnt recommend this to anyone i only got it cause my friend wanted this set</li>
            <li> Blend very well for the price they cost me.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to any make-up artist!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Got two playsation batteries instead like really??</li>
            <li> i waited like 2 weeks and come to find out they made a mastake with my package with play station batteries really?</li>
            <li> Shipped fast  also</li>
            <li> but I have found cheaper brushes that don&#x27;t shed as much.</li>
            <li> It smelled very chemical-y or something.</li>
            <li> you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t have a real problem with hairs coming off brush except 2 brushes i don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be really wasting much money.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for brushes to practice with or don&#x27;t care about makeup that much, then</li>
            <li> She really loves the set</li>
            <li> i really like it anyway.</li>
            <li> the blush brush tends to shed a lot, and the foundation brush doesn&#x27;t blend the product very well.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This set is amazing..there is so much to choose from.</li>
            <li> The brushes were very disapointing coz</li>
            <li> and I would not recommend this set to anyone who wants quality.</li>
            <li> Pleanty of different sizes for different uses, and the case is nice.</li>
            <li> Quality not Quantity!!!Although this brush set comes with many brushes the quality is really bad.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the brushes are really rough.</li>
            <li> This product contains a few face brushes which doesn&#x27;t come in handy</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll just save up the money for soft better brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying individual brushes here and there for a long time (MAC brushes are my favorite splurge!)</li>
            <li> I have not used this long enough to judge the durability of it, but it is a big variety and would be absolutely perfect for those who are just starting out in makeup or just want to keep things on a budget!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s fake leather, which is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to open it.</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m in love being a long time user of Mac and Sephora Professional Studio brushes</li>
            <li> Some have said that the hairs fall out easily with these sets but after testing them for myself, I haven&#x27;t found a single lost hair -not even on the face brushes-.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently airing it out and am getting ready to give the brushes a quick washing with a recipe I got from makeup guru Michelle Phan.</li>
            <li> They are soft and work pretty well for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes before brush was good but this order was not good ani</li>
            <li> Not a big deal for me since the are full.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited at the beginning, but when I picked the first brush the little hairs started falling off.</li>
            <li> They, very quickly, became brittle and rough.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to be getting top quality brushes when your paying such a low price.</li>
            <li> decent brush set for money paid.</li>
            <li> Never have I found such a fantastic makeup kit with so many applicators for so little money!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed much at all, and are also very soft.</li>
            <li> I DID EXPECT THEM TO BE A LITTLE BETTER QUALITY.</li>
            <li> Was just hopin for a little more</li>
            <li> As I expected, the brushes are fairly cheaply made.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great , just as well as my expensive ones.</li>
            <li> This product is far from what is described I am very un-happy</li>
            <li> the material is so cheap n rough...</li>
            <li> Use these brushes on occasion; I rarely get dressed up enough to use them.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I definitely want to get my moneys worth out of them..</li>
            <li> I currently recieved my brushes and must say that its worth the price.</li>
            <li> There were many brushes on my set that had uneven bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone is totally right about the smell when you open the package!  </li>
            <li> and i had to pay 50 dollars to ship them right back ..</li>
            <li> It wipes down easily if you get makeup all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i like my new brushes..</li>
            <li> The eyebrow/eyelash brush head popped off the first time I used it, but after a little super glue it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft -with</li>
            <li> but nothing I haven&#x27;t seen in some others very soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and don&#x27;t appear to shed at all.  </li>
            <li> they use them daily and like them very much.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your time or your money!</li>
            <li> Have I had better brushes in the past yes</li>
            <li> A lot of brushes are exactly the same but come on people</li>
            <li> the case that the brushed come in, have a funny smell.</li>
            <li> is because the hair shed a bit but only the first time i used them.</li>
            <li> The paste brushes are sooo soft and I have not had any shedding!</li>
            <li> I bought for the first time on one piece Next time 2 and those 2 were</li>
            <li> Use your money to buy a smaller, softer, higher end set.</li>
            <li> but I seem to notice that when I use the super soft bristles they hang on to more makeup (less makeup on my face) and dont last as long also they do not shed their bristles.</li>
            <li> Will last for a very long time and with so many different sizes, you won&#x27;t need anything else!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only certain brush&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Especially the large brushes for powder and foundation, bristles fall out and some bristles are uneven!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but luckily, I can replace it when other brushes in the pouch.</li>
            <li> The brush its totally disapointed coz the material is so cheap n rough...</li>
            <li> Thankfully though it&#x27;s nothing that cant be fixed.</li>
            <li> I gave them to my 3 year old to play with I</li>
            <li> Soft bristle</li>
            <li> But Im 30 and for everyday brushes, they&#x27;re cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Then the &amp;#34;soft hair&amp;#34; is about as soft as sandpaper on your lids.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money unless youve got both to spare</li>
            <li> Shipped directly from China and smells like chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft to the touch and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin</li>
            <li> bros i order this for early bday presnt  </li>
            <li> they are really soft</li>
            <li> BY FAR.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup student and</li>
            <li> it just surprised me.</li>
            <li> I bought them to replace my old ones, but now I kinda miss them.</li>
            <li> NOTHING WORKS LIKE NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li> the case is nice but has a kind of an odd smell, but it is very faint.</li>
            <li> The only downside I found is ,I would like to see more of the super soft bristle brushes and less of the various sized harder brushes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these brushes to anyone who wants a very broad range of brushes to use for quite a low price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice if youre not a professional and just use for personal everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes, which are all black, are way better in comparison to the larger brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall, a decent companion to my MUA Kit.  </li>
            <li> It comes in big, medium and small brushes for better application.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend especially for someone into make-up and brushes.</li>
            <li> So I expected a little more from these brush set according to the reviews I had read on them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the overwhelming plastic/moth-ball smell of the case that seems to get on everything.</li>
            <li> I love these brush&#x27;s they feel heavy not like hollow or a plastic type feeling</li>
            <li> The one downfall but not a big deal is that some of the brissels on the face brushes are left on my face after haha</li>
            <li> Only have a small problem, some of the hair on some of brushes come off easily.</li>
            <li> I mean, its cool that i now have a million make up brushes, esp the eye brushes, but they arent very soft at all.  </li>
            <li> Most important they don&#x27;t hold any product, I&#x27;m so disappointed</li>
            <li> All of the brushes in the sets density are all the same way to soft.</li>
            <li> My wife was surprised by the amount of brushes that actually come with this package.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I have been spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on brushes from big names for years.</li>
            <li> I actually got this product 3 days early</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out all the time and they are really hard to clean.</li>
            <li> the exception of a few which are meant to be more stiff than the others- and came neatly wrapped in individual plastic coverings.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, and only have minimal shedding (1-3 hairs on only some brushes)</li>
            <li> If you need a set of extra not great quality then this should work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them pretty extensively with very little fiber fallout.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive these brushes, but once I got them, I was totally and completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> A lot of them loose a lot of bristles even when used with a lot of care and no rough movements.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I would be advised of is the picture doesn&#x27;t really show that the brush hair is different colors - black and red.</li>
            <li> i like having the option of so many brushes, but they leave little hairs behind when i used them, so that was a bummer.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not very soft.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; set is not very professional.</li>
            <li> The brushes range from soft to firm and fills any brush need.</li>
            <li> I am not professional</li>
            <li> the brush is not soft</li>
            <li> I just hope this wont shed for a long time once it is washed.  </li>
            <li> The bristles DO fall out and the face brushes are completely not usable bc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed make up brushes for a long time.</li>
            <li> so I bought two with one missing in action</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional &amp; ordered these for two of my granddaughters.....</li>
            <li> Secondly, they&#x27;re not the brushes in the picture, they are all black and extremely synthetic looking, and feeling (the brushes in the picture have brown in them and look pretty soft) which is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> some brushes r soft and some r stiff or not soft</li>
            <li> bristles are not too stiff nor soft as some reviews state.</li>
            <li> Also, the length of the handles are really long!</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are soft to the hand but hard on the face, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very rough (especially the foundation brushes that you are rubbing all over your face).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to keep cleaning the same few brushes I have to use different colors!</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough not soft at all.</li>
            <li> I now have brushes that don&#x27;t loose their bristles nor break the heads off.  </li>
            <li> Frustrated I had tried out most of the other brushes and figured they were all the same.</li>
            <li> The brushes are what u pay for the large brushes, powder brush , blending brushes, shed and poorly made.</li>
            <li> Only thing they shed a little</li>
            <li> When they were washed, the bigger brushes shed a little.</li>
            <li> I would just like to say that these brushes are not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are of medium quality--not too soft, but not too hard.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint was that some of the brushes are a little too soft for application techniques.</li>
            <li> They were all synthetic which was what I expected.</li>
            <li> The are rough and hurt my face and made my makeup look streaky.</li>
            <li> some of them the brush is rough and the brush hair falls out every time I wash it</li>
            <li> But just open it and leave it for a few hours</li>
            <li> I guess they were rougher than expected.</li>
            <li> I never really use them bc</li>
            <li> I really do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> brushes feel too rough for skin.</li>
            <li> and when it does shed it&#x27;s usaully not much</li>
            <li> Not very well made.  </li>
            <li> not much i would recommend these brushes to everyone</li>
            <li> My order arrived sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> But the only reason i did not give it 5 stars besides the occasional shedding is because when i opended the package this very very bad chemicle type smell came out of it, it made me wonder if the brush&#x27;s were safe for using but the brush&#x27;s themselves did not smell just the pouch they were in</li>
            <li> the brushes were stiff and coarse.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a lil stiff, they definitely get the job done.</li>
            <li> I really just needed the case and not the brushes but for that price I decided that I might as well have some new brushes and worst come to worst throw away the ones I don&#x27;t want, but for personal use they&#x27;re actually very good!</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews said they were way too rough.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is becuase the case is a little smelly!</li>
            <li> , I DIDNT EXPECT MAC OR SIGMA QUALITY BRUSHES, HOWEVER FROM THE OTHER REVIEW</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to my lack of brushes.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have a smell like other brushes like this that I have ordered also.</li>
            <li> I usually use Mac brushes and decided to get this kit just to have some extra brushes to use.  </li>
            <li> 3 other brushes are lose and about to break...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with any &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell like some people from other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other uses for some of my brushes since I wont be using all of them..</li>
            <li> But I am unfortunately going to have to buy a different brush set to actually use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I put other things in it like my mascara and lip stick.</li>
            <li> They were not exactly what I thought they would be</li>
            <li> Just not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The pouch is actually pretty neat and mine did not have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I was horribly wrong, the first danger sign was the smell that this product emitted when I had taken it out of the plastic wrapping in came in.</li>
            <li> ( very rough too)</li>
            <li> Very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> Very rough for putting makeup on someone&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are a little rough</li>
            <li> Besides that the handles felt cheap and the case was badly made.</li>
            <li> not worth the wait or the purchase</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Only complaint..</li>
            <li> Looks expensive fior a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I only use a select few of them because the 12 eye shadow brushes are either really stiff and harsh or brittle and the hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> dont let it bring u down a dro</li>
            <li> Eventually the chemical smell will die down or I&#x27;ll get use to it,</li>
            <li> it does not hace eyeshadow brushes, but a lot of concealer brushes, they are all flat and hard</li>
            <li> several months back, an in store makeup saleswoman applied my foundation with a brush, telling me how much expensive product i was wasting with my sponge.  </li>
            <li> slightly Substandard solve this problem</li>
            <li> Slight smell from the leather but not a problem.</li>
            <li> In person, all the brushes are black and nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> only reason why this set did not receive 5 stars from me is due to the strong odor of the case, it was horrible!</li>
            <li> The unfortunate thing is that I can&#x27;t do anything about it as to getting a replacement brush or exchanging it for a new set.</li>
            <li> I like the set because they even come with little plastic guards to make the brushes stay in the correct shapes.  </li>
            <li> Little pieces of the brush tend to come off onto your face when you use it .</li>
            <li> I was impress and a little overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them they were rough and hard</li>
            <li> I gave these to my three year old to play with and destroy bc they are useless as can be.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t buy these then you will be missing out.</li>
            <li> I made that mistake with a few of them.</li>
            <li> The tips were uneven and just not what you would want out of everyday make up brushes.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I notice that I was missing a brush.</li>
            <li> This just completely killed my mood.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but all of the brushes lost a few bristles uopn opening.</li>
            <li> My brushes had chunks of wood missing from my brushes and would be scared to buy again.</li>
            <li> I attempted to use a few of the brushes and the bristles kept coming out and were all over my face.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal</li>
            <li> My biggest problems with it though are that the larger brushes are not soft at all, and they shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> Also, the bag didn&#x27;t stink near as bad as some of the other complainer reviewers.</li>
            <li> i was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> now, i have always applied some of my make up with brushes, usually eye shadow, and blush, as well as finishing powder.  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the product however if you like that</li>
            <li> A unbelievable value.</li>
            <li> The hairs are too slick and don&#x27;t hold any powder.</li>
            <li> It does come with various brushes, some useless though.</li>
            <li> If you want practical and not stylish, give them a try.</li>
            <li> Not very good for applying shadow</li>
            <li> They are too hard on the face.</li>
            <li> I washed them at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> faint smell, not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> People complaining about the smell are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The smell is really not horrible, I don&#x27;t know why people hate it that bad.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about them is the odor.</li>
            <li> Yeah, when you open it it dies smell bad.</li>
            <li> That was strike one for me; next I was testing them out to see how bad the shedding was and never in my life</li>
            <li> some brushes were uneven and fake feeling</li>
            <li> And first of the chemical smell was really bad!!!</li>
            <li> First off, they smell terrible, but that fades I suppose.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really tough.  </li>
            <li> and I find that the hair in the brushes seem to fall out while I am using them, causing them to get caught in my eyelashes or, worse, in my eyes.</li>
            <li> i got these brushes they are absolute terrible.</li>
            <li> If that didn&#x27;t happen, I would definitely give then a 5 star review, but I really hate it when the hair falls off and stays on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are of the lowest quality, lower than dollar store stuff and one came in broken.</li>
            <li> My mom was not happy either seeing the house still smells from it</li>
            <li> SORRY THIS SUCKS.</li>
            <li> the quality is bad and the brushes are hard as sandpaper on skin.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSHES AND BRUSH ROLL SMELL AWFUL WHEN YOU OPEN THE!</li>
            <li> even after wash its still the same i would not buy or recommend these brushes they are unbelievably terrible.</li>
            <li> and i mean it was really bad</li>
            <li> They are very poor quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are rough, the bristles fall out and they smell horrible!!</li>
            <li> brushes r so expensive!</li>
            <li> but if you do what you can to prevent that, things are not too bad.</li>
            <li> i whould recomend this to any one it is so fantactic and dont lisin to some bad reviews</li>
            <li> I heard really bad reviews about the smell</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not all that bad.</li>
            <li> they have a bad smell to them....</li>
            <li> For this reason I do not ever use the foundation because they can be painful.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed for the price.</li>
            <li> I guess.  :(</li>
            <li> i have had brush&#x27;s before that shed like crazy!</li>
            <li> but I do not even use these brushes :(</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> When I looked at the brushes, they were already shedding and they smelled really bad!</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product!</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I must say that these are the worst brushes ive ever encountered.</li>
            <li> The face brushes are horrible.</li>
            <li> I will never recommend this even to my worst enemy!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I would just like to say that these brushes are not too hard and not too soft. Some of the other reviews said they were way too rough. Wrong they are perfect. If you don&#x27;t buy these then you will be missing out. Great product. Also, the bag didn&#x27;t stink near as bad as some of the other complainer reviewers. :)</li>
            <li> There are a lot more brushes in this set than I would have ever thought about using.  I definitely don&#x27;t need this many because I&#x27;m not a gigantic makeup wearer, however I love these brushes because they were cheaper than some other sets that I saw and they had more brushes.  The quality of the brushes is top notch.  I like the set because they even come with little plastic guards to make the brushes stay in the correct shapes.  The case makes them easy to transport and that came in handy on my recent vacation and will probably come in handy when I move in a few months.</li>
            <li> This product is rediculous! Please do not waste your time or your money! It is so cheap! I sent it back as soon as I received this product. You can buy better for the same price.</li>
            <li> Not so good quality but ok</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them they were rough and hard</li>
            <li> the brush&#x27;s hair came out so easily. ( very rough too)</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough not soft at all. sheds alot. i was not satisfied. So if your looking for good quality then look else where.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes and i was happy with them. The only bad thing about them is the odor. It smells like plastic and leather and it&#x27;s very strong. So i just let them air out and it&#x27;s gone away not fully but hopefully after i clean them it won&#x27;t be there. They are a good quality brush, i haven&#x27;t used them yet though. I&#x27;ll comment when i do use them.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR SCHOOLS SO I JUST NEEDED A CHEAP BRUSH SET, I DIDNT EXPECT MAC OR SIGMA QUALITY BRUSHES, HOWEVER FROM THE OTHER REVIEW I DID EXPECT THEM TO BE A LITTLE BETTER QUALITY. THE BRUSHES AND BRUSH ROLL SMELL AWFUL WHEN YOU OPEN THE! I WASHED THEM RIGHT AWAY AND THE SHED A LOT... MORE THEN NORMAL BRUSHES. THE BRISTLES ARE FLIMSY. I WOULDNT PURCHASE THIS AGAIN</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay they came on time and appeared as they did in the pic however the bristles tend to come off on my clients face. They get the job done but would be better if the bristles stayed on brush</li>
            <li> All the brushes work great! Only have a small problem, some of the hair on some of brushes come off easily. Only two or three of them though. Other wise I love it!</li>
            <li> the brushes i received were very cheap and some of them were bent. not worth the wait or the purchase</li>
            <li> I have not used this long enough to judge the durability of it, but it is a big variety and would be absolutely perfect for those who are just starting out in makeup or just want to keep things on a budget!</li>
            <li> I just got this brush set today and I must say I absolutely LOVE it! The brushes are very soft -with the exception of a few which are meant to be more stiff than the others- and came neatly wrapped in individual plastic coverings. I&#x27;ve yet to find them damaged at all. On top of that, I&#x27;m really digging the variety of brushes. There&#x27;s one for practically everything which, of course, I&#x27;d expect from a 32 count set. My only complaint is the overwhelming plastic/moth-ball smell of the case that seems to get on everything. Thankfully though it&#x27;s nothing that cant be fixed. I&#x27;m currently airing it out and am getting ready to give the brushes a quick washing with a recipe I got from makeup guru Michelle Phan. Some have said that the hairs fall out easily with these sets but after testing them for myself, I haven&#x27;t found a single lost hair -not even on the face brushes-. Even if I did, it&#x27;s not too big of a problem. As my first set of pro brushes, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I got my brushes today..and I must say I&#x27;m in love being a long time user of Mac and Sephora Professional Studio brushes these are pretty good...The reason I don&#x27;t rate them 5 stars is the smell as soon as you open the box your attack by this plastic smell, once you wash your brushes the smell goes away..I did see some of the hair fall out but not too much.Great buy.</li>
            <li> Some of the glue let&#x27;s lose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to make up and I find that the hair in the brushes seem to fall out while I am using them, causing them to get caught in my eyelashes or, worse, in my eyes. They work great other than that and the case is great for keeping them together. All around I like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a couple years and they are falling apart. The bristles fall out. They&#x27;re nice if youre not a professional and just use for personal everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> not as nice of quality as i expected kind of cheap looking and feeling brushes. some brushes were uneven and fake feeling</li>
            <li> Great product. My wife was simple thrilled when I gifted this to her. My overall experience of buying was also fantastic....</li>
            <li> I got my brushes quick the case was nice the brushes are good and they do the job. They don&#x27;t shed which is a plus. Have I had better brushes in the past yes but these brushes are competitive and are worth the purchase. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and I still love it. The brushes range from soft to firm and fills any brush need.</li>
            <li> Although these brushes may not be \\&quot;professional\\&quot; like they state in the description, for 22 brushes its worth the 13 bucks! People complaining about the smell are ridiculous. It smells like plastic get over it. While taking the packaging off I had one brush fall apart. Not that big if a deal. A lot of brushes are exactly the same but come on people it&#x27;s $13 what do you expect, MAC brushes?</li>
            <li> The brushes are of medium quality--not too soft, but not too hard.  About what you&#x27;d expect for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is totally right about the smell when you open the package!  Very chemically!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to wash/soak your brushes in warm to hot water and soap before you use them--it will help get out the red dye that is on some of the brush heads--so it won&#x27;t end up on your or your client&#x27;s face!</li>
            <li> When it comes to makeup, its not the brushes that create beauty, its the the artist. The tools used do not matter if you are good at what you do.</li>
            <li> I must say that these are the worst brushes ive ever encountered. Just got them today, I was so excited to get them, before any usage the bristles were already coming out and the handles were chiped . Most important they don&#x27;t hold any product, I&#x27;m so disappointed but you get what you pay for. I gave them to my 3 year old to play with I give these brushes 5 thumbs down......period!  Amazon needs to take this off their websites exspeditiously. I will say the leather case is okay that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> when i saw these make up brushes being sold on amazon i thought, must not be very good for actual make up applying! well,was i shocked to open up this beautiful set of 32 brushes, stored in this just as beautiful leather pouch. now, i have always applied some of my make up with brushes, usually eye shadow, and blush, as well as finishing powder.  several months back, an in store makeup saleswoman applied my foundation with a brush, telling me how much expensive product i was wasting with my sponge.  well,she got me hooked! now all of my make up goes on with a brush and this dynomite set from amazon is the best available to get the job done!</li>
            <li> So many different brushes I can use...they are awesome! I don&#x27;t have to keep cleaning the same few brushes I have to use different colors!</li>
            <li> Little pieces of the brush tend to come off onto your face when you use it . I also had one them come off. It was easy to fix though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying individual brushes here and there for a long time (MAC brushes are my favorite splurge!) but this was the first time I decided to try out a set of brushes with a brush roll.  I&#x27;m definitely a convert!  I love the brush roll that comes with this set: it folds up nicely and keeps the brushes protected and safe.  The material is sturdy and is wearing well over the months that I&#x27;ve been using it.  It wipes down easily if you get makeup all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are nice and soft and there is a good variety.  I&#x27;ve used them pretty extensively with very little fiber fallout.  They wash up quite well and, after drying, they are good as new.  There is still nothing quite as satisfying as splurging on a new fabulous brush, but this collection is affordable and high quality and gives you a great basic set of brushes to cover all of the basics as well as a few specialty applications and are durable and will work for a variety of uses.</li>
            <li> Many choices in brushes and the eyeshadow and and powders go on so well with them. I suggest these for the price that they are.</li>
            <li> These brushes are made of plastic. They are very poor quality. I guess you can&#x27;t expect more for the price.</li>
            <li> I liked having a large variety of brushes to choose from but there are a few things I did not like about this product. These brushes are very rough (especially the foundation brushes that you are rubbing all over your face). For this reason I do not ever use the foundation because they can be painful. I know have to save again for a gentle set of brushes. Secondly, I would advise any buyer to wash these brushes and condition them so the they do not shed...I made that mistake with a few of them. These shed a lot but if you do what you can to prevent that, things are not too bad. All in all the large variety is amazing, the sleek look is awesome and the price is incredible. My only problems are the shedding and the roughness.</li>
            <li> Who could ask or need anything more? This pouch of make up brushes leaves nothing lacking. It&#x27;s the real thing you will look like a real Hollywood Startlet! Hollywood is in the house honey!</li>
            <li> all was great, product worked as expected and required. Price was good, planning on refilling when run out of pro</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazing, some of them arent as well made as the rest but most of them are fantastic i love them!!</li>
            <li> There were a lot of the same shaped brushes in different sizes. They were all synthetic which was what I expected. Overall, pretty good value for the price. They&#x27;re good for glitter shadows.</li>
            <li> I got this set for Christmas and was pretty excited since there were so many. First off, the STINK! I have left the case open since I got them and they are finally getting better. The face brushes are horrible. The are rough and hurt my face and made my makeup look streaky. I have already replaced those with ones that I had before. The eye brushes have worked pretty well. They are soft and work pretty well for the price. If you need a set of extra not great quality then this should work fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes as a gift and they are great quality.  They include many different sizes along with a case for storage. You wont be disappointed for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to my lack of brushes. For the price, its an alright set. I wouldve been happier if the brushes that i use the most didnt start breaking.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it cuz the bigger brushes are coarse and scratchy . . . I only gave a 3 because the brushes for the eyes are actually useable</li>
            <li> I recently ordered these brushes again (2 sets actually) because I was so pleased by the results I had with a set I ordered at the beginning of the year. When I got them, I was so excited, until I opened up the roll... THEY ARE ALL SYNTHETIC, basically all concealer/foundation style of brushes... what the hell am I supposed to do with 64 concealer and foundation brushes? You can&#x27;t even use them for eyeshadows! I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The brush hairs were much more coarse than I thought they would be. Also, the tip of the eyebrow comb kept falling off. But the presentation was nice.</li>
            <li> I like this set. It has a lot of brushes for a great price. My biggest problems with it though are that the larger brushes are not soft at all, and they shed like crazy. The smaller brushes, which are all black, are way better in comparison to the larger brushes. They don&#x27;t shed much at all, and are also very soft. Overall, you get what you pay for with this set.</li>
            <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t the greatest for professionals but for someone like me that just likes to do fancy eyeshadow every now and then these are fantastic. They didn&#x27;t shed too much after I washed them the first time and they clean very easily. They didn&#x27;t have a smell like other brushes like this that I have ordered also.</li>
            <li> Some of these brushes I use all the time....some of them the brush is rough and the brush hair falls out every time I wash it</li>
            <li> It should have the names of the brushes on the end of them. It&#x27;d be really helpful. And the hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I started experimenting with different tech for make up and when i got them with in a week the heads started coming off and i had to tape them ALL and the shed wayy too much id rather stick with my sigma brushes</li>
            <li> it does not hace eyeshadow brushes, but a lot of concealer brushes, they are all flat and hard so they are not so good for blending eyeshadows, the rest are good... for the price</li>
            <li> I usually use Mac brushes and decided to get this kit just to have some extra brushes to use.  I love them! They are awesome quality.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is becuase the case is a little smelly! Like chemicals.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it contained a brush for every makeup application you can dream of.  And I would most definetly recommend this product to my friends..</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved these brushes i have no complaints about the item itself however I rated this 3 out of 5 stars because of the fact that this item took almost a month for me to receive it. Other then that they are amazing high quality brushes for their price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a get what you pay for item... handles fall apart and the brushes are too coarse.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a little rough but I seem to notice that when I use the super soft bristles they hang on to more makeup (less makeup on my face) and dont last as long also they do not shed their bristles.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for an extra set.. some hair fallout but not to much the blending brush works well. Not very good for applying shadow but like I said they work great for blending :)</li>
            <li> All of the brushes in the sets density are all the same way to soft. They don&#x27;t blend well that we&#x27;ll or pick up product good enough for make up application</li>
            <li> Soft bristle but it falls off all over my face with every use.  I guess for the price i paid it&#x27;s not shocking.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money. This is a great gift for a young girl. Its fun with all the different brushes and a teenage girl would love this. But Im 30 and for everyday brushes, they&#x27;re cheaply made. Bristles fell out the minute I removed the brush from the plastic wrap. The tips were uneven and just not what you would want out of everyday make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely happy it arrived so fast i ordered it on sunday and tuesday it was already here i was playing around with them and i feel in love 32 brushes and they are amazing i recomend it you will love them</li>
            <li> Brushes are not neatly tirmed the are bushy and kind of rough ... But you get what u paid for right... Really strong chemical smell when you it up... Would recommend washing it hot water before use ... It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my best friend. She is absolutely in love with them. The case is nice and the brushes are really cool. :) I think it&#x27;s a great starter kit for her to become a wonderful make-up artist.</li>
            <li> i got these brushes they are absolute terrible. the quality is bad and the brushes are hard as sandpaper on skin. even after wash its still the same i would not buy or recommend these brushes they are unbelievably terrible.</li>
            <li> These brushes might as well be for preschool watercoloring. When i got this set there were two brushes without hair in them. Then the &amp;#34;soft hair&amp;#34; is about as soft as sandpaper on your lids. I gave these to my three year old to play with and destroy bc they are useless as can be. &amp;#34;Professional quality&amp;#34; they are not. Do not waste your time or money unless youve got both to spare</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good daily use brush set.  As I expected, the brushes are fairly cheaply made. The eyebrow/eyelash brush head popped off the first time I used it, but after a little super glue it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  They work well and are comfortable to use. I love the wonderful leather case they come in. I would recommend these brushes to anyone who wants a very broad range of brushes to use for quite a low price.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not pick up product well, sheds, flimsy. But I did not expect much anyway.</li>
            <li> Shipped directly from China and smells like chemicals.  Very concerned to use it.  I tried to clean it but they still smell.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  I don&#x27;t use it myself, but she seems to really like it.  Pleanty of different sizes for different uses, and the case is nice.</li>
            <li> I gave this set as a gift and the recipient was thrilled with them. I&#x27;m so glad I chose these. She says they are good quality brushes</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these as they were a Christmas gift.  Quick delivery and arrived exactly as described!  Would highly recommend especially for someone into make-up and brushes.</li>
            <li> My wife was surprised by the amount of brushes that actually come with this package.  She was pleasantly surprise, hey, i definitely benefited from it......</li>
            <li> Good product. Only complaint..the case that the brushed come in, have a funny smell. I guess in time it will go away?</li>
            <li> I still think it is a brilliant product. Lots of brushes for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the smell: Yeah, when you open it it dies smell bad. But just open it and leave it for a few hours and it is gonna go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the brushes: You do have to wash them first, just leave them in the sink for an hour. They are good quality, easy to work with. I am not professional but I love doing makeup and I&#x27;m sure this kit is going to be a big help for me. I just love it.</li>
            <li> They are what they say they are. Only thing they shed a little but nothing I haven&#x27;t seen in some others very soft. Happy I got them</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY NICE SET OF BRUSHES.  IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERY APPLICATION. THE ROLLUP POUCH IS A PLUS FOR KEEPING THINGS IN PLACE, AND FOR TRAVEL.</li>
            <li> Never have I found such a fantastic makeup kit with so many applicators for so little money! I use this all the time and I absolutely adore it. It&#x27;s soft to the touch and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and it works very well for blending/applying/anything you need to do for makeup!</li>
            <li> this brushes is not what i expect when  i got it /! the brush is not soft i have 2 brushes that u can see the glue on it</li>
            <li> ok so heres the cons and bros i order this for early bday presnt  ok what is good about it said it will come the 15 it came the 13  what wasnt the geretes about it was the smeel but u can air it out so dont let it bring u down a dro it that the bigs fan brush sheade alout but ever thing else sheded like onece they are really soft it comes in a pretty case i love i whould recomend this to any one it is so fantactic and dont lisin to some bad reviews</li>
            <li> Arrived early and is nice and neat. Perfect for a christmas present. Has all the brushes you will need and require.</li>
            <li> I just received the package today. I was pretty excited at the beginning, but when I picked the first brush the little hairs started falling off. That happened with about 4 brushes. If that didn&#x27;t happen, I would definitely give then a 5 star review, but I really hate it when the hair falls off and stays on my face.</li>
            <li> the brushes didnt have enough hair.. even though the selection is great, the quality isnt great... wish i got something better.</li>
            <li> Took 7 days for this to ship to US which was on time.  The leather case was nice and soft and the brushes were soft.  Although it comes with a strong smell of chemical which is ok and tolerable. This is my gift to my sister in the Phil.  I just hope this wont shed for a long time once it is washed.  Looks expensive fior a reasonable price.  Great deal! Im glad this was what i chose among the others.</li>
            <li> got it as a gift for a friend when i opened it to make sure there wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with it i saw they were cheaply made i wouldnt recommend this to anyone i only got it cause my friend wanted this set</li>
            <li> Overall, a decent companion to my MUA Kit.  The vinyl (NOT LEATHER) case is cheap; the ties quickly fell apart. I purchased two, one to keep, one to give.</li>
            <li> Best brushes ever used. So many to choose from that there is no way there isn&#x27;t one you need in the collection</li>
            <li> my girl love them said that they work perfectly for her makeup said that they were good quality and will order more in the future thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking to get an affordable set of brushes and I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second use I could not take it. Some of the brushes are soft to the hand but hard on the face, especially around the eyes. I learned my lesson and am only buying brushes from Mac and Sephora from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you can take the brittleness on your face...go for it! I know I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes on sunday. And first of the chemical smell was really bad!!! I hate it. I washed them at least 3 times. The face brushes shed a bit. But other than that I&#x27;m happy. Eventually the chemical smell will die down or I&#x27;ll get use to it, but this is great someone who want to become better at make-up, as I.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great just as describe the bag smells like plastic but not too bad and really good for the money</li>
            <li> i never notice there are so many different kind of those brushes! well its pretty good, but i dont really know how to see if its made by good materials, or hair?..</li>
            <li> This is over all a very nice product. Needs to be cleaned once you get them but i enjoy my set very much. If you are just looking for a nice set to start off with or to have i would say go for it.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive these brushes, but once I got them, I was totally and completely disappointed. The hair on the brushes come off and don&#x27;t pick up any product. They&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes. The quality of the brushes is very good. They came on time and they get the job done. Blend very well for the price they cost me. Very cheap price for the amount of brushes it came with.</li>
            <li> YOU RECEIVE MANY BRUSHES IN THIS SET BUT THE QUALITY IS NOT THE BEST ...BY FAR. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> ... they are nice but the bristles are not the softest. She does have the skin of an angel though...</li>
            <li> The brush its totally disapointed coz the material is so cheap n rough...&lt;br /&gt;Till now i never use it coz the hair brush keep fallin</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted arrived on time</li>
            <li> These brushes are deff. worth the buy. They were bigger than i imagined and the casing was nice. The only reason y I didnt give them 5 stars is because the hair shed a bit but only the first time i used them. This only happened on like 2 of the brushes and after i washed them nothing fell off at all. But these are amazing :)</li>
            <li> Really reliable and precise brushes! Would highly recommend to any make-up artist! Great shipping and ease of purchase. Strong brushes and great pouch.</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes today and was excited to see them. When I opened the box, I notice that I was missing a brush. This just completely killed my mood. I was upset that I paid for 32 brushes and only got 31. Sure it sounds like I can live without one brush but if I paid for a set, I expect a whole set! The unfortunate thing is that I can&#x27;t do anything about it as to getting a replacement brush or exchanging it for a new set. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> There is every size brush you could ever need. The brushes are not very soft.  Also, the length of the handles are really long!</li>
            <li> Some brushes are good some of the brushes are made of really cheap material but for $20 I didn&#x27;t expect something outstanding</li>
            <li> My brush set arrived very quickly, only in 5 days.  Arrived in good condition and it&#x27;s awesome all the brushes that I have for only $15.  They are brushes that you can&#x27;t find them.  I am a professional makeup student and the set is awesome for me.  Thanks</li>
            <li> my girl was soooo excited when she got these awesome professional make up brushes, she loves them. she started using them immediatley</li>
            <li> Never have I had a set of brushes that lives up to the standards that these brushes do. I am a professional makeup artist and I have been spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on brushes from big names for years. These brushes are amazing and even if you don&#x27;t like them as well as your MAC brushes, they are cheap and easy to replace. . ..</li>
            <li> From the pictures, my wife thought the brushes would have been more fine. I guess they were rougher than expected. She uses them though.</li>
            <li> i love this item. i love all the multi-brushes with individual plastic covering and their own pouch to be in.</li>
            <li> These seem to be great brushes and love the fact that there are so many. I haven&#x27;t used them yet because they are soaking in hot soapy water to get the small out hopefully. I smelt them when I pulled them out of my PO BOX. The only other thing I would be advised of is the picture doesn&#x27;t really show that the brush hair is different colors - black and red. Not a huge deal it just surprised me. The shipping also takes forever - they arrived three weeks after I ordered them!!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this set because of all the reviews of it being stinky. I&#x27;m glad that I did buy it! The smell is really not horrible, I don&#x27;t know why people hate it that bad. The scent is that of a mechanic shop and leather jacket. You have to wash all make up brushes anyway so there is really no big deal. The paste brushes are sooo soft and I have not had any shedding! These are better than my Estee Lauder set (those frizzed and became brittle.) These are middle of the line quality, they are no M.A.C. set, but that is good enough for me! The price and how many you get make this irresistible!  If anything ever happens to these I think that I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> This brush set is perfect. Will last for a very long time and with so many different sizes, you won&#x27;t need anything else!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my teenage daughter who loves to do and try different make ups. She is absolutely thrilled with them and the shipping was much faster than I thought! Great buy for a great price!!!</li>
            <li> The price is good but the brushes didnt met my expectations. I bought them to replace my old ones, but now I kinda miss them.</li>
            <li> I mean, its cool that i now have a million make up brushes, esp the eye brushes, but they arent very soft at all.  I never really use them bc they arent that great.  The bristles DO fall out and the face brushes are completely not usable bc they are so scratchy!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes before brush was good but this order was not good ani I bought for the first time on one piece Next time 2 and those 2 were slightly Substandard solve this problem</li>
            <li> Use these brushes on occasion; I rarely get dressed up enough to use them.&lt;br /&gt;But when I do they work great and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed make up brushes for a long time. I recently lost all my make up though, so I have not been able to use them yet. They are very soft, and only have minimal shedding (1-3 hairs on only some brushes) Definitely will buy again if I need brushes!</li>
            <li> Got two playsation batteries instead like really?? i waited like 2 weeks and come to find out they made a mastake with my package with play station batteries really? And then they told me to send them back and i had to pay 50 dollars to ship them right back .. THE WORST!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* if had the choice to put no stars, i would .</li>
            <li> I loved it! The brushes are soo good! All the variety of brushes are great for that awsome price its the best!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this package, it took about a month to ship, and when I opened the package it straight up smelled like hazard chemicals! When I looked at the brushes, they were already shedding and they smelled really bad! I washed them and they still smelled burnt, AND THEY STILL KEEP ON SHEDDING. I really do not recommend this product at all. Many of the brushes are the same. I regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous set of brushes!!  The synthetic material of the bristles are easy to clean and resistant to staining.  For the price I would  purchase these again and again!!!  I would recommended this product to anyone, especially to someone in the beauty industry.  Having such a large number of brushes on hand at one time allows you to do multiple makeup applications without having to clean or sanitize-a fresh set for each person!!</li>
            <li> Quality not Quantity!!!Although this brush set comes with many brushes the quality is really bad.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the brushes are really rough. I was not pleased with the product however if you like thats fine to</li>
            <li> Great variety but brushes feel too rough for skin. Blush and powder brushes especially .  Pouch and selection are great. Shipped fast  also</li>
            <li> Amaizing, my wife was speechless when she saw them the first time, but when they arrive, I can&#x27;t describe how she reacted, this product is amaizing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are rough, the bristles fall out and they smell horrible!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;These are nothing but junk!</li>
            <li> Quality is just as good as Mac or Bobbi Brown brushes.  Would recommend this product.  Applies make up well. Very minimal shedding. Update.  Glue pieces fall apart.  Does not pick up eyeshadow on brushes.  Shed consistently. But for the price (smile)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed at such a reasonable price. It was the perfect buy and I love it.</li>
            <li> They were described as soft brushes, however, sand paper I think would be more gentle on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are of the lowest quality, lower than dollar store stuff and one came in broken. 3 other brushes are lose and about to break... I will not recommend this set at all.</li>
            <li> I got this as a christmas gift this year.  Each brush is individually covered in plastic within the pouch.  The brushes are very soft and don&#x27;t appear to shed at all.  Would recommend for any aspiring / beginner makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Mr. AMAZON. Good afternoon. I am writing to you, in order to please suggest me the tracking number for the order 111-9100901-1337059 Index to be reported to the Liberty Express Company, as it is required for them to monitor the merchandise. Likewise, with the Order Tracking Nro.111-96014296823432 9400111201237375650519 where LIBERTY EXPRESS me that this product have not yet rcibido, thank verify this information.&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for a prompt response, I am of you, att: Ms. Lenis Carruyo A.</li>
            <li> This came with lots of great brushes. So many different shapes and sizes to choose from. Very nice quality brushes as well.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Except its a pleather case. But nice. Brushes are nice. I do wish it came with a description for all all the brushes are meant for.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review an item that never arrived - wasn&#x27;t sure until yesterday which brand it was - talked to the person I gave the set to for Christmas and she confirmed that she got the Coastal Scents set ---I &#x27;m sure this was on my statement - so I bought two with one missing in action -----Joan Blacker</li>
            <li> Love it perfect kit. Great value for the price! I recommend this kit for all beginners. A unbelievable value. I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more for gifts for friends.</li>
            <li> Not bad for price but I have found cheaper brushes that don&#x27;t shed as much. I spend more time rubbing off my makeup along w the shredded bristles.</li>
            <li> Es un estuche completo, de buena calidad a un precio muy accesible, me sorprendió cuando lo recibí, cada broca es excelente.</li>
            <li> i bougt the brushes and was realy pleased with the majority of the product. The larger brushes were all had lower quality bristles than the smaller brushes but they all had very nice stems. The small brushes had very nice bristles (realy shiny and soft) but all of the brushes lost a few bristles uopn opening. the case is nice but has a kind of an odd smell, but it is very faint. over all good product for the price payed!</li>
            <li> I got my brush set on time.. It looks just like the picture promised. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with any &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell like some people from other reviews. Honestly don&#x27;t expect a professional brush set.. You get what you pay for. The brushes are super soft.. But they don&#x27;t pick up any product. The hairs are too slick and don&#x27;t hold any powder. I&#x27;ve found other uses for some of my brushes since I wont be using all of them.. I definitely want to get my moneys worth out of them.. But I am unfortunately going to have to buy a different brush set to actually use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> yea mixed feelings...some brushes r soft and some r stiff or not soft.....i got this for a friend cause she didnt want to create a amazon account to order stuff and her sister actually liked it so i ordered it for her sister too! well good thing is that u get lots of brushes for a cheap price right? brushes r so expensive!</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived at my door two days after ordering. I opened the package and was immediately grossed out by the smell. It smelled very chemical-y or something. I washed the brushes, and there was a big change in the order. They still kind of smell, but it&#x27;s ok now. When they were washed, the bigger brushes shed a little. I haven&#x27;t used them yet as they are still drying. So yeah, I think they are a very good brushes, but definitely need a good washing before use.</li>
            <li> I currently recieved my brushes and must say that its worth the price. It does come with various brushes, some useless though. Don&#x27;t expect to be getting top quality brushes when your paying such a low price. The brushes aren&#x27;t a really good quality but for beginners I think it&#x27;s worth it. The downside is the smell and the red dye that seeps though if you don&#x27;t wash them. WASH YOUR BRUSHES THROUGHLY!!</li>
            <li> I just wanted more brushes to use while my expensive brushes were drying after a wash. These brushes work great , just as well as my expensive ones. No hairs coming out. If you want practical and not stylish, give them a try. Slight smell from the leather but not a problem.</li>
            <li> My brushes had chunks of wood missing from my brushes and would be scared to buy again. But that&#x27;s what u get for the price I guess! Was just hopin for a little more I guess.  :(</li>
            <li> The brushes are absolutely perfect in every way except for the fact that the hair strands fall out at times.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my daughter who really loved this item. She recommended it to her friends already so no issues here.</li>
            <li> Just got them today and I&#x27;m in a play so there great brushes for any makeup artist there perfect for every day use.</li>
            <li> I really just needed the case and not the brushes but for that price I decided that I might as well have some new brushes and worst come to worst throw away the ones I don&#x27;t want, but for personal use they&#x27;re actually very good! I use them every day ;)</li>
            <li> Some of the bristle was falling out the first time I used it .</li>
            <li> you really get what you pay for. the brushes were stiff and coarse. irritated the skin.  i would never recommend them to anybody.</li>
            <li> These came sooner than I had planned and were in perfect condition (being new).  The style of brushes were more than I imagined.  I now have brushes that don&#x27;t loose their bristles nor break the heads off.  I love these brushes, I would recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li> I attempted to use a few of the brushes and the bristles kept coming out and were all over my face. The organizer is nice, but the brushes are definitely lacking.</li>
            <li> nice assortment of brushes. i didn&#x27;t have a real problem with hairs coming off brush except 2 brushes i don&#x27;t use much. i believe these brushes come from different sets, hence the different color bristles. bristles are not too stiff nor soft as some reviews state. decent brush set for money paid. pouch does smell like cheap plastic. just wash twice &amp; leave outside. i put mine out on my window ledge hanging by one of the strings. faint smell, not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick! Great set to have all the brushes you would ever need for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely loved these!</li>
            <li> This product is far from what is described I am very un-happy I will never recommend this even to my worst enemy!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> There are a ton of good quality brushes in this set. It is well worth the reasonable price.The only downside I found is ,I would like to see more of the super soft bristle brushes and less of the various sized harder brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brush&#x27;s they feel heavy not like hollow or a plastic type feeling and they don&#x27;t shed but alittle every now and then and when it does shed it&#x27;s usaully not much and it&#x27;s only certain brush&#x27;s i have had brush&#x27;s before that shed like crazy! they arrived way ahead of scedule it said that they were going to arrive like 20 days from now on like january 20th and it arrived on december 27th instead which is awesome. But the only reason i did not give it 5 stars besides the occasional shedding is because when i opended the package this very very bad chemicle type smell came out of it, it made me wonder if the brush&#x27;s were safe for using but the brush&#x27;s themselves did not smell just the pouch they were in and i mean it was really bad no joke that smell gave me a headache and made me dizzy and i can only imagine what it did to my cat! My mom was not happy either seeing the house still smells from it and it is now the next day after recieving them, i had to pull each brush out one by one and pull plastic off them before i could throw the pouch outside in hopes the smell would be gone but it wasn&#x27;t! so, all in all besides the smell of the pouch these brush&#x27;s come in i would recomend these because it is a very good deal even if you have to throw the pouch out seeing it&#x27;s just plastic you won&#x27;t be really wasting much money. the brush&#x27;s work great and all in all they are a great product and i would buy them again!</li>
            <li> excellent job very satisfied. not too much more to say no problems worked out okie dokie smoky a okay .</li>
            <li> way better than i thought they would be...mineral makeup needs a good brush set like this one...makeup goes on more even with these...great brushes and i&#x27;ll be buying them for my daughter in law...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional &amp; ordered these for two of my granddaughters.....they use them daily and like them very much.</li>
            <li> I actually got this product 3 days early and I was really excited to open it. Of course I looked at the reviews before getting the brush set. I heard really bad reviews about the smell but it&#x27;s not all that bad. This product contains a few face brushes which doesn&#x27;t come in handy but luckily, I can replace it when other brushes in the pouch. The pouch can be very handy while traveling and can hold a lot. I put other things in it like my mascara and lip stick. The eyeshadow brushes are a big plus and it&#x27;s great! It comes in big, medium and small brushes for better application. Some brushes required a bit of trimming if you&#x27;re that precise about how a brush should look like but it all works the same. When you look at the picture that is provided when you buy it, it definitely looks different in person. In person, all the brushes are black and nothing like the picture. I purchased this pouch because I wanted more eyeshadow brushes and why not get the set? Now I can get the achieve look that I want. Even though some of the face brushes aren&#x27;t what I was looking for, my sister was happily to take it and she loves it. I guess everything works after all.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got all of these brushes for the price. Upon arrival, they were clean and soft, then I started using them. They, very quickly, became brittle and rough. The bristles fall out all the time and they are really hard to clean. I used a makeup brush shampoo to clean them and maybe make them softer, but the bristles became mangled and even more brittle. I only use a select few of them because the 12 eye shadow brushes are either really stiff and harsh or brittle and the hairs fall out. Some of the face brushes are useful, but bristles still fall out all the time. I would NOT repurchase these again. Use your money to buy a smaller, softer, higher end set.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and came extremely fast.  I love the leather pouch it came in and the brushes are great and soft.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better service or better brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set for my daughter for Christmas. She likes them a lot and uses them daily. Only complaint was that some of the brushes are a little too soft for application techniques. Great buy!</li>
            <li> My order was on time, product was exactly as described. They were not exactly what I thought they would be but they work just fine and there&#x27;s so many you can&#x27;t go wrong. Great brush pouch, very light.</li>
            <li> I read the good reviews on these brushes and thought that they should be fairly good for their price. I was very disappointed with these brushes. First off, they smell terrible, but that fades I suppose. Secondly, they&#x27;re not the brushes in the picture, they are all black and extremely synthetic looking, and feeling (the brushes in the picture have brown in them and look pretty soft) which is not pleasant. They also aren&#x27;t very good at picking up color and/or applying it evenly. Especially the large brushes for powder and foundation, bristles fall out and some bristles are uneven!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for brushes to practice with or don&#x27;t care about makeup that much, then go right ahead and get these. But if you want good brushes for a good price, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone in Cosmotology school and she loved it. She&#x27;s learning about all kinds of different makeup techniques and having this set of tools(brushes) has helped her a ton.</li>
            <li> The brushes are what u pay for the large brushes, powder brush , blending brushes, shed and poorly made. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Regardless you know how to do makeup or not. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone to buy these brushes. They are too hard on the face. Even on the hand they hurt. I wish I could give it no stars but that wasn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> ive never owned any real brushes before, and i have to say thease are beautiful, they are soft and apear to be well made, the case has a nice stylish look to it.  only thing that would make it better would be if came with an insurt that explaind what each brush was and how to use it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 16 and this is her first make up brush set. She is a beginner to makeup so she is constantly on Youtube to learn what each of these brushes do. She really loves the set and I think this is a great price for a complete set for a non professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why this set did not receive 5 stars from me is due to the strong odor of the case, it was horrible!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice, and easy to use. Just make sure to WASH the brushes first to get out all of the dye and chemical smell out of them. Other than that i enjoy using these brushes, since i got so many for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> i just got my brushes today..they are fine (not all of them) the big brushes could been better but the small brushes are good.. i like my new brushes.. but they smell funny.. make sure u wash them before using them..</li>
            <li> it is really nice and soft, the number of brushes made it easier for me and more interesting to apply my make up..like them alot</li>
            <li> Product okay. Not very well made.  Brushes hairs started to fall out after a couple of uses.  Good part is there was a big variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot. When you receive it, smells strongly of rubber. Work well but some bristles fall off on face. Otherwise great brushes for cheap price. Would recommend them.</li>
            <li> great variety of brushes...good carry case..I am able to apply makeup beautifully with these brushes...a great buy at a great price</li>
            <li> some of the brushes seem to be falling a part. i really like it anyway. and i can live with it not being perfect.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE CHEAPER DOLLAR STORE LOOKING I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND AT ALL...SORRY THIS SUCKS.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, easy payment, good product. Just not exactly what I was looking for. The brushes are nice just not the quality I wanted.</li>
            <li> the brushes are nice and do not shed there are so many! very very nice a great product buy it!</li>
            <li> The bristles are a lil stiff, they definitely get the job done. For the price ,well uget what you pay for. They alsoshedquite a bit.</li>
            <li> So I expected a little more from these brush set according to the reviews I had read on them. I guess for the price they are alright. There were many brushes on my set that had uneven bristles. I had to trim them so that they would be even. A lot of them loose a lot of bristles even when used with a lot of care and no rough movements. The pouch is actually pretty neat and mine did not have a weird smell. Good starter kit, but definitely not something I would ever consider buying again or recommending to a friend.</li>
            <li> The hair in the brushes falls out when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;There is glue stuck all over the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; set is not very professional.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really tough.  Feels like a hair brush.  Very rough for putting makeup on someone&#x27;s face.  Also feels like a number 2 pencil.  Someone got this for my birthday and I totally appreciate the gift but I do not even use these brushes :( which is sad because there are so many.  The foundation and concealer brush in this set work good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, the smell that everyone talked about was gone in 5 minutes.  The first use i experienced a little fall out but not much i would recommend these brushes to everyone</li>
            <li> Came with so many brushes!!!!! Not being a make-up artist I was impress and a little overwhelmed. I have had the pack for over a year and is still enjoying the brushes.</li>
            <li> There is a great selection of sizes/shapes of brushes in this set...but the quality is NOT what I hoped for.  Every time I use them I lose bristles/hair out of them...but for low end they will work</li>
            <li> Luv d brushes they come in very handy in anything luv them a lot and I&#x27;m always using them for my make up</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t not used the makeup brushes the quality of them when they arrived felt good. So I can&#x27;t not wait to use them.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner and I bought these brushes because of the variety. I think I made a good buy... when you first get it they smell freshly painted and it doesn shed some. Not a big deal for me since the are full. I used the brushes and loved the way they applied my make up.. I didn&#x27;t change the type of makeup I use or did anything different but people noticed and the brushes do make a difference. The quantity and quality for the price is GREAT!!! I would recommend this product... GOOD BUY!!!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the brushes are okay.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like a couple of the eye shadow brushes and the contour brush.&lt;br /&gt;But the blush brush tends to shed a lot, and the foundation brush doesn&#x27;t blend the product very well.&lt;br /&gt;But I think they did an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; job for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Great gift.  My order arrived sooner than I expected.  This is a good deal.  This was a Christmas present to myself.</li>
            <li> Well, you get what you pay for. Next time, I&#x27;ll just save up the money for soft better brushes. Oh, well</li>
            <li> I bought one for my mom and one for myself and they are perfect for us. Really nice quality and pouch. Pretty sure it&#x27;s fake leather, which is nice and soft. I have nothing bad to say about this product!</li>
            <li> The makeup brush set it okay, You have alot of the same brushes. They do what they need to do to get the job done. They are not the best makeup brushes but they are okay</li>
            <li> This set is amazing..there is so much to choose from. The one downfall but not a big deal is that some of the brissels on the face brushes are left on my face after haha but I just swipe them off. Other than that, GREAT BUY!! RECOMENDED</li>
            <li> Good quality, perfect gift especially for the price.  There are so many brushes of varying sizes.  Perfect for a professional or just for fun.  My girlfriend loves this set.</li>
            <li> One should never need another brush after buying this.  I really liked this product.  There is a brush for everything!!</li>
            <li> The brushes were very disapointing coz the material is so cheap n rough...&lt;br /&gt;Hair brush keep falling off. they have a bad smell to them....</li>
            <li> Lets start by saying you get what you pay for. I had bought these brushes thinking that they might be a better quality than the picture shows. I was horribly wrong, the first danger sign was the smell that this product emitted when I had taken it out of the plastic wrapping in came in. It smelled like a mixture of a chemical plastic and just funk. That was strike one for me; next I was testing them out to see how bad the shedding was and never in my life have I see a brush refuse eye shadow. I had tried to grab some from my pallet and sweep it into the top of my hand and you could barely see anything. Most of the powder went flying into the floor/counter. Letting it go I picked up another brush with the same results. Frustrated I had tried out most of the other brushes and figured they were all the same. I work as a part time MUA and I would not recommend this set to anyone who wants quality. Besides that the handles felt cheap and the case was badly made.</li>
            <li> IM A 30+ YEAR HAIR AND MAKE-UP PERSON, AND IVE WORKED WITH MANY DIFF PRODUCTS, THESE ARE GREAT QUALITY AND NOTHING WORKS LIKE NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li> i like having the option of so many brushes, but they leave little hairs behind when i used them, so that was a bummer.</li>
            <li> they are ok ,but  sometimes the hair  is coming out :),but is a really good price for this amount of brushes</li>
