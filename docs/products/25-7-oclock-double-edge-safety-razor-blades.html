            <li>i love these blades!</li>
            <li>These are a great double edge safety razor blade, I had no problem getting a great shave and would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li>I did get 3 10 packs which is nice</li>
            <li>I have also used sharks, derbies, astra&#x27;s and these are still my favorite.</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite DE razor blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure you get the St. Petersburg produced ones.  </li>
            <li>I gave two stars because I did receive 5 more blades than advertised.</li>
            <li>You could probably get more shaves out of them</li>
            <li>Make sure you know which 7 O&#x27;Clock razor blades you are getting.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you know which one you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are my favorite for my 1977 razor.  </li>
            <li>I thought they were sharper, but anyway they are OK.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite razors</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which safety blade to pick and ordered a multipack of a variety of manufacturers.</li>
            <li>The price is right, the shave is good...</li>
            <li>and you will have a nice smooth irritation free face with these blades.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect sharpness for my skin, and I&#x27;m glad they were the one&#x27;s from russia that was expected!</li>
            <li>These have worked the best for me so far and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Best de blades in my opinion, not overly sharp and not dull either, perfect shave every time even with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>For years I have used derby razors, however, I am now a huge fan of these.</li>
            <li>They give me a close but comfortable shave in both the adjustble gillette</li>
            <li>The blade packages themselves did not appear to be compromised, so I wonder if the glue was just cheap and the boxes opened during shipping?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great blades, though I prefer the German Merkur ones over these</li>
            <li>An extremely smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The Good News is that they are actually better and sharper than the Russian blades.</li>
            <li>Good blade, nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Nice blades, work good for more senstive skins, even with a thick beard.</li>
            <li>I probably get ~4 good shaves per blade, which is pretty decent for me.</li>
            <li>My go to blade for a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>but they are not as good of quality as the Russian models.</li>
            <li>Feathers are great, but in comparison are less comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Adding 7 O&#x27;Clock Brand rapper on top the white one would give better appearance.  </li>
            <li>My overall favorite of the many brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>These are good as expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a distinct difference between the two types of razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Nice Russian blades.</li>
            <li>Far and away the most consistent blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Received in two days and was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I received the product exactly as advertised, and in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Great, sharp Russian blades</li>
            <li>guess it&#x27;s cool that I got 5 extra blades, which makes the blades worth keeping, but I wanted what was displayed in the picture - 5 packs of Russia-made blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As with any blade it certainly depends on the razor and technique.  </li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get a satisfactory shave, though, in areas that I felt I shouldn&#x27;t have that much of a problem with.</li>
            <li>I expect the chin to be a bit of a problem (very angular chin and jowls).</li>
            <li>Much easier than trying to find a store that carries them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than the 3-4-5 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Permasharp Stainless are made in India&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li>Stainless are made in Russia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted the Russian super stainless blades in the picture.</li>
            <li>So, of blades tried so far, I would still have to go with Feather in first place, followed by Derby, Wilkinson, and then this Gillette.</li>
            <li>This one was 2nd only to the Feather Stainless and a but more forgiving.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different blades and keep coming back to these.</li>
            <li>Make a first pass with the grain and then a second at 90 degrees to the first</li>
            <li>The shave started out fine, and really, I didn&#x27;t cut myself with it (contrary to popular opinion in many blade reviews, cutting yourself is normally the result of a dulling blade, and not of one that is sharp).</li>
            <li>Gillette India still makes a high quality blade that lasts about 7 days.  </li>
            <li>These blades are okay, but don&#x27;t last as long as the Derby or Personna blades.</li>
            <li>They last longer and are just the right sharpness for my beard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to safety razor shaving</li>
            <li>Also, the end flaps on all three boxes were opened when I received them, although the blades inside appear to be in new condition.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new brand of razors and headed to these.</li>
            <li>Not sure if their&#x27;s a difference however my face sure feels the difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades shave ok, not great, for 1-2 shaves at the most - not nearly as smooth as the real-deal Russian ones, which will last 4-5 shaves and pleasantly smooth.</li>
            <li>course, you can knick your face with these blades like any other DE blade, but I find it is more gentle than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These blades left me with more nicks, especially on the 2nd and 3rd passes.</li>
            <li>After going through a few different blades, many of which I threw out after one use, I settled on these.</li>
            <li>Better than the Russian green.</li>
            <li>I tried several different brands and these have just the right amount of sharpness and aggressiveness for me.</li>
            <li>and I shave in the shower with regular old face soap.</li>
            <li>The only downside is for some reason the first shave on each blade tends to be rough on my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use them instead of returning them because the return isn&#x27;t worth the hassle on such a small purchase.</li>

            <li> For the curious here are the different types of</li>
            <li> Strange... the seller sent 3 &amp;#34;Saloon&amp;#34; packs of &amp;#34;PermaSharp&amp;#34; blades, each box contained 10 blades, and all of the boxes were opened!</li>
            <li> Still wish blades of this type would last a little longer, only getting 4 to 5 shaves out of them.</li>
            <li> I learned that domestic cartridge razor providers sacrifice sharpness and  blade metallurgy (ability to stay sharp and hold an edge longer).</li>
            <li> Yes, Gillette actually makes a shaving product that costs less than $35 per pack.</li>
            <li> They seemed to stay sharper longer and left me with little to no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected</li>
            <li> There are only 2 types of blades labelled Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock in a GREEN box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much to say, except these worked for me.</li>
            <li> I Prefer these over all other blades.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp but they also they do not overly irritate.</li>
            <li> The other ones do not seem to be as sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blades where sharp did there job.</li>
            <li> I wanted the green packs, got the grey ones.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing glamorous about this blade other than it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as Feathers, which I&#x27;ve used, but sometimes I need a change of pace.</li>
            <li> I ordered a sample pack of all different brands and out of that set these nicked the least, lasted forever on my saety razor, and always got a close shave.</li>
            <li> PLATINUM - Made in India - Black Box</li>
            <li> The image, and description on this particular item are completly wrong.  </li>
            <li> My shipment consisted of three packages of 10 blades each of Gillette 7O&#x27;clock in the green box but made in India, not in Russia.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I received the Russian made blades.  </li>
            <li> The Bad News is that these are indeed, as other reviewers have pointed out, the Indian manufactured &amp;#34;Permasharp&amp;#34; blades, not the Russian made &amp;#34;Super Stainless&amp;#34;, which also come in a lime green box.</li>
            <li> but at this price I would rather not worry about irritation from using a dull blade.</li>
            <li> I prefer a couple of others but, that doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t work well for you.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard</li>
            <li> they are fake, looks like used ones</li>
            <li> Wrong blades.</li>
            <li> I contacted Giellette for guidance about how to find the Indian made blades, unfortunately they were of no help.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> The shave started out fine, and really, I didn&#x27;t cut myself with it (contrary to popular opinion in many blade reviews, cutting yourself is normally the result of a dulling blade, and not of one that is sharp). So that&#x27;s probably a point in its favor. I just couldn&#x27;t get a satisfactory shave, though, in areas that I felt I shouldn&#x27;t have that much of a problem with. I expect the chin to be a bit of a problem (very angular chin and jowls). But I don&#x27;t expect, on the third pass, to still find myself seeing stubble after I&#x27;ve relathered once again and stretched the skin as taut as it will go. So, of blades tried so far, I would still have to go with Feather in first place, followed by Derby, Wilkinson, and then this Gillette.</li>
            <li> I Prefer these over all other blades.  They give me a close but comfortable shave in both the adjustble gillette slim (on lvl 5) and the 3 piece merkur HD I have used them in. I still get a good shave after 5-7 shaves but change them out anyway. Feathers are great, but in comparison are less comfortable.  I have also used sharks, derbies, astra&#x27;s and these are still my favorite.</li>
            <li> Received in two days and was exactly what I was expecting. Much easier than trying to find a store that carries them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to safety razor shaving so I bought a variety pack of razors a while back. After going through a few different blades, many of which I threw out after one use, I settled on these. Surprise! Gillette still knows how to make a good razor. They are sharp but they also they do not overly irritate. The only downside is for some reason the first shave on each blade tends to be rough on my skin, maybe it&#x27;s just my technique, but I don&#x27;t look forward to it.</li>
            <li> Strange... the seller sent 3 &amp;#34;Saloon&amp;#34; packs of &amp;#34;PermaSharp&amp;#34; blades, each box contained 10 blades, and all of the boxes were opened! The blade packages themselves did not appear to be compromised, so I wonder if the glue was just cheap and the boxes opened during shipping?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these are NOT made in Russia - these are the cheaper, India-made blades that I was purposefully avoiding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s cool that I got 5 extra blades, which makes the blades worth keeping, but I wanted what was displayed in the picture - 5 packs of Russia-made blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades shave ok, not great, for 1-2 shaves at the most - not nearly as smooth as the real-deal Russian ones, which will last 4-5 shaves and pleasantly smooth. These blades left me with more nicks, especially on the 2nd and 3rd passes.</li>
            <li> they are fake, looks like used ones</li>
            <li> Great blades, though I prefer the German Merkur ones over these</li>
            <li> These are a great double edge safety razor blade, I had no problem getting a great shave and would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very good razors. They function just as advertised. Great deal, as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different blades and keep coming back to these. Far and away the most consistent blades I&#x27;ve used. I recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite DE razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you can knick your face with these blades like any other DE blade, but I find it is more gentle than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These are good as expected.  Adding 7 O&#x27;Clock Brand rapper on top the white one would give better appearance.  Delivered as expected</li>
            <li> make sure you get the St. Petersburg produced ones.  The other ones do not seem to be as sharp.  the Petersburg ones are my favorites.</li>
            <li> The product I received was not as described. My shipment consisted of three packages of 10 blades each of Gillette 7O&#x27;clock in the green box but made in India, not in Russia. Also, the end flaps on all three boxes were opened when I received them, although the blades inside appear to be in new condition. I&#x27;ll use them instead of returning them because the return isn&#x27;t worth the hassle on such a small purchase. I gave two stars because I did receive 5 more blades than advertised.</li>
            <li> My overall favorite of the many brands I&#x27;ve tried.  This is a replacement.  I ordered a sample pack of all different brands and out of that set these nicked the least, lasted forever on my saety razor, and always got a close shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are okay, but don&#x27;t last as long as the Derby or Personna blades. I recently re-discovered shaving with a double-edge safety razor. It&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than the 3-4-5 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts with these blades. I use them in a Merkur 180 and I use them twice before changing them out. You could probably get more shaves out of them but at this price I would rather not worry about irritation from using a dull blade. They come individually wrapped in wax paper 5 to a box. I have a very thick beard and I shave in the shower with regular old face soap. These blades will still glide over my face with no pulling. I never shave against the grain, there is no need to do that to your face! Make a first pass with the grain and then a second at 90 degrees to the first and you will have a nice smooth irritation free face with these blades.</li>
            <li> I have found the perfect razor for me. I tried several different brands and these have just the right amount of sharpness and aggressiveness for me. Try different brands as everyones face is different but for me i get a BBS shave each time without razorburn or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I received the product exactly as advertised, and in a very timely manner. Overall, I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the Russian super stainless blades in the picture. Instead I received the  permasharp Indian blades. I did get 3 10 packs which is nice but they are not as good of quality as the Russian models. Please update the picture. Price payed for 30 blades was fair.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect sharpness for my skin, and I&#x27;m glad they were the one&#x27;s from russia that was expected! Love these blades!</li>
            <li> I know razor are different for everybody. The blades where sharp did there job. that is the only reason given 5 star because of the fact not every razor work the same for people. The razor caused my face to break out and irritated it. That is why I will not buy this again. because of the way my face is.</li>
            <li> Yes, Gillette actually makes a shaving product that costs less than $35 per pack. These are solid razors with no discernible pros/cons. The price is right, the shave is good... what else could you ask for.</li>
            <li> I bought a sampler pack and these were in it. Out of all of the brands, these razors provided me with the best feeling shave. They seemed to stay sharper longer and left me with little to no razor burn. Everyone has different skin and therefor different razors will work differently. These have worked the best for me so far and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> An extremely smooth shave. I have used these with my safety razor &amp; my shavette. They provide an effortless glide.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new brand of razors and headed to these. For years I have used derby razors, however, I am now a huge fan of these. They last longer and are just the right sharpness for my beard</li>
            <li> I I wanted the green packs, got the grey ones. Not sure if their&#x27;s a difference however my face sure feels the difference.</li>
            <li> Still wish blades of this type would last a little longer, only getting 4 to 5 shaves out of them. They&#x27;re good blades regardless.</li>
            <li> Best blades I have ever used, from India. Better than the Russian green. My go to blade for a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Great, sharp Russian blades</li>
            <li> Make sure you know which 7 O&#x27;Clock razor blades you are getting.  There are only 2 types of blades labelled Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock in a GREEN box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Permasharp Stainless are made in India&lt;br /&gt;Super Stainless are made in Russia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a distinct difference between the two types of razor blades.  They are not the same, and many people buy the wrong one due to the color of the box being the same color for both. The image, and description on this particular item are completly wrong.  Make sure you know which one you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For the curious here are the different types of Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock razor blades;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERMASHARP STAINLESS - Made in India - Green Box&lt;br /&gt;SUPER PLATINUM - Made in India - Black Box&lt;br /&gt;SUPER STAINLESS - Made in Russia - Green Box&lt;br /&gt;SUPER PLATINUM - Made in Russia - Blue Box&lt;br /&gt;SHARPEDGE - Made In Russia - Yellow Box</li>
            <li> These are my favorite for my 1977 razor.  Gillette India still makes a high quality blade that lasts about 7 days.  Well done and I will keep buying until they stop making, the razor breaks, or when I die.  Careful on first shave, they are very, very sharp!</li>
            <li> Nice Russian blades. I thought they were sharper, but anyway they are OK.</li>
            <li> i love these blades! my order came with 5 boxes of 7 in it so that was a bonus!</li>
            <li> I received my package with only 2 50 blades with room for 5. In the photo there is 5. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice blades, work good for more senstive skins, even with a thick beard.</li>
            <li> The Bad News is that these are indeed, as other reviewers have pointed out, the Indian manufactured &amp;#34;Permasharp&amp;#34; blades, not the Russian made &amp;#34;Super Stainless&amp;#34;, which also come in a lime green box. The Good News is that they are actually better and sharper than the Russian blades. Excellent blades for the money.</li>
            <li> Wrong blades. These are made in India. Returned.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite razors</li>
            <li> Best de blades in my opinion, not overly sharp and not dull either, perfect shave every time even with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing glamorous about this blade other than it gets the job done. Blade wears out in about 7-8 shaves.</li>
            <li> Good blade, nice and sharp.  Price is reasonable.  As with any blade it certainly depends on the razor and technique.  I prefer a couple of others but, that doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t work well for you.</li>
            <li> After going to a safety blade, I&#x27;ve never gone back to cartridge razors. I learned that domestic cartridge razor providers sacrifice sharpness and  blade metallurgy (ability to stay sharp and hold an edge longer). I wasn&#x27;t sure which safety blade to pick and ordered a multipack of a variety of manufacturers. This one was 2nd only to the Feather Stainless and a but more forgiving.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, except these worked for me. Not as sharp as Feathers, which I&#x27;ve used, but sometimes I need a change of pace. I probably get ~4 good shaves per blade, which is pretty decent for me.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying the blades made in India.  Unfortunately I received the Russian made blades.  I prefer not to buy Russian made items.  I contacted Giellette for guidance about how to find the Indian made blades, unfortunately they were of no help.  They said that someone else makes their DE blades.  They seem to have no control over any of their DE blades.</li>
