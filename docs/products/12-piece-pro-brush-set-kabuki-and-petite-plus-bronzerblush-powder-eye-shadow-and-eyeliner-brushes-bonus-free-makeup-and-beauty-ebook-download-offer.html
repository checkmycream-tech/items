            <li>Each professional makeup brush is great quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>I received a set of these brushes complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion</li>
            <li>testing them out one night and washing them, I was impressed to see that the bristles didn&#x27;t fall out like those you purchase from other retailers.</li>
            <li>Some very easily can be multi-use but its fun to play around and see which I like to work with.</li>
            <li>Next I love the Tapered Kabuki brush for my liquid foundation, it gives me such a great application and beautiful finish.</li>
            <li>Fine Eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are high quality brushes and looks very elegant .  </li>
            <li>All of the brushes are fantastic in applying cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic when dabbing, and using concealer.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using cheap brushes and these are so luxurious and plush that it almost felt wicked using them.</li>
            <li>All of the Kabuki bristles are super dense and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are very well made, great quality, offer so many options, and are simply well worth a purchase!</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>LOVE that it comes with a card explaining exactly what the brushes should be used for.</li>
            <li>My 3rd favorite is the petite flat angled brush which works wonderfully with my cream concealer.</li>
            <li>And all artists need the right tools to create their works!</li>
            <li>However after giving them a shot, I have found that they work perfectly fine, and are just the right</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to do a whole makeup look with these brushes and I didn&#x27;t need to use all 12 to do so.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I received this item at a discount, and this is my honest experience: These brushes are incredibly soft and durable.</li>
            <li>The wooden handle is comfortable to hold while doing my own face or a customers.</li>
            <li>I have many brushes in my collection, some that range from dollar store finds, all the way to luxury high end brands.</li>
            <li>Large selection of different size brushes, good for each application.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect it to come in such a nice package if you got it for a gift</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right, ALL of my makeup.</li>
            <li>My personal favorites are the Powder Brush, which not only is incredibly soft, but it buffs out my powder wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love the multiple sizes suitable for entire face or finishing details.</li>
            <li>I love that when you open the case there is a description of what each brush is used for .</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed when opening the pouch</li>
            <li>so I can see exactly what goes on them.</li>
            <li>The are super soft but firm enough to apply makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li>it would be ready right when you get it out the box.</li>
            <li>have washed these brushes, and I experienced very minimal shedding which is normal with new brushes.</li>
            <li>The fibers are super soft, the handles are substantial and they come is a pretty sequined bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will admit that upon first arrival, I thought that some of the &amp;#34;petite&amp;#34; brushes were quite large, and too large to use around the eye area.</li>
            <li>And it cleaned very easy unlike all other brushes.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and they pick up and apply powders and creams</li>
            <li>They are super soft and appy makeup really  welll and dont leave any streaks</li>
            <li>The brushes are very easy to clean, and do not take too long to dry</li>
            <li>They come with a pamphlet describing what each brush is used for which I found to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased 2 individual brushes from a different company and paid more jan what this 12-pc-set costs!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The brushes are extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t shed .</li>
            <li>bristles themselves are natural and synthetic, soft and some are dense and fluffy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I am a complete makeup lover.</li>
            <li>Inside the box is a very chic gold sequence bag that ties together with a yellow ribbon.</li>
            <li>but I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li>They were given to me as an unexpected gift</li>
            <li>I cannot give these a high enough recommendation!</li>
            <li>place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the brushes, have long black barrels with the Angel Sa Sa logo embossed on them that look iridescent when the light hits them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This 12 brush professional kit came in a yellow box with logo.</li>

            <li> Best, Best, Best Brushes Set ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nice, professional, strong, and has a beautiful bag!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift!</li>
            <li> My makeup brushes arrived fast in this beautiful elegant case . These brushes are everything it said it would be . They are high quality brushes and looks very elegant .  I love that when you open the case there is a description of what each brush is used for . I have  used them twice since I&#x27;ve received them and the brushes make my makeup look flawless. The brushes are extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t shed . I absolutely love my brushes !</li>
            <li> I received this product for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with the design and quality of these kabuki brushes. They are super soft and they pick up and apply powders and creams wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;I imagine they also work great with liquids as well but I only tested them with powders and cream products.&lt;br /&gt;The brush roll they come in is very beautiful and elegant with a wrap around ribbon with the Angel Sa Sa logo.&lt;br /&gt;The brush roll is like a yellow gold with sequence on the front and it is very sturdy and thick and it holds each brush into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the brushes, have long black barrels with the Angel Sa Sa logo embossed on them that look iridescent when the light hits them.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles themselves are natural and synthetic, soft and some are dense and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only brush that had lots of shedding was the powder brush and the kabuki tapered one had minimal shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that these brushes also has names on them to indicate what they are and what they can be used for but again you can use them how they suit your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kabuki Flat&lt;br /&gt;Kabuki Angled&lt;br /&gt;Kabuki Tapered&lt;br /&gt;Kabuki Flat Angled&lt;br /&gt;Petite Round&lt;br /&gt;Petite Angled&lt;br /&gt;Petite Tapered&lt;br /&gt;Petite Flat Angled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powder Brush&lt;br /&gt;Bronzer / Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;Eye Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;Ultra Fine Eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I realized I used the eyeliner brush as a lip brush lol , Hey! it still worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to do a whole makeup look with these brushes and I didn&#x27;t need to use all 12 to do so.&lt;br /&gt;Even if I did use a liquid foundation I wouldn&#x27;t need all 12 but having many brushes is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they would have included an eye blender since they do include an eyeshadow brush.&lt;br /&gt;So, I had to use the petite angled brush to blend but it did not feel right although it was great to use as a highlight for the browbone.</li>
            <li> After the purchase. I did not expect it to come in such a nice package if you got it for a gift it would be ready right when you get it out the box. The brushes and the pouch are absolutely gorgeous. The roll up pouch is so cute with gold sequence and string bow, and there is a brush for everything in here.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when opening the pouch it didn’t have any odor and it was ready to use, unlike other makeup brushes I bought in the past I had to wait for them to air out before I used them because they smelled so bad. The case has pockets for all the bushes&lt;br /&gt;After testing them out one night and washing them, I was impressed to see that the bristles didn&#x27;t fall out like those you purchase from other retailers. They retain their softness, but do a great job holding and applying makeup. 10 stars! I received mine at a discounted price, but that in no way affects my review. I recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging.  Every brush is individually packed.  Large selection of different size brushes, good for each application.  The brushes work well.  It is a great item.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I am a complete makeup lover. It is more than just making myself look better, but its also my art. And all artists need the right tools to create their works! I have many brushes in my collection, some that range from dollar store finds, all the way to luxury high end brands. You could call me a brush expert haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush kit from AngelSaSa is perfect for those who are new to makeup, or seasoned vets like myself. 12 beautifully designed brushes that are very well made, and have a attractive sleek look to them. And they come wrapped in a beautiful gold brush roll. Simply stunning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these brushes for the past week exclusively to apply all of my cosmetic products. Yes, that&#x27;s right, ALL of my makeup. From my liquid foundation, blush, bronzer, powder, concealer, eye shadow, eye liner, and primer. There is a brush that works for each product. My personal favorites are the Powder Brush, which not only is incredibly soft, but it buffs out my powder wonderfully. Next I love the Tapered Kabuki brush for my liquid foundation, it gives me such a great application and beautiful finish. My 3rd favorite is the petite flat angled brush which works wonderfully with my cream concealer. All of the brushes are fantastic in applying cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have washed these brushes, and I experienced very minimal shedding which is normal with new brushes. The brushes are very easy to clean, and do not take too long to dry either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that upon first arrival, I thought that some of the &amp;#34;petite&amp;#34; brushes were quite large, and too large to use around the eye area. However after giving them a shot, I have found that they work perfectly fine, and are just the right size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have to say that this brush kit from AngelSaSa are outstanding! They are very well made, great quality, offer so many options, and are simply well worth a purchase! I cannot give these a high enough recommendation! I&#x27;d give them a 10 star rating if I could!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.mmendation!

            <li> For the price these are great quality brushes. They come with a pamphlet describing what each brush is used for which I found to be very helpful. These brushes are the perfect tool for contouring and highlighting. You will not be disappointed with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discount, and this is my honest experience: These brushes are incredibly soft and durable. They spread evenly without clumping as other brushes. Fantastic when dabbing, and using concealer. I love that the bag has separate compartments yet rolls into a compact size. So great for traveling!!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with these brushes ... Smooth and leaves no hair on face. Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and love these brushes. The bristles are smooth, durable, and excellent quality. The wooden handle is comfortable to hold while doing my own face or a customers. I like that the edges are white so I can see exactly what goes on them. They are easy to clean. I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they come in a pretty gold sequined case which makes them an ideal gift.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very elegant gift bag holder that has a pocket for each brush. the bushes are very soft and very greatly angled applies makeup so great and smooth. And it cleaned very easy unlike all other brushes. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love it, the best brushes</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:eb42e07ad5050dfe95c0ca286965bfe8]] This 12 brush professional kit came in a yellow box with logo. Inside the box is a very chic gold sequence bag that ties together with a yellow ribbon. As the roll is spread out the makeup brushes are still covered and protected with a flap. The inside of the bag is a nice satin gold that compliments the sequence. Each professional makeup brush is great quality. All of the Kabuki bristles are super dense and easy to use. I love the multiple sizes suitable for entire face or finishing details. The varying tips; angled, tapered, and rounded all have specific tasks. Some very easily can be multi-use but its fun to play around and see which I like to work with. The kit came with a handy guide including pictures, brush names and descriptions for use.  Each brush also has the name on the handle as well. I received this product for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> I received a set of these brushes complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of these brushes. These are by far the best makeup brushes I have ever tried. The are super soft but firm enough to apply makeup perfectly. The bristles are firmly attached and I have not experienced any shedding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that it comes with a card explaining exactly what the brushes should be used for. Most of the time I&#x27;m guessing at how to use a brush. But not with this set.  I would recommend this for amateurs and professionals a like.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! Tried so many brands ... These are the perfect brushes to get makeup on easy . Leaves no hair on face! Love</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! I recently purchased 2 individual brushes from a different company and paid more jan what this 12-pc-set costs!! The value that I got with this set is unbelievable! The amount of brushes in this set, combined with the superb quality of each brush, makes this set an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these make-up brushes. They were given to me as an unexpected gift and I was shocked when I received them. I&#x27;m used to using cheap brushes and these are so luxurious and plush that it almost felt wicked using them.Also there is a brush for everything. The fibers are super soft, the handles are substantial and they come is a pretty sequined bag. They work so well I&#x27;ll probably be making up my face a lot more than I used to.</li>
