            <li>I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I will probably be a better judge of it during the summer.</li>

            <li>the tangles come right out !</li>
            <li>but the scent is way too sweet.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, but would prefer if the spray was more of a wider mist instead of a stream.</li>
            <li>Smells great and with just a few sprays and light brushing</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s not as sickeningly sweet now since the fragrance oil has tamed down that smell.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I use Luster, along with a Wet brush, and my life is much easier now.</li>
            <li>In the past, I would not use a leave in conditioner because my hair is fine and it would weigh it down.  </li>

            <li> In the past, I would not use a leave in conditioner because my hair is fine and it would weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need that much either, I have very thick long hair</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a lot of product - will last a long time!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now she can wear her natural curls down.</li>
            <li> but man, when you spray it, it goes is a straight thick stream.</li>
            <li> The leave-in conditioner is not heavy like some I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tone down my frizz enough to use alone.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I got a little nervous because it was so thick but tried it any way.  </li>
            <li> Even after it had dried and I got back to the house</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t run your fingers through your hair will enough it can look pretty crazy.</li>
            <li> My family uses this product every single day!!!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is now that I am about 3/4 down the spray is all clogged due to thickness &amp; doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s me a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this brand a few years.</li>
            <li> Before, it was a battle of tears and screams, which usually ended with me just throwing her hair into a tangled messy bun.</li>
            <li> Small company so like to support that.</li>
            <li> Those on the go, a surfer, swimmer or just for everyday use!</li>
            <li> Thick like lotion wish it was easier to spray</li>
            <li> way too thick to spray out</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical since I have really fine hair and everything makes it look horrible.</li>
            <li> It rehydrates without leaving any buildup behind.</li>

            <li> Love the product. When I first got it I got a little nervous because it was so thick but tried it any way.  It detangles great and added bonus is that it thickens my fine hair.  Smells great and does not way hair done.  Only complaint is now that I am about 3/4 down the spray is all clogged due to thickness &amp; doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I like it but the scent is way too sweet.  Like baked goods (sugar cookies or white cake?)  Not a scent I want in my hair!  I put a couple of drops of fragrance oil in it and it&#x27;s not as sickeningly sweet now since the fragrance oil has tamed down that smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s safe for color-treated hair.  It&#x27;s a good detangler.  Doubt I&#x27;ll purchase again, but it&#x27;s worth finishing the bottle (it&#x27;s a lot of product - will last a long time!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.  It&#x27;s a good leave-in conditioner.  Just depends on what you like re: scents for hair products.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for all ages - infant to adult! My family uses this product every single day!!! My hair has never looked this good.</li>
            <li> Smells like yummy bananas but man, when you spray it, it goes is a straight thick stream. No misting at ALL. If you don&#x27;t run your fingers through your hair will enough it can look pretty crazy. BUT it does condition.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It works great on my 4 year old&#x27;s long, curly hair. I can easily brush her hair after baths and swimming. I use Luster, along with a Wet brush, and my life is much easier now. Before, it was a battle of tears and screams, which usually ended with me just throwing her hair into a tangled messy bun. Now she can wear her natural curls down. And it smells great :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this brand a few years. Love the scents. Small company so like to support that. Works great</li>
            <li> It has literally been a life saver for me! Since my hair is fairly thick it has a tendency to tangle real quick whenever I&#x27;m in and out of the water. Luster fixes that for me, I can comb  through my hair so easily when I use it. It also helps with my natural wave in my hair! Plus my hair is always so shiny and smell amazing after I use it! I always get compliments on my hair ever since I started using Luster leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Those on the go, a surfer, swimmer or just for everyday use!</li>
            <li> Luster is a great product!!  I love the way it smells!!  TONIC also has an amazing all over body shampoo called 3some. I use it to shave and love the way it leaves my face and body feeling refreshed an clean. I highly recommend all TONIC products.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have tried. It rehydrates without leaving any buildup behind. It is also gentle enough that I use on our daughter daily as well. Such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Thick like lotion wish it was easier to spray</li>
            <li> Great product!!  In the past, I would not use a leave in conditioner because my hair is fine and it would weigh it down.  After trying Luster, my hair was shiny and looked healthy.  I have always put color on my hair, so this was a great find. I have recommended this product to both my girls.</li>
            <li> Smells great and with just a few sprays and light brushing the tangles come right out ! Shipping was quick too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Being a person who surfs all the time and spends most of the time under the sun, my&lt;br /&gt;Hair needs it. Smells good and makes my&lt;br /&gt;Hair happy! Just what I need for the summer! Luster is great!</li>
            <li> I like it.  It doesn&#x27;t tone down my frizz enough to use alone.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle b/c of my beach vacation and didn&#x27;t want the sun to damage my hair (suggestion from my stylist) I wasn&#x27;t sure which brand to purchase but I read the reviews and decided on Luster.  I always straighten my hair even though I have a natural wave/curl.  This conditioner made my hair look fabulous and I didn&#x27;t have to take the extra time to straighten.  I thought maybe it was the sun and ocean water but I use it now and again since I&#x27;ve been back (tomorrow is 9/1/14 and we returned at the end of June) and it still works great and I always get compliments.  I&#x27;m now on my 2nd bottle, this is now my brand. It&#x27;s totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I got this to take to the beach this year...I was a little skeptical since I have really fine hair and everything makes it look horrible. I used this to get the tangles out of my hair after swimming in the ocean and it worked wonderfully. It smells delightful and makes your hair feel amazing. Even after it had dried and I got back to the house my hair still smelled good and was so soft. It doesn&#x27;t take much! This bottle should last a while. I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like it, but would prefer if the spray was more of a wider mist instead of a stream. It smells so good and seems to be working. I will probably be a better judge of it during the summer.</li>
            <li> way too thick to spray out</li>
            <li> It works wonders in a pinch, I use it after I get out of the pool and it makes my hair nice and soft again and smells good too. You really don&#x27;t need that much either, I have very thick long hair and it only take&#x27;s me a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love Luster!  The leave-in conditioner is not heavy like some I have used in the past.  It smells great and leaves your hair nice and shiny.  It&#x27;s perfect for the beach, pool and after bath for the kids.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I love the water; ocean, lake or pool. This product is perfect for use after a swim; leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky. Would definitely recommend.</li>
