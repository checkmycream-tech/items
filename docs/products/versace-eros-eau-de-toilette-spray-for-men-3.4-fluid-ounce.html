            <li>Eros lasted me a good 6-8 hours</li>
            <li>best Gianni Versace herself designed the iconic bottle but whoever made this juice did a great job top notes are vanilla and tonka bean with a hint of mint</li>

            <li>The fragrance is amazing.</li>
            <li>This cologne is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, I was suspicious about buying something I&#x27;ve never smelled before</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I thought I had ordered an Eau de Parfum, but all it takes is one pump of the spray... trust me.</li>
            <li>I love it its just too good</li>
            <li>But everybody gets their own scents from cologne.</li>
            <li>prompt service, nice price.</li>
            <li>I thought I liked this cologne when I smelled a sample of it.  </li>
            <li>Nice to get Items as described and sent in a timely manner</li>
            <li>You will definitely be memorable in good way.</li>
            <li>the thing is I can return this kind of Item .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice bottle, scent had an powder after smell to it.</li>
            <li>None of the women&#x27;s fragrances I tried had the kind of sexuality I was looking for without being too floral or fruity.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, ordering online coupled with some of the reviews, I was somewhat concern.</li>
            <li>He really liked it</li>
            <li>Love the good price I got on it.  </li>
            <li>But still smelled nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, refined scent.</li>
            <li>Very good quality smell doesn&#x27;t fade off right away.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the first spray , let the top notes fade and this will be one of the best scents you own.</li>
            <li>have bought three bottles since it first came out .. smells very good</li>
            <li>My wife buy it for me and really like it happy wife happy life:)</li>
            <li>This fragrance is sweet with a hint of vanilla and not to mention great longevity on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert in the perfume department, but I can say this one smells pretty good!  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and is definitely an authentic product.</li>
            <li>I had used another versace cologne years ago and liked it, this one is even better.</li>
            <li>and I just want to eat him alive which works out perfectly for him.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t a full bottle!!</li>

            <li>He thought it was Ok too, so I got him a bottle for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>but it makes you feel more confident in your smell.</li>
            <li>I love this smell from this set.  </li>
            <li>Works its magic in night clubs.</li>
            <li>I love that it appeals both sexes.</li>
            <li>and they both love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it to buyers.</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I was able to give it to my boyfriend in another state.</li>
            <li>I found better price after</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and being a fragrance connoisseur I have quite an appreciation for the versace house.</li>
            <li>This is in my top 5 favorite colognes&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I went to Macy&#x27;s and tried all of the men&#x27;s scents and this was my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product, and the price u CANNOT BEAT!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>this is just an excellent daily cologne.</li>
            <li>but i am not one of those people to speak about the top notes of cedar or anything like that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Projection is ok on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Great cologne and much cheaper than retail stores.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent.  </li>
            <li>all means my favorite one he has.</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>My girl love it</li>
            <li>bought it for my boyfriend and we both love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell this cologne gives off</li>
            <li>I love this cologne on my husband.</li>
            <li>Personally I love it and will keep Versace Eros in my Summer rotation for years to come.</li>
            <li>It stays with you for most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell like a million bucks, this cologne isn&#x27;t for you, but if you want to smell really good and get tons of complements, you&#x27;ve come to the right place.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very unique and speaks of the quality of the versace brand.</li>
            <li>I personally love this smell, I first smelled it at my friends house (who payed a lot more for it; $65 for the 1.7 OZ) and loved it.</li>
            <li>He loved it very much.</li>
            <li>The product came very fast and was fairly priced.</li>
            <li>Bottle is nice, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I will say that this is a very good smelling cologne and one that i get several compliments on when i wear it.</li>
            <li>Smells really great, awesome scent for summer or for working out as sweat, as weird as it sounds, makes the scent even better</li>
            <li>most men&#x27;s cologne are prominent, bold, etc.</li>
            <li>This is definitely NOT a hot weather fragrance at all, this would be best used during the Fall, Winter and Spring seasons.</li>
            <li>Compare to other Versace colognes, this one is not the best</li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend this to someone who likes their colognes more powdery, spicy, unique and in your face.</li>
            <li>I receive Versace Eros very quickly .</li>
            <li>It smells way too strong, but the bottle looks cooler than the smell.</li>
            <li>but I would consider it if your looking for a strong presence cologne.</li>
            <li>It was so strong that I would put it on in the morning, ride my bike to work, work all day, and get cologne compliments on my bike ride home.</li>
            <li>It is a strong musk smell to me.  </li>
            <li>fragrance smells really nice, but it is pretty strong so go easy on the trigger with this one.</li>
            <li>It has very clean scent and yet a distinct smell that you don&#x27;t get from many colognes.  </li>
            <li>Sweet notes, but still inspires masculinity with a bit of sophisticated sex appeal.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, it&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
            <li>great always has been just bought my third</li>
            <li>It was 18.00 cheaper than duty free.</li>
            <li>Great smell ladies cant get enough! !</li>
            <li>This cologne is so smooth, it smells like heavens clouds.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps persuade you that this is one you&#x27;ll enjoy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell as nice as it does in a magazine sample.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>As a 19 year old I wanted basically a smell that would be &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; but not make me smell like an old man, this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li>Love it but easy to put to much on!</li>
            <li>Very nice last along time.</li>
            <li>cologne is very strong; so much that the smell of the cologne you will notice after hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deffinently worth getting!</li>
            <li>You know love at first sight</li>
            <li>Ordered 3.4oz bottle and not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>this is a unique smell that cools you.</li>
            <li>and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this at Sephora but saw that the price was almost 50% cheaper here on Amazon</li>
            <li>34;FRESH MEN SPORT CLEAN SCENT&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>overall Versace Eros is a great fragrance, definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>It has such a pleasant distinctive smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, strong and sweet.</li>
            <li>rather it be business or with a special someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Smells good and stays on for entire day</li>
            <li>Sweet smelling fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>And while this land a selling point, it does come in a really cool body.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t go full to your senses because you have became accustom to the smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is so cool.</li>
            <li>It is like a sweet mint with a touch of moss and vanilla.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soft scent</li>
            <li>Not a bad cologne by any means.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it for any man who wants a great smelling cologne that has a lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Love it not too strong and not too little just right!!!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have tried this scent but really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The product came in the mail within 2 days and overall I was very satisfied with the product and service</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>very clean and fresh with a little sexy :)</li>
            <li>The price is great compared to other places, plus shipping was very fast..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll skip my two cents and simply say I love this scent for the Summer and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but not as good as the other Versace colognes I have.</li>
            <li>The Longevity is amazing and you only need one spray !!!.</li>
            <li>Amazing cologne, I had nothing but compliments, especially women.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, love to wear it round the year.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this for him as a gift when he was given a sample vial of it and ran out- the fact that he actually used up all of the sample was out of character for him, so I knew he liked it.</li>
            <li>The service from the company was good as well; received product as expected.</li>
            <li>It does smell fresh.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far since Usher Silver was discontinued.</li>
            <li>Youthful but mature and confident.</li>
            <li>Well worth the priced.</li>
            <li>I love this Versace because it last all day and the fragrent is outstanding I would more than likely pucrhase this again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Olfactive Family: Fresh, Oriental, Woody</li>
            <li>It is described as passionate, sexy, and strong, and that spelled perfection for me.</li>
            <li>Right up there with my fave cologne Chrome..........</li>
            <li>thixs time ut was right kn the monehy.</li>
            <li>This cologne is a very manly smell to it while maintaining the sweet cooling smell.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet musky smell that I actually really enjoy and sometimes has an aphrodisiac aromatherapy affect but two people said it smelled like black licorice to them and that wasn&#x27;t appealing.</li>
            <li>very good, but a bit weak.</li>
            <li>I paid $48 for a 3.4 oz bottle which is about $30 less than retail at say macy&#x27;s so it is a good deal.</li>
            <li>is only a few feet with 1 spray; although it is VERY STRONG it doesn&#x27;t project as good as it could.</li>
            <li>The packaging too, of course is super masculine and cool.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, but can be a little overpowering.</li>
            <li>Same exact one I paid way more for in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>His first response was &amp;#34; I like the way the bottle looks&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t a cologne kinda guy, and I&#x27;m not big into most men&#x27;s fragrances either.</li>
            <li>I tried this cologne out in the mall first before I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m sure I will get the same reaction</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and my wife love the way i smell with it</li>
            <li>With that said, this is more of a winter wonderland cologne, I usually only wear it exclusively in Nov, Dec, Jan and Fab when the weather is below 20F.</li>
            <li>Expecting a lot of complements from the ladies with this one ;))</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Received this perfume and feel in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li>I like it, exactly like the one which is in sephora store</li>
            <li>This is my first cologne from the versace brand</li>
            <li>This is most definitely not that.</li>
            <li>Item was well packaged and was exactly what he wanted.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that this purchase was at a much better price than in the stores.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he loves it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>I keep comparing it to the store I first saw this at.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Definitely a &amp;#34;dressier&amp;#34; cologne, not something I&#x27;d wear looking for a crisp, clean, fresh scent</li>
            <li>Afterwards I bought a bottle on amazon, and everyone who has said anything was positive about the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a really confident woman with a punchy personality, and I felt like this fragrance had enough sweetness to get away with some femininity while also communicating the kind of unabashed bravado I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This scent is extremely versatile and can not say enough great things about this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Of course, you really can&#x27;t go into purchasing this without smelling it first, so head to a mall or something and give it a sniff.</li>
            <li>This scent holds very well in the humidity and hot sun.</li>
            <li>it smells good but the scent doesnt last long a hr max</li>
            <li>Smells great for every occasion soft and long lasting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a connoisseur of fine smells, but it definitely isn&#x27;t something fruity or girly</li>
            <li>Upon first spray it is smooth, clean and a little fruity...</li>
            <li>It smells great, and all you need is a few sprays to last you for almost all day</li>
            <li>You can get this cologne much cheaper:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and it was much cheaper than in the dept stores.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Almost too much.  </li>
            <li>You have to be very judicious with how much you apply.</li>
            <li>My wife likes how it smells on me and that&#x27;s really all that matters.  </li>
            <li>He puts on the smallest amount he can because it&#x27;s very overpowering.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not going to wear very often.</li>
            <li>It is the real deal- with a discount (about 30 dollars cheaper)</li>
            <li>too much will make you smell like the cologne lounge at the shopping malls.  </li>
            <li>I really have.</li>
            <li>I revived my package the day after I ordered it, I was amazed at how fast the shipment was.</li>
            <li>so feel free to check my reviews later on.</li>
            <li>Thank you sooo much.</li>
            <li>FAst shipment and I&#x27;m&lt;br</li>
            <li>As advertised, would buy again - Thanks AAA+++</li>
            <li>... And get ready for the ladies to chase you.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves the smell.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The real deal</li>
            <li>Favorite smell, came just as expected.</li>
            <li>Which I really use in the winter and to partys because projection is beast mode on my skin chemistry.</li>
            <li>iitwatbe real thing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>takes one spray to last through the next 2 days, but not overpowering.(might be a little to some on the first spray, as well as every time you put it on, let it breathe first before totally oversaturating your sense of smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starts off lightly spicy,outdoorsy,with a hint of citrus to bold warm sweet smell (</li>
            <li>This is defiantly more of a winter night cologne but could be worn in other seasons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is simple yet unique.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Smell&#x27;s crisp &amp; classy.</li>
            <li>The version sent to me doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long, and this one has a very strong smell when you first spray it.</li>
            <li>I would use this lightly as it holds for a very long time and</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s bold and manly at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Going into most stores like Sephora and Macy&#x27;s, most of their retail workers would shy you away from it because if you plan to use this as your year round cologne they might make you go for a YSL that is more for all seasons.</li>
            <li>Worth waiting for 3 business days and only 42.00 with taxes vs 75.00 plus taxes.  </li>
            <li>I have a few more to try out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s complex and pairs really nicely with my skin, toning down even more into a masculine-feminine mix of vanilla and cedarwood that combines to create a round, smooth coconutty aura.  </li>
            <li>The smell is subtle but very sexy, and classy.</li>
            <li>Very similar to a Gucci cologne I purchased in the past, which fortunately I did enjoy</li>
            <li>It is a new fragrance for him.</li>
            <li>and I have a gathering of where we meet new friends.</li>
            <li>So for those who live in a season-less area, I would say go for another Versace like Man Eau Fraiche or Pour Homme.</li>
            <li>Came in within 3 days and in a brand new condition.</li>
            <li>I like this perfume when I am live in my country but when come to USA</li>
            <li>I spray half a spray in the air and walk through it, and it still smells strong when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Bought this last year at Macy&#x27;s for a pretty penny...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unbelievable how many compliments I get from this.</li>
            <li>An awesome product and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than first indicated.</li>
            <li>This is pretty strong and I suggest the smallest spray possible and it last a long time!  </li>
            <li>This may sound a bit odd but for me I smell sort of an Apple smell deeper in chocolate.</li>
            <li>I got this from john bull; a store in a mall near by and the first day I wore this the ladies couldn&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li>Luckily I received a small sample spray w/ another cologne order earlier this year and instantly fell in love w/ Versace Eros.</li>
            <li>but now i can confirmed it definitely dosent stay long at all!</li>
            <li>Kind of weak.</li>
            <li>ONLY reason why I gave it 2 stars and not 5 is because of the shipping, I did receive my order fairly quick, but when I received it my cologne was way over-heated like somebody had left it out to bake in the sun, and was leaking therefore</li>
            <li>This is no strong perfume, is very mild.  </li>
            <li>and I bought it directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just this one so far and 2 others.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see people noticing it unless they smell your shirt directly.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying directly from amazon to ensure the authenticity.</li>
            <li>A young professional could pull this off in the healthcare setting (if permitted).</li>
            <li>Oh, dat dry down is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>So I am 15 years old and wanted a fresh sent that could be worn at dances and other party like atmospheres.</li>
            <li>I bought it in April but just opened it when my older one was finally finished.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying out different colognes and 5 stars is not common for me.</li>
            <li>(makes a good repellent in that case which is sad because the scent is awesome)</li>
            <li>, this is definitely a manly, refined, and classy smell.</li>
            <li>you get a Macy&#x27;s or any other large retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is considerably weaker and not long lasting.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for flirty, I wanted suave, slick, and bold.  </li>
            <li>Like always, it was also much cheaper through Amazon than buying at Macy&#x27;s or some other retail store.  </li>
            <li>smell lasts for not a long time</li>
            <li>waste your money on this garbage, it smells exactly like Vanilla extract and not quality cologne.</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it so far is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.</li>

            <li> best Gianni Versace herself designed the iconic bottle but whoever made this juice did a great job top notes are vanilla and tonka bean with a hint of mint</li>

            <li> Love everything about this brand and smell, it smells all day and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is amazing.</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, I was suspicious about buying something I&#x27;ve never smelled before</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I thought I had ordered an Eau de Parfum, but all it takes is one pump of the spray... trust me.</li>
            <li> I love it its just too good</li>
            <li> But everybody gets their own scents from cologne.</li>
            <li> prompt service, nice price.</li>
            <li> I thought I liked this cologne when I smelled a sample of it.  </li>
            <li> Nice to get Items as described and sent in a timely manner</li>
            <li> You will definitely be memorable in good way.</li>
            <li> the thing is I can return this kind of Item .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice bottle, scent had an powder after smell to it.</li>
            <li> None of the women&#x27;s fragrances I tried had the kind of sexuality I was looking for without being too floral or fruity.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, ordering online coupled with some of the reviews, I was somewhat concern.</li>
            <li> He really liked it</li>
            <li> Love the good price I got on it.  </li>
            <li> But still smelled nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, refined scent.</li>
            <li> Very good quality smell doesn&#x27;t fade off right away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the first spray , let the top notes fade and this will be one of the best scents you own.</li>
            <li> have bought three bottles since it first came out .. smells very good</li>
            <li> My wife buy it for me and really like it happy wife happy life:)</li>
            <li> This fragrance is sweet with a hint of vanilla and not to mention great longevity on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert in the perfume department, but I can say this one smells pretty good!  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is definitely an authentic product.</li>
            <li> I had used another versace cologne years ago and liked it, this one is even better.</li>
            <li> and I just want to eat him alive which works out perfectly for him.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a full bottle!!</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping and smells really good</li>

            <li> I went to Macy&#x27;s and tried all of the men&#x27;s scents and this was my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Such a great product, and the price u CANNOT BEAT!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> this is just an excellent daily cologne.</li>
            <li> but i am not one of those people to speak about the top notes of cedar or anything like that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Projection is ok on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Great cologne and much cheaper than retail stores.</li>

            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> My girl love it</li>
            <li> bought it for my boyfriend and we both love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell this cologne gives off</li>
            <li> I love this cologne on my husband.</li>
            <li> Personally I love it and will keep Versace Eros in my Summer rotation for years to come.</li>
            <li> It stays with you for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like a million bucks, this cologne isn&#x27;t for you, but if you want to smell really good and get tons of complements, you&#x27;ve come to the right place.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very unique and speaks of the quality of the versace brand.</li>
            <li> I personally love this smell, I first smelled it at my friends house (who payed a lot more for it; $65 for the 1.7 OZ) and loved it.</li>
            <li> He loved it very much.</li>
            <li> The product came very fast and was fairly priced.</li>
            <li> Bottle is nice, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I will say that this is a very good smelling cologne and one that i get several compliments on when i wear it.</li>
            <li> Smells really great, awesome scent for summer or for working out as sweat, as weird as it sounds, makes the scent even better</li>
            <li> most men&#x27;s cologne are prominent, bold, etc.</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT a hot weather fragrance at all, this would be best used during the Fall, Winter and Spring seasons.</li>
            <li> Compare to other Versace colognes, this one is not the best</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this to someone who likes their colognes more powdery, spicy, unique and in your face.</li>
            <li> I receive Versace Eros very quickly .</li>
            <li> It smells way too strong, but the bottle looks cooler than the smell.</li>
            <li> but I would consider it if your looking for a strong presence cologne.</li>
            <li> It was so strong that I would put it on in the morning, ride my bike to work, work all day, and get cologne compliments on my bike ride home.</li>
            <li> It is a strong musk smell to me.  </li>
            <li> fragrance smells really nice, but it is pretty strong so go easy on the trigger with this one.</li>
            <li> It has very clean scent and yet a distinct smell that you don&#x27;t get from many colognes.  </li>
            <li> Sweet notes, but still inspires masculinity with a bit of sophisticated sex appeal.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, it&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
            <li> great always has been just bought my third</li>
            <li> It was 18.00 cheaper than duty free.</li>
            <li> Great smell ladies cant get enough! !</li>
            <li> This cologne is so smooth, it smells like heavens clouds.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps persuade you that this is one you&#x27;ll enjoy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell as nice as it does in a magazine sample.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> As a 19 year old I wanted basically a smell that would be &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; but not make me smell like an old man, this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it but easy to put to much on!</li>
            <li> Very nice last along time.</li>
            <li> cologne is very strong; so much that the smell of the cologne you will notice after hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deffinently worth getting!</li>
            <li> You know love at first sight</li>
            <li> Ordered 3.4oz bottle and not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> this is a unique smell that cools you.</li>
            <li> and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this at Sephora but saw that the price was almost 50% cheaper here on Amazon</li>
            <li> 34;FRESH MEN SPORT CLEAN SCENT&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> overall Versace Eros is a great fragrance, definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> It has such a pleasant distinctive smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, strong and sweet.</li>
            <li> rather it be business or with a special someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Smells good and stays on for entire day</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> And while this land a selling point, it does come in a really cool body.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t go full to your senses because you have became accustom to the smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is so cool.</li>
            <li> It is like a sweet mint with a touch of moss and vanilla.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soft scent</li>
            <li> Not a bad cologne by any means.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it for any man who wants a great smelling cologne that has a lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Love it not too strong and not too little just right!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have tried this scent but really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> The product came in the mail within 2 days and overall I was very satisfied with the product and service</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> very clean and fresh with a little sexy :)</li>
            <li> The price is great compared to other places, plus shipping was very fast..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll skip my two cents and simply say I love this scent for the Summer and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but not as good as the other Versace colognes I have.</li>
            <li> The Longevity is amazing and you only need one spray !!!.</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne, I had nothing but compliments, especially women.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, love to wear it round the year.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for him as a gift when he was given a sample vial of it and ran out- the fact that he actually used up all of the sample was out of character for him, so I knew he liked it.</li>
            <li> The service from the company was good as well; received product as expected.</li>
            <li> It does smell fresh.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far since Usher Silver was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Youthful but mature and confident.</li>
            <li> Well worth the priced.</li>
            <li> I love this Versace because it last all day and the fragrent is outstanding I would more than likely pucrhase this again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Olfactive Family: Fresh, Oriental, Woody</li>
            <li> It is described as passionate, sexy, and strong, and that spelled perfection for me.</li>
            <li> Right up there with my fave cologne Chrome..........</li>
            <li> thixs time ut was right kn the monehy.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a very manly smell to it while maintaining the sweet cooling smell.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet musky smell that I actually really enjoy and sometimes has an aphrodisiac aromatherapy affect but two people said it smelled like black licorice to them and that wasn&#x27;t appealing.</li>
            <li> very good, but a bit weak.</li>
            <li> I paid $48 for a 3.4 oz bottle which is about $30 less than retail at say macy&#x27;s so it is a good deal.</li>
            <li> is only a few feet with 1 spray; although it is VERY STRONG it doesn&#x27;t project as good as it could.</li>
            <li> The packaging too, of course is super masculine and cool.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, but can be a little overpowering.</li>
            <li> Same exact one I paid way more for in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> His first response was &amp;#34; I like the way the bottle looks&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t a cologne kinda guy, and I&#x27;m not big into most men&#x27;s fragrances either.</li>
            <li> I tried this cologne out in the mall first before I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m sure I will get the same reaction</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and my wife love the way i smell with it</li>
            <li> With that said, this is more of a winter wonderland cologne, I usually only wear it exclusively in Nov, Dec, Jan and Fab when the weather is below 20F.</li>
            <li> Expecting a lot of complements from the ladies with this one ;))</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Received this perfume and feel in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li> I like it, exactly like the one which is in sephora store</li>
            <li> This is my first cologne from the versace brand</li>
            <li> This is most definitely not that.</li>
            <li> Item was well packaged and was exactly what he wanted.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that this purchase was at a much better price than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he loves it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> I keep comparing it to the store I first saw this at.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Definitely a &amp;#34;dressier&amp;#34; cologne, not something I&#x27;d wear looking for a crisp, clean, fresh scent</li>
            <li> Afterwards I bought a bottle on amazon, and everyone who has said anything was positive about the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really confident woman with a punchy personality, and I felt like this fragrance had enough sweetness to get away with some femininity while also communicating the kind of unabashed bravado I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This scent is extremely versatile and can not say enough great things about this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Of course, you really can&#x27;t go into purchasing this without smelling it first, so head to a mall or something and give it a sniff.</li>
            <li> This scent holds very well in the humidity and hot sun.</li>
            <li> it smells good but the scent doesnt last long a hr max</li>
            <li> Smells great for every occasion soft and long lasting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a connoisseur of fine smells, but it definitely isn&#x27;t something fruity or girly</li>
            <li> Upon first spray it is smooth, clean and a little fruity...</li>
            <li> It smells great, and all you need is a few sprays to last you for almost all day</li>
            <li> You can get this cologne much cheaper:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and it was much cheaper than in the dept stores.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Almost too much.  </li>
            <li> You have to be very judicious with how much you apply.</li>
            <li> My wife likes how it smells on me and that&#x27;s really all that matters.  </li>
            <li> He puts on the smallest amount he can because it&#x27;s very overpowering.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not going to wear very often.</li>
            <li> It is the real deal- with a discount (about 30 dollars cheaper)</li>
            <li> too much will make you smell like the cologne lounge at the shopping malls.  </li>
            <li> I really have.</li>
            <li> I revived my package the day after I ordered it, I was amazed at how fast the shipment was.</li>
            <li> so feel free to check my reviews later on.</li>
            <li> Thank you sooo much.</li>
            <li> FAst shipment and I&#x27;m&lt;br</li>
            <li> As advertised, would buy again - Thanks AAA+++</li>
            <li> ... And get ready for the ladies to chase you.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The real deal</li>
            <li> Favorite smell, came just as expected.</li>
            <li> Which I really use in the winter and to partys because projection is beast mode on my skin chemistry.</li>
            <li> iitwatbe real thing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> takes one spray to last through the next 2 days, but not overpowering.(might be a little to some on the first spray, as well as every time you put it on, let it breathe first before totally oversaturating your sense of smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starts off lightly spicy,outdoorsy,with a hint of citrus to bold warm sweet smell (</li>
            <li> This is defiantly more of a winter night cologne but could be worn in other seasons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is simple yet unique.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Smell&#x27;s crisp &amp; classy.</li>
            <li> The version sent to me doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long, and this one has a very strong smell when you first spray it.</li>
            <li> I would use this lightly as it holds for a very long time and</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s bold and manly at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Going into most stores like Sephora and Macy&#x27;s, most of their retail workers would shy you away from it because if you plan to use this as your year round cologne they might make you go for a YSL that is more for all seasons.</li>
            <li> Worth waiting for 3 business days and only 42.00 with taxes vs 75.00 plus taxes.  </li>
            <li> I have a few more to try out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s complex and pairs really nicely with my skin, toning down even more into a masculine-feminine mix of vanilla and cedarwood that combines to create a round, smooth coconutty aura.  </li>
            <li> The smell is subtle but very sexy, and classy.</li>
            <li> Very similar to a Gucci cologne I purchased in the past, which fortunately I did enjoy</li>
            <li> It is a new fragrance for him.</li>
            <li> and I have a gathering of where we meet new friends.</li>
            <li> So for those who live in a season-less area, I would say go for another Versace like Man Eau Fraiche or Pour Homme.</li>
            <li> Came in within 3 days and in a brand new condition.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume when I am live in my country but when come to USA</li>
            <li> I spray half a spray in the air and walk through it, and it still smells strong when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Bought this last year at Macy&#x27;s for a pretty penny...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable how many compliments I get from this.</li>
            <li> An awesome product and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than first indicated.</li>
            <li> This is pretty strong and I suggest the smallest spray possible and it last a long time!  </li>
            <li> This may sound a bit odd but for me I smell sort of an Apple smell deeper in chocolate.</li>
            <li> I got this from john bull; a store in a mall near by and the first day I wore this the ladies couldn&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> Luckily I received a small sample spray w/ another cologne order earlier this year and instantly fell in love w/ Versace Eros.</li>
            <li> but now i can confirmed it definitely dosent stay long at all!</li>
            <li> Kind of weak.</li>
            <li> ONLY reason why I gave it 2 stars and not 5 is because of the shipping, I did receive my order fairly quick, but when I received it my cologne was way over-heated like somebody had left it out to bake in the sun, and was leaking therefore</li>
            <li> This is no strong perfume, is very mild.  </li>
            <li> and I bought it directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just this one so far and 2 others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see people noticing it unless they smell your shirt directly.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend buying directly from amazon to ensure the authenticity.</li>
            <li> A young professional could pull this off in the healthcare setting (if permitted).</li>
            <li> Oh, dat dry down is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> So I am 15 years old and wanted a fresh sent that could be worn at dances and other party like atmospheres.</li>
            <li> I bought it in April but just opened it when my older one was finally finished.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out different colognes and 5 stars is not common for me.</li>
            <li> (makes a good repellent in that case which is sad because the scent is awesome)</li>
            <li> , this is definitely a manly, refined, and classy smell.</li>
            <li> you get a Macy&#x27;s or any other large retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is considerably weaker and not long lasting.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for flirty, I wanted suave, slick, and bold.  </li>
            <li> Like always, it was also much cheaper through Amazon than buying at Macy&#x27;s or some other retail store.  </li>
            <li> smell lasts for not a long time</li>
            <li> waste your money on this garbage, it smells exactly like Vanilla extract and not quality cologne.</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it so far is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high for the quality as well...</li>
            <li> It has a fresh subtle scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> i was smelling alcohol and it will not last long!</li>
            <li> My dog likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> We went to dinner the other night and the next morning</li>
            <li> The scent also lasts very long which is unsurprising.</li>
            <li> 9 out of 10 people liked this one me but 1 of the black licorice ones hated it so much.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is going to be bait for all the single ladies.</li>
            <li> Every single it came out</li>
            <li> The mint kicks up in the middle but the dry down.</li>
            <li> Now, I can barely smell it a few hours after putting it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a long lasting cologne and you only need a few sprays because the cologne is a bit on the heavy side on the scent department.</li>
            <li> If you get this product and you think it&#x27;s a knockoff because you get a big hint of vanilla extract, well you will actually be wrong because this does have a have a large vanilla presence to it and</li>
            <li> Beware not much is needed..</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> no whole day scent</li>
            <li> Just one thing - a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have never smelt this sent before and bought it off of YouTube reviews and other reviewers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the bottle was missing just a little bit of cologne and there was 2 chips on the bottle thats the reason I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The package was very careful.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will always be great.this is hands down my favourite cologne</li>
            <li> stars hands down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to resort to dabbing it on slightly.</li>
            <li> the smell didn&#x27;t get the compliments I&#x27;ve received in the past from using other colognes.</li>
            <li> I buy my in December 2014, i wrote my review after wearing it for few weeks</li>
            <li> Well I smell no lemon in this cologne but rather a heavy mint with touches of vanilla.</li>
            <li> but she could smell it and disliked it.</li>
            <li> There was a story behind me buying this item and it brought back a memory for me!</li>
            <li> Green Apple&lt;br /&gt;Heart:</li>
            <li> It gets me quite a few compliments when I wear it as well.</li>
            <li> My husband usually wears Aqua Di Gio, which I personally hate- it is too strong and has an almost gasoline smell to me.</li>
            <li> If you like it, buy it online for MUCH less!</li>
            <li> The recent Amazon supply of 3.4 oz seems to be weaker (maybe fake).</li>
            <li> I have a small collection of fragrences</li>
            <li> A luxury I don&#x27;t have so usually rely on my instinct and scent notes.</li>
            <li> I am a person who has never enjoyed colognes but I am now a convert.</li>
            <li> It could also be worn casually but not spicy enough to be a night time scent in my opinion.</li>
            <li> my bottle was not completely full, I was not happy about that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> colognes that are so common.</li>
            <li> Seemed weak and</li>
            <li> Shopped around and Amazon was the least expensive.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a bootleg version of this.  </li>
            <li> The perfume I have received has obly 25% of fragrance , I don&#x27;t know if its an Old Inventory , But very disappointed</li>
            <li> made the mistake of buying this as a blind buy because the rating on Amazon is 4.7 out of 5...</li>
            <li> Bought this blindly without having smelled.</li>
            <li> so I can usually blindly buy a cologne knowing whether or not I&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> The ladies will go CRAZY over this on you men.....  </li>
            <li> Cold and usable for every season</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of leaving it in the cold for 4 hours in my trunk inside my luggage and the scent changed.</li>
            <li> NEVER leave cologne in cold weather.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know who is the supplier , i am very sad , because from now on i will buy perfume @</li>
            <li> The box is very difficult to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please buy you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> VERY NASTY...</li>

            <li> Same exact one I paid way more for in Macy&#x27;s. So why not smell good and save some money.</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling. Very similar to a Gucci cologne I purchased in the past, which fortunately I did enjoy and so I like this one. This is a great cologne, it&#x27;s unlike those (personally) annoying standard &amp;#34;FRESH MEN SPORT CLEAN SCENT&amp;#34; colognes that are so common. I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing. Worth the price. The smell doesn&#x27;t fade. I washed my clothes and It still had the smell of the cologne. Many people compliment me and ask what type of cologne I&#x27;m wearing. It&#x27;s deffinently worth getting!</li>
            <li> it smell great. definitely in my top 3</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for this cologne, but it is STRONG! I spray half a spray in the air and walk through it, and it still smells strong when I put it on. I&#x27;m going to resort to dabbing it on slightly.</li>
            <li> You can get this cologne much cheaper:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to the store and buy some vanilla extract and put that on like cologne and there you have Versace Eros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of buying this as a blind buy because the rating on Amazon is 4.7 out of 5... But now I look and see on Fragrantica.com it is a 3.6 out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage, it smells exactly like Vanilla extract and not quality cologne.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. This fragrance is going to be bait for all the single ladies. Time to hit up Tinder, Tagged and POF!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely LOVED this cologne...</li>
            <li> My husband is in love with this cologne. He got the sample and people smell him in the elevators and they always tell him he smells good what is that. I cant wait until i give him this for christmas. He&#x27;s been dying for this. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the cologne and the speed in which it got here</li>
            <li> Great Price! I receive Versace Eros very quickly .</li>
            <li> Bought as gift...my son cody loved it!</li>
            <li> Best cologne I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> This fragrance was great!!!!!  My husband wears it every day, so he loves it to. It is a new fragrance for him. I think it is yummy!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife buy it for me and really like it happy wife happy life:)</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is definitely an authentic product. Bought this last year at Macy&#x27;s for a pretty penny... Worth waiting for 3 business days and only 42.00 with taxes vs 75.00 plus taxes.  No brianer.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne ! I bought it for my bf for Christmas. His first response was &amp;#34; I like the way the bottle looks&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really good product, 100% recommended... I just love it</li>
            <li> This is a great scent for the man in your life!!</li>
            <li> This smells awesome!  My husband loves it and it was much cheaper than in the dept stores.  Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> Love it! Smell so good on my husband!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my favorite.  Seemed weak and the smell didn&#x27;t get the compliments I&#x27;ve received in the past from using other colognes.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s perfect if you&#x27;re looking to impress for those special occasion night outs rather it be business or with a special someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance smells really nice, but it is pretty strong so go easy on the trigger with this one. 2 sprays will do the trick. This is definitely NOT a hot weather fragrance at all, this would be best used during the Fall, Winter and Spring seasons. Eros lasted me a good 6-8 hours so I was very satisfied with it&#x27;s longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY reason why I gave it 2 stars and not 5 is because of the shipping, I did receive my order fairly quick, but when I received it my cologne was way over-heated like somebody had left it out to bake in the sun, and was leaking therefore my bottle was not completely full, I was not happy about that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall Versace Eros is a great fragrance, definitely worth a try. I give it a 8 out of 10.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loved it very much.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! great scent lasts for ever!</li>
            <li> Will recommend it for playboys</li>
            <li> You know love at first sight, well this fragrances is... My husband loves this, I&#x27;ve bought 2 bottles for him already.. The price is great compared to other places, plus shipping was very fast.. This scent is extremely versatile and can not say enough great things about this fragrance. To me it&#x27;s SEXY!!!!! The ladies will go CRAZY over this on you men.....  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the first spray , let the top notes fade and this will be one of the best scents you own.The Longevity is amazing and you only need one spray !!!. I will continue to purchase this for my husband.</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t a cologne kinda guy, and I&#x27;m not big into most men&#x27;s fragrances either. However, I LOVE this one! I bought this for him as a gift when he was given a sample vial of it and ran out- the fact that he actually used up all of the sample was out of character for him, so I knew he liked it. It&#x27;s a simple, clean scent. Not too &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34;. Perhaps a bit citrusy. Of course, you really can&#x27;t go into purchasing this without smelling it first, so head to a mall or something and give it a sniff. If you like it, buy it online for MUCH less!</li>
            <li> Shipping was two days. No problem. It did take an additional two days from the day I got the tracking number until it actually got to the Post Office. No worries. It wasn&#x27;t a &#x27;need&#x27; just a want. And I didn&#x27;t pay any additional shipping or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance itself, well, I got the package and opened it up. I had been dying to show it off to a couple of people. The response was along the lines of &amp;#34;That smells great! What is it?&amp;#34; I am very happy with the smell. To be honest, I thought I had ordered an Eau de Parfum, but all it takes is one pump of the spray... trust me. This stuff is powerful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a connoisseur of fine smells, but it definitely isn&#x27;t something fruity or girly, this is definitely a manly, refined, and classy smell. Just one thing - a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Smells good and stays on for entire day</li>
            <li> great always has been just bought my third and hopefully it will always be great.this is hands down my favourite cologne best Gianni Versace herself designed the iconic bottle but whoever made this juice did a great job top notes are vanilla and tonka bean with a hint of mint</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne, I had nothing but compliments, especially women.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and all you need is a few sprays to last you for almost all day</li>
            <li> A nice change from Versace Eau-de-toilette, great for the weekend.</li>
            <li> I love it. My boyfriend loves it. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love it its just too good</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, ladies.  Order this for your man.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I buy my in December 2014, i wrote my review after wearing it for few weeks,i gave it 4stars i like it,but then I didn&#x27;t wear it as much,didn&#x27;t get out as much,was unemployed, but even back in dec - January i had suspicious about it,bc i was smelling alcohol and it will not last long! but now i can confirmed it definitely dosent stay long at all! maybe a hour - till 2 max i would say 3 but i would say only if u put your shirt on your nose you will smell it! but i smell alcohol so I believe thats why it goes away quickly!!! and bottle and box both says from ltaly they seem legit, but if anybody knows how &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ones look at the store, let me know, or simply check the pics i posted and let me know was sup?! Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume! I&#x27;ve had a LOT of compliments while wearing it. Also, don&#x27;t forget, that all perfumes smelldifferently on each of us, so make sure you test it out somewhere beforehand.</li>
            <li> I had a sample bottle and loved it. Ordered 3.4oz bottle and not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I am convinced this is a knockoff.  I bought it in April but just opened it when my older one was finally finished.  The fragrance is considerably weaker and not long lasting. It smells diluted.</li>
            <li> The cologne is great. Has a great smell to it. I tried this cologne out in the mall first before I decided to buy it. Haven&#x27;t tried it in places where females are at yet. But, I&#x27;m sure I will get the same reaction I always. Try this next time my friends and I have a gathering of where we meet new friends.</li>
            <li> Right up there with my fave cologne Chrome..........</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling fragrance that lasts all day. I bought this for my hubby and when he wears it the fragrance makes me wanna eat him up. :)</li>
            <li> have bought three bottles since it first came out .. smells very good</li>
            <li> Let there be no doubt this is the real deal.  For goodness sake this stuff is around well after 4 hours of work.  Almost too much.  You have to be very judicious with how much you apply.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite cologne.  I&#x27;ve gone through three bottles of it and I still purchase it every 6 months. Every single it came out it has been my #1. Amazon also has a great price on this item. If you&#x27;re on the fence between this and another cologne, get this one!!!!</li>
            <li> love love love this on my man!!!!! very clean and fresh with a little sexy :)</li>
            <li> Product came as promised. Very fast shipping. 5 star organization.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable how many compliments I get from this. This may sound a bit odd but for me I smell sort of an Apple smell deeper in chocolate. But everybody gets their own scents from cologne. That&#x27;s just my opinion. I think it smells great. Everyone else does too. And while this land a selling point, it does come in a really cool body.</li>
            <li> My wife likes how it smells on me and that&#x27;s really all that matters.  Definitely a &amp;#34;dressier&amp;#34; cologne, not something I&#x27;d wear looking for a crisp, clean, fresh scent but there is something about this I just like.</li>
            <li> prompt service, nice price.</li>
            <li> my favorite smell. Cold and usable for every season</li>
            <li> I thought I liked this cologne when I smelled a sample of it.  I shared the sample with my husband.  He thought it was Ok too, so I got him a bottle for Christmas.  He puts on the smallest amount he can because it&#x27;s very overpowering.  Even then, he smells like the mall - I think it&#x27;s Abercrombie that pipes the cologne smell into the mall corridor.  Bummer, I wish it wasn&#x27;t so overpowering and that it didn&#x27;t remind me of the mall.  He&#x27;s not going to wear very often.</li>
            <li> Nice to get Items as described and sent in a timely manner</li>
            <li> Smells great for every occasion soft and long lasting. This is my second bottle and my wife love the way i smell with it on!big plus!!!</li>
            <li> One of the best cologne I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Speedy Shipping , Great price ,Wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li> I love smelling good! This scent is awesome! If you want to impress people when you walk by then this is the one. Not only that but it makes you feel more confident in your smell. This scent holds very well in the humidity and hot sun. You will definitely be memorable in good way. An awesome product and you will not be disappointed. The service from the company was good as well; received product as expected.</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever made.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing... Mimi husband loves itðŸ˜œ</li>
            <li> The perfume I have received has obly 25% of fragrance , I don&#x27;t know if its an Old Inventory , But very disappointed .&lt;br /&gt;And the thing is I can return this kind of Item .&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know who is the supplier , i am very sad , because from now on i will buy perfume @ stand of store for guarantee of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Regards  ,&lt;br /&gt;Cory</li>
            <li> perfect for dating&lt;br /&gt;the perfect Fragance for a night date , My girlfriend loved it</li>
            <li> Very good smell, thank you</li>
            <li> I melt every time my boyfriend wears it. I uses it too and always get compliments when I do. Sweet notes, but still inspires masculinity with a bit of sophisticated sex appeal. Third bottle now:) Thank you to the seller!</li>
            <li> It smells way too strong, but the bottle looks cooler than the smell.</li>
            <li> So I am 15 years old and wanted a fresh sent that could be worn at dances and other party like atmospheres. I have never smelt this sent before and bought it off of YouTube reviews and other reviewers on Amazon. I bought the 100 ml bottle and was quite suprised at how big it was. THE SHIPPING TOOK ONLY 2 DAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I came across this fragrance choice when I typed in &amp;#34;cologne that smells like vanilla and mint&amp;#34;. I have seen reviews that say it smells like lemon... Well I smell no lemon in this cologne but rather a heavy mint with touches of vanilla. I have never smelled a cologne (out of my fathers, mine, and Dillard&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, ECT...) this is a unique smell that cools you. It reminds me of winter mint gum (not that it smells like gum but the cooling effect). It does smell fresh. This is defiantly more of a winter night cologne but could be worn in other seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne is very strong; so much that the smell of the cologne you will notice after hours. It won&#x27;t go full to your senses because you have became accustom to the smell. This cologne is a very manly smell to it while maintaining the sweet cooling smell. This is a smell I would say works best with age 14-28. Also it&#x27;s projection is only a few feet with 1 spray; although it is VERY STRONG it doesn&#x27;t project as good as it could. The longer you have it on the sweeter it gets. And it should last about 8 hours on skin. On cloths it will last days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is like a vault that holds gold at Fort Knox. The box is very difficult to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O would recommend this cologne and I bought it directly from Amazon. It is the real deal- with a discount (about 30 dollars cheaper) YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Michael Brooks</li>
            <li> Great gift and smells great</li>
            <li> Nice bottle, scent had an powder after smell to it.</li>
            <li> I love this smell from this set.  It has very clean scent and yet a distinct smell that you don&#x27;t get from many colognes.  Everybody around me complimented on it and never had complaints.  I would use this lightly as it holds for a very long time and too much will make you smell like the cologne lounge at the shopping malls.  Overall, this is a must have for men</li>
            <li> One of the best Colognes I ever had, and I have had many LOL I really have.</li>
            <li> Great scent and lasts all day..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem, can&#x27;t use when around one friend as it bothers her allergies.. (makes a good repellent in that case which is sad because the scent is awesome)</li>
            <li> Got this scent because it was on some list of &amp;#34;top mens colognes rated by women&amp;#34;. I had used another versace cologne years ago and liked it, this one is even better. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> perfume smells great and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I revived my package the day after I ordered it, I was amazed at how fast the shipment was. It smells amazing, it&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
            <li> This fragance smells delicious. Longevity is almost 10 hrs in me and more in my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Sillage is heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful ! You&#x27;ll feel very sexy while wearing it</li>
            <li> So I have a mix review because I have a love/hate feeling about this cologne. This also has to do with the fact that you should really sample a product for a few days before you decide and buy this product. If you get this product and you think it&#x27;s a knockoff because you get a big hint of vanilla extract, well you will actually be wrong because this does have a have a large vanilla presence to it and its the same one you get a Macy&#x27;s or any other large retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a long lasting cologne and you only need a few sprays because the cologne is a bit on the heavy side on the scent department. Compare to other Versace colognes, this one is not the best but I would consider it if your looking for a strong presence cologne. Going into most stores like Sephora and Macy&#x27;s, most of their retail workers would shy you away from it because if you plan to use this as your year round cologne they might make you go for a YSL that is more for all seasons. With that said, this is more of a winter wonderland cologne, I usually only wear it exclusively in Nov, Dec, Jan and Fab when the weather is below 20F. So for those who live in a season-less area, I would say go for another Versace like Man Eau Fraiche or Pour Homme.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. It has a sweet musky smell that I actually really enjoy and sometimes has an aphrodisiac aromatherapy affect but two people said it smelled like black licorice to them and that wasn&#x27;t appealing. 9 out of 10 people liked this one me but 1 of the black licorice ones hated it so much. She didn&#x27;t know it was me but she could smell it and disliked it. You can&#x27;t please everybody. But this still gets 5 stars. I&#x27;m trying out different colognes and 5 stars is not common for me. Just this one so far and 2 others. Besides that, none of the others are great. I have a few more to try out so feel free to check my reviews later on. Lol.</li>
            <li> Good product.I like it.</li>
            <li> Came in within 3 days and in a brand new condition. Smells fantastic!! Expecting a lot of complements from the ladies with this one ;))</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> As a woman, I was looking for a musky, assertive fragrance.  None of the women&#x27;s fragrances I tried had the kind of sexuality I was looking for without being too floral or fruity.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for flirty, I wanted suave, slick, and bold.  I&#x27;m a really confident woman with a punchy personality, and I felt like this fragrance had enough sweetness to get away with some femininity while also communicating the kind of unabashed bravado I was looking for.  Eros is it.  It&#x27;s complex and pairs really nicely with my skin, toning down even more into a masculine-feminine mix of vanilla and cedarwood that combines to create a round, smooth coconutty aura.  It is described as passionate, sexy, and strong, and that spelled perfection for me.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have tried this scent but really enjoy it. My favorite so far since Usher Silver was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Great smell, but not a versatile scent. Works its magic in night clubs.</li>
            <li> Received this perfume and feel in love with it instantly. The smell is so cool. I love that it appeals both sexes. I&#x27;ve had two girlfriends spray it and they both love it. The scent also lasts very long which is unsurprising. The bottle is simple yet unique. I love it and would recommend it to buyers.</li>
            <li> Honestly, ordering online coupled with some of the reviews, I was somewhat concern. However, I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed. The fragrance is amazing. In addition, it lasts. I know some people have questions about that, as did I. This is a great cologne at an extremely reasonable price. I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> This Versace Eros came a couple of days after ordering it. I was able to give it to my boyfriend in another state. He really liked it and I loved it on him!</li>
            <li> Aaaaamazing. Thank you sooo much.</li>
            <li> I found better price after</li>
            <li> The recent Amazon supply of 3.4 oz seems to be weaker (maybe fake). My girlfriend bought me this cologne (1.7oz) for Christmas 2013. It was so strong that I would put it on in the morning, ride my bike to work, work all day, and get cologne compliments on my bike ride home. Now, I can barely smell it a few hours after putting it on.</li>
            <li> Not a bad cologne by any means. The smell is good, but can be a little overpowering. The price is a little high for the quality as well...almost as if you are paying for the Versace brand name.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and being a fragrance connoisseur I have quite an appreciation for the versace house. This fragrance is sweet with a hint of vanilla and not to mention great longevity on my skin. The product came in the mail within 2 days and overall I was very satisfied with the product and service</li>
            <li> Love everything about this brand and smell, it smells all day and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is in my top 5 favorite colognes&lt;br /&gt;Just takes one spray to last through the next 2 days, but not overpowering.(might be a little to some on the first spray, as well as every time you put it on, let it breathe first before totally oversaturating your sense of smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starts off lightly spicy,outdoorsy,with a hint of citrus to bold warm sweet smell (if that&#x27;s how i can explain it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars hands down</li>
            <li> I got this from john bull; a store in a mall near by and the first day I wore this the ladies couldn&#x27;t get enough! Please buy you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and i was very pleased. There was a story behind me buying this item and it brought back a memory for me! And smelled great as a gift for my husband.</li>
            <li> For years I have been wearing Versace Blue, but I felt like it was time for a change.  I went to Macy&#x27;s and tried all of the men&#x27;s scents and this was my favorite.  The girlfriend loved it too.  It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite scent.  Like always, it was also much cheaper through Amazon than buying at Macy&#x27;s or some other retail store.  Get it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a great scent!! Beware not much is needed..The wife always ask for this one when we go out..</li>
            <li> Quality for a great price</li>
            <li> FAst shipment and I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Smellin good!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. It doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> I personally love this smell, I first smelled it at my friends house (who payed a lot more for it; $65 for the 1.7 OZ) and loved it. Afterwards I bought a bottle on amazon, and everyone who has said anything was positive about the smell.</li>
            <li> It smelled really good my friends would always ask what cologne is that</li>
            <li> Such a great product, and the price u CANNOT BEAT!</li>
            <li> smell lasts for not a long time</li>
            <li> it smells good but the scent doesnt last long a hr max no whole day scent i regret buying</li>
            <li> As advertised, would buy again - Thanks AAA+++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert in the perfume department, but I can say this one smells pretty good!  My friend (who is a girl) notice it firsthand.  She had to hug me to notice it though.  This is no strong perfume, is very mild.  I don&#x27;t see people noticing it unless they smell your shirt directly.  That&#x27;s why I took one star out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is very good, but a bit weak.</li>
            <li> I like it, exactly like the one which is in sephora store</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! You won&#x27;t stop smelling yourself after you spray it.  My girlfriend said its the best cologne I have ever used. (I use a lot of different kinds) You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great scent, and lasts throughout the day.  not overpowering to give the wearer, or the sniffer, a headache.  neutral fragrance.  most men&#x27;s cologne are prominent, bold, etc. this is just an excellent daily cologne.</li>
            <li> This is my first cologne from the versace brand and i was not disappointed. The bottle is very unique and speaks of the quality of the versace brand. I have a small collection of fragrences but i am not one of those people to speak about the top notes of cedar or anything like that. I will say that this is a very good smelling cologne and one that i get several compliments on when i wear it. I would recommend buying directly from amazon to ensure the authenticity. I paid $48 for a 3.4 oz bottle which is about $30 less than retail at say macy&#x27;s so it is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Compliments from guys and girls... But it...</li>
            <li> Very nice last along time.</li>
            <li> This is pretty strong and I suggest the smallest spray possible and it last a long time!  Hubby put this on and whew!  I could smell him coming.  It is a strong musk smell to me.  There is something intriguing about it - almost a love hate type of smell.  Bottle is nice, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> ... And get ready for the ladies to chase you. Upon first spray it is smooth, clean and a little fruity... But in a manly way. The mint kicks up in the middle but the dry down. Oh, dat dry down is phenomenal. It is like a sweet mint with a touch of moss and vanilla. It&#x27;s the only way I can describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Projection is ok on my skin. Not too forward which I like. Longevity I&#x27;m getting 6-8 hrs. Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for any season. Spring and fall would be ideal in my mind. I think any age group could wear it but I would picture this for the 24-35 crowd. Youthful but mature and confident. This would do well in a business meeting. A young professional could pull this off in the healthcare setting (if permitted). It could also be worn casually but not spicy enough to be a night time scent in my opinion. I would NOT recommend this to someone who likes their colognes more powdery, spicy, unique and in your face. Dior L&#x27;homme comes to mind when I describe that. This is most definitely not that. This is a sweeter scent. If that&#x27;s not your thing then there&#x27;s nothing to see here.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. It definitely appeals to a wife variety of women. It has a fresh subtle scent that lasts all day. Trust me, get this one. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. This smells awesome on my boyfriend :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband and he absolutely loved it. It arrived earlier than first indicated. Item was well packaged and was exactly what he wanted.  I would order item again. Well worth the priced. Shopped around and Amazon was the least expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this regularly.  I love it.  I especially like that this purchase was at a much better price than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and gets lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Smells great,fast shipping, will order again!!!! Ya dig!</li>
            <li> Great cologne and much cheaper than retail stores. g-</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing. I made the mistake of leaving it in the cold for 4 hours in my trunk inside my luggage and the scent changed. So...I&#x27;m pissed and it doesn&#x27;t smell as great as before. NEVER leave cologne in cold weather. You&#x27;ll end up wasting money and having to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume when I am live in my country but when come to USA I like price itâ€™s seem good for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent.  My husband ordered it for himself and I just want to eat him alive which works out perfectly for him.  It&#x27;s a nice soft scent but it&#x27;s bold and manly at the same time.  It lasts forever.  We went to dinner the other night and the next morning I could still smell it on him.  My husband is a bit of a fragrance whore and this is by all means my favorite one he has.</li>
            <li> Bought this blindly without having smelled. It&#x27;s not bad, but not as good as the other Versace colognes I have. I spray it on after I workout, or on smelly shoes, etc. just to use it up. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Xmas present for boyfriend.  We both love it.</li>
            <li> Eros this cologne is a bomb! My girl love it, even the bottle is spectacular.stay all day in cloth</li>
            <li> This scent is just amazing!  I got this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he loves it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves the smell. The packaging too, of course is super masculine and cool. The smell is subtle but very sexy, and classy. We both love it!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great! I receive a lot of compliments from friends and my fiance regarding the cologne. It has such a pleasant distinctive smell. Chicks will love it!</li>
            <li> I love this Versace because it last all day and the fragrent is outstanding I would more than likely pucrhase this again.</li>
            <li> My son loves the cologne smells great!</li>
            <li> smells wonderful for the price. The real deal</li>
            <li> Love it but easy to put to much on! Only two squirts is all you need!</li>
            <li> bought it for my boyfriend and we both love the smell.</li>
            <li> Favorite smell, came just as expected.</li>
            <li> The product came very fast and was fairly priced. I love the smell this cologne gives off and I get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and great price</li>
            <li> Beautiful oozes of class and elegance and the packaging was really good would recommend!</li>
            <li> Versace eros cologne is a great scent.Which I really use in the winter and to partys because projection is beast mode on my skin chemistry.Longevity is 8plus hours.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a bootleg version of this.  I keep comparing it to the store I first saw this at.  The version sent to me doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long, and this one has a very strong smell when you first spray it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, I was suspicious about buying something I&#x27;ve never smelled before but it&#x27;s amazing. As a 19 year old I wanted basically a smell that would be &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; but not make me smell like an old man, this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling mens fragrances I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  Love the good price I got on it.  It was 18.00 cheaper than duty free.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent remains all day on my husband !</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a full bottle!! But still smelled nice</li>
            <li> Great smell ladies cant get enough! !</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved it,smells amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  that FIRE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, well packed, smells great, last all day long, great purchase experience!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> very good I want another</li>
            <li> This is one of the best colognes out there!  Great price .. quick shipping .. very happy with the product and transaction</li>
            <li> Orgasmic. Has to be one of the best colognes I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Love it not too strong and not too little just right!!!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne on my husband. My husband usually wears Aqua Di Gio, which I personally hate- it is too strong and has an almost gasoline smell to me. This cologne is so smooth, it smells like heavens clouds. If my husband would let me get my hands on it I would douse myself with it. It is just a delicious smell.</li>
            <li> THE EROS WAD ALL ALCOHOL NO PETULE NO WOODY SMRLL...VERY NASTY...</li>
            <li> Personally I like having an idea of the scents that are in a fragrance. Often there&#x27;s something there I know I&#x27;ll like so I can usually blindly buy a cologne knowing whether or not I&#x27;ll like it. Luckily I received a small sample spray w/ another cologne order earlier this year and instantly fell in love w/ Versace Eros. I&#x27;ll skip my two cents and simply say I love this scent for the Summer and strongly recommend it. It&#x27;s fresh, strong and sweet. All the ingredients blend perfectly well together to make an incredible fragrance. According to the sample card/sleeve here is what you can expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head: Mint Oil, Italian Lemon, Orpur, Green Apple&lt;br /&gt;Heart: Tonka Bean, Venezuelan Ambroxan, Geranium Flower&lt;br /&gt;Dry Out: Vanilla, Madagascar Vetyver, Oak Moss Accord, Cedar wood from Virginia &amp; Cedar wood from Atlas&lt;br /&gt;Olfactive Family: Fresh, Oriental, Woody&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence I hope this helps persuade you that this is one you&#x27;ll enjoy. If nothing else do yourself a favor and check this out at a department store if you can. A luxury I don&#x27;t have so usually rely on my instinct and scent notes. Personally I love it and will keep Versace Eros in my Summer rotation for years to come.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like a million bucks, this cologne isn&#x27;t for you, but if you want to smell really good and get tons of complements, you&#x27;ve come to the right place.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping and smells really good</li>
            <li> Just an alright cologne. Won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Very good quality smell doesn&#x27;t fade off right away. It stays with you for most of the day. The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long. 2 hours at best.</li>
            <li> I love it. Smells very good. All the girls at work just want to hug an sniffing on me.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he loves this Cologne. Would recommend it for any man who wants a great smelling cologne that has a lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell, and is girlfriend approved! It gets me quite a few compliments when I wear it as well. The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it so far is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long on me. It&#x27;s probably different for every individual person though, as it has a lot to do with body chemistry. Either way, it&#x27;s a great smell, and it&#x27;s a great price. I originally purchased this at Sephora but saw that the price was almost 50% cheaper here on Amazon so I returned it and re-purchased it here.</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s a nice, refined scent. I am a person who has never enjoyed colognes but I am now a convert.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell as nice as it does in a magazine sample. Kind of weak.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic. The package was very careful.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, love to wear it round the year.</li>
            <li> iitwatbe real thing. thixs time ut was right kn the monehy.</li>
            <li> Awesome price! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smell&#x27;s crisp &amp; classy. My Gf loves it~</li>
            <li> Smells really great, awesome scent for summer or for working out as sweat, as weird as it sounds, makes the scent even better</li>
            <li> OohLaLa. This cologne smells divine.</li>
            <li> Smells really good! Only problem is the bottle was missing just a little bit of cologne and there was 2 chips on the bottle thats the reason I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and he absolutely loved it. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Awesome I love the smell!!!</li>
            <li> I like it...My dog likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.  It smells so good on him!</li>
