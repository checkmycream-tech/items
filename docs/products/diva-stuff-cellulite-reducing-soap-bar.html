            <li>I absolutely love coconut anything because it smells good and is great for you.</li>
            <li>I am sure it&#x27;s great, but just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll give it a lol more time to see the results..</li>
            <li>You will probably find coffee grains in interesting places post shower, lol.  </li>

            <li>Oh and did I mention I love this soap!</li>
            <li>and I fell in love!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>really liked the seller because she also sent me a &amp;#34;cold fighting Chapstick&amp;#34; which I LOVE!</li>
            <li>I feel like the coffee grounds do an amazing exfoliating job</li>
            <li>it smells amazing and it leaves your skin</li>
            <li>The smell and feeling was amazing.</li>
            <li>Its been three weeks using the soap and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>The free samples were a great incentive.</li>
            <li>I would pay $30 for a soap that produces results this amazing.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if the soap bar reduced anything</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s kinda nice.</li>
            <li>I recommend having it in its own tray if you use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>works in my opinion better than franks, it smells so good, it helps with cellulite, it lasts longer, and it&#x27;s a FRACTION of the cost.  </li>
            <li>to be honest, I did not notice a difference in that area.  </li>
            <li>nice grip and a nutritional soap.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for great service and gifts!</li>
            <li>but this is a nice change it dose</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>I liked the soap, it did help exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>Might be nice for just a soap bar but doesn&#x27;t work for cellulite areas.</li>
            <li>Feels nice.</li>
            <li>I just bought the full size of this, and I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I cannot really say if it &amp;#34;works!&amp;#34;, I am working out, eating better, and trying my best to remedy my skin.</li>
            <li>it looks very natural and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>Rinse out your shower as soon as you are through, its a very easy fix.</li>
            <li>And can&#x27;t wait to see more results! :)</li>
            <li>Love it love it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well , so nice</li>
            <li>lasts a good long time and skin feels great!</li>

            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>when I get some more money I will try it again.</li>
            <li>I wish that I was able to tolerate it</li>
            <li>I would recommend placing it a container if you want to get a couple of more showers out of it.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love the coffee grinds that exfoliate and massage my skin during my shower or bath.  </li>
            <li>I love this coffee soap .It</li>
            <li>and I am going to buy another one:).</li>
            <li>Seems to be working great in tightening my skin and reducing appearance of cellulite, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so so soft it&#x27;s incredible</li>
            <li>Love this soap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my yearly summer ritual of using this delightful, coffee scented cellulite</li>
            <li>Love this idea.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to buying more Diva Stuff  Cellulite Reducing Bar.</li>
            <li>I would love this if they made better colors and scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
            <li>My skin looks much more toned and tighter and even.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m petty sure that that is what it is supposed to do along with the what the ingredients</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>Will keep you guys updated :)</li>
            <li>and I love the smells because it wakes me up.</li>
            <li>I love Diva Stuff products, they never disappoint.</li>
            <li>plus its way better than using chemicals which I have no clue how to pronounce them and what they even are.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes your body feel after you use it.</li>
            <li>I love coffee</li>
            <li>and I love scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>Will for sure be getting more of these!&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>The company also sent along some free samples with the order and that was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>But still ok product.</li>
            <li>Have not seen a reduction in cellulite but love the smell of this item as well as the feel of it rubbing across my skin.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of this product and the smooth skin it gives me after every use!</li>
            <li>but I am sure it is exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Love soap will order again</li>
            <li>absolutely love it and hope you give it a try.</li>
            <li>After using it for a month, I just purchased a bunch more.</li>
            <li>but, I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>the customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li>we need more stuff like this.  </li>
            <li>more oatmeal baths.  </li>
            <li>more yum.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love all the smells</li>
            <li>I love that is smells like chocolate cake...</li>
            <li>but I did was exfoliation to help get better circulation.</li>
            <li>all, I don&#x27;t think this bar of soap should promise cellulite extinction, but more so exfoliation.</li>
            <li>But when you use it you sure can see those coffee grounds on your skin.</li>
            <li>But I am going to order more</li>
            <li>I actually felt the circulation in my stomach increasing :-D</li>
            <li>It brought better circulation to that area making the skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li>I happened to love the coffee smell too.  </li>
            <li>I hope this review is helpful to someone! :-)</li>
            <li>Love how it feel when I massage on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I have grown to really love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>The product came on time and was packaged with two bonus products - a lip balm and a lovely antibacterial hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the way the coffee soap smells and feels</li>
            <li>and I love what it does to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Lol but def love this soap so far!</li>
            <li>Maybe it is too soon to say if it helps cellulite, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, my legs feel pretty dang good.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>This soap was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful soap bar has real coffee but is not scratchy like some things that add real beans.</li>
            <li>The bumps on the top of the soap melt off but the soap stays more smooth on that side.</li>
            <li>But the soap gets the blood flowing and my bruises go away much more quickly!</li>
            <li>That surprised me a great deal.</li>
            <li>The seller was so nice and also gave me some facial scrub (haven&#x27;t tried it yet) and some pineapple anti cellulite cream which is amazing as well!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great product!!</li>
            <li>I already knew bout coffee as a great exfoliant for smooth soft tighter looking skin.</li>
            <li>But it feels great to use and makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It does not stain and I just sprayed water over it and it washed away easily.</li>
            <li>easy fix.</li>
            <li>The best is  to use the other anti cellulite products from Diva Stuff !</li>
            <li>got this soap, I love the way it exfoliate my skin, the aroma is very gentle,, if you love coffee this is for you.</li>
            <li>It has reduced ingrown hairs tremendously!</li>
            <li>I love the way it is so natural and makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Diva Stuff is amazing, I love their products because they work, are natural, affordable,  </li>
            <li>I used this soap ONE TIME and noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and the nodules last a lot</li>
            <li>I does smooth out your cellulite</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;~I got a free sample of yummy-smelling pineapple orchid cream with each order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And a trial sized &amp;#34;cellulite cream&amp;#34; smelled amazing and VERY moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Both were free of charge.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful Cellulite Soap from Diva Stuff, i find this to not be as messy as some say,</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel some smooth.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the Diva Stuff products because you can feel and smell the ingredients that are used in the products.</li>
            <li>It was too smooth and liquidy.</li>
            <li>this stuff should be used over the whole body it didnt reduce cellulite but its like a super amazing feel.  </li>
            <li>Now, I am more aware of how to reduce and make disappear cellulite....</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t to sure about the smell,  </li>
            <li>I admit I had a significant reduction in cellulite</li>
            <li>She is very genuine and everything is all natural with respectable ingredients.</li>
            <li>love the shape and size, it&#x27;s ideal for scrubbing at pesky, hard to treat cellulite.</li>
            <li>but I just put it on my rack and clean the shower after.</li>
            <li>My skin is super smooth, like yeah my ass is smooooth.</li>
            <li>Pretty good soap, will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>Just received the coffee soap and had to give it a try right away!</li>
            <li>but I you use lotion right after your fine.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kind of coffee soaps and this by far as the highest concentrate of coffee out of them all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lately I got a sample of the blueberry scented lotion and it smells awesome</li>
            <li>use it more often because it is much easier to rub on  this soap then try to apply a homemade scrub.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that has to be continued as a regular regiment to keep the good results.  </li>
            <li>but you guys are sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of coffee grounds</li>
            <li>I have to use bleach to get it off, and a LOT of it, and that seems really counterproductive, considering I try to use as many cruelty-free items in my house as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good but gritty like coffee grounds</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a super</li>
            <li>so it dries off quickly.</li>
            <li>Package arrived fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I like but the bumps rub off quick.</li>
            <li>I also use a cellulite reducer cream right after the shower, I can tell my skin has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE VERY FUNNY SKIN</li>
            <li>I follow it with the key lime pie smoothing cream also you of my favorite things!</li>
            <li>After having my first child, BOOM!</li>
            <li>Quick ship and nice price so overall</li>
            <li>Absolutely loveeee the free samples of anti cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the free stuff that came along with it.</li>
            <li>Its so cool, can tell real coffee is used and the grounds helped to exfoliate and smooth my skin in my first use.</li>
            <li>I think this is worth giving a chance.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite product so far that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is one exotic scrub that leaves you skin feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>And plus in my opinion that&#x27;s the fun in it</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;~I love that it&#x27;s natural and cruelty-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my thighs feel, so revived, and my skin so soft from the exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I love that all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>The one thing im not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>but i love the smell and at first i was worried because most of the reviews say that the coffee grinds make a huge mess.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and delighted that this soap actually did reduce my cellulite significantly.</li>
            <li>The seller does send you free samples of other things which is nice.  </li>
            <li>but the bar crumbles away pretty quick.</li>
            <li>so you should make sure you have a soap dish to place it on and take extra time to clean the shower after use.</li>
            <li>If used right willast about a month.</li>
            <li>This company got it right with the ingredients used in this soap.</li>
            <li>I do work out and eat right too.</li>
            <li>price is right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap so give a try if you want, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up to high.</li>
            <li>All natural products, great customer service, quick shipping and samples of their other products in your order to boot.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it works though lol</li>
            <li>Just rinse your shower down good to remove lose coffee grinds.</li>
            <li>I also loved that my purchase came with other diva stuff samples!</li>
            <li>Smells great, but very messy</li>
            <li>It does smell good, makes your skin very soft, but will make a huge mess in your shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed really, I&#x27;ll probably be stuck with it my whole life.</li>
            <li>This soap smells good and it helped a little with my cellulite.</li>
            <li>My skin is super super soft</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have enough words to say how much I love this soap.</li>
            <li>You can see it first thing when you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s on my bucket list for next order:-)</li>
            <li>I USE THIS EVERY EVENING ON MY WHOLE BODY!</li>
            <li>more so I could see if it actually helped with cellulite.</li>
            <li>The soap last more than one month for me</li>
            <li>but I really like it for some reason!</li>
            <li>Thanks Diva Stuff!</li>
            <li>Please send me more because I&#x27;m a definite follower now.</li>
            <li>but you have to be consistent with you&#x27;re toning exercises along with this soap.</li>
            <li>Thanks Diva stuff!</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole body!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in the first line people....</li>
            <li>If I can use it more religiously I will update with results.</li>
            <li>I am trying to conserve the second to try and get more longevity out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just purchased Diva Stuff&#x27;s Cellulite cream with the same ingredients, so I have more hope for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, it smelled funny probably from being packed in plastic.</li>
            <li>But once I got it out and used it; it didn&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it exactly smells like coffee.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give it an even higher however.</li>
            <li>and they ship fast too!</li>
            <li>I have used so many different cellulite products and none of them worked.</li>
            <li>and it really gets your blood circulating!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be lazy and you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>The Diva Stuff line really got it right.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but the soap is very rough because of the coffee inside, I guess.</li>
            <li>I love diva stuff because they use natural ingredients that are clearly marked on there packageing</li>
            <li>I love this product because it leaves my skin smooth and supple after a few days of use continuous use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bar because I haven&#x27;t really decided about the cellulite yet, and I wanted to give it more of a chance.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft after using this!</li>
            <li>I have a crispy white cotton shower curtain and if you aren&#x27;t careful you will stain things, but overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The coffee smell was too strong (and not that delicious-walk into a coffee shop smell) and every time I used it, i was left with coffee grounds all over my body.</li>
            <li>Well than after using it a few times I love it!</li>
            <li>The idea is nice, but boy what a mess in your shower.</li>
            <li>Nice little bar for some skin pampering.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in cellulite appearance, but I haven&#x27;t used it as regularly as I should.  </li>
            <li>I make sure my skin is wet before I start</li>
            <li>It was too much for me.</li>
            <li>That stuff  stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does much for cellulite</li>
            <li>I honestly really like it.</li>
            <li>I really didnt see any in my shower</li>
            <li>You can really smell the coffee (no lie)  </li>
            <li>all natural products, IT TAKES TIME to see results, but boy is it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>-it really does work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it does much for cellulite.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t really seem much of a change with anything else on my body....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exercise much at all btw.</li>
            <li>It help with my cellulite so much I can wear shorts now.</li>
            <li>but boy does it make your legs look and feel so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>It really just came out of nowhere, but this scrub has since gotten rid of those bumps.  </li>
            <li>so I was REALLY content with that too.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li>I use that side when I want to really exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I imagine towards the very end of the bar, it would get crumbly, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with that.</li>
            <li>Soap is really great,messages the body well</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin shine and exfoliates.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I absolutely have to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Saw very difference, if any, in cellulite.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s abrasive and the design is comfortable and makes massaging your skin simple</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>Cellulite-reduction has been in the media for weeks now thanks to a well-known TV show.</li>
            <li>Actually does smooth my cellulite</li>
            <li>Ive used the whole bar.</li>
            <li>I use it to exfoliate for shaving, I use it ( gently) on my face in the morning to \\</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but if you really want results I recommend squats.</li>
            <li>my surprise, not only have I noticed an astonishing difference in the appearance of cellulite, but I&#x27;ve also seen my skin shrink considerably.</li>
            <li>BUT THIS SOAP MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SOOO SOFT!!!</li>
            <li>I love the soap, and the little extras body scrubs the company sent me;)</li>
            <li>Some of the coffee grinds fall onto the shower floor as I use the product, but clean up is simple.</li>
            <li>It does get all the dead skin cells off and leaves my skin feeling new, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>however you should keep this bar in its own soap dish, I have mine in a small baggie off to the side in the shower.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how effective it is as a cellulite treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good soap but the only problem I have with it is the mess it leaves in my tub.</li>
            <li>I still have a bit more than half the bar</li>
            <li>Plus they threw in a sugar scrub and black head disolver for free!</li>
            <li>This is definitely an interesting product - I was not sure I was going to like it at first.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, but everyone has to be realistic and remember it&#x27;s not a miracle product.</li>
            <li>Make your skin very soft!</li>
            <li>I loved the soap but doesn&#x27;t last long so not practical only a week!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Certainly if you are not satisfied I am sure Divastuff will see to it that you are.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but I am so happy I tried this</li>
            <li>Really like this soap leaves skin really soft</li>
            <li>Waste of time better off ordering the message roller</li>
            <li>I have not really had it long enough to see if there will be a remarkable difference, but it has already started working.</li>
            <li>well, I must say the smell was just a tad bit weird, however it works great as an exfoliator and my skin is very soft after each use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re right there on the back of my thighs!!</li>
            <li>I saw this product and noticed it has all the ingredients I use plus some that were new to me like juniper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it is something that I can live with.</li>
            <li>I just love the raw layer of coffee extracts for exfoliating</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this soap irritates it.  </li>
            <li>Seeing very little improvement on my cellulite, maybe it takes more time to see results.</li>
            <li>btw those products are natural and it is a plus factor to me!</li>
            <li>Common sense tells me showering with a specific type of soap will not remove cellulite but it should help a great deal with proper diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive, and it maybe works, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of that smell.</li>
            <li>first bar lasted me only a week.</li>
            <li>while I have seen a small improvement, I think I just need to diet more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which one had the most affect--but people keep saying to me&amp;#34;  are you losing weight?...</li>
            <li>really sure how to use it ,do you scrub with flat part first,then use other side to your cellulite</li>
            <li>But it clearly stimulates your skin and has to be doing something.  </li>
            <li>and I have light cellulite on the back of my legs Even with minimal exercise</li>
            <li>It was completely dissolved within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li>and I using it with NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate, 5oz and with a stone pumice.</li>
            <li>I doubt it completely gets rid of cellulite by using this alone but it does improve skin appearance</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely remove your cellulite</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural coffee grinds</li>
            <li>It also has not stained my 40 year old, porous, fiberglass shower.</li>
            <li>I must assume that the people saying it&#x27;s completely gone in two weeks have it sitting in a dish where it&#x27;s getting dissolved by water.</li>
            <li>Probably doesnt do much for cellulite because only diet and exersize will help that.</li>
            <li>I used to rub coffee grinds directly on the problematic areas and when I did</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to using it on a daily basis to see the true long term results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The raised massaging parts do not seem to wear down quickly either.</li>
            <li>I have recently finished my first bar and am considering ordering a second.</li>
            <li>This bar is a little abrasive on the skin - but that&#x27;s no necessarily a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>I am buying two at the same time now so that I can scrub both sides of my hips, which is the area I am focusing now, as well  as the high part of my thighs.</li>
            <li>Very messy, did not see any results after more than 5 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>but it exfoliates like no other!</li>
            <li>A little scratchy, but pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>However, enjoy a few minute massage and get that blood flowing!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try my new stuff next.</li>
            <li>This soap really helps my circulation and the grains you feel  are rough, leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this with a cellulite cream and see a major improvement.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoothe and soft from only 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I work out my legs every other day with INTENSE work outs and that doesn&#x27;t do the trick either.</li>
            <li>does work but may smell a little funny like coffee.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried about my shower since it was messy</li>
            <li>to mention that the &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; side was very wore down already..</li>
            <li>It really works extremely well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all like not really, but I can see a marked improvement in the appearance of the cellulite in my thighs and buttocks!.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful price can&#x27;t go wrong with this soap!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it smells really nice and is a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good scrub</li>
            <li> just cause it feels that good.</li>
            <li> this is a really good product.</li>
            <li> and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Good smell</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good exfoliator and the smell helps wake me up in the shower.  </li>
            <li> , it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> but, over all it is a good soap...</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the cellulite, But I do think it&#x27;s a good exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll list the good first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not like coffee but a good coffee</li>
            <li> Smelled good.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> a good scrub and caffeine is supposed to help plump skin.  </li>
            <li> loved the product.</li>
            <li> It smells good and does exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love coconut anything because it smells good and is great for you.</li>
            <li> I am sure it&#x27;s great, but just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll give it a lol more time to see the results..</li>
            <li> You will probably find coffee grains in interesting places post shower, lol.  </li>
            <li> But I love it, smells great &amp; exfoliates.</li>
            <li> Over all still a good product smells nice</li>
            <li> It smells great, very sweet, and it works.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after using!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Oh and did I mention I love this soap!</li>
            <li> and I fell in love!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> really liked the seller because she also sent me a &amp;#34;cold fighting Chapstick&amp;#34; which I LOVE!</li>
            <li> I feel like the coffee grounds do an amazing exfoliating job</li>
            <li> it smells amazing and it leaves your skin</li>
            <li> The smell and feeling was amazing.</li>
            <li> Its been three weeks using the soap and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> The free samples were a great incentive.</li>
            <li> I would pay $30 for a soap that produces results this amazing.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if the soap bar reduced anything</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s kinda nice.</li>
            <li> I recommend having it in its own tray if you use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> works in my opinion better than franks, it smells so good, it helps with cellulite, it lasts longer, and it&#x27;s a FRACTION of the cost.  </li>
            <li> to be honest, I did not notice a difference in that area.  </li>
            <li> nice grip and a nutritional soap.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for great service and gifts!</li>
            <li> but this is a nice change it dose</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> I liked the soap, it did help exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> Might be nice for just a soap bar but doesn&#x27;t work for cellulite areas.</li>
            <li> Feels nice.</li>
            <li> I just bought the full size of this, and I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I cannot really say if it &amp;#34;works!&amp;#34;, I am working out, eating better, and trying my best to remedy my skin.</li>
            <li> it looks very natural and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Rinse out your shower as soon as you are through, its a very easy fix.</li>
            <li> And can&#x27;t wait to see more results! :)</li>
            <li> Love it love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell as well , so nice</li>
            <li> lasts a good long time and skin feels great!</li>
            <li> The soap came quickly with some great samples all safely wrapped.  </li>
            <li> Stop looking for an easy way out!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> What can be more suitable?  </li>

            <li> The smell is magic.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> when I get some more money I will try it again.</li>
            <li> I wish that I was able to tolerate it</li>
            <li> I would recommend placing it a container if you want to get a couple of more showers out of it.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love the coffee grinds that exfoliate and massage my skin during my shower or bath.  </li>
            <li> I love this coffee soap .It</li>
            <li> and I am going to buy another one:).</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great in tightening my skin and reducing appearance of cellulite, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so so soft it&#x27;s incredible</li>
            <li> Love this soap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my yearly summer ritual of using this delightful, coffee scented cellulite</li>
            <li> Love this idea.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to buying more Diva Stuff  Cellulite Reducing Bar.</li>
            <li> I would love this if they made better colors and scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
            <li> My skin looks much more toned and tighter and even.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m petty sure that that is what it is supposed to do along with the what the ingredients</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> Will keep you guys updated :)</li>
            <li> and I love the smells because it wakes me up.</li>
            <li> I love Diva Stuff products, they never disappoint.</li>
            <li> plus its way better than using chemicals which I have no clue how to pronounce them and what they even are.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes your body feel after you use it.</li>
            <li> I love coffee</li>
            <li> and I love scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> Will for sure be getting more of these!&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> The company also sent along some free samples with the order and that was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> But still ok product.</li>
            <li> Have not seen a reduction in cellulite but love the smell of this item as well as the feel of it rubbing across my skin.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of this product and the smooth skin it gives me after every use!</li>
            <li> but I am sure it is exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Love soap will order again</li>
            <li> absolutely love it and hope you give it a try.</li>
            <li> After using it for a month, I just purchased a bunch more.</li>
            <li> but, I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> the customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> we need more stuff like this.  </li>
            <li> more oatmeal baths.  </li>
            <li> more yum.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love all the smells</li>
            <li> I love that is smells like chocolate cake...</li>
            <li> but I did was exfoliation to help get better circulation.</li>
            <li> all, I don&#x27;t think this bar of soap should promise cellulite extinction, but more so exfoliation.</li>
            <li> But when you use it you sure can see those coffee grounds on your skin.</li>
            <li> But I am going to order more</li>
            <li> I actually felt the circulation in my stomach increasing :-D</li>
            <li> It brought better circulation to that area making the skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li> I happened to love the coffee smell too.  </li>
            <li> I hope this review is helpful to someone! :-)</li>
            <li> Love how it feel when I massage on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but I have grown to really love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> The product came on time and was packaged with two bonus products - a lip balm and a lovely antibacterial hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the way the coffee soap smells and feels</li>
            <li> and I love what it does to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Lol but def love this soap so far!</li>
            <li> Maybe it is too soon to say if it helps cellulite, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, my legs feel pretty dang good.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> This soap was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful soap bar has real coffee but is not scratchy like some things that add real beans.</li>
            <li> The bumps on the top of the soap melt off but the soap stays more smooth on that side.</li>
            <li> But the soap gets the blood flowing and my bruises go away much more quickly!</li>
            <li> That surprised me a great deal.</li>
            <li> The seller was so nice and also gave me some facial scrub (haven&#x27;t tried it yet) and some pineapple anti cellulite cream which is amazing as well!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great product!!</li>
            <li> I already knew bout coffee as a great exfoliant for smooth soft tighter looking skin.</li>
            <li> But it feels great to use and makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It does not stain and I just sprayed water over it and it washed away easily.</li>
            <li> easy fix.</li>
            <li> The best is  to use the other anti cellulite products from Diva Stuff !</li>
            <li> got this soap, I love the way it exfoliate my skin, the aroma is very gentle,, if you love coffee this is for you.</li>
            <li> It has reduced ingrown hairs tremendously!</li>
            <li> I love the way it is so natural and makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Diva Stuff is amazing, I love their products because they work, are natural, affordable,  </li>
            <li> I used this soap ONE TIME and noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and the nodules last a lot</li>
            <li> I does smooth out your cellulite</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;~I got a free sample of yummy-smelling pineapple orchid cream with each order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And a trial sized &amp;#34;cellulite cream&amp;#34; smelled amazing and VERY moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Both were free of charge.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful Cellulite Soap from Diva Stuff, i find this to not be as messy as some say,</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel some smooth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the Diva Stuff products because you can feel and smell the ingredients that are used in the products.</li>
            <li> It was too smooth and liquidy.</li>
            <li> this stuff should be used over the whole body it didnt reduce cellulite but its like a super amazing feel.  </li>
            <li> Now, I am more aware of how to reduce and make disappear cellulite....</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t to sure about the smell,  </li>
            <li> I admit I had a significant reduction in cellulite</li>
            <li> She is very genuine and everything is all natural with respectable ingredients.</li>
            <li> love the shape and size, it&#x27;s ideal for scrubbing at pesky, hard to treat cellulite.</li>
            <li> but I just put it on my rack and clean the shower after.</li>
            <li> My skin is super smooth, like yeah my ass is smooooth.</li>
            <li> Pretty good soap, will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Just received the coffee soap and had to give it a try right away!</li>
            <li> but I you use lotion right after your fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kind of coffee soaps and this by far as the highest concentrate of coffee out of them all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lately I got a sample of the blueberry scented lotion and it smells awesome</li>
            <li> use it more often because it is much easier to rub on  this soap then try to apply a homemade scrub.  </li>
            <li> This is a product that has to be continued as a regular regiment to keep the good results.  </li>
            <li> but you guys are sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full of coffee grounds</li>
            <li> I have to use bleach to get it off, and a LOT of it, and that seems really counterproductive, considering I try to use as many cruelty-free items in my house as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good but gritty like coffee grounds</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a super</li>
            <li> so it dries off quickly.</li>
            <li> Package arrived fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I like but the bumps rub off quick.</li>
            <li> I also use a cellulite reducer cream right after the shower, I can tell my skin has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE VERY FUNNY SKIN</li>
            <li> I follow it with the key lime pie smoothing cream also you of my favorite things!</li>
            <li> After having my first child, BOOM!</li>
            <li> Quick ship and nice price so overall</li>
            <li> Absolutely loveeee the free samples of anti cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the free stuff that came along with it.</li>
            <li> Its so cool, can tell real coffee is used and the grounds helped to exfoliate and smooth my skin in my first use.</li>
            <li> I think this is worth giving a chance.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite product so far that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is one exotic scrub that leaves you skin feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> And plus in my opinion that&#x27;s the fun in it</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;~I love that it&#x27;s natural and cruelty-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my thighs feel, so revived, and my skin so soft from the exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I love that all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> The one thing im not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> but i love the smell and at first i was worried because most of the reviews say that the coffee grinds make a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and delighted that this soap actually did reduce my cellulite significantly.</li>
            <li> The seller does send you free samples of other things which is nice.  </li>
            <li> but the bar crumbles away pretty quick.</li>
            <li> so you should make sure you have a soap dish to place it on and take extra time to clean the shower after use.</li>
            <li> If used right willast about a month.</li>
            <li> This company got it right with the ingredients used in this soap.</li>
            <li> I do work out and eat right too.</li>
            <li> price is right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap so give a try if you want, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up to high.</li>
            <li> All natural products, great customer service, quick shipping and samples of their other products in your order to boot.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works though lol</li>
            <li> Just rinse your shower down good to remove lose coffee grinds.</li>
            <li> I also loved that my purchase came with other diva stuff samples!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but very messy</li>
            <li> It does smell good, makes your skin very soft, but will make a huge mess in your shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed really, I&#x27;ll probably be stuck with it my whole life.</li>
            <li> This soap smells good and it helped a little with my cellulite.</li>
            <li> My skin is super super soft</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have enough words to say how much I love this soap.</li>
            <li> You can see it first thing when you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s on my bucket list for next order:-)</li>
            <li> I USE THIS EVERY EVENING ON MY WHOLE BODY!</li>
            <li> more so I could see if it actually helped with cellulite.</li>
            <li> The soap last more than one month for me</li>
            <li> but I really like it for some reason!</li>
            <li> Thanks Diva Stuff!</li>
            <li> Please send me more because I&#x27;m a definite follower now.</li>
            <li> but you have to be consistent with you&#x27;re toning exercises along with this soap.</li>
            <li> Thanks Diva stuff!</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole body!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in the first line people....</li>
            <li> If I can use it more religiously I will update with results.</li>
            <li> I am trying to conserve the second to try and get more longevity out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased Diva Stuff&#x27;s Cellulite cream with the same ingredients, so I have more hope for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it smelled funny probably from being packed in plastic.</li>
            <li> But once I got it out and used it; it didn&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it exactly smells like coffee.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it an even higher however.</li>
            <li> and they ship fast too!</li>
            <li> I have used so many different cellulite products and none of them worked.</li>
            <li> and it really gets your blood circulating!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be lazy and you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> The Diva Stuff line really got it right.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but the soap is very rough because of the coffee inside, I guess.</li>
            <li> I love diva stuff because they use natural ingredients that are clearly marked on there packageing</li>
            <li> I love this product because it leaves my skin smooth and supple after a few days of use continuous use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bar because I haven&#x27;t really decided about the cellulite yet, and I wanted to give it more of a chance.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft after using this!</li>
            <li> I have a crispy white cotton shower curtain and if you aren&#x27;t careful you will stain things, but overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The coffee smell was too strong (and not that delicious-walk into a coffee shop smell) and every time I used it, i was left with coffee grounds all over my body.</li>
            <li> Well than after using it a few times I love it!</li>
            <li> The idea is nice, but boy what a mess in your shower.</li>
            <li> Nice little bar for some skin pampering.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in cellulite appearance, but I haven&#x27;t used it as regularly as I should.  </li>
            <li> I make sure my skin is wet before I start</li>
            <li> It was too much for me.</li>
            <li> That stuff  stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does much for cellulite</li>
            <li> I honestly really like it.</li>
            <li> I really didnt see any in my shower</li>
            <li> You can really smell the coffee (no lie)  </li>
            <li> all natural products, IT TAKES TIME to see results, but boy is it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> -it really does work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does much for cellulite.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t really seem much of a change with anything else on my body....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exercise much at all btw.</li>
            <li> It help with my cellulite so much I can wear shorts now.</li>
            <li> but boy does it make your legs look and feel so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> It really just came out of nowhere, but this scrub has since gotten rid of those bumps.  </li>
            <li> so I was REALLY content with that too.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li> I use that side when I want to really exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I imagine towards the very end of the bar, it would get crumbly, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with that.</li>
            <li> Soap is really great,messages the body well</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin shine and exfoliates.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I absolutely have to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Saw very difference, if any, in cellulite.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s abrasive and the design is comfortable and makes massaging your skin simple</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> Cellulite-reduction has been in the media for weeks now thanks to a well-known TV show.</li>
            <li> Actually does smooth my cellulite</li>
            <li> Ive used the whole bar.</li>
            <li> I use it to exfoliate for shaving, I use it ( gently) on my face in the morning to \\</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but if you really want results I recommend squats.</li>
            <li> my surprise, not only have I noticed an astonishing difference in the appearance of cellulite, but I&#x27;ve also seen my skin shrink considerably.</li>
            <li> BUT THIS SOAP MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SOOO SOFT!!!</li>
            <li> I love the soap, and the little extras body scrubs the company sent me;)</li>
            <li> Some of the coffee grinds fall onto the shower floor as I use the product, but clean up is simple.</li>
            <li> It does get all the dead skin cells off and leaves my skin feeling new, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> however you should keep this bar in its own soap dish, I have mine in a small baggie off to the side in the shower.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how effective it is as a cellulite treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good soap but the only problem I have with it is the mess it leaves in my tub.</li>
            <li> I still have a bit more than half the bar</li>
            <li> Plus they threw in a sugar scrub and black head disolver for free!</li>
            <li> This is definitely an interesting product - I was not sure I was going to like it at first.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, but everyone has to be realistic and remember it&#x27;s not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Make your skin very soft!</li>
            <li> I loved the soap but doesn&#x27;t last long so not practical only a week!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Certainly if you are not satisfied I am sure Divastuff will see to it that you are.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I am so happy I tried this</li>
            <li> Really like this soap leaves skin really soft</li>
            <li> Waste of time better off ordering the message roller</li>
            <li> I have not really had it long enough to see if there will be a remarkable difference, but it has already started working.</li>
            <li> well, I must say the smell was just a tad bit weird, however it works great as an exfoliator and my skin is very soft after each use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re right there on the back of my thighs!!</li>
            <li> I saw this product and noticed it has all the ingredients I use plus some that were new to me like juniper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it is something that I can live with.</li>
            <li> I just love the raw layer of coffee extracts for exfoliating</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this soap irritates it.  </li>
            <li> Seeing very little improvement on my cellulite, maybe it takes more time to see results.</li>
            <li> btw those products are natural and it is a plus factor to me!</li>
            <li> Common sense tells me showering with a specific type of soap will not remove cellulite but it should help a great deal with proper diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive, and it maybe works, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of that smell.</li>
            <li> first bar lasted me only a week.</li>
            <li> while I have seen a small improvement, I think I just need to diet more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which one had the most affect--but people keep saying to me&amp;#34;  are you losing weight?...</li>
            <li> really sure how to use it ,do you scrub with flat part first,then use other side to your cellulite</li>
            <li> But it clearly stimulates your skin and has to be doing something.  </li>
            <li> and I have light cellulite on the back of my legs Even with minimal exercise</li>
            <li> It was completely dissolved within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li> and I using it with NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate, 5oz and with a stone pumice.</li>
            <li> I doubt it completely gets rid of cellulite by using this alone but it does improve skin appearance</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely remove your cellulite</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural coffee grinds</li>
            <li> It also has not stained my 40 year old, porous, fiberglass shower.</li>
            <li> I must assume that the people saying it&#x27;s completely gone in two weeks have it sitting in a dish where it&#x27;s getting dissolved by water.</li>
            <li> Probably doesnt do much for cellulite because only diet and exersize will help that.</li>
            <li> I used to rub coffee grinds directly on the problematic areas and when I did</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using it on a daily basis to see the true long term results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The raised massaging parts do not seem to wear down quickly either.</li>
            <li> I have recently finished my first bar and am considering ordering a second.</li>
            <li> This bar is a little abrasive on the skin - but that&#x27;s no necessarily a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> I am buying two at the same time now so that I can scrub both sides of my hips, which is the area I am focusing now, as well  as the high part of my thighs.</li>
            <li> Very messy, did not see any results after more than 5 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> but it exfoliates like no other!</li>
            <li> A little scratchy, but pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> However, enjoy a few minute massage and get that blood flowing!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try my new stuff next.</li>
            <li> This soap really helps my circulation and the grains you feel  are rough, leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with a cellulite cream and see a major improvement.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoothe and soft from only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I work out my legs every other day with INTENSE work outs and that doesn&#x27;t do the trick either.</li>
            <li> does work but may smell a little funny like coffee.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried about my shower since it was messy</li>
            <li> to mention that the &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; side was very wore down already..</li>
            <li> It really works extremely well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all like not really, but I can see a marked improvement in the appearance of the cellulite in my thighs and buttocks!.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful price can&#x27;t go wrong with this soap!!!</li>
            <li> but I am also working out and applying a vacuum cellulite massager</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really works, I would like to get a second one and then give the results.</li>
            <li> but the only downside is that the bar doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay really.</li>
            <li> and I could really feel it helping my circulation in those areas that usually just feel like they&#x27;re stuck</li>
            <li> The bumpy part didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> it sit as long as you can and rinse off, following with another Diva Stuff cellulite cream</li>
            <li> The bar didn&#x27;t last too long for me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to know if it works or not.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last long, or that it stains their shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long lasting and works.  </li>
            <li> Live this stiff skin shows definitely to have improved</li>
            <li> It should be stored away from the bath area and allowed to dry as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work a little, but results didn&#x27;t seem to last, only for a short time after shower.</li>
            <li> It does lat a long time.</li>
            <li> And this soap has lasted quite a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and firm.</li>
            <li> It worked for as long as I had it for.</li>
            <li> Makes a little difference really fast , you will realize it in less than a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only really noticed a very slight temporary firm of my thighs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other soaps but it left me itchy and not feeling</li>
            <li> I had lost a lot of weight in a short time, due to illness, not fat burning.</li>
            <li> I was preparing myself for eventual surgery and thought I&#x27;d give topical treatments a try, even though I thought it was extremely hoaky that a soap could benefit cellulite.</li>
            <li> It will dry you out</li>
            <li> It does dry the skin out</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean well at all so its really useless.</li>
            <li> i have a hard time finding products due to very senstive skin.</li>
            <li> At half a bar, the product has yet to crumble, even after being dropped several times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times and am using multiple products for cellulite reduction, so I&#x27;m not sure what to think just yet.  </li>
            <li> This soap makes such a mess in my tub.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and is a little messy, but it does massage pretty good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, but definitely it makes a lot of mess in my shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been there for long enough that I thought I would need surgery, or major, long-term cardiovascular exercise at the very least, to see a difference in the loose skin.</li>
            <li> They also sent me two extra little gifts.</li>
            <li> I actually had a problem with shaving bumps for a little bit...</li>
            <li> It definitely made my legs a little smoother.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t press hard or it will feel</li>
            <li> Be careful it runs so</li>
            <li> But what do you expected from one time using so</li>
            <li> If not, when the rest of the family showers and the bar gets wet it kinda gets the color all over.</li>
            <li> Could not enjoy it, Bought two bars and only used 1.</li>
            <li> but for cellulite not much yet...</li>
            <li> Lasts longer then expected.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no confidence that soap could help with my issues</li>
            <li> A  bit rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Left a few scratches</li>
            <li> but thats to be expected with Coffee</li>
            <li> and after i shower i just take a wet cloth and remove whatever coffee is in Tub easy,and no my Tub is not stained from this .</li>
            <li> so, Cellulite has not completely diminished but it is definitely diminishing slowly.</li>
            <li> Seller included other sample products.  </li>
            <li> I have been making a coffee, seaweed, sea salt, scrub for a long time, but it can be messy and time consuming.</li>
            <li> I will order again and I will try other products from Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li> other then that package came in on time and even got a sample..</li>
            <li> I have used it on other parts of my body and my face.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again and use other products.</li>
            <li> that it gets my circulation going ,i have used their  other Cellulite soap as well</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t expect my Cellulite to disappear over night but after using this and the other soap i do see some results.</li>
            <li> The other one is the pineapple and the Pumpkin one</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if the soap actually helped.</li>
            <li> WHAT A BIG MESS and waste of money.</li>
            <li> extreme thermo active cellulite cream...</li>
            <li> I little messy but no big deal since it goes down the drain.  </li>
            <li> It is a little messy but not as bad as my concoction and rinses away better than my homemade scrub.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how long it takes to work have used a week haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in cellulite appearance going to jeep using</li>
            <li> product is abrasive, as some people have complained about, but I really only notice this on the underside of the soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth any money at all.</li>
            <li> Its messy which is it be expected so rinse out out the shower but</li>
            <li> Plus it felt like I was scraping my skin; it was not very smooth.</li>
            <li> so I always had a brown trail from the soap holder down the shower wall.</li>
            <li> look at you, you&#x27;re slimming down huh?&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with dieting, and I&#x27;ve noticed I have slimmed down and look smoother.</li>
            <li> I am using a few other produces</li>
            <li> One item to be careful about is that this item tends to be a little messy.</li>
            <li> laughing at the other reviewers complaining that this product is messy...</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit strange, and I&#x27;m not sure it is coffee.</li>
            <li> All this did was make a mess in my bathtub and would stain it if it wasn&#x27;t rinsed down the drain ASAP</li>
            <li> This is already beginning  to give me results after less than a week.</li>
            <li> I notice I have less culluite on my thighs...</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother and has less cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results in less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The coffee grounds get all over your shower and make a mess.  </li>
            <li> it makes a mess</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what some sellers are saying about this bar being a mess.</li>
            <li> Makes a mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> so I can deal.with the smell and the mess</li>
            <li> yes it makes a mess in the shower...</li>
            <li> It makes a mess in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Of course a few coffee particles come off on your body when you use it but other than that I didn&#x27;t find it to be messy at all.</li>
            <li> , the bumps wear down after a few showers, but I think it&#x27;s the exfoliating and ingredients that help the cellulite appearance reduce.  </li>
            <li> Like wtf I cant wear shorts anymore its driven me crazy, esp with my climate where its so hot i live in shorts.</li>
            <li> yes it does make a little mess</li>
            <li> A little messy to use it, but overal I like it.</li>
            <li> a little messy</li>
            <li> My legs are firm.</li>
            <li> It is messy</li>
            <li> It does help to firm the skin.</li>
            <li> It is messy.</li>
            <li> So its stimulating blood flow to those &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas to remove those trapped fat cells.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used this everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the tub</li>
            <li> and YES its messy but</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like coffee and it&#x27;s messy it has coffee grounds in it.</li>
            <li> A few things did happen with this soap.</li>
            <li> and I do my thighs, butt, and arms everyday.</li>
            <li> I do (or did) have tiny thin stretch marks on my side and hip area.</li>
            <li> I will order this when my Dead Sea clay bar is out</li>
            <li> Will put an update in a few weeks...</li>
            <li> As for the Coffee Soap, I&#x27;m not going to lie, it&#x27;s a bit messy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as messy</li>
            <li> After using it a few days I saw results.</li>
            <li> A bit messy but works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are complaining about it being messy.</li>
            <li> you can feel the little coffee grinds scrubbing the cellulite away!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a mess with the coffee granules and is a little rough on the skin, but cellulite is tough!</li>
            <li> It turns into a mess with coffee ground like substance streaming all over you and the floor if it stays the least bit damp (which happens in the shower.)  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product, if allowed to remain wet for any amount of time, will dissolve quickly, so be very careful after usage.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I feel the difference when I use the bar and started to see small changes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet</li>
            <li> im not sure if it works or not</li>
            <li> You get some small presents with it</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it does anything for cellulite.</li>
            <li> , now I&#x27;m not saying that all my cellulite is gone or is it vanishing - not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> I usually order the pineapple orchard</li>
            <li> Gave it four stars because I am not sure it is working.  </li>
            <li> I thought the coffee smell would be weird, but I actually like it!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it has done the job.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in skin or cellulite and it&#x27;s very messy.</li>
            <li> I have them due to injecting medication, and they can be big and ugly.</li>
            <li> Messy to use and not pleasant wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> was the coffee grinds gets all over the shower and in my wash cloth which can be hard to rinse out after a shower.</li>
            <li> So all of the customers giving negative reviews and the people reading this that are on iffy about purchasing , everything doesn&#x27;t work for everybody that is a fact.</li>
            <li> I like using the soap, but I hate cleaning the tub afterwards, leaves to much residue</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is it drips brown when water runs over it</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that it&#x27;s quite drying.</li>
            <li> If anything at all, I can at least say I&#x27;m treating my poor, abused, crappily circulating legs with a vigorous, exfoliating massage with this soap.</li>
            <li> Not a good idea if you have a septic system.</li>
            <li> First when I got this soap I Hated it!</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin, or are afraid scratches will show (if your cellulite is that bad you are resorting to treatments, you would probably be hiding the area to begin with) then this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> Not great, but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me unfortunately</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but ill still keep using it..</li>
            <li> Shipping cost was a bit expensive, I thought.</li>
            <li> My thighs had a lot of cellulite and had horrible loose skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this, it stinks and messed up my tub.</li>
            <li> It crumbled into pieces, turned my tub brown, and it stinks..</li>
            <li> But smells like bad coffee beans.</li>
            <li> I have BAD cellulite.</li>
            <li> and I still have BAD cellulite.</li>
            <li> STains your shower so bad even bleach doesn&#x27;t get it out.</li>
            <li> Diva Stuff hasn&#x27;t disappointed me in any of my purchases.</li>
            <li> Absolutely HATE this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible soap bar , don&#x27;t even bother !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this soap!!!! I am buying two at the same time now so that I can scrub both sides of my hips, which is the area I am focusing now, as well  as the high part of my thighs. It smells great, and the nodules last a lot IF YOU DO NOT SCRUB UNDER THE SHOWER. I make sure my skin is wet before I start but I do not scrub while under the shower. I also use a cellulite reducer cream right after the shower, I can tell my skin has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. It was too much for me. It was delivered in a timely manner though.</li>
            <li> If you are going to buy this... #1.. doesn&#x27;t work at all.. #2.. if you buy it anyway.. do NOT leave it in the shower.  It turns into a mess with coffee ground like substance streaming all over you and the floor if it stays the least bit damp (which happens in the shower.)  It was completely dissolved within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Did&#x27;t see any changes or results</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have enough words to say how much I love this soap. I&#x27;ve tried other soaps but it left me itchy and not feeling like it did it&#x27;s job. Not this soap!!! My legs are firm. My cellulite is almost gone. My tummy, butt and thighs have lost weight. All these benefits and some dancing and you get what you paid for, of course with plenty of water and kale with your meals. This soap really helps my circulation and the grains you feel  are rough, leaves your skin feeling soft. I love this soap. I&#x27;m on my 7th order of this soap. Thank you Diva!!!:)</li>
            <li> Loved it. The smell is magic. Like a coffee heaven. And the soap did help me to get rid off the cellulite. Thank you</li>
            <li> The bumpy part didn&#x27;t last long. The bar itself did last about a month though (used on only thighs and butt). Seemed to work a little, but results didn&#x27;t seem to last, only for a short time after shower. Feels good though!</li>
            <li> No visible improvement, don&#x27;t think I will repurchase</li>
            <li> Waste of time better off ordering the message roller</li>
            <li> Makes a little difference really fast , you will realize it in less than a week</li>
            <li> Make your skin very soft! and smell good</li>
            <li> scent leaves a lot to be desired - no change in skin tone</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference but it feels good!  The coffee grounds get all over your shower and make a mess.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> lasts a good long time and skin feels great!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It exfoliated well. It won&#x27;t do anything for your cellulite however.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me unfortunately</li>
            <li> I have tried all kind of coffee soaps and this by far as the highest concentrate of coffee out of them all.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!! Its messy which is it be expected so rinse out out the shower but what a great product.&lt;br /&gt;You have me hooked!! :) Thank you xoxo</li>
            <li> Very messy, did not see any results after more than 5 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> That stuff  stuff really works. You can see it first thing when you step out of the shower. The skin looks smoother in one use! The best is  to use the other anti cellulite products from Diva Stuff ! I use them all and they make me look gorgeous! Those guys also send you samples. Lately I got a sample of the blueberry scented lotion and it smells awesome it&#x27;s on my bucket list for next order:-) btw those products are natural and it is a plus factor to me!</li>
            <li> I USE THIS EVERY EVENING ON MY WHOLE BODY! EVEN ON MY FACE AND I HAVE VERY FUNNY SKIN I BREAK OUT VERY EASY!!!! BUT THIS SOAP MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SOOO SOFT!!! BUT I DON&#x27;T SEE THE DIFFRENCE IN MY CELLULITE AS OF YET BUT I WILL LET YOU KNOW LATER! LOL!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for one week in conjunction with Diva Stuff Pineapple Orchid Cellulite Cream. I can&#x27;t say it has reduced my cellulite but I have noticed an overall healthier look and feel to my skin. I have inherited not the best leg circulation and it has become noticeable in my 30s. I&#x27;m also a commuter and spend a lot of time on my feet at work. If anything at all, I can at least say I&#x27;m treating my poor, abused, crappily circulating legs with a vigorous, exfoliating massage with this soap. I feel like the coffee grounds do an amazing exfoliating job and the caffeine has got to do some good to get some blood flow going. Maybe it is too soon to say if it helps cellulite, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, my legs feel pretty dang good.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and price! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> First when I got this soap I Hated it! Well than after using it a few times I love it! I don&#x27;t think it does much for cellulite but it exfoliates like no other! It is messy but I just put it on my rack and clean the shower after. It smells just like coffee. I honestly really like it. I follow it with the key lime pie smoothing cream also you of my favorite things! I think this is worth giving a chance. It will dry you out but I you use lotion right after your fine. It Will Leave coffee bean flakes in your shower! I would put in a soap dish! Will be buying another one this week even. If used right willast about a month.</li>
            <li> I feel the difference when I use the bar and started to see small changes. Some of the cellulite on my arms have begun to dissapear. I also maintain my diet and work out on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It dissolved on your body in the shower. Smells pretty good. Just started using it so getting used to the grains that&#x27;s in the bar. So im looking closely at my skin to see any difference. Be careful it runs so after used put it in close soap dish.</li>
            <li> I like using the soap, but I hate cleaning the tub afterwards, leaves to much residue</li>
            <li> It was okay. But what do you expected from one time using so when I get some more money I will try it again.</li>
            <li> I do like this soap. I cannot really say if it &amp;#34;works!&amp;#34;, I am working out, eating better, and trying my best to remedy my skin. I am hypothyroid and have many skin issues so maybe I am the wrong person to judge. I do like the way it makes my skin feel after use. Smell is no issue. however you should keep this bar in its own soap dish, I have mine in a small baggie off to the side in the shower. If not, when the rest of the family showers and the bar gets wet it kinda gets the color all over.</li>
            <li> The coffee smell was too strong (and not that delicious-walk into a coffee shop smell) and every time I used it, i was left with coffee grounds all over my body. Plus it felt like I was scraping my skin; it was not very smooth. I am sure it&#x27;s great, but just wasn&#x27;t for me. I wish that I was able to tolerate it more so I could see if it actually helped with cellulite.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews i decided to give this a try. i got this yesterday and have only used it twice but i love the smell and at first i was worried because most of the reviews say that the coffee grinds make a huge mess. I really didnt see any in my shower but i did notice the coffee grinds on my body. My skin feels smoothe and soft from only 2 uses. Absolutely loveeee the free samples of anti cellulite cream. I love diva stuff because they use natural ingredients that are clearly marked on there packageing i have a hard time finding products due to very senstive skin. Defenitly will be ordering more!!!!</li>
            <li> All this did was make a mess in my bathtub and would stain it if it wasn&#x27;t rinsed down the drain ASAP</li>
            <li> I love this product because it leaves my skin smooth and supple after a few days of use continuous use.  You can really smell the coffee (no lie)  but the only downside is that the bar doesn&#x27;t last long.  I would recommend placing it a container if you want to get a couple of more showers out of it.  Other than that it is a great product!!</li>
            <li> I am using a few other produces but my cellulite is visibly fading away and im sure this is helping it!!!</li>
            <li> This soap is great! It smells fantastic! The raised massaging parts do not seem to wear down quickly either. My skin feels extremely soft. This is already beginning  to give me results after less than a week. That surprised me a great deal. They also sent me two extra little gifts. One of which was a self tanning cream which is in a no way overpowering it looks very natural and smells delicious. They also sent me a coconut milk hair treatment. I absolutely love coconut anything because it smells good and is great for you. All in all I would say these guys have definitely got their stuff together.</li>
            <li> This bar rules. Its my favorite product so far that I&#x27;ve tried. Love the coffee grinds that exfoliate and massage my skin during my shower or bath.  Nice little bar for some skin pampering. I like to use their pineapple orchid cellulite cream afterwards. It smells awesome. The Diva Stuff line really got it right.</li>
            <li> I love this coffee soap .It is helping me a lot to treat my cellulite and exfoliate my skin.The appearance of my cellulite has improved a lot and I using it with NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate, 5oz and with a stone pumice. The soap last more than one month for me and I am going to buy another one:).</li>
            <li> The product was delivered in a promptly manner. Not sure if it works yet but it does make my legs tingle. Seller included other sample products.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if the soap bar reduced anything but I really like it for some reason! LOL</li>
            <li> This is definitely an interesting product - I was not sure I was going to like it at first. I was really happy after using it though - it smells really nice and is a great exfoliator. One item to be careful about is that this item tends to be a little messy. I have a crispy white cotton shower curtain and if you aren&#x27;t careful you will stain things, but overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Did not see any results</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Seems to be working great in tightening my skin and reducing appearance of cellulite, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This soap makes such a mess in my tub. Could not enjoy it, Bought two bars and only used 1.</li>
            <li> Live this stiff skin shows definitely to have improved</li>
            <li> Loved this soap!! absolutely loved it!! it smells amazing and it leaves your skin so so soft it&#x27;s incredible, I am already recommending this product and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love this soap I cam already see a change in my cellulite. I love the smell as well , so nice</li>
            <li> It does help to firm the skin. I have been using it for 3 weeks and noticed a difference. It smells yummy like coffee candy. I will continue to buy just because of the smell. It does dry the skin out but I moisturize with mango butter so that isn&#x27;t a problem. I doubt it completely gets rid of cellulite by using this alone but it does improve skin appearance</li>
            <li> Great product. Cant wait to place another order. The smell and feeling was amazing. I am definitely going to suggest this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I have a bit of cellulite on my thighs and bum.&lt;br /&gt;Now that it&#x27;s bikini season I&#x27;ll go back to my yearly summer ritual of using this delightful, coffee scented cellulite soap.&lt;br /&gt;I love the shape and size, it&#x27;s ideal for scrubbing at pesky, hard to treat cellulite. Scrub away and massage it in with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Let it sit as long as you can and rinse off, following with another Diva Stuff cellulite cream (the orchid pineapple is amazing.)&lt;br /&gt;Like all natural products, IT TAKES TIME to see results, but boy is it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product through their official site, but have to comment-it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is you WILL get some coffee granules in you tub/shower, but do you prefer that or the look of cellulite on your thights?  It&#x27;s a small price to pay really.</li>
            <li> Love this idea.&lt;br /&gt; I have been making a coffee, seaweed, sea salt, scrub for a long time, but it can be messy and time consuming. I saw this product and noticed it has all the ingredients I use plus some that were new to me like juniper.&lt;br /&gt;I use it more often because it is much easier to rub on  this soap then try to apply a homemade scrub.  It is a little messy but not as bad as my concoction and rinses away better than my homemade scrub. After using it three times I  noticed that my skin looks tighter, smoother.  Cellulite is noticeably improved.  This is a product that has to be continued as a regular regiment to keep the good results.  I am looking forward to buying more Diva Stuff  Cellulite Reducing Bar.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and is a little messy, but it does massage pretty good. I would love this if they made better colors and scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars... Not because my cellulite has disappeared, but because it is an excellent exfoliater! My dog keeps stealing it off the side of my tub so it must taste good too! Just put it in a soap dish.. It is messy.</li>
            <li> it makes a mess but it&#x27;s a good scrub.. I don&#x27;t know if it does much for cellulite.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this because it has coffee in it I already knew bout coffee as a great exfoliant for smooth soft tighter looking skin. I&#x27;m glad I bought this have been using only 5 days and I see a difference! My skin looks much more toned and tighter and even. I just ordered another since im almost done with the bar.  The bar didn&#x27;t last too long for me i think cus I keep scrubbing with it for like 10 min. In the shower each day? Lol but def love this soap so far! And can&#x27;t wait to see more results! :)</li>
            <li> I like it just forget to use it sometimes.i hope it works.not really sure how to use it ,do you scrub with flat part first,then use other side to your cellulite</li>
            <li> This bar is a little abrasive on the skin - but that&#x27;s no necessarily a bad thing.  It gets the blood moving in the area where you use it and I&#x27;m petty sure that that is what it is supposed to do along with the what the ingredients do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diva Stuff is a great company and I will not hesitate to order from them again.  All natural products, great customer service, quick shipping and samples of their other products in your order to boot.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> well, I must say the smell was just a tad bit weird, however it works great as an exfoliator and my skin is very soft after each use. after each use I then  apply&lt;br /&gt;slim extreme thermo active cellulite cream...</li>
            <li> im not sure if it works or not but the bar crumbles away pretty quick. they did send a couple samples and i like the way it makes my skin feel. i like it as a soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this soap so I cannot attest to it&#x27;s cellulite removing ability.  But I have noticed every time after use, my skin tingles and is flushed.  So its stimulating blood flow to those &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas to remove those trapped fat cells.  Common sense tells me showering with a specific type of soap will not remove cellulite but it should help a great deal with proper diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> skin got tighter...i haven&#x27;t really seem much of a change with anything else on my body....it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of cellulite just some dimpling.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference but probably will continue to use.  I little messy but no big deal since it goes down the drain.  I use regular soap and this on my problem areas.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lil cellulite on my bum when I was younger (I&#x27;m only 29 now) but it never bothered me. After having my first child, BOOM! They&#x27;re right there on the back of my thighs!! Like wtf I cant wear shorts anymore its driven me crazy, esp with my climate where its so hot i live in shorts. So guess what, I haven&#x27;t given up hope and I&#x27;ve used this everyday. I don&#x27;t exercise much at all btw. Except for running circles around my baby and husband but yeah DAMN i think it works! I use it everyday in the tub and YES its messy but so what, i just give the tub a rinse after. I use it all over my body just cause it feels that good. Smells like coffee cake idk what everyone is going on about, talk about DIVAS. Lol. Jk. Ok so, Cellulite has not completely diminished but it is definitely diminishing slowly. My skin is super smooth, like yeah my ass is smooooth. I will order again and I will try other products from Diva Stuff. In fact I&#x27;ve just ordered the Pore Perfect and Orchid cellulite cream. Thanks Diva Stuff! I&#x27;ve never actually thanked a vendor from Amazon before but you guys are sweet. I really appreciate the free stuff that came along with it. Please send me more because I&#x27;m a definite follower now. I&#x27;m a believer! Can&#x27;t wait to try my new stuff next. Will keep you guys updated :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this, it stinks and messed up my tub. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to know if it works or not.</li>
            <li> It does just as they claim. It help with my cellulite so much I can wear shorts now. My legs loke great!!!</li>
            <li> The soap it is very good..but for cellulite not much yet...Hope I will see some results and I will let you know</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but the soap is very rough because of the coffee inside, I guess. My skin is very sensitive and this soap irritates it.  I end up having red skin a day after I use it.  I don&#x27;t know if it helps in any way and I won&#x27;t find out because I can&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Just received the coffee soap and had to give it a try right away! Its so cool, can tell real coffee is used and the grounds helped to exfoliate and smooth my skin in my first use. That&#x27;s a super plus so we shall see the results when I get to use longer!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It smells great, very sweet, and it works. Not only did it reduce my cellulite, but it also reduced the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BAR!!! It doesn&#x27;t completely remove your cellulite but boy does it make your legs look and feel so much smoother.  I&#x27;m on my second bar already!!!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the reviews I have read, the product is great. This company got it right with the ingredients used in this soap. I use a massage brush and massage my buttock, abs and legs after applying the soap. Its been three weeks using the soap and the results are amazing. I bought more soap bars!!!!</li>
            <li> I have recently finished my first bar and am considering ordering a second. I believe I saw some results when using this daily. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star.. I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but ill still keep using it.. other then that package came in on time and even got a sample..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything but exfoliate your skin. You get some small presents with it so that&#x27;s kinda nice.</li>
            <li> This is one exotic scrub that leaves you skin feeling refreshed and soft. I just love the raw layer of coffee extracts for exfoliating and I love the smells because it wakes me up. I does smooth out your cellulite but you have to be consistent with you&#x27;re toning exercises along with this soap.</li>
            <li> Messy to use and not pleasant wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I love Diva Stuff products, they never disappoint. Wonderful soap bar has real coffee but is not scratchy like some things that add real beans. I LOVE this soap bar, great smell, great price, great product! Still wondering... how does she do it? One of the best anti-cellulite products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been softer. I recommend having it in its own tray if you use it in the shower. The free samples were a great incentive. I think i will keep buying this. plus its way better than using chemicals which I have no clue how to pronounce them and what they even are. Organic is the best way to go.</li>
            <li> Love it love it! I think it is helping to reduce the appearance of my celly.. Thanks Diva stuff! And I will be repurchasing</li>
            <li> Absolutely HATE this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I would&#x27;ve listened to what others reviewed about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it one time and threw it away. It crumbled into pieces, turned my tub brown, and it stinks..&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention that the &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; side was very wore down already..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes your body feel after you use it. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  You can feel the coffee grounds working on the bumps in my legs.  They didn&#x27;t stint on the grounds either.  (they actually help with cleaning the shower, too.)  The soap came quickly with some great samples all safely wrapped.  Diva Stuff hasn&#x27;t disappointed me in any of my purchases.</li>
            <li> Works great!!  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bar of soap!  My legs look better this year than they have in years!!  Definitely will continue to buy!!</li>
            <li> Great for legs it starts to improve and gives result after month of using it</li>
            <li> I just started using the product and haven&#x27;t saw any changes just yet so I&#x27;ll give it a lol more time to see the results.. Stay tuned!!!</li>
            <li> I have not really had it long enough to see if there will be a remarkable difference, but it has already started working.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! I use it on my whole body! I am extremely impressed with this! I was skeptical but I am so happy I tried this and I will be purchasing it again in the future</li>
            <li> I love coffee and I love scrubs.  It makes my skin feel so smooth.  I actually had a problem with shaving bumps for a little bit... It really just came out of nowhere, but this scrub has since gotten rid of those bumps.  Kinda cray bc I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different things for the shaving bumps (i.e., changing blade, different shaving creams and lotions, different body lotions, oils, after-shave, etc...).  This is the only thing that has worked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, but definitely it makes a lot of mess in my shower. It&#x27;s full of coffee grounds</li>
            <li> It does what it says it would...I notice I have less culluite on my thighs...this is a really good product. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in LOVE with this product. After trying both this and Franks I&#x27;ve definitely switched to Diva Stuff&#x27;s coffee bar over Franks.&lt;br /&gt;It works in my opinion better than franks, it smells so good, it helps with cellulite, it lasts longer, and it&#x27;s a FRACTION of the cost.  After finding it on amazon after some research I decided to give this bar a try and I&#x27;m SO happy I did. Will for sure be getting more of these!&lt;br /&gt;Im laughing at the other reviewers complaining that this product is messy... Did you read the description? It&#x27;s in the first line people.... It&#x27;s natural coffee grinds they aren&#x27;t going to just disappear, it exfoliates your skin. And plus in my opinion that&#x27;s the fun in it and it smells so good. At first I was worried about my shower since it was messy but it doesn&#x27;t affect it at ALL so I was REALLY content with that too.&lt;br /&gt;When I used it I used one side to exfoliate my skin and then the bumpy side I rubbed into my &#x27;problem&#x27; areas in a circle and I could really feel it helping my circulation in those areas that usually just feel like they&#x27;re stuck there.&lt;br /&gt;So happy I switched from Franks to this. A &#x27;more-in-1&#x27; product and I&#x27;m saving $$$ too</li>
            <li> A little scratchy, but pretty decent.  Good smell, the bumps wear down after a few showers, but I think it&#x27;s the exfoliating and ingredients that help the cellulite appearance reduce.  You will probably find coffee grains in interesting places post shower, lol.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in cellulite appearance, but I haven&#x27;t used it as regularly as I should.  If I can use it more religiously I will update with results. But it&#x27;s a good exfoliator and the smell helps wake me up in the shower.  The company also sent along some free samples with the order and that was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating. But smells like bad coffee beans. Not sure if it works.  But still ok product. Lasts longer then expected.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have not seen a reduction in cellulite but love the smell of this item as well as the feel of it rubbing across my skin.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how long it takes to work have used a week haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in cellulite appearance going to jeep using maybe it&#x27;ll take time .....  Over all still a good product smells nice</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great using.  I am not sure if it does anything for cellulite. to be honest, I did not notice a difference in that area.  However, enjoy a few minute massage and get that blood flowing! Quick ship and nice price so overall, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I like it...&lt;br /&gt;I got this soap, I love the way it exfoliate my skin, the aroma is very gentle,, if you love coffee this is for you. I&#x27;m not sure if it really works, I would like to get a second one and then give the results. Now, I am more aware of how to reduce and make disappear cellulite....but, over all it is a good soap...</li>
            <li> I loved the soap but doesn&#x27;t last long so not practical only a week!</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good. I am not sure how effective it is as a cellulite treatment. It is kinda gritty. It does lat a long time. The only bad thing is it drips brown when water runs over it so I always had a brown trail from the soap holder down the shower wall. It does not stain and I just sprayed water over it and it washed away easily. I would buy this item again. Great smelling coffee soap</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what some sellers are saying about this bar being a mess. Of course a few coffee particles come off on your body when you use it but other than that I didn&#x27;t find it to be messy at all. I also love the smell of this product and the smooth skin it gives me after every use! I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are complaining about it being messy. Of course there will be coffee grounds in the shower, there&#x27;s coffee grounds in the bar. Absolutely necessary as the targeting ingredient in this product. Caffeine is the stimulant, breaking apart the fat cells. I think this product is wonderful. Rinse out your shower as soon as you are through, its a very easy fix.</li>
            <li> This soap was pretty good.  One thing I didn&#x27;t like was the coffee grinds gets all over the shower and in my wash cloth which can be hard to rinse out after a shower. This is supposed to help with cellulite.  I&#x27;ve only really noticed a very slight temporary firm of my thighs.  The smell is like coffee but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit strange, and I&#x27;m not sure it is coffee. It&#x27;s not expensive, and it maybe works, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of that smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like coffee and it&#x27;s messy it has coffee grounds in it. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the cellulite, But I do think it&#x27;s a good exfoliate. I doubt I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bar because I haven&#x27;t really decided about the cellulite yet, and I wanted to give it more of a chance. A few things did happen with this soap. I&#x27;ll list the good first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~It smells really good! Not like coffee but a good coffee cake.&lt;br /&gt;~It exfoliates really well. I have used it on other parts of my body and my face. If you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t press hard or it will feel scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;~It helps get rid of the huge bruises on my thighs! I have them due to injecting medication, and they can be big and ugly. But the soap gets the blood flowing and my bruises go away much more quickly! I was pleasantly surprised &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;~I love that it&#x27;s natural and cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;~I got a free sample of yummy-smelling pineapple orchid cream with each order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~It stained the white grout in my shower. I have to use bleach to get it off, and a LOT of it, and that seems really counterproductive, considering I try to use as many cruelty-free items in my house as possible.&lt;br /&gt;~I got coffee grounds EVERYWHERE on my body. You may get coffee grounds where coffee grounds have no business being.&lt;br /&gt;~The coffee grounds will be all over your shower/tub.&lt;br /&gt;~The first bar lasted me only a week. I am trying to conserve the second to try and get more longevity out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will edit my review when I decide if it&#x27;s helping the cellulite or not.</li>
            <li> still waiting for it to work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with a cellulite cream and see a major improvement. My skin looks smoother and has less cellulite. I do work out and eat right too. Yes, it&#x27;s a mess with the coffee granules and is a little rough on the skin, but cellulite is tough!</li>
            <li> Smells good but gritty like coffee grounds but I am sure it is exfoliating. Can&#x27;t say it does anything for the cellulite.</li>
            <li> Love soap will order again</li>
            <li> Only used it once.  Smelled good.  Not sure if it works though lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this soap. I had absolutely no confidence that soap could help with my issues but I was amazed at the results. I had lost a lot of weight in a short time, due to illness, not fat burning. My thighs had a lot of cellulite and had horrible loose skin. I was preparing myself for eventual surgery and thought I&#x27;d give topical treatments a try, even though I thought it was extremely hoaky that a soap could benefit cellulite. I read through all the reviews and decided to purchase this despite people saying the bar crumbles and it doesn&#x27;t last long, or that it stains their shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, not only have I noticed an astonishing difference in the appearance of cellulite, but I&#x27;ve also seen my skin shrink considerably. I&#x27;ve used the soap for about a month and I&#x27;m delighted with it. I still have a bit more than half the bar and I do my thighs, butt, and arms everyday. The skin shrinking alone has astonished me beyond compare. I did not expect this to happen. It&#x27;s been there for long enough that I thought I would need surgery, or major, long-term cardiovascular exercise at the very least, to see a difference in the loose skin. What a blessing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is abrasive, as some people have complained about, but I really only notice this on the underside of the soap. I use that side when I want to really exfoliate. The bumps on the top of the soap melt off but the soap stays more smooth on that side. If you have very sensitive skin, or are afraid scratches will show (if your cellulite is that bad you are resorting to treatments, you would probably be hiding the area to begin with) then this might not be for you. At half a bar, the product has yet to crumble, even after being dropped several times. I imagine towards the very end of the bar, it would get crumbly, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with that. It also has not stained my 40 year old, porous, fiberglass shower. I can&#x27;t take a shower in it where the dirt and oil on my feet doesn&#x27;t stain this thing, so I&#x27;m astonished to read people complaining about it staining theirs. And this soap has lasted quite a long time. I have it on a showerhead rack so it dries off quickly. I must assume that the people saying it&#x27;s completely gone in two weeks have it sitting in a dish where it&#x27;s getting dissolved by water. I would say this soap is likely to last me 2-3 months at the rate it&#x27;s dissolving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it and hope you give it a try. After using it for a month, I just purchased a bunch more. I probably have 10 extra soaps now. I would pay $30 for a soap that produces results this amazing. I credit my results entirely to this soap, even though I  have used some Finnulite sporadically. I don&#x27;t recommend that product. You get almost nothing and it&#x27;s definitely not for larger areas. That only lasted about a week. I&#x27;ve just purchased Diva Stuff&#x27;s Cellulite cream with the same ingredients, so I have more hope for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and by the way, I would turn off the water or turn the shower head away, use the soap and lather the areas very well, let the product sit on my skin for a few minutes, as I conditioned my hair and whatnot. I think letting the product sit on for a bit is key, and that is why I&#x27;m dying from excitement to try the cream!</li>
            <li> It really works extremely well!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if  this will help reduce cellulite, but it works great as exfoliate.  Will purchase again and use other products. Shipping cost was a bit expensive, I thought.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product by mistake but, I am glad that I did. I do not have cellulite so I can not speak on how well this product works for that but it is the best exfoliate I have every used. The bar does leave tiny remnants like coffee grounds in the shower but it is something that I can live with. I use it for my legs before I remove hair. It has reduced ingrown hairs tremendously! I do (or did) have tiny thin stretch marks on my side and hip area. But, after exfoliating with this they have lightened and tightened up! I am buying another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: the customer service is top notch. Divastuff values their customers. So all of the customers giving negative reviews and the people reading this that are on iffy about purchasing , everything doesn&#x27;t work for everybody that is a fact. Certainly if you are not satisfied I am sure Divastuff will see to it that you are.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after using!</li>
            <li> this stuff should be used over the whole body it didnt reduce cellulite but its like a super amazing feel.  nice grip and a nutritional soap.  we need more stuff like this.  more oatmeal baths.  more yum. yeah awesome scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice I loved the exfoliating properties and the smell</li>
            <li> Thanks for great service and gifts! Soap is really great,messages the body well,also it has a great smell and I am happy with it.thanks!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious. A little messy to use it, but overal I like it. I use my scrub after it to combat cellulite</li>
            <li> Horrible soap bar , don&#x27;t even bother !</li>
            <li> Does nothing for the skin.  Very disappointed, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! My skin feels soft and firm. Plus they threw in a sugar scrub and black head disolver for free!</li>
            <li> Great! Leaves skin so smooth and soft. It&#x27;s great for exfoliating and has a great scent! Wish the bar was bigger,that way it would last me longer.</li>
            <li> A  bit rough on my skin. Left a few scratches</li>
            <li> I actually need to buy another bar.  I think it works well, now I&#x27;m not saying that all my cellulite is gone or is it vanishing - not sure yet.  But it clearly stimulates your skin and has to be doing something.  I will continue to buy this item.</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent.  It really makes your skin shine and exfoliates.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Love it! Good results!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but very messy</li>
            <li> Seeing very little improvement on my cellulite, maybe it takes more time to see results.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I usually order the pineapple orchard but this is a nice change it dose have some coffee grids in it but it&#x27;s nice it&#x27;s like a srub bar I will order this when my Dead Sea clay bar is out I like to switch it up I love all the smells</li>
            <li> Gave it four stars because I am not sure it is working.  I use it every time I shower and I put on the NIVEA Skin Firming &amp; Smoothing Concentrated Serum after the shower and while I have seen a small improvement, I think I just need to diet more.  It does get all the dead skin cells off and leaves my skin feeling new, which is nice.  I thought the coffee smell would be weird, but I actually like it!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It really works. Thank you Diva Stuff!</li>
            <li> Great works great on legs and buttox wish I ordered more than one</li>
            <li> The idea is nice, but boy what a mess in your shower. Coffee grinds everywhere. Not a good idea if you have a septic system.</li>
            <li> I love that is smells like chocolate cake... you can feel the little coffee grinds scrubbing the cellulite away! Will put an update in a few weeks...</li>
            <li> I liked the soap, it did help exfoliate my skin. I have BAD cellulite. I&#x27;m only 17 and it runs in my family I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6 and 120 pounds. 13% body fat and I still have BAD cellulite. I work out my legs every other day with INTENSE work outs and that doesn&#x27;t do the trick either. I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle from a bar of soap but I did was exfoliation to help get better circulation. It definitely made my legs a little smoother. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, it&#x27;s a bit scratchy but I didn&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I don&#x27;t think this bar of soap should promise cellulite extinction, but more so exfoliation. I&#x27;m not disappointed really, I&#x27;ll probably be stuck with it my whole life. Good product. Not great, but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the seller because she also sent me a &amp;#34;cold fighting Chapstick&amp;#34; which I LOVE! And a trial sized &amp;#34;cellulite cream&amp;#34; smelled amazing and VERY moisturizing. Both were free of charge. I would buy from this seller again. She is very genuine and everything is all natural with respectable ingredients.</li>
            <li> It worked for as long as I had it for. I actually seen the difference while using the soap. It works and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful Cellulite Soap from Diva Stuff, i find this to not be as messy as some say,yes it does make a little mess but thats to be expected with Coffee and it is stated in the description about it .Anyway I love this soap smells awesome and i like that it gets my circulation going ,i have used their  other Cellulite soap as well and i think they all work great ,like everything things take time i didn&#x27;t expect my Cellulite to disappear over night but after using this and the other soap i do see some results. The other one is the pineapple and the Pumpkin one all great and after i shower i just take a wet cloth and remove whatever coffee is in Tub easy,and no my Tub is not stained from this .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily notice a difference in cellulite reduction with this product and it was a bit scratchy/rough on the skin. It also leaves brown coffee grounds in the shower so you should make sure you have a soap dish to place it on and take extra time to clean the shower after use.</li>
            <li> Really like this soap leaves skin really soft</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference, it just got a lot of brown coffee all over my shower which I had to scrub off. Might be nice for just a soap bar but doesn&#x27;t work for cellulite areas.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it smelled funny probably from being packed in plastic. But once I got it out and used it; it didn&#x27;t smell funny. I wouldn&#x27;t say it exactly smells like coffee. But when you use it you sure can see those coffee grounds on your skin. I like the way it makes my skin feel afterwards. I just started using it so I don&#x27;t know about results yet. But I am going to order more I like the way it exfoliates so hopefully it is doing it&#x27;s job. Oh and did I mention I love this soap!</li>
            <li> This soap is very good. As soon as I started using it I felt it working. I actually felt the circulation in my stomach increasing :-D</li>
            <li> I only got 3 uses out of it before the nodules smoothed out.  It does smell great and is a good exfoliator.  The seller does send you free samples of other things which is nice.  I wouldn&#x27;t say its the best for cellulite removal though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely have to give this product 5 stars. I wish I could give it an even higher however. Definitely recommend product. Thank you for the samples as well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in skin or cellulite and it&#x27;s very messy.</li>
            <li> This soap smells good and it helped a little with my cellulite. It brought better circulation to that area making the skin appear smoother. It definitely smells like coffee. It&#x27;s a good soap but the only problem I have with it is the mess it leaves in my tub.</li>
            <li> OMG!  What can be more suitable?  This bar is &amp;#34;DA&#x27; BOMB&amp;#34; !!!!!  I love the way it makes my thighs feel, so revived, and my skin so soft from the exfoliation.  I happened to love the coffee smell too.  I ordered 2, and today I&#x27;m reordering---I think I&#x27;m hooked.  Bottom Line:  I&#x27;ve been using the bar 1- 2 x&#x27;s a day (am/pm) for about 4 weeks, along with Finulite Lotions (another product sold on amazon).  I&#x27;m not sure which one had the most affect--but people keep saying to me&amp;#34;  are you losing weight?...look at you, you&#x27;re slimming down huh?&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m all like not really, but I can see a marked improvement in the appearance of the cellulite in my thighs and buttocks!.  I&#x27;m optimistic again because cellulite is B@#$% to improve let alone remove.  Drinks lots of water &amp; keep moving!  I hope this review is helpful to someone! :-)</li>
            <li> She indicated that she did not see a change or felt any different, prior to purchasing this product.  We will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good soap, will definitely order more. It makes my skin feel some smooth. Love how it feel when I massage on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way it is so natural and makes my skin feel amazing. I am looking forward to using it on a daily basis to see the true long term results.&lt;br /&gt; I enjoy the Diva Stuff products because you can feel and smell the ingredients that are used in the products.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin is super super soft it smells great.</li>
            <li> Saw very difference, if any, in cellulite.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me...</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Long lasting and works.  I&#x27;ve seen results in less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s a reduction in cellulite but it def. gives your skin a good scrub and caffeine is supposed to help plump skin.  I like that as soon as it hits your skin it&#x27;s abrasive and the design is comfortable and makes massaging your skin simple</li>
            <li> This is awesome! I had gotten a sample size of it and I fell in love!  At first I wasn&#x27;t to sure about the smell,  but I have grown to really love the smell.  I just bought the full size of this, and I am happy with it.  I don&#x27;t have any cellulite so I can&#x27;t say if it helps with that, but it does a wonderful job exfoliating my skin. My skin is super soft after using this! I love that all the ingredients are natural. Diva Stuff is amazing, I love their products because they work, are natural, affordable,  and they ship fast too!</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. I will buy more. However, doesn&#x27;t eliminate the cellulite 100% .... Just help to reduce it</li>
            <li> I have been using the soap bar for the last 2 weeks and im seeing results already. The one thing im not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this after searching dozens of products to help reduce the appearance of cellulite. I intend to write about it for my blog, EverBeautiful.com. Cellulite-reduction has been in the media for weeks now thanks to a well-known TV show. I began my Amazon search with seaweed scrubs and ended up here, with Diva Stuff Cellulite Reducing Soap Bar With Coffee, Juniper and Kelp. The product came on time and was packaged with two bonus products - a lip balm and a lovely antibacterial hand lotion. I would buy either of these products, they smell and work so well. I tucked them into my handbag and use them all the time. As for the Coffee Soap, I&#x27;m not going to lie, it&#x27;s a bit messy. But it feels great to use and makes my skin smooth and soft. Some of the coffee grinds fall onto the shower floor as I use the product, but clean up is simple. I just use my hand held shower head to rinse the floor of the shower and all is well.  I love the way the coffee soap smells and feels and I love what it does to my skin.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Works well but it smells gross. Makes a mess in the shower. Actually does smooth my cellulite so I can deal.with the smell and the mess</li>
            <li> yes it makes a mess in the shower... But I love it, smells great &amp; exfoliates. Probably doesnt do much for cellulite because only diet and exersize will help that. I will be buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> loved the product. does work but may smell a little funny like coffee. I am ordering again . price is right</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! I have been using Nivea anti cellulite serum twice/day for almost a month with NO results. I have used so many different cellulite products and none of them worked. I used this soap ONE TIME and noticed a huge difference. I am so glad I found this. I will continue to buy. The seller was so nice and also gave me some facial scrub (haven&#x27;t tried it yet) and some pineapple anti cellulite cream which is amazing as well! I will definitely be buying the cellulite cream in addition to the soap.</li>
            <li> Great products! Will continue to purchase from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> this product is nor result to me  is just smell coffee and don&#x27;t use white cloth it will ruin it.</li>
            <li> The soap is messy and very &amp;#34;liquidish&amp;#34;. It makes a mess in the bathroom. I used to rub coffee grinds directly on the problematic areas and when I did so I felt that the grinds are stimulating the blood stream. It didn&#x27;t happen with this soap. It was too smooth and liquidy. Not sure if it has done the job. I admit I had a significant reduction in cellulite but I am also working out and applying a vacuum cellulite massager so I&#x27;m not sure if the soap actually helped. I think I will try a different coffee soap next time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried the soap yet and I know I&#x27;ll order from you again. The sample lotion made me smell so wonderful and it was sweet!</li>
            <li> WHAT A BIG MESS and waste of money. If I didn&#x27;t throw out the packaging I would have returned them promptly.</li>
            <li> I love the soap, and the little extras body scrubs the company sent me;) Wonderful price can&#x27;t go wrong with this soap!!!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Feels nice. Smells like coffee which is one of my favorite smells!!</li>
            <li> fell apart in the shower</li>
            <li> Package arrived fairly quickly. Been using the soap for about two weeks now. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, but everyone has to be realistic and remember it&#x27;s not a miracle product. I believe if your walking, exercising regularly the soap will help with the appearance of cellulite. It does smell good, makes your skin very soft, but will make a huge mess in your shower. Just rinse your shower down good to remove lose coffee grinds.</li>
            <li> This is such a scam, I can&#x27;t believe I actually paid for it! It looks nothing like the picture, that&#x27;s one. It doesn&#x27;t work at all, that&#x27;s two. The only thing it does, however, is making my skin feel as if I was &amp;#34;massaging&amp;#34; it with a  sand paper. Don&#x27;t fall for this one. It&#x27;s not worth any money at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product and you can not beat the price!! Don&#x27;t let the low price deter you! It does stain if you let it and the coffee runs...just rinse the tub after your shower...easy fix. I can feel the difference and it really gets your blood circulating! Great job diva stuff!! I also loved that my purchase came with other diva stuff samples! Love it!</li>
            <li> wishful thinking. Dont notice any changes.  It&#x27;s cheap so give a try if you want, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up to high.</li>
            <li> Ive used the whole bar. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for it and I have light cellulite on the back of my legs Even with minimal exercise it doesn&#x27;t do a thing. It smells good and does exfoliate. Doesn&#x27;t clean well at all so its really useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times and am using multiple products for cellulite reduction, so I&#x27;m not sure what to think just yet.  Unfortunately this product, if allowed to remain wet for any amount of time, will dissolve quickly, so be very careful after usage.  It should be stored away from the bath area and allowed to dry as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> I cannot say if this has actually helped my cellulite- I think it has, but it doesn&#x27;t matter- This thing is an AWESOME exfoliator that smells like coffee! Another reviewer mentioned that she used it \\&quot; all over\\&quot; and now I understand what she meant. I use it to exfoliate for shaving, I use it ( gently) on my face in the morning to \\&quot; Wake Up\\&quot; my skin.  I use it on my feet and elbows. The coffee grounds in it have this wonderful sandy consistency that makes for a very satisfying scrub . I am completely addicted.</li>
            <li> STains your shower so bad even bleach doesn&#x27;t get it out.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as messy I thought it&#x27;d be and I had no problem with stains. I was surprised and delighted that this soap actually did reduce my cellulite significantly. I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with dieting, and I&#x27;ve noticed I have slimmed down and look smoother. I&#x27;ve recommended the soap to my sister as well. The only bad thing about it is that it&#x27;s quite drying. I&#x27;ve had to up my moisturizing regime.</li>
            <li> a little messy but I like it</li>
            <li> I like it, I don&#x27;t know if it really helps reducing cellulite, but I am using it everyday</li>
            <li> I like but the bumps rub off quick.</li>
            <li> Love it! Highly recommend it! After using it a few days I saw results.</li>
            <li> Didnt do anything great</li>
            <li> A bit messy but works well</li>
            <li> Love it. You can&#x27;t just expect one product to work. Especially if you&#x27;re not exercising! I have cellulite on my thighs and I do get results with products but if you really want results I recommend squats. Exercise and I guarantee you&#x27;ll have results and drink lots of water that also helps with cellulite. Don&#x27;t be lazy and you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied. Stop looking for an easy way out!</li>
