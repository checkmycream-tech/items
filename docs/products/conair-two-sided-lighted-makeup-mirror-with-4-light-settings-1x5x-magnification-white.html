            <li>the mirror is great.</li>
            <li>Conair Illumia Collection Two-sided mirror is a great product for women to use to put their make up on.</li>
            <li>The settings called Home and Day are the brightest, whereas Office and Evening are dimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Another great quality of his product is its adjustable stand.  </li>

            <li>This product a very handy product.</li>
            <li>it was very nice</li>
            <li>I ordered this mirror and it is very nice and does the job.</li>
            <li>As mentioned by another reviewer, at it&#x27;s brightest setting, it is not even as bright as the Jerdon evening setting.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t stand up good</li>
            <li>Just not as good lighting quality as they used to make them.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this makeup mirror at Wal-Mart after my beloved Clairol one died after 25 years.</li>
            <li>It is also good for putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>All is all, it a good buy.</li>
            <li>I may just buy my own bulbs and replace them, but everything else about this mirror is great.</li>
            <li>Good investment.</li>
            <li>The price is good and the service was good.</li>
            <li>The girls were delighted with them.  </li>
            <li>They especially liked the light exposure feature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size.</li>
            <li>It is a good bargain.</li>
            <li>I can see so good</li>
            <li>This is the perfect size and the lighting is fun to use!</li>
            <li>the light on this isn&#x27;t very bright though.</li>
            <li>and am very pleased with the lighting and brightness.</li>
            <li>My wife was very satisfied and the mirror met or exceeded her expectations.</li>
            <li>I have had many great Conair products over the decades, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>I returned it and bought the Jerdon one from Amazon and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>If I wanted to spend $100+ fora lighted mirror, then I would expect more!</li>
            <li>We were so pleased to find it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>love the lighting!</li>
            <li>Great illumination and light for makeup</li>
            <li>I liked the design of the Illumina</li>
            <li>This one has 1X and 5X which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice makeup lamp..</li>
            <li>A 3 panel mirror in this size would have been nice</li>
            <li>In my opinion, Conair makes excellent products for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>But the magnifying side is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully she loves it and will leave mine alone now that she will have her own</li>
            <li>OK, my wife asked where the \\&quot;side mirrors\\&quot; are, and that&#x27;s a good question, why&#x27;d they take them off??  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves using this to put on her own make up or do others make up for them.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it a lot</li>
            <li>Still a very nice light.</li>
            <li>This makeup mirror is nice and the magnification is wonderful but the brightest light isn&#x27;t really that bright.  </li>
            <li>this will be a christmas gift for granddaughter - received in perfect condition and quickly - packaged securely - will do business with again</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this wonderful makeup mirror - it has a magnifying side, and two side doors you can angle.</li>
            <li>The light works good and the stand is nice.</li>
            <li>I found the mirror to be very clear and the lighting excellent,  </li>
            <li>The mirror itself is very good but the lighting is not the right kind of light.</li>
            <li>The magnification is great and the fact that the lights can be adjusted to mimic daylight, florescent light, evening (which I assume is lamp light).</li>
            <li>the product was exactly what we were looking for - and it was great price too.</li>
            <li>it is very cheaply made and way over priced</li>
            <li>The cost was great on this mirror, so I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to get a real high end product.  </li>
            <li>Not as bright as I had hoped, but adequate.  </li>
            <li>and I have gone through a lot of different quality of mirrors and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>In the store I had looked at others, but more than 5X and you are practically seeing inside your pores.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I told her to send them out and asked her to send along 4 more bulbs, which I paid for.  </li>
            <li>I guess it will do because I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>love the 1x/5x magnification and settings.</li>
            <li>Bulbs immediately went out on top.</li>
            <li>Two mirrors in a 6-month time span is too many.</li>
            <li>I also have the comparable Jerdon mirror, and the lighting on it is better.</li>
            <li>so glad i made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I have been using magnified, lighted mirrors for many years; this is the BEST by far for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>:) Much, much better than what I had ordered before</li>
            <li>THERE ISN&#x27;T MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THIS MIRROR.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife since she needed a mirror with close up as well as better lighting.</li>
            <li>I love the size of it.</li>
            <li>but I think this mirror is ok.</li>
            <li>and it sure beats putting on my makeup in front of my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the magnification side because my face is already fat and it shows every imperfection :)</li>
            <li>She recommends this product to those person needing a satisfying magnification and lighting.</li>
            <li>I also would have preferred that it would be able to stand on a straighter angle.</li>
            <li>and I have not been able to find replacements.</li>
            <li>Love the magnifying side.  </li>
            <li>I thoroughly reviewed many make up mirrors to replace my vintage and working Clairol II from 1978.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mirror.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted I don&#x27;t have anything more to say.</li>
            <li>conair is simply the best for beauty products.  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>She has been enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I can see myself better and use my makeup correctly.  </li>
            <li>What more need I say?</li>
            <li>She was pleased and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>satisfied .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and all the choices of lighting could not be better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great choice at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love the lighting and magnification.  </li>
            <li>I felt that for $46.95 there could have been more features included.  </li>
            <li>I now see that for Prime members on Amazon.com you can purchase this product for $25.77 which I feel is a more appropriate</li>
            <li>Six more words required plus two</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift because I have had one for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try more compact mirrors</li>
            <li>This is the right size and the light settings are great.</li>
            <li>it has two different sides 14 close up which is great for doing eyeliner eyeshadow or mascara and perfect for eyebrow hairs and the other side is great for just looking at your face and doing makeup all around your face and even doing your hair 5 stars</li>
            <li>it is more like a \\&quot;3x\\&quot; magnified mirror; I know this to be true because I own a \\&quot;5x\\&quot; for home use</li>
            <li>5his was a gift so didn&#x27;t really see it first hand, but granddaughter was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I like the compact size of this attractive product for use while traveling and staying in hotels with their notoriously high bathroom countertops.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty good.</li>
            <li>needed a new mirrow, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have a lamp beside the mirror and it gives a better light.</li>
            <li>I like this mirror, it is 2 sided and has great lighting which is good in the winter months when it is so dark in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll be able to sit comfortably at the room desk to put on makeup.</li>
            <li>It provides enough light for my needs, because I have very good wired-in vanity lighting.  </li>
            <li>It IS easy to pack, but it is NOT a 5x-</li>
            <li>Easy to use for makeup</li>
            <li>This one seemed the most similar and she says it works great.</li>
            <li>Like that bulbs for it are easy to find.  </li>
            <li>The mirror looks good and it a nice size for my vanity table with an adjustable back bar for the angle.</li>
            <li>The magnification side is a bit too strong for the placement of the mirror I use.  </li>
            <li>The mirror spins too freely, so it won&#x27;t stay still so you can easily use it.</li>
            <li>It was fine, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>But for what I use it for it was fine.</li>
            <li>I needed a 5x, light weight, easy to pack make-up mirror that would fit in a suitcase</li>
            <li>I was super excited about it because I need better light for applying make-up.</li>
            <li>Too huge for</li>
            <li>so I need the magnifier with the light...</li>
            <li>Fortunately, when I called Conair, the customer service rep I spoke with agreed with me and offered to replace the 2 bulbs at N/C.  </li>
            <li>Also, the lights do not all light up.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the mirror has four light setting; Evening,Home,Office, and Day.</li>
            <li>But the lighting on it really isn&#x27;t all that amazing</li>
            <li>BUT THE LIGHT AND SETTING CAN BE ADJUSTED.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t give off a lot of light</li>
            <li>Took forever but found my mother-in-law another light like this.</li>
            <li>B001RJBL7E Conair Illumina Collection Two-Sided Makeup Mirror with 4 Light Settings]]</li>
            <li>Great gift for teen girl.</li>
            <li>the mirror itself is wonderful, however when it arrived one side of it did not light up.</li>
            <li>Mirror is cheap material and the plastic panels over the lights keeps coming off.  </li>
            <li>Returned it, and bought the Ott Light.</li>
            <li>Definitely wasnt happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>The four light settings is what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Two-Sided Make-up Mirror is a fantastic product for $46.95.</li>
            <li>You can adjust he height to personally fit your height.  </li>
            <li>After all these years I have yet had to change any of the four light bulbs.  </li>
            <li>lighting is fantastic.</li>
            <li>&quot; setting was anything like natural, bright daylight.</li>
            <li>Had a Clairol unit for almost 20 years and it more than provided adequate and true lighting for each setting.</li>
            <li>I liked the older version of this light where there was a separate on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>it gets very hot ,very quickly .So</li>
            <li>I thought the light settings would provide adequate light.  </li>
            <li>Love it, was exactly what I was hoping for</li>
            <li>This is very helpful because no one wants to go out in the bright of day looking like a hooker.</li>
            <li>Broke it trying to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Perfect Christmas present for my 15 year old daughter</li>
            <li>but, if we were able to get access to the insides, the old mirror would have kept going for more years.</li>
            <li>It would be a good mirror if they could make the light truer and not so yellow.</li>
            <li>Not at all bright enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright, but very short.</li>
            <li>This mirror is not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>The light is not the right color on any settings.</li>
            <li>, I use it all the time for a quick touch up, thank you, Elvis Aron Preston</li>
            <li>This would be ok for some, but if you need a lot of light, then I would go with the higher priced one that is very similar but brighter and more sturdy.</li>
            <li>bright enough and strong enough to find those stray eyebrow hairs without using my glasses...:)</li>
            <li>This mirror is very nice but bigger than what I really wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars but it tends to get very  hot after awhile.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, a great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li>I have a very fare skin tone, and I get makeup lines so easy, but with this mirror you and see the makeup lines as they come up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many makeup mirrors over the last 30 years and especially loved my Clairol true to light mirror which sadly died about ten years ago (after a good 15 faithful years of service).</li>
            <li>text what&#x27;s excellent no problem very least with everything I purchase at amazon will continue to shop thank you</li>
            <li>I like selecting the light mode and the magnifier is great for those hard to see areas.  </li>
            <li>Good product and came when expected</li>
            <li>but just wish the lighting feature was more like my old mirror.</li>
            <li>In all honesty I absolutely love this, I am 16 years old and my father bought it for me for Christmas</li>
            <li>It is nice to see the quality of this product has remain the same.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old mirror.</li>
            <li>It has a magnifying side good for eyebrow tweezing and a regular side to evaluate your whole look.</li>
            <li>This is an okay mirror but the lighting isn&#x27;t bright enough and I found myself putting on more makeup than usual.  </li>
            <li>And, some bulbs did not work on the right side of this mirror upon receipt of this item (as others have stated in their reviews).</li>
            <li>The lighting is just right.  </li>
            <li>There are four light settings and they are all pretty much indoor settings.</li>
            <li>The day setting on my former mirror seemed more true to life than this lighting..</li>
            <li>Even though they are older, I guarantee that they will work better than the new ones out there!</li>
            <li>With its four different light settings it makes it easy to see in all types in environments.</li>
            <li>Great item for the small price.</li>
            <li>I have a daughter that will be able to use it because the price of packing &amp; sending this one back, wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
            <li>Great mirror with different settings such as office, evening,</li>
            <li>The lights were not as bright as I expected, but they were bright enough for me to see what I was doing, so overall, it&#x27;s a satisfactory product.  </li>
            <li>So, far, it&#x27;s working fine and exactly what I need on my dresser.  </li>
            <li>the BIG side was huge!  </li>
            <li>The lighting is perfect, its not to big, but yet not to small.</li>
            <li>Also, the light bulbs are so dim that I had to use a lamp on a near-by desk to use in putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>When I turned it on, I could not believe how dim the light was.</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what my wife needed.</li>
            <li>IT DOES GET A BIT HOT</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not a quality product.  </li>
            <li>Even though my brother said I needed a 10x mirror the 5x is really all you need!</li>
            <li>If the bulbs hadn&#x27;t blown I would have rated higher.</li>
            <li>The only improvement would be to be able to tilt the mirror.</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for!  </li>
            <li>I like this mirror much better than the Clairol one that I bought from another vendor several years ago.  </li>
            <li>This feature helps when you are using many different types of surfaces.</li>
            <li>the office setting is the blue top row lighting coming from above as would be in most work environments and the &#x27;evening&#x27; setting</li>
            <li>Even the brightest light is dim.  </li>
            <li>The sides get so hot</li>
            <li>Only half the lights worked at best on a couple of settings.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d sent the item back for a full refund and the shipping costs charged me well over $55.00 in returning it</li>
            <li>Not as bright as I would have wanted and kind of an inconvenient angle.</li>
            <li>The multiple light settings and changeable magnification are useful.</li>
            <li>Positive recommendation.</li>
            <li>I cannot use it because the light in this mirror has a yellowish cast, which obviously does not mimic natural light.</li>
            <li>Great lighting, the magnify mirror  extremely enlarges where you can see every pore or facial line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, I expected the light to be brighter, I bought this as a replacement to an old Conair makeup mirror that I had, I do like the two sided mirror and the versatile stand that it comes with.</li>
            <li>Well to me its not worth all that, but its nice for what i paid....</li>
            <li>In the past I had a Clairol mirrow which I loved.  </li>
            <li>When I bought a new one, it was as good as I remembered but felt slightly dimmer.</li>
            <li>we replaced the bulbs in that older model, but it finally bit the dust after many years of service.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t bright enough and the light is a gross yellow.</li>
            <li>It has four different light settings (evening, home, office, day) through the use of four bulbs, but if you want to want to have enough light to put on makeup, the only setting that gives somewhat adequate light is the day setting.</li>
            <li>the lighting is good, not great, but not terribly bad.</li>
            <li>I have a huge 3 panel regular vanity</li>
            <li>it has different light settings too choose from</li>
            <li>The stand is a very flimsy plastic</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stand up as straight as I would like.</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li>I really do like having a mirror that I can bring anywhere</li>
            <li>My wife really like this lighted makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>and she is very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>So it isn&#x27;t really adjustable as the Jerdon is.</li>
            <li>I really searched online for a couple of weeks and then settled on this one.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Item shipped fast and I gave it to my mom.</li>
            <li>not as sturdy as i had hoped and even the brightest settting is yellow light.</li>
            <li>Should stand straight up.</li>
            <li>Bought for granddaughter she really likes it</li>
            <li>It has a two sided magnification mirrors, it has four different light settings, and an adjustable stand.  </li>
            <li>This product is very durable.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li>this is a great product and the new one will last as long as the old one...yrmv</li>
            <li>this new conair mirror is much brighter and has a higher magnification.</li>
            <li>Bought this one to replace my old one that I broke so !!!</li>
            <li>I love my mirror, doesn&#x27;t stand up as high as I would like as far as the bar in the back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the other mirror and went for this one instead.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the new mirror arrived with one light burnt out.</li>
            <li>I really like my makeup mirror, small enough to use in my Motor home, easy to store, and I love all of the settings.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t portray you&#x27;re true color and is a bit yellow toned</li>
            <li>I really needed a little more magnification .</li>
            <li>I guess it is expecting too much to think that the new makeup mirrors will work as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>Yesterday I replaced the last of the bulbs I had on hand, so I am back to the hassle and expense of ordering more bulbs.  </li>
            <li>Love this mirror as I had same one for about 25 years and it finally broke.  </li>
            <li>as it turns out, the bulb was burnt out and i had to drive 40 miles to the nearest store that had that particular bulb in stock.</li>
            <li>The older one was also brighter for daytime.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this purchase to all women.</li>
            <li>magnifier side too high</li>
            <li>I had a mirror just like this in high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The lights aren&#x27;t bright enough and most of the settings have a golden glow to the lighting which makes it hard to see small details and imperfections, which defeats the purpose of getting a lighted make up mirror.</li>
            <li>This mirror is not what I expected, in that the light is glaring to look into.  </li>
            <li>Depending on which selection you chose a light on the bottom only or mid only or top only will come on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with big hopes of having fun makeup sessions - you know, rainy afternoon, trying new faces?  </li>
            <li>Light were much dimmer that our previous mirror.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new mirror since mine had 1X and 3X.  </li>
            <li>We bought a new one because it was cheaper than buying the replacement lamps.  </li>
            <li>so i will live with it ....</li>
            <li>I purchased this product five years ago and it still works like new.  </li>
            <li>nice big mirror for use everyday</li>
            <li>I bought this because I previously owned one similar that was a different brand and loved it.</li>
            <li>Very dim and inaccurate lighting.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my wife to replace a very old one she had.  </li>
            <li>I chose this mirror because it looked similar to my old mirror and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>, I had to put a folded up paper towel under the bar to make it sit straighter, so you don&#x27;t have to lean so far in to do your makeup!</li>
            <li>I had another mirror that looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The mirror I replaced was exactly the same one I had for about 25 years.</li>
            <li>The old one was another brand, and was only taken out of the picture, due to not being able to find replacement lightbulbs for it.  </li>
            <li>I searched for a long time for a lighted mirror that actually gave off LIGHT.  </li>
            <li>Just what i expected and quick delivery</li>
            <li>switch blew, it would cost as much to replace as a new mirror, so I bought this Conair one, it looked similar, but I would say don&#x27;t buy.  </li>
            <li>Only mirror of new models that give enough light to actually see what you are doing!</li>
            <li>I have to use it on its brightest setting because my attic room is very dark even with the light on.</li>
            <li>This was a great disappointment-</li>
            <li>Since I wear glasses, the 1X seems too far away.  </li>
            <li>With my old one I used 3X to put on makeup and never used the 1X side.  </li>
            <li>When my old Clairol lighted make-up mirror on/off</li>
            <li>I really was looking for something like this, but smaller</li>
            <li>you must pull the whole mirror back and forth to adjust looking into it.</li>
            <li>We kept the old one for spare parts.</li>
            <li>Just replaced my old one.</li>
            <li>It does not bother my daughter, but my old eyes need flood lights.</li>
            <li>bought for my 13 yr old for her 14th Birthday in Jan</li>
            <li>I read in other reviews that the light was on the yellow side and it is.  </li>
            <li>the name of the conair product is new, but the similar bulbs will work inside the new model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than the other conair lighted mirror I was going to originally buy that had 3 mirror panels.</li>
            <li>This mirror is much different than older model.  </li>
            <li>the numbers are the same, so save your older bulbs.  </li>
            <li>the older unit lasted longer than we thought, so this product is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li>red hot stopped working 3rd time i used it</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a long lasting product this is the right one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I have to lean in too much, but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>I needed a simple and inexpensive mirror with clear images and clean lines and that takes up little space.  </li>
            <li>This mirror only lights up white unlike some of the other colored light up mirrors.</li>
            <li>the light&#x27;s are not very bright</li>
            <li>It is very dimly lit with an unnatural, yellow hue.  </li>
            <li>so I thought this would be a great mirror for the bad lighting that I have in my room</li>
            <li>After selling this mirror for at least 18 months, Conair still doesn&#x27;t make them available for ordering on their website?    </li>
            <li>The light in my room sucks.</li>
            <li>Day is the brightest setting and the only one I can use because the rest are too dim.</li>
            <li>I could barely see to put my makeup on.</li>
            <li>When my old friend finally \\&quot;retired\\&quot; I could not find a duplicate but went to Amazon and found it with no problem.      </li>
            <li>My 25 year old make up mirror quietly died after 25 years of faithful service.  </li>
            <li>So naturally I bought the same product again,because it works and lasts forever ( or close to it).</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for a young teenage girl.  </li>
            <li>The overall light output is very, very dim, so really it&#x27;s just a mirror, as the lights are useless.  </li>
            <li>She also said the power cord on this model is at least a foot shorter than the original, so what&#x27;s with that??  </li>
            <li>It has served my needs for the past five years with its different light settings, two different magnified mirrors, and its adjustable stand.  </li>
            <li>Two bulbs are blue, the two clear ones give off yellow color.</li>
            <li>Her previous exact same model stopped working after 15 years.</li>
            <li>I find that the office setting is the least yellow and closer to regular light.  </li>
            <li>When I first bought the mirror, two bulbs burned out at the same time, within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Light was not bright enough.</li>
            <li>The light was not bright enough for me to use when I put my eye makeup on.  </li>
            <li>Light not bright enough</li>
            <li>The only defect I found with this mirror is that the edges of the mirrow were not flat and thus my image was not flat.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it was very nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror and it is very nice and does the job.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by another reviewer, at it&#x27;s brightest setting, it is not even as bright as the Jerdon evening setting.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stand up good</li>
            <li> Just not as good lighting quality as they used to make them.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this makeup mirror at Wal-Mart after my beloved Clairol one died after 25 years.</li>
            <li> It is also good for putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> All is all, it a good buy.</li>
            <li> I may just buy my own bulbs and replace them, but everything else about this mirror is great.</li>
            <li> Good investment.</li>
            <li> The price is good and the service was good.</li>
            <li> The girls were delighted with them.  </li>
            <li> They especially liked the light exposure feature.</li>

            <li> It is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> I can see so good</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size and the lighting is fun to use!</li>
            <li> the light on this isn&#x27;t very bright though.</li>
            <li> and am very pleased with the lighting and brightness.</li>
            <li> My wife was very satisfied and the mirror met or exceeded her expectations.</li>
            <li> I have had many great Conair products over the decades, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> I returned it and bought the Jerdon one from Amazon and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> If I wanted to spend $100+ fora lighted mirror, then I would expect more!</li>
            <li> We were so pleased to find it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> love the lighting!</li>
            <li> Great illumination and light for makeup</li>
            <li> I liked the design of the Illumina</li>
            <li> This one has 1X and 5X which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice makeup lamp..</li>
            <li> A 3 panel mirror in this size would have been nice</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Conair makes excellent products for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> But the magnifying side is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully she loves it and will leave mine alone now that she will have her own</li>
            <li> OK, my wife asked where the \\&quot;side mirrors\\&quot; are, and that&#x27;s a good question, why&#x27;d they take them off??  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves using this to put on her own make up or do others make up for them.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it a lot</li>
            <li> Still a very nice light.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror is nice and the magnification is wonderful but the brightest light isn&#x27;t really that bright.  </li>
            <li> this will be a christmas gift for granddaughter - received in perfect condition and quickly - packaged securely - will do business with again</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this wonderful makeup mirror - it has a magnifying side, and two side doors you can angle.</li>
            <li> The light works good and the stand is nice.</li>
            <li> I found the mirror to be very clear and the lighting excellent,  </li>
            <li> The mirror itself is very good but the lighting is not the right kind of light.</li>
            <li> The magnification is great and the fact that the lights can be adjusted to mimic daylight, florescent light, evening (which I assume is lamp light).</li>
            <li> the product was exactly what we were looking for - and it was great price too.</li>
            <li> it is very cheaply made and way over priced</li>
            <li> The cost was great on this mirror, so I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to get a real high end product.  </li>
            <li> Not as bright as I had hoped, but adequate.  </li>
            <li> and I have gone through a lot of different quality of mirrors and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> In the store I had looked at others, but more than 5X and you are practically seeing inside your pores.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I told her to send them out and asked her to send along 4 more bulbs, which I paid for.  </li>
            <li> I guess it will do because I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> love the 1x/5x magnification and settings.</li>
            <li> Bulbs immediately went out on top.</li>
            <li> Two mirrors in a 6-month time span is too many.</li>
            <li> I also have the comparable Jerdon mirror, and the lighting on it is better.</li>
            <li> so glad i made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using magnified, lighted mirrors for many years; this is the BEST by far for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> :) Much, much better than what I had ordered before</li>
            <li> THERE ISN&#x27;T MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THIS MIRROR.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife since she needed a mirror with close up as well as better lighting.</li>
            <li> I love the size of it.</li>
            <li> but I think this mirror is ok.</li>
            <li> and it sure beats putting on my makeup in front of my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the magnification side because my face is already fat and it shows every imperfection :)</li>
            <li> She recommends this product to those person needing a satisfying magnification and lighting.</li>
            <li> I also would have preferred that it would be able to stand on a straighter angle.</li>
            <li> and I have not been able to find replacements.</li>
            <li> Love the magnifying side.  </li>
            <li> I thoroughly reviewed many make up mirrors to replace my vintage and working Clairol II from 1978.  </li>
            <li> My favorite mirror.  </li>
            <li> Just what I wanted I don&#x27;t have anything more to say.</li>
            <li> conair is simply the best for beauty products.  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li> She has been enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I can see myself better and use my makeup correctly.  </li>
            <li> What more need I say?</li>
            <li> She was pleased and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> satisfied .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and all the choices of lighting could not be better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great choice at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love the lighting and magnification.  </li>
            <li> I felt that for $46.95 there could have been more features included.  </li>
            <li> I now see that for Prime members on Amazon.com you can purchase this product for $25.77 which I feel is a more appropriate</li>
            <li> Six more words required plus two</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift because I have had one for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try more compact mirrors</li>
            <li> This is the right size and the light settings are great.</li>
            <li> it has two different sides 14 close up which is great for doing eyeliner eyeshadow or mascara and perfect for eyebrow hairs and the other side is great for just looking at your face and doing makeup all around your face and even doing your hair 5 stars</li>
            <li> it is more like a \\&quot;3x\\&quot; magnified mirror; I know this to be true because I own a \\&quot;5x\\&quot; for home use</li>
            <li> 5his was a gift so didn&#x27;t really see it first hand, but granddaughter was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like the compact size of this attractive product for use while traveling and staying in hotels with their notoriously high bathroom countertops.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty good.</li>
            <li> needed a new mirrow, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a lamp beside the mirror and it gives a better light.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror, it is 2 sided and has great lighting which is good in the winter months when it is so dark in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll be able to sit comfortably at the room desk to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> It provides enough light for my needs, because I have very good wired-in vanity lighting.  </li>
            <li> It IS easy to pack, but it is NOT a 5x-</li>
            <li> Easy to use for makeup</li>
            <li> This one seemed the most similar and she says it works great.</li>
            <li> Like that bulbs for it are easy to find.  </li>
            <li> The mirror looks good and it a nice size for my vanity table with an adjustable back bar for the angle.</li>
            <li> The magnification side is a bit too strong for the placement of the mirror I use.  </li>
            <li> The mirror spins too freely, so it won&#x27;t stay still so you can easily use it.</li>
            <li> It was fine, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> But for what I use it for it was fine.</li>
            <li> I needed a 5x, light weight, easy to pack make-up mirror that would fit in a suitcase</li>
            <li> I was super excited about it because I need better light for applying make-up.</li>
            <li> Too huge for</li>
            <li> so I need the magnifier with the light...</li>
            <li> Fortunately, when I called Conair, the customer service rep I spoke with agreed with me and offered to replace the 2 bulbs at N/C.  </li>
            <li> Also, the lights do not all light up.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the mirror has four light setting; Evening,Home,Office, and Day.</li>
            <li> But the lighting on it really isn&#x27;t all that amazing</li>
            <li> BUT THE LIGHT AND SETTING CAN BE ADJUSTED.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give off a lot of light</li>
            <li> Took forever but found my mother-in-law another light like this.</li>
            <li> B001RJBL7E Conair Illumina Collection Two-Sided Makeup Mirror with 4 Light Settings]]</li>
            <li> Great gift for teen girl.</li>
            <li> the mirror itself is wonderful, however when it arrived one side of it did not light up.</li>
            <li> Mirror is cheap material and the plastic panels over the lights keeps coming off.  </li>
            <li> Returned it, and bought the Ott Light.</li>
            <li> Definitely wasnt happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> The four light settings is what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Two-Sided Make-up Mirror is a fantastic product for $46.95.</li>
            <li> You can adjust he height to personally fit your height.  </li>
            <li> After all these years I have yet had to change any of the four light bulbs.  </li>
            <li> lighting is fantastic.</li>
            <li> &quot; setting was anything like natural, bright daylight.</li>
            <li> Had a Clairol unit for almost 20 years and it more than provided adequate and true lighting for each setting.</li>
            <li> I liked the older version of this light where there was a separate on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> it gets very hot ,very quickly .So</li>
            <li> I thought the light settings would provide adequate light.  </li>
            <li> Love it, was exactly what I was hoping for</li>
            <li> This is very helpful because no one wants to go out in the bright of day looking like a hooker.</li>
            <li> Broke it trying to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Perfect Christmas present for my 15 year old daughter</li>
            <li> but, if we were able to get access to the insides, the old mirror would have kept going for more years.</li>
            <li> It would be a good mirror if they could make the light truer and not so yellow.</li>
            <li> Not at all bright enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright, but very short.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> The light is not the right color on any settings.</li>
            <li> , I use it all the time for a quick touch up, thank you, Elvis Aron Preston</li>
            <li> This would be ok for some, but if you need a lot of light, then I would go with the higher priced one that is very similar but brighter and more sturdy.</li>
            <li> bright enough and strong enough to find those stray eyebrow hairs without using my glasses...:)</li>
            <li> This mirror is very nice but bigger than what I really wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but it tends to get very  hot after awhile.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, a great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a very fare skin tone, and I get makeup lines so easy, but with this mirror you and see the makeup lines as they come up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many makeup mirrors over the last 30 years and especially loved my Clairol true to light mirror which sadly died about ten years ago (after a good 15 faithful years of service).</li>
            <li> text what&#x27;s excellent no problem very least with everything I purchase at amazon will continue to shop thank you</li>
            <li> I like selecting the light mode and the magnifier is great for those hard to see areas.  </li>
            <li> Good product and came when expected</li>
            <li> but just wish the lighting feature was more like my old mirror.</li>
            <li> In all honesty I absolutely love this, I am 16 years old and my father bought it for me for Christmas</li>
            <li> It is nice to see the quality of this product has remain the same.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old mirror.</li>
            <li> It has a magnifying side good for eyebrow tweezing and a regular side to evaluate your whole look.</li>
            <li> This is an okay mirror but the lighting isn&#x27;t bright enough and I found myself putting on more makeup than usual.  </li>
            <li> And, some bulbs did not work on the right side of this mirror upon receipt of this item (as others have stated in their reviews).</li>
            <li> The lighting is just right.  </li>
            <li> There are four light settings and they are all pretty much indoor settings.</li>
            <li> The day setting on my former mirror seemed more true to life than this lighting..</li>
            <li> Even though they are older, I guarantee that they will work better than the new ones out there!</li>
            <li> With its four different light settings it makes it easy to see in all types in environments.</li>
            <li> Great item for the small price.</li>
            <li> I have a daughter that will be able to use it because the price of packing &amp; sending this one back, wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
            <li> Great mirror with different settings such as office, evening,</li>
            <li> The lights were not as bright as I expected, but they were bright enough for me to see what I was doing, so overall, it&#x27;s a satisfactory product.  </li>
            <li> So, far, it&#x27;s working fine and exactly what I need on my dresser.  </li>
            <li> the BIG side was huge!  </li>
            <li> The lighting is perfect, its not to big, but yet not to small.</li>
            <li> Also, the light bulbs are so dim that I had to use a lamp on a near-by desk to use in putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on, I could not believe how dim the light was.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what my wife needed.</li>
            <li> IT DOES GET A BIT HOT</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not a quality product.  </li>
            <li> Even though my brother said I needed a 10x mirror the 5x is really all you need!</li>
            <li> If the bulbs hadn&#x27;t blown I would have rated higher.</li>
            <li> The only improvement would be to be able to tilt the mirror.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for!  </li>
            <li> I like this mirror much better than the Clairol one that I bought from another vendor several years ago.  </li>
            <li> This feature helps when you are using many different types of surfaces.</li>
            <li> the office setting is the blue top row lighting coming from above as would be in most work environments and the &#x27;evening&#x27; setting</li>
            <li> Even the brightest light is dim.  </li>
            <li> The sides get so hot</li>
            <li> Only half the lights worked at best on a couple of settings.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d sent the item back for a full refund and the shipping costs charged me well over $55.00 in returning it</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I would have wanted and kind of an inconvenient angle.</li>
            <li> The multiple light settings and changeable magnification are useful.</li>
            <li> Positive recommendation.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it because the light in this mirror has a yellowish cast, which obviously does not mimic natural light.</li>
            <li> Great lighting, the magnify mirror  extremely enlarges where you can see every pore or facial line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I expected the light to be brighter, I bought this as a replacement to an old Conair makeup mirror that I had, I do like the two sided mirror and the versatile stand that it comes with.</li>
            <li> Well to me its not worth all that, but its nice for what i paid....</li>
            <li> In the past I had a Clairol mirrow which I loved.  </li>
            <li> When I bought a new one, it was as good as I remembered but felt slightly dimmer.</li>
            <li> we replaced the bulbs in that older model, but it finally bit the dust after many years of service.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bright enough and the light is a gross yellow.</li>
            <li> It has four different light settings (evening, home, office, day) through the use of four bulbs, but if you want to want to have enough light to put on makeup, the only setting that gives somewhat adequate light is the day setting.</li>
            <li> the lighting is good, not great, but not terribly bad.</li>
            <li> I have a huge 3 panel regular vanity</li>
            <li> it has different light settings too choose from</li>
            <li> The stand is a very flimsy plastic</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stand up as straight as I would like.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li> I really do like having a mirror that I can bring anywhere</li>
            <li> My wife really like this lighted makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> and she is very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> So it isn&#x27;t really adjustable as the Jerdon is.</li>
            <li> I really searched online for a couple of weeks and then settled on this one.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast and I gave it to my mom.</li>
            <li> not as sturdy as i had hoped and even the brightest settting is yellow light.</li>
            <li> Should stand straight up.</li>
            <li> Bought for granddaughter she really likes it</li>
            <li> It has a two sided magnification mirrors, it has four different light settings, and an adjustable stand.  </li>
            <li> This product is very durable.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and the new one will last as long as the old one...yrmv</li>
            <li> this new conair mirror is much brighter and has a higher magnification.</li>
            <li> Bought this one to replace my old one that I broke so !!!</li>
            <li> I love my mirror, doesn&#x27;t stand up as high as I would like as far as the bar in the back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the other mirror and went for this one instead.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the new mirror arrived with one light burnt out.</li>
            <li> I really like my makeup mirror, small enough to use in my Motor home, easy to store, and I love all of the settings.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t portray you&#x27;re true color and is a bit yellow toned</li>
            <li> I really needed a little more magnification .</li>
            <li> I guess it is expecting too much to think that the new makeup mirrors will work as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> Yesterday I replaced the last of the bulbs I had on hand, so I am back to the hassle and expense of ordering more bulbs.  </li>
            <li> Love this mirror as I had same one for about 25 years and it finally broke.  </li>
            <li> as it turns out, the bulb was burnt out and i had to drive 40 miles to the nearest store that had that particular bulb in stock.</li>
            <li> The older one was also brighter for daytime.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this purchase to all women.</li>
            <li> magnifier side too high</li>
            <li> I had a mirror just like this in high school.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The lights aren&#x27;t bright enough and most of the settings have a golden glow to the lighting which makes it hard to see small details and imperfections, which defeats the purpose of getting a lighted make up mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not what I expected, in that the light is glaring to look into.  </li>
            <li> Depending on which selection you chose a light on the bottom only or mid only or top only will come on.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with big hopes of having fun makeup sessions - you know, rainy afternoon, trying new faces?  </li>
            <li> Light were much dimmer that our previous mirror.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new mirror since mine had 1X and 3X.  </li>
            <li> We bought a new one because it was cheaper than buying the replacement lamps.  </li>
            <li> so i will live with it ....</li>
            <li> I purchased this product five years ago and it still works like new.  </li>
            <li> nice big mirror for use everyday</li>
            <li> I bought this because I previously owned one similar that was a different brand and loved it.</li>
            <li> Very dim and inaccurate lighting.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife to replace a very old one she had.  </li>
            <li> I chose this mirror because it looked similar to my old mirror and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> , I had to put a folded up paper towel under the bar to make it sit straighter, so you don&#x27;t have to lean so far in to do your makeup!</li>
            <li> I had another mirror that looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li> The mirror I replaced was exactly the same one I had for about 25 years.</li>
            <li> The old one was another brand, and was only taken out of the picture, due to not being able to find replacement lightbulbs for it.  </li>
            <li> I searched for a long time for a lighted mirror that actually gave off LIGHT.  </li>
            <li> Just what i expected and quick delivery</li>
            <li> switch blew, it would cost as much to replace as a new mirror, so I bought this Conair one, it looked similar, but I would say don&#x27;t buy.  </li>
            <li> Only mirror of new models that give enough light to actually see what you are doing!</li>
            <li> I have to use it on its brightest setting because my attic room is very dark even with the light on.</li>
            <li> This was a great disappointment-</li>
            <li> Since I wear glasses, the 1X seems too far away.  </li>
            <li> With my old one I used 3X to put on makeup and never used the 1X side.  </li>
            <li> When my old Clairol lighted make-up mirror on/off</li>
            <li> I really was looking for something like this, but smaller</li>
            <li> you must pull the whole mirror back and forth to adjust looking into it.</li>
            <li> We kept the old one for spare parts.</li>
            <li> Just replaced my old one.</li>
            <li> It does not bother my daughter, but my old eyes need flood lights.</li>
            <li> bought for my 13 yr old for her 14th Birthday in Jan</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews that the light was on the yellow side and it is.  </li>
            <li> the name of the conair product is new, but the similar bulbs will work inside the new model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than the other conair lighted mirror I was going to originally buy that had 3 mirror panels.</li>
            <li> This mirror is much different than older model.  </li>
            <li> the numbers are the same, so save your older bulbs.  </li>
            <li> the older unit lasted longer than we thought, so this product is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li> red hot stopped working 3rd time i used it</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a long lasting product this is the right one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I have to lean in too much, but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> I needed a simple and inexpensive mirror with clear images and clean lines and that takes up little space.  </li>
            <li> This mirror only lights up white unlike some of the other colored light up mirrors.</li>
            <li> the light&#x27;s are not very bright</li>
            <li> It is very dimly lit with an unnatural, yellow hue.  </li>
            <li> so I thought this would be a great mirror for the bad lighting that I have in my room</li>
            <li> After selling this mirror for at least 18 months, Conair still doesn&#x27;t make them available for ordering on their website?    </li>
            <li> The light in my room sucks.</li>
            <li> Day is the brightest setting and the only one I can use because the rest are too dim.</li>
            <li> I could barely see to put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> When my old friend finally \\&quot;retired\\&quot; I could not find a duplicate but went to Amazon and found it with no problem.      </li>
            <li> My 25 year old make up mirror quietly died after 25 years of faithful service.  </li>
            <li> So naturally I bought the same product again,because it works and lasts forever ( or close to it).</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a young teenage girl.  </li>
            <li> The overall light output is very, very dim, so really it&#x27;s just a mirror, as the lights are useless.  </li>
            <li> She also said the power cord on this model is at least a foot shorter than the original, so what&#x27;s with that??  </li>
            <li> It has served my needs for the past five years with its different light settings, two different magnified mirrors, and its adjustable stand.  </li>
            <li> Two bulbs are blue, the two clear ones give off yellow color.</li>
            <li> Her previous exact same model stopped working after 15 years.</li>
            <li> I find that the office setting is the least yellow and closer to regular light.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought the mirror, two bulbs burned out at the same time, within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Light was not bright enough.</li>
            <li> The light was not bright enough for me to use when I put my eye makeup on.  </li>
            <li> Light not bright enough</li>
            <li> The only defect I found with this mirror is that the edges of the mirrow were not flat and thus my image was not flat.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> But when it arrived in the mail after Christmas I was pleasantly surprised to see it was way larger than the other mirror.</li>
            <li> Just thought the price was a little high.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it had a higher setting for the lights to be brighter.</li>
            <li> I just purchased it, so I do not know how long the bulbs will last....</li>
            <li> I have to lean far down to use it.</li>
            <li> If the bulbs last at least a year, I can afford to replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li> But whereas makeup mirrors past had little fluorescent tubes in there with various filters and incandescent bulbs that mixed and matched for the &amp;#34;evening&amp;#34; &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; settings, this one has two very dim incandescents, two barely visible LEDs, and NO fluorescent tubes.  </li>
            <li> this NEEDS a long cord to give you access to an outlet,</li>
            <li> I still had the make-up mirror that I had in college but due to years of aging could not make it white again.  </li>
            <li> It uses bulbs that cannot be ordered online from Conair, or any other online or local specialty lighting/bulb store.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is that this product cannot be consumer serviced, other than replacing bulbs.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t see myself so clearly as my other mirror that had white lights.</li>
            <li> The stand is attached, but always loose</li>
            <li> Among the many problems this mirror has is the fact that replacement bulbs are almost impossible to find.</li>
            <li> only issue is that there seems to be no way to lock the mirror in place because any slight movement can rotate the mirrors</li>
            <li> I am Australian and used an international plug adapter as the prongs were not suitable.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little too much actually.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;office\\&quot; setting is especially disappointing because I didn&#x27;t think it was anything close to the bright fluorescent lights you would actually find in an office.</li>
            <li> be careful &amp; do not leave on or let children use this product</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Their younger sister will probably want one, as well,  in a few years.</li>
            <li> so be careful where you&#x27;re going to use this??</li>
            <li> And I have it on a desk top, and the mirror itself cannot tilt, and there is not a position on the base that lets me even see into the mirror properly.</li>
            <li> I just hope this mirror lasts as long as my previous one.</li>
            <li> There are only 4 small bulbs-</li>
            <li> I have used the same type mirror in years past and there was never a problem.</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers will relate when I say that things are not made well anymore.</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li> Conair puts out better products, and I am so disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> disappointed but the price point was ok ...</li>
            <li> I heard that can be a nightmare with other mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for but was unable to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This one takes up less counter space because it is not a tri-fold like other styles.</li>
            <li> I am going to end up buying it again as this mirror is not useful.</li>
            <li> The daytime setting is sooo off color, way too dark.</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose by allowing magnification and lighted mirror in a dark room.</li>
            <li> I have every confidence that this Conair product will last a long time, but it&#x27;s doubtful that I&#x27;ll be around to see it, if it lasts as long as my old one did!</li>
            <li> Also the angle is not adjustable up and down, so if&lt;</li>
            <li> the mirroe goes up and down.  </li>
            <li> I wish the mirror flipped up and down instead of side to side.  </li>
            <li> In short, I am very disappointed and will now have to look elsewhere and spend more time and money in finding this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they make it difficult as the only option offered is to return the entire product.</li>
            <li> Lights all burned out in less than a month</li>
            <li> I have to prop it up and do odd things to see.</li>
            <li> and once we replaced the bulb it was fine, however it was very inconvenient to have to hunt down that bulb.</li>
            <li> The time settings on it are NOT true.</li>
            <li> Bulbs were not all working and is not bright enough</li>
            <li> I odered this for my Mom who is a makeup artist and it was not bright enough</li>
            <li> Daylight setting could be a little brighter also.  </li>
            <li> It also seems a little orange/yellow.</li>
            <li> just wish it was a little brighter</li>
            <li> I would like it if the lighting was a little brighter.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the lighting is very dark.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> This happened with same mirror approximately 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I had the Jerdon Tri-Fold which lasted a few years and died on me.</li>
            <li> It is not a light that my wife usually needs</li>
            <li> , this product is a little expensive initially its longevity it makes up for the price.</li>
            <li> This mirror has a setting dial that I can hardly turn because it is so tight.</li>
            <li> As per my daughter, it was not bright enough, the filters were useless to simulate other types of lighting.</li>
            <li> I pluck with 5X and usually use 1X to put on makeup.  </li>
            <li> This Conair mirror was ordered to replace my Jerdon and is a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not much better.</li>
            <li> and it was so small.  </li>
            <li> but shipping back is to expensive</li>
            <li> Amazon came to the rescue as usual.</li>
            <li> would have given this product five out of five stars, but I was not satisfied with the listed price at the time of my purchase.</li>
            <li> very uneven.  </li>
            <li> The lighting is not very bright.</li>
            <li> In addition, they are difficult to remove and replace, due to the small bulb housing - and I am a small person, with small hands and fingers!          </li>
            <li> I can hardly even see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> Too dull.</li>
            <li> Finding all these features in one mirror can be hard.</li>
            <li> If you wear glasses and find it hard to put your makeup on without them?</li>
            <li> that is too bad since qualified electronics people could simply replace an electrical cord or fix simple things that just happen to fail.  </li>
            <li> I had my Clairol mirror since the late 80&#x27;s and never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> I had this Makeup Mirror for at least 15 years.  </li>
            <li> The lights malfunctioned within a few days of receipt and just got worse by the day.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to apply makeup to a yellow face.</li>
            <li> but,  95% of of the world cannot simply replace a bad cord, so it must be a safety issue.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, I have had a make-up mirror for over 40 years, and this one is not a good buy.</li>
            <li> But when I received this one it was not bright at all</li>
            <li> It is very hard to apply your make up.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with it</li>
            <li> The one on my Clairol mirror was irritating because I had to push a button and hold it in before it would come on . .  .</li>
            <li> I was afraid this one would be small too.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but</li>
            <li> And they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> The angle of the mirror makes it difficult to see.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately that was for one day</li>
            <li> The outside lighting is the worst!</li>
            <li> Being spoiled by it&#x27;s devotion, it was difficult to decide on a successor.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it became inoperable after it fell off my vanity.</li>
            <li> sorry Conair</li>
            <li> Not a good buy :-(</li>
            <li> Hers was burnt and dangerous.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror despite the fact that everyone said the lighting was bad.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;How bad could it be?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The mirror&#x27;s concave side was not even and had bad distortion.</li>
            <li> I was scared to try it because there&#x27;s a lot of bad feedback on this mirror but thank God I didn&#x27;t listen to the people&#x27;s bad feedback</li>
            <li> At a bad angle.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the magnification.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> Hated it.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S VERY VERY BAD.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY disappointed with the mirror.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this item for the money...</li>
            <li> It was, except for the fact that the lighting is terrible.</li>
            <li> a day, I found this outrageous.  </li>
            <li> but it was horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product and came when expected</li>
            <li> I still had the make-up mirror that I had in college but due to years of aging could not make it white again.  I liked the design of the Illumina so I purchased it.  I like it but just wish the lighting feature was more like my old mirror. Still would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it ! it has different light settings too choose from and It has a magnifier side that show you EVERYTHING on your face.</li>
            <li> This is the only mirror for me....bright enough and strong enough to find those stray eyebrow hairs without using my glasses...:)</li>
            <li> I needed a simple and inexpensive mirror with clear images and clean lines and that takes up little space.  This mirror is perfect.  It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I love my mirror, doesn&#x27;t stand up as high as I would like as far as the bar in the back, I had to put a folded up paper towel under the bar to make it sit straighter, so you don&#x27;t have to lean so far in to do your makeup!</li>
            <li> In all honesty I absolutely love this, I am 16 years old and my father bought it for me for Christmas and I have gone through a lot of different quality of mirrors and this one is the best. The lighting is perfect, its not to big, but yet not to small. I have a very fare skin tone, and I get makeup lines so easy, but with this mirror you and see the makeup lines as they come up. Great buy if you ask me. (:</li>
            <li> This was a great disappointment- It is very dimly lit with an unnatural, yellow hue.  There are only 4 small bulbs- very uneven.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I ended up with a Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror and am very pleased with the lighting and brightness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror despite the fact that everyone said the lighting was bad.  I thought, \\&quot;How bad could it be?\\&quot;  IT&#x27;S VERY VERY BAD.  I had another mirror that looked exactly the same. It broke so I thought that the Conair would be just like it.  It was, except for the fact that the lighting is terrible.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years (that I purchased about 20 years ago) and it was wonderful.  So when it was time to replace it, I chose what appeared to be the same one.  It isn&#x27;t by any means. The slant of the mirror requires you to stand up to use it, even at the highest setting. The mirror spins too freely, so it won&#x27;t stay still so you can easily use it.</li>
            <li> Great illumination and light for makeup</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a prior model where the bulbs burned out.  I&#x27;m getting older so I need the magnifier with the light... the light on this isn&#x27;t very bright though.</li>
            <li> I needed a new mirror since mine had 1X and 3X.  I needed 5X so I could see to pluck my brows.  In the store I had looked at others, but more than 5X and you are practically seeing inside your pores.  This one has 1X and 5X which is nice.  I pluck with 5X and usually use 1X to put on makeup.  I wish someone would make a 3X and a 5X.  Since I wear glasses, the 1X seems too far away.  With my old one I used 3X to put on makeup and never used the 1X side.  This one takes up less counter space because it is not a tri-fold like other styles. Daylight setting could be a little brighter also.  Not perfect, but okay.</li>
            <li> met all my expectations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many makeup mirrors over the last 30 years and especially loved my Clairol true to light mirror which sadly died about ten years ago (after a good 15 faithful years of service). My replacement Jerdon mirror was an acceptable alternative but only lasted about 5 years before the bulbs died out. This Conair mirror was ordered to replace my Jerdon and is a complete disappointment. As mentioned by another reviewer, at it&#x27;s brightest setting, it is not even as bright as the Jerdon evening setting. I can hardly even see what I&#x27;m doing. The mirror is being sent back tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I have had this mirror for about 18 months.  It provides enough light for my needs, because I have very good wired-in vanity lighting.  That being said, I cannot recommend it because of the bulb issue.  It uses bulbs that cannot be ordered online from Conair, or any other online or local specialty lighting/bulb store.  The only way to get bulbs is to call Conair.  I learned the bulbs are custom made for Conair in China.  And they are expensive.  In addition, they are difficult to remove and replace, due to the small bulb housing - and I am a small person, with small hands and fingers!          When I first bought the mirror, two bulbs burned out at the same time, within a few weeks.  Based on the fact that I only use the lights about 15 min. a day, I found this outrageous.  Fortunately, when I called Conair, the customer service rep I spoke with agreed with me and offered to replace the 2 bulbs at N/C.  I told her to send them out and asked her to send along 4 more bulbs, which I paid for.  Yesterday I replaced the last of the bulbs I had on hand, so I am back to the hassle and expense of ordering more bulbs.  After selling this mirror for at least 18 months, Conair still doesn&#x27;t make them available for ordering on their website?    Again, I cannot recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> When my old Clairol lighted make-up mirror on/off switch blew, it would cost as much to replace as a new mirror, so I bought this Conair one, it looked similar, but I would say don&#x27;t buy.  I returned it and bought the Jerdon one from Amazon and LOVE IT!  The Conair, even on the brightest setting is not even what the evening one is for the Jerdon.  Trust me, I have had a make-up mirror for over 40 years, and this one is not a good buy.</li>
            <li> I searched for a long time for a lighted mirror that actually gave off LIGHT.  This one is the best I found (and I searched everywhere)</li>
            <li> The angle of the mirror makes it difficult to see.  Not Amazon&#x27;s fault and I discarded the box so I am stuck with it.</li>
            <li> The mirror I replaced was exactly the same one I had for about 25 years. It is nice to see the quality of this product has remain the same.</li>
            <li> Hated it. Won&#x27;t stand up good</li>
            <li> This mirror is not bad for the price. If the bulbs last at least a year, I can afford to replace the whole thing. I just purchased it, so I do not know how long the bulbs will last....the lighting is good, not great, but not terribly bad. You get what you pay for. If I wanted to spend $100+ fora lighted mirror, then I would expect more!</li>
            <li> I gave to my mom as a gift and she loved it!</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and found that this is not made with the same quality....same maker.  Also, the lights do not all light up.  Depending on which selection you chose a light on the bottom only or mid only or top only will come on.  Just not as good lighting quality as they used to make them.  The mirrors are great.  The stand is a very flimsy plastic and I worry it may not hold up.</li>
            <li> Bulbs were not all working and is not bright enough</li>
            <li> nice big mirror for use everyday</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror at Target for $29.00. I was super excited about it because I need better light for applying make-up. The light in my room sucks. Anyway, the mirror has four light setting; Evening,Home,Office, and Day. Day is the brightest setting and the only one I can use because the rest are too dim. It also seems a little orange/yellow. I guess it will do because I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better. It also has another side of the mirror that is zoomed in on your face X5.</li>
            <li> I found the mirror to be very clear and the lighting excellent,  Just thought the price was a little high.</li>
            <li> I brought this for mom mom and she loves it</li>
            <li> Order this on 5/30/2012 and received it on 6/04/2012 the light&#x27;s are not very bright but if you use the maginifcation view on day it works well for me.</li>
            <li> This mirror was advertised as \\&quot;5x\\&quot; magnified, it is NOT a 5x- it is more like a \\&quot;3x\\&quot; magnified mirror; I know this to be true because I own a \\&quot;5x\\&quot; for home use and it&#x27;s great- I can see perfectly. I needed a 5x, light weight, easy to pack make-up mirror that would fit in a suitcase so I bought this one. It IS easy to pack, but it is NOT a 5x- it was blurry and rather distorted on the magnified side. Also, the light bulbs are so dim that I had to use a lamp on a near-by desk to use in putting on makeup. I was very disappointed in this product. I have a daughter that will be able to use it because the price of packing &amp; sending this one back, wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
            <li> I love my two-sided mirror!!!</li>
            <li> I love it.  This  is a great product. I have been using this product for over 10 years. It is the only&lt;br /&gt;mirror I will use. Please continue to make this model.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror is great...love the 1x/5x magnification and settings. But, after putting mirror on counter and adjusting the height in back, the mirror accidentally fell and hit counter. Bulbs immediately went out on top. This happened with same mirror approximately 3 months ago. Two mirrors in a 6-month time span is too many. Make bulbs sturdier. I have used the same type mirror in years past and there was never a problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and was very happy with it. I actually ordered another one for another family member the next year.</li>
            <li> The lights were not as bright as I expected, but they were bright enough for me to see what I was doing, so overall, it&#x27;s a satisfactory product.  I also have the comparable Jerdon mirror, and the lighting on it is better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this makeup mirror at Wal-Mart after my beloved Clairol one died after 25 years. When I turned it on, I could not believe how dim the light was. I could barely see to put my makeup on. I returned it and purchased a Jerdon one. Not much better. It worked for three days and the lights went out and never came back on. Now I have to return this one too. I know other reviewers will relate when I say that things are not made well anymore. I had my Clairol mirror since the late 80&#x27;s and never had a problem with it. The bulbs never had to be replaced. I guess it is expecting too much to think that the new makeup mirrors will work as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy a Clairol one on ebay. Even though they are older, I guarantee that they will work better than the new ones out there!</li>
            <li> The lights on this mirror make my face look yellow.  It is very difficult to apply makeup to a yellow face.</li>
            <li> This is the right size and the light settings are great. Easy to use for makeup and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Im so glad i made this purchase. Got it at an awesome price. a week later went to purchase 2 for friends as presents and the price was increased almost double! Well to me its not worth all that, but its nice for what i paid....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stand up as straight as I would like.</li>
            <li> Nice makeup lamp..just wish it was a little brighter</li>
            <li> I really was looking for something like this, but smaller so I could take it with me while traveling.  This mirror is very nice but bigger than what I really wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this for plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is also good for putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> I had this Makeup Mirror for at least 15 years.  I dropped it and it finally broke.  I took this everywhere with me and never had a problem.  I always called Conair for replacement bulbs, etc and never had a problem.  When my old friend finally \\&quot;retired\\&quot; I could not find a duplicate but went to Amazon and found it with no problem.      Thank you Conair and Amazon.    Kathy</li>
            <li> I have been using magnified, lighted mirrors for many years; this is the BEST by far for the cheap price. I had a similar revlon mirror I used for 4 years this new conair mirror is much brighter and has a higher magnification. I just hope this mirror lasts as long as my previous one. I highly recommend this purchase to all women.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what my wife needed. Her previous exact same model stopped working after 15 years. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the new mirror arrived with one light burnt out. It is not a light that my wife usually needs but I would like Amazon to replace but they make it difficult as the only option offered is to return the entire product.</li>
            <li> Bought this one to replace my old one that I broke so !!! Rather than the swivel mirror its great.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror. The magnification is great and the fact that the lights can be adjusted to mimic daylight, florescent light, evening (which I assume is lamp light). This is very helpful because no one wants to go out in the bright of day looking like a hooker. :) Much, much better than what I had ordered before and I would recommend this one to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really do like having a mirror that I can bring anywhere and you can adjust the height. But the lighting on it really isn&#x27;t all that amazing no matter what lighting you have on it doesn&#x27;t portray you&#x27;re true color and is a bit yellow toned so when putting on makeup or even eyeshadow / foundation / concealer it makes it look a bit yellow and off toned so I prefer to do that stuff in a regular mirror</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror is nice and the magnification is wonderful but the brightest light isn&#x27;t really that bright.  It has a yellowish cast to the lighting.  I would not have purchased this if I would have known that before.</li>
            <li> My wife really like this lighted makeup mirror.  Unfortunately that was for one day and then I had to return it because it was a bit to tall for the designated spot that my wif needs it to be in.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not what I expected, in that the light is glaring to look into.  Also the angle is not adjustable up and down, so if&lt;br /&gt;you put on heels you must pull the whole mirror back and forth to adjust looking into it.</li>
            <li> Lights all burned out in less than a month</li>
            <li> This is a replacement makeup mirror for one I was given as a birthday gift in 1964!  The old one was another brand, and was only taken out of the picture, due to not being able to find replacement lightbulbs for it.  When it \\&quot;died\\&quot; a couple of months ago, the bulbs that finally burned out were the originals!  This one has similar features and Conair is a respected name in beauty products, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  So, far, it&#x27;s working fine and exactly what I need on my dresser.  I have every confidence that this Conair product will last a long time, but it&#x27;s doubtful that I&#x27;ll be around to see it, if it lasts as long as my old one did!</li>
            <li> Returned it.  Light was not bright enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, a great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. The lightbulbs last for years and it makes eye brow plucking a breeze.</li>
            <li> THE BEST MIRROR EVER....THERE ISN&#x27;T MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THIS MIRROR. IT DOES GET A BIT HOT BUT THE LIGHT AND SETTING CAN BE ADJUSTED.</li>
            <li> The lighting did not meet my wife&#x27;s expectations. Too dull. The mirror&#x27;s concave side was not even and had bad distortion.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is very good but the lighting is not the right kind of light. I have a lamp beside the mirror and it gives a better light. The mirror lights seem to shine in my face rather than lighting up the mirror. The mirror looks good and it a nice size for my vanity table with an adjustable back bar for the angle.</li>
            <li> Best price on a lighted make up mirror I could find, and it is closer to the Revlon mirror I had used for decades.  The magnification side is a bit too strong for the placement of the mirror I use.  I have to lean in too much, but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience.  All is all, it a good buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the lighting on this one compared to the one I had.</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter requested a lighted make-up mirror like mine that I inherited from my mother.  This one seemed the most similar and she says it works great.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give off a lot of light</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife since she needed a mirror with close up as well as better lighting. This product does both well and she is very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that there seems to be no way to lock the mirror in place because any slight movement can rotate the mirrors</li>
            <li> I have to use it on its brightest setting because my attic room is very dark even with the light on. I love the size of it. It&#x27;s bigger than the other conair lighted mirror I was going to originally buy that had 3 mirror panels. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the other mirror and went for this one instead. Around Christmas time I went to Kmart and saw the 3 mirror paneled one and it was so small.  I was afraid this one would be small too. But when it arrived in the mail after Christmas I was pleasantly surprised to see it was way larger than the other mirror. A 3 panel mirror in this size would have been nice but I think this mirror is ok. I don&#x27;t use the regular mirror side of it only the magnification side. I have a huge 3 panel regular vanity so I use that instead.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Conair makes excellent products for a reasonable price.  I have been using this for months and it sure beats putting on my makeup in front of my bathroom mirror.  I don&#x27;t like the magnification side because my face is already fat and it shows every imperfection :) haha  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very dim and inaccurate lighting. There are four light settings and they are all pretty much indoor settings. The outside lighting is the worst!</li>
            <li> Sent it back.  Unfortunately not a quality product.  Light were much dimmer that our previous mirror.  Suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size and the lighting is fun to use! Even though my brother said I needed a 10x mirror the 5x is really all you need! Great item for the small price.</li>
            <li> it gets very hot ,very quickly .So be careful &amp; do not leave on or let children use this product</li>
            <li> Save your money. The lighting is not very bright. And, some bulbs did not work on the right side of this mirror upon receipt of this item (as others have stated in their reviews). However, Amazon has a great return policy, &amp; this product was returned with no problem.</li>
            <li> My wife was very satisfied and the mirror met or exceeded her expectations. She recommends this product to those person needing a satisfying magnification and lighting.</li>
            <li> I can manage my eyebrows again!</li>
            <li> I am not happy with it. I cannot use it because the light in this mirror has a yellowish cast, which obviously does not mimic natural light. The stand is attached, but always loose, your can&#x27;t clip it away when not in use. I&#x27;m VERY disappointed with the mirror.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this wonderful makeup mirror - it has a magnifying side, and two side doors you can angle. 4 options for lighting which is great. Well made - the one I had before this lasted for 25 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does not do colors, just brightness.  But the magnifying side is really nice.  Don&#x27;t need glasses to pluck my eyebrows anymore.</li>
            <li> Took forever but found my mother-in-law another light like this. Hers was burnt and dangerous. They don&#x27;t sell them like this anymore. needs brighter lighting.</li>
            <li> The light is not the right color on any settings. It is very hard to apply your make up. Two bulbs are blue, the two clear ones give off yellow color. Not happy at all with it but shipping back is to expensive so I am stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I had this mirror for about 8 years before it finally died in my last apartment move. When I bought a new one, it was as good as I remembered but felt slightly dimmer. I may just buy my own bulbs and replace them, but everything else about this mirror is great. The multiple light settings and changeable magnification are useful.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the magnification.  I thought it would be stronger.  I also would have preferred that it would be able to stand on a straighter angle.</li>
            <li> Among the many problems this mirror has is the fact that replacement bulbs are almost impossible to find. Two out of four bulbs blew out in about 5 months and I have not been able to find replacements. I may buy another mirror instead, and not this model. I have had many great Conair products over the decades, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> Came with US power plug. I am Australian and used an international plug adapter as the prongs were not suitable. I plugged it in and one of the settings blew a bulb. I tried to order a replacement but the manufacturer said that AU power wattage is between 220-240v. Any replacement bulb will blow again. I used it again and another bulb blew. Says nowhere on page about plug type provided. If the bulbs hadn&#x27;t blown I would have rated higher. :/[[ASIN:B001RJBL7E Conair Illumina Collection Two-Sided Makeup Mirror with 4 Light Settings]]</li>
            <li> Good price, good mirror!</li>
            <li> the mirroe goes up and down.  I would rather it went side to side</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all.  This was to be a Christmas gift.  My expectation was that the mirror would work properly.  The lights malfunctioned within a few days of receipt and just got worse by the day.  Only half the lights worked at best on a couple of settings.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d sent the item back for a full refund and the shipping costs charged me well over $55.00 in returning it and I expect that to be reimbursed to me as well.&lt;br /&gt;I understand you do not have a replacement in stock.  In short, I am very disappointed and will now have to look elsewhere and spend more time and money in finding this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia Viglione</li>
            <li> We bought a new one because it was cheaper than buying the replacement lamps.  We kept the old one for spare parts.</li>
            <li> 5his was a gift so didn&#x27;t really see it first hand, but granddaughter was very happy with it. Positive recommendation.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror, it is 2 sided and has great lighting which is good in the winter months when it is so dark in the mornings.</li>
            <li> magnifier side too high</li>
            <li> This product a very handy product. It can be used anywhere in the house and works excellently as promoted. Iuse it daily.</li>
            <li> I have went back into show business, and this mirror is the ticket for off stage makeup, I use it all the time for a quick touch up, thank you, Elvis Aron Preston</li>
            <li> I had the Jerdon Tri-Fold which lasted a few years and died on me. I am going to end up buying it again as this mirror is not useful. I was looking around in regular retail stores, and saw this Conair and got it. Big mistake. It isn&#x27;t bright enough and the light is a gross yellow. And I have it on a desk top, and the mirror itself cannot tilt, and there is not a position on the base that lets me even see into the mirror properly. I have to prop it up and do odd things to see. So it isn&#x27;t really adjustable as the Jerdon is. And the magnification side doesn&#x27;t blow your pores up to moon crater size as we all demand!</li>
            <li> Love this mirror as I had same one for about 25 years and it finally broke.  Only thing I miss is the electrical outlet on front of mirror to plug in blow dryer or curling iron.  Good investment.</li>
            <li> I had one of these year ago. The lighting is just right.  Love the magnifying side.  Much better than my old mirror.</li>
            <li> Great gift for teen girl.Great price and value compared to others.</li>
            <li> The  mirror works but the stand seems to slip. I really needed a little more magnification .</li>
            <li> My 25 year old make up mirror quietly died after 25 years of faithful service.  Being spoiled by it&#x27;s devotion, it was difficult to decide on a successor.  I chose this mirror because it looked similar to my old mirror and the price was right.  It is pretty good. The only feature that I wish it had is an electrical outlet for a hair appliance.</li>
            <li> The light was not bright enough for me to use when I put my eye makeup on.  I had to return this product.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in, and one of the lights blew.  Another fizzled out last night.  Certainly not worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly reviewed many make up mirrors to replace my vintage and working Clairol II from 1978.  Broke it trying to clean it.  This mirror is samely shaped, without the plug outlet, same type settings.  The day setting on my former mirror seemed more true to life than this lighting..but I need to get used to it after over 30 years.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of choices of lighting and it has a magnifying side which is great for seeing close up.</li>
            <li> My favorite mirror.  Have been using this product for years.  Just replaced my old one.</li>
            <li> Light not bright enough</li>
            <li> I had a mirror just like this in high school. Over the years I was looking for this mirror but never found it until I went on a&lt;br /&gt;Amazon. Great mirror with different settings such as office, evening, day etc to get the correct makeup look for where ever you are and what time of day it is.</li>
            <li> This mirror is much different than older model.  Different Lights are only one bulb for each setting instead of 4 lights with different covers.  Very disappointed with this product.  They don&#x27;t make&#x27;em like they used to!</li>
            <li> the mirror itself is wonderful, however when it arrived one side of it did not light up. as it turns out, the bulb was burnt out and i had to drive 40 miles to the nearest store that had that particular bulb in stock. great mirror, and once we replaced the bulb it was fine, however it was very inconvenient to have to hunt down that bulb.</li>
            <li> It has four different light settings (evening, home, office, day) through the use of four bulbs, but if you want to want to have enough light to put on makeup, the only setting that gives somewhat adequate light is the day setting. Otherwise, the lighting is very dark. Had a Clairol unit for almost 20 years and it more than provided adequate and true lighting for each setting. Wish they still made that.</li>
            <li> this will be a christmas gift for granddaughter - received in perfect condition and quickly - packaged securely - will do business with again</li>
            <li> Perfect Christmas present for my 15 year old daughter she loves it!</li>
            <li> I had the same makeup mirror for years and it finally gave out on me,and it was of course Conair! So naturally I bought the same product again,because it works and lasts forever ( or close to it).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and it works for her beautifully. We were so pleased to find it!</li>
            <li> Mirror is cheap material and the plastic panels over the lights keeps coming off.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted I don&#x27;t have anything more to say. I hope you have a great day &amp; holiday.</li>
            <li> hello,&lt;br /&gt;  conair is simply the best for beauty products.  the one we had was a similar model:  the TM8LX.  we replaced the bulbs in that older model, but it finally bit the dust after many years of service.  the name of the conair product is new, but the similar bulbs will work inside the new model.  the numbers are the same, so save your older bulbs.  the only thing is that this product cannot be consumer serviced, other than replacing bulbs.  that is too bad since qualified electronics people could simply replace an electrical cord or fix simple things that just happen to fail.  but, there is not one external screw to open the two sides of the unit.  but,  95% of of the world cannot simply replace a bad cord, so it must be a safety issue.  the older unit lasted longer than we thought, so this product is definitely a keeper.  but, if we were able to get access to the insides, the old mirror would have kept going for more years. this is a great product and the new one will last as long as the old one...yrmv</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and met my expectations for the needed lighting and the size fits great on my vanity. I had a Conair make-up mirror for 23 yrs and it finally died! I really searched online for a couple of weeks and then settled on this one. Amazon came to the rescue as usual. Thanks</li>
            <li> Not at all bright enough. Returned it, and bought the Ott Light.</li>
            <li> Definitely wasnt happy with this product.  Gives an orange image no matter what setting you use. (:  The product was low priced, but price doesn&#x27;t account for everything.</li>
            <li> Great lighting, the magnify mirror  extremely enlarges where you can see every pore or facial line.</li>
            <li> Love it, was exactly what I was hoping for</li>
            <li> it was very nice and I use it every day</li>
            <li> Arrived on time! It was a gift for a teenager and she loved it!</li>
            <li> passed on to my daughter, who loves it. It has a magnifying side good for eyebrow tweezing and a regular side to evaluate your whole look. My only complaint is that I wish it had a higher setting for the lights to be brighter. It does not bother my daughter, but my old eyes need flood lights.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a young teenage girl.  What a great age for a gift like this!</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose.  The only improvement would be to be able to tilt the mirror. The price is good and the service was good.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted. works well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I expected the light to be brighter, I bought this as a replacement to an old Conair makeup mirror that I had, I do like the two sided mirror and the versatile stand that it comes with. I would like it if the lighting was a little brighter. The delivery was just as promised and I would order again from this company.</li>
            <li> bought for my 13 yr old for her 14th Birthday in Jan Hopefully she loves it and will leave mine alone now that she will have her own</li>
            <li> I liked the older version of this light where there was a separate on/off switch.  The older one was also brighter for daytime.  Still a very nice light.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed this product several times and am not doing it anymore.  It was fine, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought two for Christmas gifts.  The girls were delighted with them.  They especially liked the light exposure feature. Their younger sister will probably want one, as well,  in a few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright, but very short. I have to lean far down to use it. I need a shelf or something to sit it on.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  I bought it to tweeze my eyebrows and it is perfect for that.  I would have given it 5 stars but it tends to get very  hot after awhile.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this item for the money... it is very cheaply made and way over priced</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast and I gave it to my mom. She has been enjoying it. I do wish the lights were a bit brighter.</li>
            <li> The four light settings is what I wanted.  I can see myself better and use my makeup correctly.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have forever owned this style of makeup mirror. This mirror has a setting dial that I can hardly turn because it is so tight. The time settings on it are NOT true. The daytime setting is sooo off color, way too dark. Conair puts out better products, and I am so disappointed in this. The makeup mirror I just replaced was another brand, but I thought I would try Conair-Unless I get restitution,I will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> dont buy  lights red hot stopped working 3rd time i used it but wasd npast 30 days couldnt return</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I had hoped, but adequate.  It serves the purpose by allowing magnification and lighted mirror in a dark room.</li>
            <li> the product was exactly what we were looking for - and it was great price too. What more need I say?</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife to replace a very old one she had.  She was pleased and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a mirror my daughter broke so I thought this would be a great mirror for the bad lighting that I have in my room I was scared to try it because there&#x27;s a lot of bad feedback on this mirror but thank God I didn&#x27;t listen to the people&#x27;s bad feedback this mirror is perfect I love it it has two different sides 14 close up which is great for doing eyeliner eyeshadow or mascara and perfect for eyebrow hairs and the other side is great for just looking at your face and doing makeup all around your face and even doing your hair 5 stars</li>
            <li> The only defect I found with this mirror is that the edges of the mirrow were not flat and thus my image was not flat.&lt;br /&gt;Also....the BIG side was huge!  Too huge for me.&lt;br /&gt;But....it was 98% perfect.</li>
            <li> The lights are yellow &amp;I could not brighten them enough.  I ended up buying a different one retail.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews that the light was on the yellow side and it is.  I think it&#x27;s a little too much actually.  I find that the office setting is the least yellow and closer to regular light.  I do like how the back wire clicks into the back of the mirror and also the plastic channel.  My last mirror didn&#x27;t have that.  I wish the mirror flipped up and down instead of side to side.  It&#x27;s just easier to me to adjust the mirror where I want it instead of having to move the back into a different slot to adjust it.  It would be a good mirror if they could make the light truer and not so yellow.</li>
            <li> not as sturdy as i had hoped and even the brightest settting is yellow light. disappointed but the price point was ok ...so i will live with it ....</li>
            <li> I like the compact size of this attractive product for use while traveling and staying in hotels with their notoriously high bathroom countertops.  Now I&#x27;ll be able to sit comfortably at the room desk to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter.  She loves it!!</li>
            <li> Only mirror of new models that give enough light to actually see what you are doing! Like that bulbs for it are easy to find.  I heard that can be a nightmare with other mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied .</li>
            <li> OK, my wife asked where the \\&quot;side mirrors\\&quot; are, and that&#x27;s a good question, why&#x27;d they take them off??  She also said the power cord on this model is at least a foot shorter than the original, so what&#x27;s with that??  An item like this NEEDS a long cord to give you access to an outlet, so be careful where you&#x27;re going to use this??</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because the lighting isn&#x27;t correct for the time of day.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using this to put on her own make up or do others make up for them.  This mirror only lights up white unlike some of the other colored light up mirrors.</li>
            <li> In the past I had a Clairol mirrow which I loved.  Since Clairol does not make these types of products anymore, especially their hair rollers which were the best......ever.  I ordered this mirror and it is very nice and does the job.</li>
            <li> I odered this for my Mom who is a makeup artist and it was not bright enough so I retuned it and ordered a more expensive one from Amazon and it is terrific.  You really get what you pay for!  This would be ok for some, but if you need a lot of light, then I would go with the higher priced one that is very similar but brighter and more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Second one and like it.</li>
            <li> Lights are yellow so I can&#x27;t see myself so clearly as my other mirror that had white lights. I will keep, but not so happy.</li>
            <li> text what&#x27;s excellent no problem very least with everything I purchase at amazon will continue to shop thank you</li>
            <li> I like this mirror much better than the Clairol one that I bought from another vendor several years ago.  The feature I like best is the on/off selection switch for the types of lighting.  The one on my Clairol mirror was irritating because I had to push a button and hold it in before it would come on . .  .</li>
            <li> This mirror is fantastic. It&#x27;s a good size. It&#x27;s lightweight and all the choices of lighting could not be better. It&#x27;s a great choice at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have had this mirror before and it lasted for years.  I love the lighting and magnification.  It is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought this with big hopes of having fun makeup sessions - you know, rainy afternoon, trying new faces?  It&#x27;s a beautiful unit - the mirror is great. But whereas makeup mirrors past had little fluorescent tubes in there with various filters and incandescent bulbs that mixed and matched for the &amp;#34;evening&amp;#34; &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; settings, this one has two very dim incandescents, two barely visible LEDs, and NO fluorescent tubes.  The overall light output is very, very dim, so really it&#x27;s just a mirror, as the lights are useless.  According to Amazon, I bought this in October 2012.  After playing with it for a day or two, it went in the closet and has been there ever since.  Not a good buy :-(</li>
            <li> At a bad angle. Should stand straight up.</li>
            <li> Bought for granddaughter she really likes it</li>
            <li> I had owned a Clairol makeup mirror for over 20 years. Unfortunately it became inoperable after it fell off my vanity. The Conair looked like an updated version of the Clairol unit. This Conair doesn&#x27;t compare in brightness.</li>
            <li> Conair Illumia Collection Mirror Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Illumia Collection Two-Sided Make-up Mirror is a fantastic product for $46.95. This product can be purchase on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Ratings&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product four out of five stars.  It has a two sided magnification mirrors, it has four different light settings, and an adjustable stand.  This product is very durable. However, the listed price seems to be high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Illumia Collection Two-sided mirror is a great product for women to use to put their make up on. With its four different light settings it makes it easy to see in all types in environments. The settings called Home and Day are the brightest, whereas Office and Evening are dimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Another great quality of his product is its adjustable stand.  This feature helps when you are using many different types of surfaces. You can adjust he height to personally fit your height.  This mirror has the two sided magnification feature which helps when you want to see closer up.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this product has great longevity.  I purchased this product five years ago and it still works like new.  After all these years I have yet had to change any of the four light bulbs.  If you are looking for a long lasting product this is the right one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product five out of five stars, but I was not satisfied with the listed price at the time of my purchase. I felt that for $46.95 there could have been more features included.  I now see that for Prime members on Amazon.com you can purchase this product for $25.77 which I feel is a more appropriate price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;Although, this product is a little expensive initially its longevity it makes up for the price. It has served my needs for the past five years with its different light settings, two different magnified mirrors, and its adjustable stand.  Finding all these features in one mirror can be hard.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I would have wanted and kind of an inconvenient angle. Six more words required plus two</li>
            <li> I really like my makeup mirror, small enough to use in my Motor home, easy to store, and I love all of the settings. I do recommend it as a purchase and it makes a great graduation gift.&lt;br /&gt; There isn&#x27;t anything about that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> needed a new mirrow, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it. What more can I say.</li>
            <li> The cost was great on this mirror, so I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to get a real high end product.  But for what I use it for it was fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom and she thinks the amount of life given off by the mirror is perfect! She does her make up in front of it every day!</li>
            <li> As per my daughter, it was not bright enough, the filters were useless to simulate other types of lighting.</li>
            <li> lighting is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great item! If you wear glasses and find it hard to put your makeup on without them? This is your answer</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for but was unable to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift because I have had one for years and love it.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Great for seeing all my hairs to pluck.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.I can see so good and i would buy another one if needed.This could be a Christmas gift for friends.Ths Edna</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect. The lighting is great and is coming from the correct directions...i/e/ the office setting is the blue top row lighting coming from above as would be in most work environments and the &#x27;evening&#x27; setting is the lowest yellowish lighting from the bottom row as you would expect at home with lamps turned on at home.&lt;br /&gt;I had this same mirror for close to 20 years that I received as a birthday present when I was 16 until it got shattered in a move. This replacement meets my expectations. Thanx!</li>
            <li> Just what i expected and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Bought this for mom. She likes it</li>
            <li> I had one of these as a teenager and I really liked it a lot so i purchased one for my daughter for christmas! she loves it too! love the lighting!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I previously owned one similar that was a different brand and loved it. But when I received this one it was not bright at all and I could not see well enough to apply make-up. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> The lights aren&#x27;t bright enough and most of the settings have a golden glow to the lighting which makes it hard to see small details and imperfections, which defeats the purpose of getting a lighted make up mirror. The \\&quot;office\\&quot; setting is especially disappointing because I didn&#x27;t think it was anything close to the bright fluorescent lights you would actually find in an office. I also did not think the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting was anything like natural, bright daylight.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this makeup mirror.  I thought the light settings would provide adequate light.  Even the brightest light is dim.  I gave it to GoodWill</li>
            <li> I had a mirror for over 20 plus years just like this and it finally stopped working.  I thought I&#x27;d try more compact mirrors but they just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations, so I returned them.  This mirror is perfect.  I like selecting the light mode and the magnifier is great for those hard to see areas.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The sides get so hot I burned my hand picking it up. The light works good and the stand is nice.</li>
            <li> This is an okay mirror but the lighting isn&#x27;t bright enough and I found myself putting on more makeup than usual.  Tried to use it to film my YouTube videos but it was horrible.  Sent it back ASAP...sorry Conair</li>
