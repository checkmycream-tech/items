    <ol>
            <li>Great invention!</li>
            <li>They work great!</li>
            <li>Great item works perfect.</li>
            <li>Size may be limiting for some, but I have slim fingers and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Very very pleased!</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>Good quality, getting used to them instead of foil.</li>
            <li>Way better then wrapping fingers in foil!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these plastic nail clips!  </li>
            <li>I do my own gel nails at home, and I have been using the foil method to remove.  </li>
            <li>Great product and great price, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These work great in assisting to hold on the foil/cotton ball/acetone to remove my gelish polish - easy to apply/hold onto the nail and easy to remove</li>
            <li>These are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Likely the best purchase a have made for the price!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re certainly better than the foil and my husband holding the cotton balls to my nails.  </li>
            <li>These have taken the place of my creative shellac polish removal process with soaked cotton pads cut into nail-size pieces then wrapped with foil and squeezed around the nail bed.  </li>
            <li>Love the system</li>
            <li>You may have to adjust the silver foil for a better grip.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly over the fingertip and they hold up to the acetone just fine, and I actually think my polish comes off cleaner than when I was wrapping my nails in the foil.  </li>
            <li>Wow these work great.</li>
            <li>Its convenient and makes it easy to soak off my gel polish now.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I tried them on and they seemed fine no pinching.</li>
            <li>They seemed to fit all my fingers well.</li>
            <li>Pretty useful, and a lot better than using foils!</li>
            <li>Soaked a pad with pure acetone and leave it on top of the finger with this clamp around it.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much, I bought a 2nd set to give to a friend that also does her own gel nails.  </li>
            <li>but I give them a try and was very pleased, so much easier to use than foil and my gel polish came of nicely far faster than it does when I soak my nails in a dish.</li>
            <li>Makes soaking off gel nails much easier!!</li>
            <li>Great product holds the gel gleaner foils tightly to the nails</li>
            <li>Only okay.  </li>
            <li>They work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought the pink color both times if that matters to anyone :-)  </li>
            <li>These are so much easier to use than foil.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These seemed like a let down when I got them out of  the package (week and cheaply made)</li>
            <li>These are so much quicker to use than foil and they arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>It took a while for these nail clips to arrive, but they make polish removal so much easier, especially glitter polishes.</li>
            <li>I use them to soak my nails for 10-15 minutes in acetone polish remover for natural nails.</li>
            <li>(you don&#x27;t need to use the whole thing, just enough to cover the nail), lay it on my nail, then put the clip over it for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>When I saw these, and for such a low price, I thought it was worth giving them a try.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are so much quicker to use than foil and they arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for about a month.  They work very well for me.  I cut a cotton pad in quarters, soak with remover and place on my nail.  Then use a clamp to hold in place.  They are not sealed so you don&#x27;t want to over use the remover or it will drip.</li>
            <li> These seemed like a let down when I got them out of  the package (week and cheaply made) but I give them a try and was very pleased, so much easier to use than foil and my gel polish came of nicely far faster than it does when I soak my nails in a dish. Likely the best purchase a have made for the price!</li>
            <li> Pretty useful, and a lot better than using foils! Size may be limiting for some, but I have slim fingers and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> It took a while for these nail clips to arrive, but they make polish removal so much easier, especially glitter polishes. I use them to soak my nails for 10-15 minutes in acetone polish remover for natural nails. Then, I press down and wiggle them slightly from side to side as I pull straight away from my finger. Usually, all the glitter comes off in one swipe. Also prevents polish stains and glitter on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wow these work great. I use gelish and usually put on 6 layers on.  These take all layers off in 10 minutes.  Way better then wrapping fingers in foil!</li>
            <li> Only okay.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of it yet, but they kept popping off.</li>
            <li> I received these a couple days ago.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they appear that they&#x27;ll hold the cotton balls in place.  They&#x27;re certainly better than the foil and my husband holding the cotton balls to my nails.  Update to follow...</li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails at home, and I have been using the foil method to remove.  When I saw these, and for such a low price, I thought it was worth giving them a try.  I LOVE these plastic nail clips!  I use 100% acetone on a piece of cotton ball (you don&#x27;t need to use the whole thing, just enough to cover the nail), lay it on my nail, then put the clip over it for 10 minutes.  They fit perfectly over the fingertip and they hold up to the acetone just fine, and I actually think my polish comes off cleaner than when I was wrapping my nails in the foil.  I liked them so much, I bought a 2nd set to give to a friend that also does her own gel nails.  I bought the pink color both times if that matters to anyone :-)  Great product and great price, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was using foils before this and this works like a charm! Its convenient and makes it easy to soak off my gel polish now.</li>
            <li> This is now the answer to my shellac nail polish removal process.  Why didn&#x27;t I think of these?  These have taken the place of my creative shellac polish removal process with soaked cotton pads cut into nail-size pieces then wrapped with foil and squeezed around the nail bed.  These little pink pinchers don&#x27;t fall off like my foil used to.  Now is there anything they make out there to improve my patience for this process, I tend to get a bit antsy when waiting for nail polish to come off and I can&#x27;t use my fingers to play games on my kindle at least.</li>
            <li> Makes soaking off gel nails much easier!!</li>
            <li> These are so much easier to use than foil. Cuts my soak/removal time in half. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I use only one piece on each hand because I only put glitter on the pointing finger. Soaked a pad with pure acetone and leave it on top of the finger with this clamp around it. It makes it easier to remove glitter polish.</li>
            <li> Great item works perfect. Thanks</li>
            <li> Good quality, getting used to them instead of foil. They work.</li>
            <li> Arrived in abt a week and a half. Totally useless though. I didn&#x27;t find that it helped with soaking my gel polish at all.</li>
            <li> These work great in assisting to hold on the foil/cotton ball/acetone to remove my gelish polish - easy to apply/hold onto the nail and easy to remove</li>
            <li> Great product holds the gel gleaner foils tightly to the nails so you can relax while the cleaner does its job! Great invention!</li>
            <li> Item came as pictured. I haven&#x27;t tested them to remove my polish. I just received them today. I tried them on and they seemed fine no pinching. They seemed to fit all my fingers well. I did switch one clip on my pinky for a tighter one on my index finger since it had a tighter clamp. Not a deal breaker. I can&#x27;t wait to try them. I will update. 💥Update💥 They work great! Very very pleased!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Love the system</li>
            <li> These are great. I wrap my nails with silver foil and cotton balls soaked with acetone, then clamp the plastic clamps on to hold. You may have to adjust the silver foil for a better grip. I find that with the plastic clamps on I tend to leave them on longer. When I remove them and the foil, the false nails/ tips are completely gone.</li>
            <li> These are very cheaply made. The springs don&#x27;t hold the cotton tight enough on your fingers. They keep falling off. Trashing them.</li>
