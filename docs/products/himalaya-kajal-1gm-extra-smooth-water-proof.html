    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>very happy I found this product.  </li>
            <li>best eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li>I have been using this kajal for years and its really good .</li>
            <li>Good product, good price.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for someone who is a minimalist and looking for a natural alternative with makeup.  </li>
            <li>This is great, very waterproof, I love it!</li>
            <li>But I love the definition.</li>
            <li>got the product alot sooner than was expected... very happy with the product</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it is easily washed off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>At first, I really liked how smooth the kohl was and that I didn&#x27;t have to rub and tug at my eyes.</li>
            <li>No way to sharpen the tip for a fine line.</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>This is something I would use for quick errands to the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>chandni bazaar thank you so much !!</li>
            <li>Free shipping and a fair price (half that of the 2.6 g version).</li>
            <li>It is large and very useful for using with a brush to draw dramatic and perfectly arched eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It glides on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my eyes when lining the inner lid.</li>
            <li>And as most said, it doesn&#x27;t last at all.  </li>
            <li>Super dark and easy to apply</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t really water proof as it smudges throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in the natural aspect of this, but it still made my eyes sting.  </li>
            <li>However, as it is natural I think better to use than other stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am more often than not very satisfied with my Amazon purchases, but this just didn&#x27;t get it for me.</li>
            <li>First of all the image makes it look significantly larger than it is.</li>
            <li>and I received it in early 2014.  </li>
            <li>This runs after 10 minutes of application, no matter how much you prime with Urban Decay or set with Skindinavia, and it is not in anyway waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the 2.6 g kajal I received on Amazon prime (which was open and used, yuck), these were sealed and marked w/dates.  </li>
            <li>It also is a super small eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I currently have a large Lakme Kajal Black Kohl pen.</li>

            <li> I had high hopes for this as the Lakme kajal was a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Actually, the Kajal is only about 1 inch long and not that malleable.</li>
            <li> Broken even before the first use and smugdes on bare toch.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long long time.</li>
            <li> , it goes on slick, but you will need a q-tip to eliminate the extra.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to have control of how much kohl you put on because the pencil is just too thick.</li>
            <li> But I cannot argue about the product or the price or the mere fact that I can actually buy this item online!</li>
            <li> Small version of the 2.6g Himalaya Herbals kajal.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why it claims to be.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t purchase again.  :(</li>

            <li> chandni bazaar thank you so much !!</li>
            <li> I was interested in the natural aspect of this, but it still made my eyes sting.  And as most said, it doesn&#x27;t last at all.  It also is a super small eyeliner.  I thought it was going to be bigger.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.  :(</li>
            <li> Not what I thought. I currently have a large Lakme Kajal Black Kohl pen. It is large and very useful for using with a brush to draw dramatic and perfectly arched eyebrows. I used to buy it locally, but every store that I used to buy from is no longer carrying it. I purchased this as an option. First of all the image makes it look significantly larger than it is. Actually, the Kajal is only about 1 inch long and not that malleable. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and have found the Lakme on another online site from which I intend to purchase. I am more often than not very satisfied with my Amazon purchases, but this just didn&#x27;t get it for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this almost 2 years ago and it still hasn&#x27;t finished. At first, I really liked how smooth the kohl was and that I didn&#x27;t have to rub and tug at my eyes. But after a few uses, I really didn&#x27;t like the smudging. It&#x27;s also hard to have control of how much kohl you put on because the pencil is just too thick.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long long time. But I cannot argue about the product or the price or the mere fact that I can actually buy this item online!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for someone who is a minimalist and looking for a natural alternative with makeup.  It is not waterproof but again I learned not to use alot.  I have noticed my eyelashes are fuller and I believe it is from the ingredients in the product.  I just noticed however that the product has a 2013 expiration date and I received it in early 2014.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t really water proof as it smudges throughout the day.  But I love the definition. However, as it is natural I think better to use than other stuff.  Also none of Kajal products come with return info or customer service info.  No instructions either.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this as the Lakme kajal was a huge disappointment.  This runs after 10 minutes of application, no matter how much you prime with Urban Decay or set with Skindinavia, and it is not in anyway waterproof.  This is something I would use for quick errands to the grocery store.  On the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it is easily washed off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Not so waterproof. Keeps smudging under my eyes. No way to sharpen the tip for a fine line. I like the smoothness, it goes on slick, but you will need a q-tip to eliminate the extra.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kajal for years and its really good .</li>
            <li> Small version of the 2.6g Himalaya Herbals kajal.  Same brand, packaging and product, only it&#x27;s 1g not 2.6.  I bought 4 as goody-bag type gifts.  Unlike the 2.6 g kajal I received on Amazon prime (which was open and used, yuck), these were sealed and marked w/dates.  Free shipping and a fair price (half that of the 2.6 g version).</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Broken even before the first use and smugdes on bare toch. Do not recommend it at all. Not what it is hyped up to be.</li>
            <li> This is great, very waterproof, I love it!</li>
            <li> got the product alot sooner than was expected... very happy with the product</li>
            <li> very happy I found this product.  It glides on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my eyes when lining the inner lid. If you haven&#x27;t used kohl before I would recommend watching video&#x27;s on ways to apply.  I did find that it won&#x27;t last all day without touch ups (which i never worry about) and if I rub my eyes it will smudge, but every product I&#x27;ve used before does that. I  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it isn&#x27;t waterproof and I&#x27;m not sure why it claims to be.</li>
            <li> best eyeliner ever. Super dark and easy to apply</li>
