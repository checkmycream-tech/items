            <li> I purchased these due to the great value as opposed to buying them individually.  I only rated a 4 because it will leave a slight blue line around the tub but it is easy to clean up. The only other thing is that I have a relatively large tub so I use a little more than normal. The salts dissolve relatively well with a pleasant smell, not overpowering and very relaxing.  They arrived exactly as posted and described.</li>
            <li> amazing relaxation and aromatherapy...concentrated LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Excellent bath salts. Ordered these for my wife and she loves them. They are however I bit over priced. This particular scent is difficult to find in store, however, the eucalyptus scent (green) are available at Walmart for only $5 a bottle. These were $20 for 3 so you can do the math and see it&#x27;s obviously cheaper to get in store but like I said. So far I&#x27;ve only seen the eucalyptus and not the lavender or any of the other scents. Wonderful salts though. I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> My brother uses this and swears by it - says it really works well</li>
            <li> Good product that did not require you to use the whole jar for a single bath.</li>
            <li> This product does the job.  I put the 2 capfuls in the water and soaked for about 20 minutes and the pain in my legs went away and didn&#x27;t return. It really works.</li>
            <li> These are like my staples for my bath. LOVE the scent and the feeling after using it. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> Wife enjoyed getting this for her birthday.  She wasn&#x27;t feeling well and the menthol in it help alot.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different bath soaks from Village Naturals and this one is my favorite. I love the smell. It&#x27;s very relaxing and eases my muscle aches. I soak for a while right before bed and I sleep like a baby.</li>
