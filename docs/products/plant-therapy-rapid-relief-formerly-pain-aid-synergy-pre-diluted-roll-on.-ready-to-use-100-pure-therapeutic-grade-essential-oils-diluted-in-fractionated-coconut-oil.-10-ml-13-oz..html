            <li>Easy to use and smells great!  </li>
            <li>I &#x27; ve used the pain oil blend ans loved it a lot.</li>
            <li>This wonderful roll on is perfect for targeting specific areas and provides</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and VERY easy application.</li>
            <li>Either way, it has a very nice clove smell :)</li>
            <li>The quality is great, and I love how easy and convenient it is to have them in the roller ball form, already diluted!</li>
            <li>Not saying that it couldn&#x27;t do the trick on its own -</li>
            <li>It smells strong but pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I also find the smell much more pleasant and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The aroma is great but it does absolutely nothing to ease pain.</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>We both really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy&#x27;s  pain aid synergy and love the roll on even more.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to mix the oils myself.</li>
            <li>This bottle has a metal ball and the liquid seems to dispense more liberally.</li>
            <li>Tiger Balm works MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>and I was able to sleep comfortably.</li>
            <li>The roll-on applicators make it so easy to apply the oils to target areas.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to dilute it myself and it is fast and easy!</li>
            <li>We also are trying to be more mindful of using more natural products.  </li>
            <li>My pain is more of a joint pain/arthritis pain and this product is absolutely making a difference.</li>
            <li>So, I just can&#x27;t give it full credit.</li>
            <li>Ordered my first pre-diluted essential oils from Plant Therapy and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li>The roller ball helps and will be great for travel as it&#x27;s small and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the smell, but after all, I got it for the pain</li>
            <li>really like the roll-ons because they are quick and convenient to use when you are on the go.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve been happy with the other products, this one completely missed the bar.  </li>
            <li>Normally I just use warm compresses, but with the Pain-Aid Synergy, it caused my pain to be less, and go away completely faster - WITH having used a warm compress afterwards.</li>
            <li>i was a first timer and wanted some roll ons to test..</li>
            <li>This is my first time to try the Pain-Aid roller ball...</li>
            <li>Really does take the pain away!</li>
            <li>Will be back for an updated review if I get better results then.</li>
            <li>He hates the ones with capsasin that make your skin HOT feeling.  </li>
            <li>I warms the area without feeling HOT.  </li>
            <li>have shared this with several family members and friends who have all said it alleviated their pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for low back pain and joints.</li>
            <li>This oil worked very well for the arthritis in my moms hand</li>
            <li>added some wintergreen to it so it wouldn&#x27;t smell SO much like Eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>seems to really work well in neck tension</li>
            <li>and it really worked.  </li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>I really like the warming feeling of this synergy.  </li>
            <li>fast relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like a roll-on, but did not get much relief of pain from that particular oil or combo.  </li>
            <li>Not bad use on my shoulder for street related pain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my knee and within a few minutes the pain was much better</li>
            <li>Between this stuff and later applying some warm compresses, I was pain-free - where, normally, I would have been in excruciating pain for a few hours at least.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so diluted that the essential oils in it are very low.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>My skin has had no trouble with this.  </li>
            <li>The applicator makes it no mess.</li>
            <li>and honestly the bottle is so small it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>This worked on some pain (low calcium after surgery hand aches, yes), but for arthritis deep bone pain, it helped but certainly didn&#x27;t cure it.</li>
            <li>If your pain is a 3 or less, it is well worth giving a try before reaching for a painkiller especially before trying to sleep.</li>

            <li> Easy to use and smells great!  Seems to actually work!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work but it did help ease my elbow pain.</li>
            <li> This oil worked very well for the arthritis in my moms hand</li>
            <li> The aroma is great but it does absolutely nothing to ease pain.</li>
            <li> love it.. i was a first timer and wanted some roll ons to test.. i now make my own but still with plant therapy&#x27;s oils!</li>
            <li> has helped with elbow pain and shoulder pain exceptionally well!</li>
            <li> I really like a roll-on, but did not get much relief of pain from that particular oil or combo.  i have back issues and also hip, bone on bone so they say.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and VERY easy application. AND seems to work. I put it on my arthritic knee at night. Allows me to sleep. Soon I will need knee replacement surgery. I forget to use it in the daytime. I think I will try it today.</li>
            <li> Worked for me, didn&#x27;t work for my wife... I used it for pain in my knees, she tried it on her back and feet. I thought it felt tingly and relieved a bit of the tension but she didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Either way, it has a very nice clove smell :)</li>
            <li> As a runner, this is my go-to must have in my house. I apply it after every run and it keeps arthritis pain at bay.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his arthritis and I use it for my fibromyalgia. We both really love this product.</li>
            <li> I &#x27; ve used the pain oil blend ans loved it a lot. It was helpful in giving me hints on what type oils can be used for pain also.</li>
            <li> really like the roll-ons because they are quick and convenient to use when you are on the go. thank you.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy&#x27;s  pain aid synergy and love the roll on even more. Now I don&#x27;t have to dilute it myself and it is fast and easy! I use it for joint pain for my arthritis and I get instant relief!</li>
            <li> I use both the self esteem and the pain aid synergies on my husband&#x27;s back for pain - alter between synergies. The roll-on applicators make it so easy to apply the oils to target areas.</li>
            <li> roll it where it hurts. it doesnt last real long time though.</li>
            <li> Only thing that helps my restless legs,  Works quickly.&lt;br /&gt; I Swear by this blend !</li>
            <li> added some wintergreen to it so it wouldn&#x27;t smell SO much like Eucalyptus.  Works great!  Can refill with whatever I like.  Only thing is that it arrived with a crack in bottom of bottle b/c it wasn&#x27;t packaged correctly!</li>
            <li> It relaxed my leg  muscles somewhat but did not help with my leg pain.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Its so diluted that the essential oils in it are very low.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try the Pain-Aid roller ball...it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve used it on my knee and within a few minutes the pain was much better and I was able to sleep comfortably. Used it on my ankles as well after walking and Pain-Aid took the pain away. I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. My knee and ankle were bothering me pretty bad the day the Pain-Aid arrived and I used it thinking &amp;#34;what the heck, nothing ventured...&amp;#34; the effect is so subtle that it took a minute for me to realize my knee and ankle weren&#x27;t throbbing anymore! Love this product and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to mix the oils myself. I will definitely order again. The roller ball helps and will be great for travel as it&#x27;s small and easy to pack. My pain is more of a joint pain/arthritis pain and this product is absolutely making a difference. Pain-Aid means pain away.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to work well for minor muscle pain.  It has a little bit of a smell, but not overwhelming.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Not long term or for my worst pain, but this does stop the pain cycle enough for your body to try to heal itself. So I had parathyroid surgery and later that day we went to DisneyWorld for 4 days. This worked on some pain (low calcium after surgery hand aches, yes), but for arthritis deep bone pain, it helped but certainly didn&#x27;t cure it. If your pain is a 3 or less, it is well worth giving a try before reaching for a painkiller especially before trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> This gives me almost immediate relief from low back pain without the burning sensation I get from other products I have tried.  I also find the smell much more pleasant and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I use this on my knees and hands and my husband uses it for his leg and together, we use it for anything else that hurts!  It works!</li>
            <li> seems to really work well in neck tension</li>
            <li> This worked great on my elbow pain.  I am not crazy about the smell, but after all, I got it for the pain and it really worked.  I have always been a person that didn&#x27;t believe that anything like this would work.  I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> Broke my wrist last fall and still aches once in a while. This is my second pain aid synergy. It really helps. This bottle has a metal ball and the liquid seems to dispense more liberally. Not sure I like the change.</li>
            <li> Ordered my first pre-diluted essential oils from Plant Therapy and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied! The quality is great, and I love how easy and convenient it is to have them in the roller ball form, already diluted!</li>
            <li> Just as thin as all the other roll ons they have (the carrier oil to essential oil ratio might be a little out of whack.).  But the pain aid?  Where is it?  While I&#x27;ve been happy with the other products, this one completely missed the bar.  No relief at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pain and I will be looking for a different product to you.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! Really does take the pain away! Very happy with this blend.</li>
            <li> Works great for pain. Relief is not permanent, but what is...</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I have bought it multiple times.</li>
            <li> It was just greasy made no difference at all</li>
            <li> I really like the warming feeling of this synergy.  It&#x27;s pretty good for low back pain and joints.</li>
            <li> I powerlift so I&#x27;m used to the aches and pains that come with the sport. That said, I&#x27;m used to the different topical oils, creams, and gels made for muscles aches. I&#x27;m not completely sold on this product yet after one use. I applied it on my left adductor, going from near the thigh fold/crotch area down to the side of my knee. I&#x27;ve been experiencing pain in that area since last Sept from doing a lot of back and front squats. I felt a very slight tingling sensation from this product and felt some relief. Nothing to write home about, but it was something. Next time I apply it, I&#x27;ll be stacking it with the Muscle-Aid oil. Will be back for an updated review if I get better results then.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. Tiger Balm works MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis.  My hubby has arthritis.  I am not fond of the products that feel cold.  He hates the ones with capsasin that make your skin HOT feeling.  I am not fond of smelling like my grandma.  I have sensative skin, and some products produce inflammed skin or a rash or even acne.  We also are trying to be more mindful of using more natural products.  I decided to give this a try.  I love it.  It smells strong but pleasant.  I warms the area without feeling HOT.  My skin has had no trouble with this.  The applicator makes it no mess. My hubby keeps asking to use it voluntarily, that is the best kind of compliment.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> No pain relief here and honestly the bottle is so small it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  Not sure what all the other rave reviews are about.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. I have fibromyalgia and have random aches and pains all over. This wonderful roll on is perfect for targeting specific areas and provides fast relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shared this with several family members and friends who have all said it alleviated their pain.</li>
            <li> I was hurting pretty bad just before a storm was coming through. My hips and knees always seem to give me problems before the precipitation changes dramatically. I immediately started to roll this and rub it in around my knees and over my hips. Between this stuff and later applying some warm compresses, I was pain-free - where, normally, I would have been in excruciating pain for a few hours at least.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it a four out of five because my pain didn&#x27;t go away with JUST the use of this product. Normally I just use warm compresses, but with the Pain-Aid Synergy, it caused my pain to be less, and go away completely faster - WITH having used a warm compress afterwards. So, I just can&#x27;t give it full credit. Not saying that it couldn&#x27;t do the trick on its own - I just can&#x27;t say from personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;Good product. All of Plant Therapy&#x27;s products have been great additions to our medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in both wrist and when I first wake up they are both very stiff and hurt this essential oil mixture helps</li>
            <li> Not bad use on my shoulder for street related pain</li>
    </ol>
