    <ol>
            <li>Excellent eye brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Great product for the price!</li>
            <li>Best eyebrow pencil I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I got it waaayyy ahead of schedule which I&#x27;m very happy with.</li>
            <li>THIS PENCIL IS GREAT!</li>
            <li>This is a great product but the retracting seems to have problems</li>
            <li>Great for eyebrow definition.</li>
            <li>The color pay-off is great and it stays all day.</li>
            <li>I love this brow pencil!</li>
            <li>They are the best at filling in my eyebrows and making them look natural.  </li>
            <li>Overall its a great product!</li>
            <li>Love the brush on one end and the ease with which it goes on.  </li>
            <li>My favorite product I&#x27;ve ever discovered.</li>
            <li>brow pencils and this one seemed to be a more in-expensive option.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would say that I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li>But I do love the spooley (excuse the spelling) end, very handy!</li>
            <li>It comes out more cream-based than pencily so as to allow for a smooth line and easy fill-in.</li>
            <li>But I do appreciate the fact that the Milani has no reddish undertone like some of the others I tried and it applies easily.  </li>
            <li>If the formula was a little firmer this pencil would be perfect.</li>
            <li>The brush on the opposite end if great for getting all our stray in line before coloring.</li>
            <li>This did not go on smooth nor did it stay on once it was on.</li>
            <li>This brow pencil is really nice, the color does not have a warm to red undertone.</li>
            <li>I WAS ORIGINALLY LOOKING FOR A POWDER--IT TENDS TO GO ON THE EASIEST, BUT</li>
            <li>EASY TO APPLY, NOT TOO HARD, AND GREAT COLOR.</li>
            <li>The right color for my face.  </li>
            <li>the color is just right</li>
            <li>Nothing to right home about or even write a review about.</li>
            <li>Love this - so easy to use, soft to color on, natural color.</li>
            <li>but I did a swatch on tje back of my hand with the pencil and then blended it with the brush and the pencil seemed to go on very smoothly</li>
            <li>I apply the pencil first just under my brow line to get the shape I want, then color in with eyebrow powder.</li>
            <li>This was the first automatic pencil I&#x27;ve ever tried and perhaps the length of the tube is deceiving?  </li>
            <li>which was nice, how ever the pencil drew on too dark, it looked like I put gel eyeliner on</li>
            <li>But...the pencil does not retract so the tip will get smushed if you twist too much.</li>
            <li>and the brush blended it very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>I really like this but would like it even more if it was just a tad harder.</li>
            <li>I love this pencil i have dark hair and</li>
            <li>Was looking for an eyebrow pencil to fill in the gaps where my Anastasia Brow Powder Duo in Ebony wasn&#x27;t providing enough coverage and to just clean up some lines in general.  </li>
            <li>I think I tried a new eyebrow pencil every month until I found these.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little difficult to be super precise, but it lasts fairly long and looks great.</li>
            <li>Very natural and neutral color.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands but this one has never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Color was true to what was expected</li>
            <li>I love the color of this eyebrow pencil (dark brown 02) and recently ordered my second one (neither from Amazon)</li>
            <li>I use a lighter shade of brown from Almay (plenty left in my first of this brand) to fill in the rest of my brows where I still have some old growth left.  </li>
            <li>- the first one didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried expensive and cheap eyebrow pencils trying to find the right one for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural, the only thing that I have to say is that it is to soft to draw individual hairs.</li>
            <li>It also has a very convenient comb on the other end.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, easy to use and matches my dark brown hair without any odd undertones.</li>

            <li> Long lasting, easy to use and matches my dark brown hair without any odd undertones.</li>
            <li> my second one lasts long enough so I won&#x27;t need to buy a third one.</li>
            <li> I can give it only 4 stars because  I expected it to last longer than 3 months, especially because I only need to use this one on the outer third of my eyebrows that I lost because of chemo.  </li>
            <li> And the point doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and not too fake &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I got the pencil earlier than expected, I ordered Tuesday 3 in the morning</li>
            <li> Just how I expected it</li>
            <li> Researched other &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I got the Dark brown.</li>
            <li> (I ordered dark brown).</li>
            <li> The dark brown is the closest to Anastasia&#x27;s Ebony shade that I have found that has comparable quality.</li>
            <li> I have dark, ash brown hair and almost ashey black eyebrows.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t afford to waste time drawing on my eyebrows for 5 minute each, the spooly was very harsh and rough and did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> Coverage is a little too creamy and waxy for what I was looking for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too crayon like in consistency, so</li>
            <li> If you like a harsh look then this is for you, but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I hate spending $20 for BrowWiz when I go through it so fast, but it&#x27;s definitely the HG for brow pencils.</li>
            <li> but I do have one complaint</li>
            <li> My eyebrows got very thin as a result of chemotherapy and have never really recovered.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I JUST WISH THAT THERE WAS A SHARPENER ON ONE END ...  :(</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> Excellent eye brow pencil.  The right color for my face.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just how I expected it</li>
            <li> This brow pencil is really nice, the color does not have a warm to red undertone. It&#x27;s very natural, the only thing that I have to say is that it is to soft to draw individual hairs. BUT that&#x27;s nothing big. Overall its a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive and cheap eyebrow pencils trying to find the right one for me. I&#x27;ve watched celebrity make up artists that say what&#x27;s in and when I bought it, it didn&#x27;t float my boat. So I was browsing and was like milani makes products for women of color. I have color so I bought it and have been hooked since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this brow pencil on Amazon now several times.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.  Love the brush on one end and the ease with which it goes on.  Will buy again when needed</li>
            <li> Horrible! Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I JUST WISH THAT THERE WAS A SHARPENER ON ONE END ...  :(</li>
            <li> Long lasting, easy to use and matches my dark brown hair without any odd undertones.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil i have dark hair and the color is just right</li>
            <li> I got the pencil earlier than expected, I ordered Tuesday 3 in the morning and I got the pencil on Thursday at noon-ish which was nice, how ever the pencil drew on too dark, it looked like I put gel eyeliner on, I tried to use a softer hand but I can&#x27;t afford to waste time drawing on my eyebrows for 5 minute each, the spooly was very harsh and rough and did not work well for me. If you like a harsh look then this is for you, but I didn&#x27;t like it. I got the Dark brown.</li>
            <li> I love this brow pencil! I use this in combination with eyebrow powder. I apply the pencil first just under my brow line to get the shape I want, then color in with eyebrow powder. Lasts all day. The brush on the opposite end if great for getting all our stray in line before coloring. Color was true to what was expected (I ordered dark brown). Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow pencil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but the retracting seems to have problems</li>
            <li> Great for eyebrow definition. My favorite product I&#x27;ve ever discovered. It comes out more cream-based than pencily so as to allow for a smooth line and easy fill-in. It also has a very convenient comb on the other end. Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows got very thin as a result of chemotherapy and have never really recovered.  I think I tried a new eyebrow pencil every month until I found these.  They are the best at filling in my eyebrows and making them look natural.  The seller was prompt with the order and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The color pay-off is great and it stays all day. Very natural and neutral color. But...the pencil does not retract so the tip will get smushed if you twist too much. And the point doesn&#x27;t last very long. If the formula was a little firmer this pencil would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an eyebrow pencil to fill in the gaps where my Anastasia Brow Powder Duo in Ebony wasn&#x27;t providing enough coverage and to just clean up some lines in general.  Researched other &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34; brow pencils and this one seemed to be a more in-expensive option.  Coverage is a little too creamy and waxy for what I was looking for but if you are just a beginner in eyebrow makeup, I would recommend.  It was easy to apply and not too fake &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail today and I got it waaayyy ahead of schedule which I&#x27;m very happy with. I have not used it yet but I did a swatch on tje back of my hand with the pencil and then blended it with the brush and the pencil seemed to go on very smoothly and the brush blended it very well. Overall, I would say that I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I WAS ORIGINALLY LOOKING FOR A POWDER--IT TENDS TO GO ON THE EASIEST, BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID--THIS PENCIL IS GREAT! EASY TO APPLY, NOT TOO HARD, AND GREAT COLOR. I WILL CONTINUE BUYING THESE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> !I have dark, ash brown hair and almost ashey black eyebrows. The dark brown is the closest to Anastasia&#x27;s Ebony shade that I have found that has comparable quality. I hate spending $20 for BrowWiz when I go through it so fast, but it&#x27;s definitely the HG for brow pencils. This however is a close second. It&#x27;s a little too crayon like in consistency, so it&#x27;s a little difficult to be super precise, but it lasts fairly long and looks great. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I really like this but would like it even more if it was just a tad harder. Just a bit and if it came with something to sharpen it because I tend to favor sharper lines when applying my brows. But I do love the spooley (excuse the spelling) end, very handy!</li>
            <li> Nothing to right home about or even write a review about. This did not go on smooth nor did it stay on once it was on.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyebrow pencil. I have tried other brands but this one has never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this eyebrow pencil (dark brown 02) and recently ordered my second one (neither from Amazon) but I do have one complaint - the first one didn&#x27;t last long. This was the first automatic pencil I&#x27;ve ever tried and perhaps the length of the tube is deceiving?  I can give it only 4 stars because  I expected it to last longer than 3 months, especially because I only need to use this one on the outer third of my eyebrows that I lost because of chemo.  I use a lighter shade of brown from Almay (plenty left in my first of this brand) to fill in the rest of my brows where I still have some old growth left.  But I do appreciate the fact that the Milani has no reddish undertone like some of the others I tried and it applies easily.  I&#x27;m done with chemo now and just hope my second one lasts long enough so I won&#x27;t need to buy a third one.</li>
            <li> Love this - so easy to use, soft to color on, natural color.</li>
