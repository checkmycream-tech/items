            <li>:) I have used this for three years and hope than L&#x27;Oreal never stops making it.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with all items with exception of 3 stylus.</li>
            <li>My most favorite wrinkle reducer for my forehead.</li>
            <li>Then you can dig out more and use for quite awhile longer.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t make this product any more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like L&#x27;Oreal products better than any I have tried.</li>
            <li>this is the best product of its type currently extant.  </li>
            <li>But I will give it more time and see if the product works better.</li>
            <li>It cost me a bit more this way than if I bought it at the store.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it here at a great price when it was no longer in stock at my local store.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a general face cream because it works all over and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Helps hide fine lines..</li>
            <li>Light lines on the forehead.  </li>
            <li>She buys a year&#x27;s supply at a time, and dreads the day when it is no longer available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that most of those products that make such claims don&#x27;t really work that great, but this one does.</li>
            <li>Hope you love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized my mistake.</li>
            <li>My sense of taste is normal, so this is more of a curiosity than anything else.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>some laugh line around my mouth.</li>
            <li>it does not erase wrinkles but seems  to prevent them from becoming deeper and delays new ones trom forming as fast.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>This product does not work right away after I apply it, but as the day goes on, i notice my forehead lines have evened out and are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>and yes, it was the product, but it didn&#x27;t smell right or felt right.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Revitalift Deep Set Wrinkle is a nice product, but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference except around the lip area.</li>
            <li>Its an ok face cream I have a deep furrow between my eye brows</li>
            <li>This is the only collagen filler that works for me -- I hope it will always be available through Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>I could definitely use more help though, so I have to keep searching.</li>
            <li>This is the only cream that worked just a little bit, I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle .I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It really works (I help it along with lemon serum).  </li>
            <li>It really fill up the unwanted wrinkles.</li>
            <li>If you keep applying over and over wile you watch a movie it will  really do the job in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s like putting a dab of real perfume on each wrinkle.</li>
            <li>and I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>and it doesnt do much for that</li>
            <li>so there ya have it just dont expect much and</li>
            <li>and i has really cutdown the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>But I had not found anything that worked really well on those lines between my eyes and on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in the mail fast.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend using this product; for the cost it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>You can cut the tube when you get down to not much left and put in a good ziplock baggie.</li>
            <li>Although it does not make my fine lines disappear completely, only make them smoother and less obvious, still I am happy enough with this product.</li>
            <li>Among all those wrinkle reduce treatment products on the market, this one is the only product I have tried so far that does reduce my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I got this for my mom as she didnt find any in the stores, so I instantly thought of Amazon, and sure enough, we have a winner!</li>
            <li>and if you stop using it the lines come back quickly.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of Dr. Dense items for my face as they really do help sensitive skin from aging.  </li>
            <li>Have bought a few times and will continue until something come out better.  </li>
            <li>and I look and feel like a new person.  </li>
            <li>really like this product it seems to fill in facial lines very well and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have pretty deep wrinkles on my forehead, and this stuff manages to reduce their visibility by about 50%.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this product like I did from the clinique.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product in early January.</li>
            <li>So far this product has underperformed.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product and I was really amazed that I could tell a difference within a short time of use.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and been trying all kinds of line fillers with no luck until I found this product.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s supposed to be a filler -- it does not work, the white cream just sits on top of the skin, and feels like an oil slick.</li>
            <li>All I can say is give it a try and be sure to use everyday; didn&#x27;t take long for me to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Have been using it a long time, but as often happens, when I really like something, the co. decides to discontinue the item.  </li>
            <li>I was shocked to see some not so great reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young woman age 26, and when I use this to get rid of the only lines I have on my face, the results are instantaneous.  </li>
            <li>I just recently tried this and so far it seems to help</li>
            <li>, I have not been using long enough to give my complete opinion on this but am noticing some changes.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and like it very much.</li>
            <li>You have to wear it everyday because it is not long acting, but once applied it really does reduce the appearance of deep lines.  </li>

            <li> You have to wear it everyday because it is not long acting, but once applied it really does reduce the appearance of deep lines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few wrinkle fillers / treatments, but this one gave me almost instant (same day) results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but under my eyes looked at least twenty years older.  </li>
            <li> I wear it on my forehead, in those lines that go from the nose down by the mouth, on my upper lip, and on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I looked the same not even a slight change.  </li>
            <li> young and have those common #11 parenthesis between eyes.  </li>
            <li> I should be seeing a difference with the $$$$$ i spent on this item.</li>
            <li> People 26 and 36 years old are not a good example for a &#x27;wrinkle treatment&#x27; product.  </li>
            <li> Found stylus not usable extremely flimsy.</li>
            <li> All other items have met my expectations.</li>
            <li> So my advice to other customers is, do not put the product in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with the lines on the sides of my face for the past several years.</li>
            <li> The product itself is very thick, you only need a little amount which is going to make this tube last a long time.</li>
            <li> goes on easily, is not greasy, and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> While my tongue is noticeably smoother and years younger, it is probably not a good idea to duplicate my mistake..</li>
            <li> I do not think I had any permanent damage, but I swear since my little comedy of errors my tongue looks smoother.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was supposed to leave it on all night for a few days to see results?</li>
            <li> But The other morning I woke up late</li>
            <li> New product disappointing &amp; consistency like water compared to this formula.  </li>
            <li> No more, though. )</li>
            <li> so that was also a WASTE!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt and it definitely was cheaper.  </li>
            <li> so much less noticeable!!</li>
            <li> At least I am assuming that is what is happening as I can no longer find it in any drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else lately.</li>
            <li> they are no more colored blind than I am.</li>
            <li> shockingly for the price, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> At least it does something!</li>
            <li> It seemed like the problem was just getting worse.  </li>
            <li> I get tired of over priced items with no effective results!!</li>
            <li> First, it stinks, that is, it has a terrible order.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed when I received my order and was two of the same products it appeared the stores has replaced this with.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find it in the stores</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased this stuff.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for some time. I was unable to find it in the stores I had always gotten it, so decided to try online. I am very happy!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this.  I&#x27;ve used a few wrinkle fillers / treatments, but this one gave me almost instant (same day) results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will def. purchase again.</li>
            <li> it did not meet what was written about it.  it did nothing of what it was supposed to and I would not order it again</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It really works (I help it along with lemon serum).  You have to wear it everyday because it is not long acting, but once applied it really does reduce the appearance of deep lines.  I wear it on my forehead, in those lines that go from the nose down by the mouth, on my upper lip, and on my neck.  I am 60 years old.  I&#x27;ve bought this product several times and it works as well or better than those really expensive products.  (And, yes, I was sucked into buying them.  One cost over a $100!!  No more, though. )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young woman age 26, and when I use this to get rid of the only lines I have on my face, the results are instantaneous.  I am satisfied with the price I paid, combined with the results that it gives me.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Price is great, the product is awesome and the quality is excellent!  Thank you!  Will buy again!  Easy Transaction!</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better. None of these &amp;#34;fillers&amp;#34; work!  I apply to the wrinkles, but there is no difference.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, a waste of money.  I even sent an email to the seller whom I never heard from - so that was also a WASTE!  I&#x27;m 65 yrs. young and have those common #11 parenthesis between eyes.  Light lines on the forehead.  Deep ones from end of nose to mouth.  Tried this &#x27;wrinkle treatment for one week (7 days), to no avail whatsoever.  I looked the same not even a slight change.  I don&#x27;t understand the 5 STARS for this useless product. People 26 and 36 years old are not a good example for a &#x27;wrinkle treatment&#x27; product.  People from 50 years up are the good examples for true wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. It really fill up the unwanted wrinkles. If you keep applying over and over wile you watch a movie it will  really do the job in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I started getting very deep lines under my eyes along with crepeness.  Granted I am only 36 but under my eyes looked at least twenty years older.  I was using clinique products which were not doing anything for me except making my face red and itchy.  It seemed like the problem was just getting worse.  I was skeptical but figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt and it definitely was cheaper.  I noticed a difference the next day.  It&#x27;s been two weeks now and I look and feel like a new person.  The product itself is very thick, you only need a little amount which is going to make this tube last a long time. I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this product like I did from the clinique.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t think I was going to get the results I did without surgery. It really is amazing.</li>
            <li> I/ve been using this product for years.  it does not erase wrinkles but seems  to prevent them from becoming deeper and delays new ones trom forming as fast.&lt;br /&gt;it goes on easily, is not greasy, and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve used this product for years and have been happy with the results.  I was glad to find it here at a great price when it was no longer in stock at my local store.  It was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and like it very much. Yes, I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Have used this item for several years now.  I think this product is re-packaged and still is for sale in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product it seems to fill in facial lines very well and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I just recently tried this and so far it seems to help, I have not been using long enough to give my complete opinion on this but am noticing some changes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Useless to me cuz it&#x27;s like putting a dab of real perfume on each wrinkle. I left it on for 20 mins (against my will) and didn&#x27;t see a change. Maybe I was supposed to leave it on all night for a few days to see results? You&#x27;ve got to be kidding! When will these skin care companies ever learn!</li>
            <li> This was a discontinued makeup product from L&#x27;Oreal and I could not find it on the Mfgt website.  I sure was happy I was able to order this product since it had have been discontinued and I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE TOLD OTHERS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT WHERE I WORK,  WILL PURCHASE AGAIN ,  NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I dare not find out...  This product works wonders and lasts forever!  Every woman must try it - You will be thrilled with the results - I promise!</li>
            <li> Its an ok face cream I have a deep furrow between my eye brows and it doesnt do much for that but nothing else will either even botox so there ya have it just dont expect much and you will be satisfied with it</li>
            <li> This product does not work right away after I apply it, but as the day goes on, i notice my forehead lines have evened out and are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> As soonas you put it on you can see the difference in those deep wrinkle areas.  I use it after I get out of the shower to fill in the lines.  I carry to beach to put on after i am in the water.  Have bought a few times and will continue until something come out better.  But for now thats all I will buy</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Have been using it a long time, but as often happens, when I really like something, the co. decides to discontinue the item.  At least I am assuming that is what is happening as I can no longer find it in any drugstore.  I&#x27;m glad I can still find it on Amazon.  It instantly softens and &amp;#34;raises&amp;#34; deep lines.  L&#x27;Oreal has a lotion that I guess is supposed to be similar but it does&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> it did soften my frown lines. This is the only cream that worked just a little bit, I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle .I am happy with the results. I been using it for about 6 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in early January. The cost was deducted from my credit card on Jan. 9th, I waited and waited for it to arrive. I wrote the company asking where was this product and was told that someone was looking into it. A week later I wrote again....this time several days later I was informed that I would receive a credit to my card because the product was not in stock. How is it good business to charge items that you don&#x27;t even have? I was informed that there was no product February 13th over a month from my credit card charge! If this is how things work out when ordered through Amazon Market Place and specifically Blessings8260 I won&#x27;t be doing it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it on my face and lips and i has really cutdown the wrinkles. :) I have used this for three years and hope than L&#x27;Oreal never stops making it.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with all items with exception of 3 stylus. Found stylus not usable extremely flimsy. All other items have met my expectations.</li>
            <li> My most favorite wrinkle reducer for my forehead. You must use daily (I only use in the morning) and then I use Olay at night.  You can cut the tube when you get down to not much left and put in a good ziplock baggie. Then you can dig out more and use for quite awhile longer.</li>
            <li> I use this as a general face cream because it works all over and smells great.  Day or night use</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as she didnt find any in the stores, so I instantly thought of Amazon, and sure enough, we have a winner! She loves it and there seems to be no problems.</li>
            <li> This is the only collagen filler that works for me -- I hope it will always be available through Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t make this product any more. My wife made the mistake or purchasing this and yes, it was the product, but it didn&#x27;t smell right or felt right. Do NOT purchase this because it definitely will be an expired product.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Revitalift Deep Set Wrinkle is a nice product, but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference except around the lip area.</li>
            <li> I did not receive what I ordered. I have tried for several months to find this product in stores when I found out it was being discontinued. I surprisingly found it on this sellers site. Happily ordered two, picture of product and box and description was exactly what I had been purchasing at store for years. Very disappointed when I received my order and was two of the same products it appeared the stores has replaced this with. Did they get my order wrong? gees box shows a blue tube and box on outside of ones sent to me show the red tube? hmmmmm  no I didn&#x27;t contact seller because I have a sneaky suspicion they are no more colored blind than I am.</li>
            <li> shockingly for the price, this stuff really works! I have pretty deep wrinkles on my forehead, and this stuff manages to reduce their visibility by about 50%. Love it. I also use the stuff for the eyes. The only downside is that the effect doesn&#x27;t usually last all day. Maybe 6-8 hours or so. But that&#x27;s usually enough.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for sometime and I am always very satisfied with the wrinkle hiding results. But The other morning I woke up late and as I was rushing around the bathroom I inadvertently put the L&#x27;Oreal product on my toothbrush, and I proceeded to brush my teeth. I quickly realized my mistake. It did not taste bad per se, but I did notice my tongue tingling where It had became immersed in the wrinkle cream. I do not think I had any permanent damage, but I swear since my little comedy of errors my tongue looks smoother. Not all over just where it was in contact with the Collagen cream. My sense of taste is normal, so this is more of a curiosity than anything else. So my advice to other customers is, do not put the product in your mouth. While my tongue is noticeably smoother and years younger, it is probably not a good idea to duplicate my mistake..</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t made a difference</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Helps hide fine lines..Absorbs quickly..Cannot find anything else that works as well..Excellent, price was the best ever..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> Among all those wrinkle reduce treatment products on the market, this one is the only product I have tried so far that does reduce my fine lines. Although it does not make my fine lines disappear completely, only make them smoother and less obvious, still I am happy enough with this product. At least it does something!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and feel it works well. I could definitely use more help though, so I have to keep searching.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this, seems to vanish the fine lines and crows feet. come very quickly, was a great pric, will order more when I need more</li>
            <li> The best product for wrinkles. It makes my make up go on a lot smother.  I like L&#x27;Oreal products better than any I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works well for me. I notice a difference when I do not use it. Did not like the last price it was advertised at. Hope that goes lower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with the lines on the sides of my face for the past several years. I tried this product just to see if it would help reduce the appearance of the lines. It works but you wont see any difference in your lines for about a month .. and if you stop using it the lines come back quickly. The best thing I would say if you are a woman over 35 is keep your skin moisturized and sun screen on at all times. I think they have discontinued this product because I had to purchase it off of here.</li>
            <li> She Who Must Be Obeyed states this is the best product of its type currently extant.  She buys a year&#x27;s supply at a time, and dreads the day when it is no longer available.</li>
            <li> So far this product has underperformed.  But I will give it more time and see if the product works better.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. First, it stinks, that is, it has a terrible order. Second, it&#x27;s greasy, never sets in. If it&#x27;s supposed to be a filler -- it does not work, the white cream just sits on top of the skin, and feels like an oil slick. I threw it out after one use!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product, and especially the expensive price!!! I should be seeing a difference with the $$$$$ i spent on this item. I get tired of over priced items with no effective results!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I was really amazed that I could tell a difference within a short time of use. I&#x27;ve found that most of those products that make such claims don&#x27;t really work that great, but this one does. Then it was never restocked where I bought it and when I saw this item on internet, I ordered it.</li>
            <li> At age 65, I don&#x27;t expect miracles; but this product makes my face feel good and it seems to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> used product previously- excellent coverage;  ordered from Amazon as no longer being sold in store in original formula.  New product disappointing &amp; consistency like water compared to this formula.  Could wear without foundation or powder.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Dr. Dense items for my face as they really do help sensitive skin from aging.  But I had not found anything that worked really well on those lines between my eyes and on my forehead.  After using L&#x27;Oreal Collagen wrinkle treatment for a month I noticed the lines were diminished and the lines around my mouth were not as visible either.  I would definitely recommend using this product; for the cost it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Arrived in the mail fast. It cost me a bit more this way than if I bought it at the store.</li>
            <li> I am so relieved that Amazon has this product. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else lately. I am in my early 40&#x27;s and been trying all kinds of line fillers with no luck until I found this product. I have been using it daily and this is the only product that has made a difference. I have an annoying vertical line between my eyes and some laugh line around my mouth. My lines are diminishing...so much less noticeable!! Give it a try...I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I was shocked to see some not so great reviews. All I can say is give it a try and be sure to use everyday; didn&#x27;t take long for me to notice a difference. Hope you love it as much as I do!</li>
