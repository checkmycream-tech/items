    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this after it was recommended by a specialist at Bloomingdale&#x27;s.  I am in my early 30s have combination skin (dry for the most part, but an oily forehead).  My skin is not sensitive by any means.  I used this as directed and it made my skin worse than it has ever been!  My chin broke out in severe acne (which I normally do not have), while the rest of my face turned red and splotchy (almost like a rash).  It also left most of my face feeling itchy.  I went from using just powder on my face to having to use full coverage make-up to cover up the mess this left.  Luckily, I was able to return it to the store for a full refund.  It&#x27;s been almost a week since I&#x27;ve stopped using it and I&#x27;m still working on repairing the damage this caused to my face.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  And, I&#x27;m steering clear from this company all together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Origins products (which I love) but wanted to try a little more specific toner for my combo skin. This was the right choice. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is much clearer after using this for only a week. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Such a good product.  I feel like it really tightens up my face and I have seen visible improvement in the three weeks that I have been using this product.  I also use the Clarins Tamarind face wash and the Clarins moisturizer.  All products are for combination/oily skin and big pores.</li>
            <li> LIKE ALL THE CLARINS PRODUCTS IT IS EXCELLENT. THE AROMA, THE FEEL ON YOUR SKIN, YOU FEEL YOUR FACE CLEAN AND REFRESHING AT THE SAME TIME. I HAVE COMBINED SKIN AND EVEN THOUGH MY AGE IS 51 AND IT IS RECOMMENDED I USE ANOTHER TYPE OF CLARINS TONING LOTION, I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS. I SOMETIMES SWITCH BUT ALWAYS RETURN TO THIS TONING LOTION.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin shine more than usual. I would recommend it to people with normal skin looking to brighten up their complexion. I&#x27;ll stickwith Clarins oil control moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Most toners are too harsh for my sensitive skin. I really like this one, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and has a very light scent. Price is great even when having to pay a little for shipping.</li>
            <li> I like this toner. gives feeling of freshness to my skin. I&#x27;ve got combined skin type to slightly dry and it-s very good for me. The only issue is that it dries very slowly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clarins products for over 10 years and this has been the best toner I&#x27;ve used.  It is gentle and effective and a perfect step for post-cleansing.</li>
            <li> Best toning lotion ever. The first find I trird this product was a couple of weeks in a duty free in Mexico. At first I was skeptical buying when it was recommended to me thinking it was a sales trick. After a 5 hours flight and a train ride my face was so smooth and clean. I always struggle with shiny and oily t zone and red spots. Well not anymore. It has also a pleasant smell (iris) and is alcohol free. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff so far, and it makes my skin feel great!  I may have a new favorite toner!</li>
            <li> is a refreshing end to my day...another product that has seen my face thru many years....keeps it supple,and soft and clean</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle since I started using this toner. Perfect for combination skin. Smells so good/natural too. Fast delivery, good price. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product &amp; company!</li>
            <li> very gentle to skin. could be used as lotion individually in the summer. or with other lotion in winter time. it is light so you don&#x27;t feel oily. love it. delivered very fast and packed carefully. will buy again!</li>
            <li> The toner seems to work well. I like it.</li>
            <li> I need information about my Package, it may not be possible so far not reached my mail box ... I demand an immediate response</li>
            <li> this product was okay for me, i switched to DICKINSON witch hazel which have soooooo much good reviews, this was just a waste of money, not purchasing it again. you don&#x27;t have to be pricey to achieve that perfect skin, you just have to search search and search</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product is great and the product arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Great toner. No alcohol so does not strip skin. Also, does wonders with making my pores less visible. Also reduces my redness</li>
            <li> This toner by clarins is great!!  It feels so cool and refreshing when putting it on my face!!  Received it quicker than I thought I would!!</li>
            <li> Great product and good price.  I think I&#x27;ll buy all skin care products here.  Great value.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I received samples of it after purchasing the HydraQuench face cream for normal to combination skin. After moving to a climate that has wreaked havoc on my skin, I really needed something that would normalize my skin care routine, as opposed to me desperately trying product after product. Enter this toning lotion, which I apply after washing my face with the Clarins Gentle Foaming Cleanser in the shower. My face is clean, but not stripped and dry - very important as I tend to dry out easily - and the HydraQuench seals in the moisture without making my skin oily or break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now more enthusiastic about caring for my skin and give two thumbs up to this product!</li>

            <li> Use effect in general</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s one of the finest cleanest feelings you can get for your skin in any product. Smells fabulous and very natural. Clarins is the real deal. Nothing better.</li>
            <li> Great toner! Controls oil without leaving your skin dry as the sahara desert. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with oil skin!</li>
            <li> I think it‘s good for my oily skin. 6.8 oz, 200ML,It’s very fresh，and  I can use it for 2~3 months. It&#x27;s  very useful.</li>
