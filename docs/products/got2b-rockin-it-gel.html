            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more and was happy to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>A nice medium hold gel.</li>
            <li>a nice hold</li>
            <li>I know that is has the pheromones in it, but man it does not smell good and really, the gel ain&#x27;t that good either.</li>
            <li>sure hope</li>
            <li>I have been using this gel for years now and love it.</li>

            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to others (to guys:)).</li>
            <li>this is a lot more liquified.</li>
            <li>Then if you let it dry in your hair, and style your hair afterward, it is a perfect hold.  </li>
            <li>As far as the girl attraction goes, I cannot make any claims lol.</li>
            <li>Got 2b needs to make this more readily available.  </li>
            <li>I love how it made my hair look and feel, however the scent is definitely for a man, lol.  </li>
            <li>This hair gel is hands down the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>I turned to Amazon instead - they do have great deals on this specific product.</li>
            <li>This is not the original formula.</li>
            <li>Is really kind of shinny soft dnt glue ur hair or anything like that.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>But hey I got a good deal can&#x27;t be sour</li>
            <li>The real difference with this gel is that it holds your hair in place with a quick pass thru the hair with your hands while your hair is damp.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>so i am only able to</li>
            <li>He won&#x27;t use any other kind after using this brand</li>
            <li>The new gel is a lot more watery and has a different smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have not tried this product yet so don&#x27;t really know how I like it</li>
            <li>Gives great control for short to medium length hair not too stiff or plastic feeling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Its hard to describe, but the bottles felt flimsy, almost like a type of really cheap plastic, or possibly even a foil like material, surely wasn&#x27;t the same as what i used to get from the store.</li>
            <li>The bottles I recived don&#x27;t look like the one in the picture they are silver and black and cheaply made one has a crack in the side of it.</li>
            <li>SO sorry that I bought three tubes after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li>&quot; If you mean by chemical smell, sure.</li>
            <li>When it pours out when you open it, it is obviously mainly water.  </li>
            <li>Someone in the review section said that the bottles didn&#x27;t look like the ones in the pic, well this part is true, they were grey and back, which actually is correct.</li>
            <li>Girls luv these gel hands down the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this product in drug stores when it was available, and as long as i&#x27;ve used it, its always been grey and black, however, it has also always been a rather sturdy plastic container, which was not the case with the order i recieved.</li>
            <li>My most recent order has me confused though.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it smells fantastic</li>
            <li> This is basically a watered-down version of their glue, which I had purchased for a long time but wanted to try this one out.  </li>
            <li> However, I did still find some minor leakage in my package  despite the taping.  </li>
            <li> It holds my hair in place all day long and its not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I even tried with my hair dry.</li>
            <li> It was not only less expensive, but it was delivered at light speed.</li>
            <li> wash your hair, dry but leave damp and apply Got 2b, comb and let dry then brush hair that is already in place...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair like it used to, and the little red beads aren&#x27;t in there, I noticed.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that covers are taped closed..</li>
            <li> Have a thinning hair, and the gel holds it well without any fluff, or residue.</li>
            <li> but it was as I expected.</li>
            <li> Also, in regards to other reviews stating,</li>
            <li> This may help prevent leaks due to temperature changes causing product expansion and pressure leaks.</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount in hair.</li>
            <li> It works well on my hair and it is water soluble and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for reasons unknown, it is not available from stores in my area anymore</li>
            <li> No greasy residue matting your hair down.</li>
            <li> The gel seemed to be close but almost a little watered down, like upon opening the lid it would start coming out without me even squeezing it, which didn&#x27;t used to happen.</li>
            <li> Along with taping of the covers I would suggest supplier remove some of the air from the product  before closing tightly and securing with tape.</li>
            <li> The product was damaged, the container was flimsy, thin and not solid like ones I ordered in the past from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for the past three years.  </li>
            <li> It can be hard to find at retail stores and when I find it I buy it all.  </li>
            <li> One woman actually told me it smelt bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed it&#x27;s not the same</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Walgreens business model wonders me all the time - they decide to discontinue to carry items based on some irrelevant data and try other cheaper products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes very hard to find at Retail.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t wrap my head around why the bottle itself seemed so fake, scratching my head here.....</li>
            <li> But she was a cold fish anyway.</li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> This was just awful.</li>

            <li> I like this product very much. It works well on my hair and it is water soluble and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for reasons unknown, it is not available from stores in my area anymore so i am only able to&lt;br /&gt;purchase it over the internet.</li>
            <li> I got my order; they were wrapped in plastic bags and for good reason. One of them leaked so I had to wash off the container before using it. Other than that, they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for years and loved it. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more and was happy to find it on amazon. I would have given it 5 stars if I would have recived what was advertised. The bottles I recived don&#x27;t look like the one in the picture they are silver and black and cheaply made one has a crack in the side of it. The ingredients have changed from the bottle I purchased a while ago in a store which looks like the one in the picture advertised and what I thought I was getting. The new gel is a lot more watery and has a different smell to it. A not so pleasant smell. I&#x27;m disappointed it&#x27;s not the same and now I have three bottles of it. Boo!!</li>
            <li> This is basically a watered-down version of their glue, which I had purchased for a long time but wanted to try this one out.  Stick with the original:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Glued-Spiking-Glue-6-Ounce-Tubes/dp/B001G7QYY2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1432249355&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;got+2b+glued</li>
            <li> Great product overall. Gives great control for short to medium length hair not too stiff or plastic feeling. As far as the girl attraction goes, I cannot make any claims lol.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for the past three years.  Sometimes very hard to find at Retail. Just purchased 3 tubes from Amazon. The real difference with this gel is that it holds your hair in place with a quick pass thru the hair with your hands while your hair is damp.  Then if you let it dry in your hair, and style your hair afterward, it is a perfect hold.  This is the only gel that I buy....sure hope Got 2 B is not considering dropping it from the line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for years now and love it. My most recent order has me confused though. Someone in the review section said that the bottles didn&#x27;t look like the ones in the pic, well this part is true, they were grey and back, which actually is correct. I used to buy this product in drug stores when it was available, and as long as i&#x27;ve used it, its always been grey and black, however, it has also always been a rather sturdy plastic container, which was not the case with the order i recieved. Its hard to describe, but the bottles felt flimsy, almost like a type of really cheap plastic, or possibly even a foil like material, surely wasn&#x27;t the same as what i used to get from the store. Im not sure if these are the real deal or maybe some sort of knockoff version. The gel seemed to be close but almost a little watered down, like upon opening the lid it would start coming out without me even squeezing it, which didn&#x27;t used to happen. i can&#x27;t wrap my head around why the bottle itself seemed so fake, scratching my head here..... For the price though, it got the job done.</li>
            <li> I use this gel every morning.  I have tried many brands but this is simply the best.  It can be hard to find at retail stores and when I find it I buy it all.  Got 2b needs to make this more readily available.  This gel isn&#x27;t shiny or greasy looking when applied.</li>
            <li> Cannot find this in any store nowadays so I was relieved when I found it here. A nice medium hold gel. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great gel, ive been using it for 2-3 years now gives great texture, and a nice hold</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this product.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel. He won&#x27;t use any other kind after using this brand</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Got it for my husband, but ended up using it in a pinch. I love how it made my hair look and feel, however the scent is definitely for a man, lol.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it smells fantastic, it&#x27;s just a manly scent.</li>
            <li> I love this brand. Nomrally use the spiked variation... Because I spike my hair. This. This was just awful. It is like poring water into your hand. I even tried with my hair dry. No difference. When it pours out when you open it, it is obviously mainly water.  Also, in regards to other reviews stating, \\&quot;Great smell.\\&quot; If you mean by chemical smell, sure.</li>
            <li> The pheromones in the ingrediants has not helped to attract any women. One woman actually told me it smelt bad. But she was a cold fish anyway.</li>
            <li> I know that is has the pheromones in it, but man it does not smell good and really, the gel ain&#x27;t that good either. SO sorry that I bought three tubes after reading the good reviews. My bad.</li>
            <li> This is not the original formula.</li>
            <li> Girls luv these gel hands down the fresh smell.Highly recommend.Is really kind of shinny soft dnt glue ur hair or anything like that.</li>
            <li> good packaging, great price, why would you buy it anywhere else</li>
            <li> The product was damaged, the container was flimsy, thin and not solid like ones I ordered in the past from Amazon.</li>
            <li> gel works great, price seems more than fair and I like the fact that covers are taped closed.. I assume this is to prevent accidental opening/leaking during shipment. However, I did still find some minor leakage in my package  despite the taping.  Along with taping of the covers I would suggest supplier remove some of the air from the product  before closing tightly and securing with tape. This may help prevent leaks due to temperature changes causing product expansion and pressure leaks.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It holds my hair in place all day long and its not greasy.  Only need a small amount in hair.</li>
            <li> Initially I was introduced to this product at Walgreens pharmacy. Have a thinning hair, and the gel holds it well without any fluff, or residue. Unfortunately Walgreens business model wonders me all the time - they decide to discontinue to carry items based on some irrelevant data and try other cheaper products. I turned to Amazon instead - they do have great deals on this specific product. Would recommend to others (to guys:)).</li>
            <li> This hair gel is hands down the best on the market. No greasy residue matting your hair down. I&#x27;ve got nothing but compliments. It makes your hair SHINE! The store I used to get it at no longer carries it, so I was amazed when I found it here. It was not only less expensive, but it was delivered at light speed. Thank YOU!</li>
            <li> product is not the same as the ones bought in CVS. this is a lot more liquified.</li>
            <li> While a good deal this product did nothing for my hair. But hey I got a good deal can&#x27;t be sour</li>
            <li> I have not tried this product yet so don&#x27;t really know how I like it but it was as I expected.</li>
            <li> wash your hair, dry but leave damp and apply Got 2b, comb and let dry then brush hair that is already in place...your&lt;br /&gt;good for all day!</li>
            <li> This product that I just received (3 pack) is not the same formula that the company used to have, or this is a knock-off.  It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair like it used to, and the little red beads aren&#x27;t in there, I noticed.</li>
