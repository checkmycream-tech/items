            <li>I ordered these brushes and I must say that they are a great quality, they feel soft and work great to give you that professional look that you want.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and I have experienced no fall out.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality set at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>rather buy good quality brushes from Real Technique.</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist I own a ton of brushes, this Soobest set is right up there with Sigma and Mac.</li>
            <li>I love them, they are cheap in price without being cheap in quality.</li>
            <li>They allow for a lot of product pick up so you won&#x27;t need to have much on the brush which is awesome to not waste product.</li>
            <li>I took a star off because when they arrive they have a strong spray paint smell.</li>
            <li>They blend so beautifully the face brushes leave an air brushed face skin.</li>
            <li>the brushes were fine, it was just the brush roll itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super soft..  great product</li>
            <li>Okay first of all this brushes are a must have!.</li>
            <li>There are many brushes for many different uses and each brush comes in handy.  </li>
            <li>This kit is great for beginners who  want to experiment with different make-up styles.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush set, especially considering the price!</li>
            <li>The round kabuki blended my foundation flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Professional quality and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I love the foundation brush, it makes it so much easier to get a smooth look!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are really soft, and that can be a good thing, however, i done like my brushes this</li>
            <li>My favorite face brush from this set is the powder brush, it resembles the Real Techniques face brush, it is more dense and rounder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thery are so soft and really good in my skin.</li>
            <li>and it was the first thing I woke up to!!</li>
            <li>I found my new favorite!</li>
            <li>So I was lucky enough to get a discount code to try these brushes at a great cost.</li>
            <li>Super soft and the quality is right up there with my MAC brushes!!!!</li>
            <li>Love the carrying case, love the color of the brushes &amp; they&#x27;re very soft.</li>
            <li>I have recently begun wearing more makeup and quickly realized I did not have the right tools to apply makeup successfully.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just adorable, firstly, with its cute pink handles, and gorgeous storage bag.</li>
            <li>Additionally they work great with loose powders and compressed powers as well.</li>
            <li>I loveeeeeeee these brushes .. they come in this cool roll up makeup brush holder.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s really affordable (most brushes at Sephora/MAC etc,</li>
            <li>These honestly feel just as soft as the brushes I&#x27;ve felt there.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft brushes definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>They are impressively dense, soooo soft and they are the prettiest pink ever!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a new set for sure.</li>
            <li>I love that they are so soft!</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I wanted and needed !</li>
            <li>I love that they are super soft</li>
            <li>I ordered the set in pink and not only are they beautiful brushes but the quality blew me away!!</li>
            <li>I love the soft feathery feel of these brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so cute and soft.</li>
            <li>Every brush in this set is useful, I find myself using all of them.</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>I received them discounted through AMZ Review Trader, but they are worth every penny of the retail price.</li>
            <li>I love the color and they are so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The eye brushes are really good for blending in the crease, however, I think this set lacks a more flat and smaller eye brush.</li>
            <li>And shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>They are very soft, and the case is easy to pack and store.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft (which is particularly nice if you have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are extremely soft, making make-up application and blending so easy.</li>
            <li>This brush set makes it more convenient and easier to apply my makeup with the necessary tools!  </li>
            <li>I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li>It makes you feel like your name is CoCo;)....</li>
            <li>It comes in a cute bag, the only thing bugging me is the smell of plastic.</li>
            <li>Rest assured I will be buying more of these at regular price as well!</li>
            <li>used several of them this morning and did not notice any more bristles falling out than I would expect from a brush</li>
            <li>a day have a big handle to hold them  better.</li>
            <li>They are really recommendable products!</li>
            <li>liked that I received a small card that explained what each brush was used for and how to clean them.  </li>
            <li>Super soft!</li>
            <li>They do have a strong smell when you first open them almost like a paint thinner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t hold up as long as the brand name brushes</li>
            <li>The bristles are full and soft.</li>
            <li>- I have several high end brushes that shed more than these.  </li>
            <li>only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is the brush roll, mine smelled so strong (chemically scent)</li>
            <li>They do smell a little when you first open them, but a little cleaner and there good to good.</li>
            <li>they are soft yet strong with a wide selection of types of brushes available.</li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes is very high for the price.</li>
            <li>This brushes work really well.</li>
            <li>I love the storage bag and wide variety of brushes included.</li>
            <li>I got the pink and gold style one and love the color &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I can really smell it on the carrying case</li>
            <li>However the value was so much</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as dense as my morphe, but they hold product very well.</li>
            <li>The real kicker came when I used the foundation brush and no hairs where on my face.</li>
            <li>The case is retro and very compact.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>pink color just makes them very girly and cute.</li>
            <li>The dusty rose color is so girly and rich feeling.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush set especially if you travel alot and need something small to pack.</li>
            <li>There was a strange smell when I first opened the package, but it went away quickly after removing them from the box.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I am so amazed of the quality of these brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;They are super soft and sturdy, they glide in my skin smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So soft and looks exactly like the photos.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone needing a new set!</li>
            <li>I highly suggest these amazingly soft and pretty brushes.  </li>
            <li>The bristle seem decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The lucky ladies in my family will DEFINITELY be getting these brushes as stocking stuffers this year.</li>
            <li>The overall quality is OK for the big brushes.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes and high quality!</li>
            <li>and very soft!</li>
            <li>They are high quailty on par with her Mac.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a highly recommended makeup brush set.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup brush snob, so I am always scared when it comes to getting new brushes.</li>
            <li>They have absolutely fine quality bristles of the more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for in the past.</li>
            <li>a very strong plastic/chemical smell (which seems common in a lot of brush sets, regardless of price).</li>
            <li>These are high quality, professional brushes without a doubt.</li>
            <li>they are so very soft and give me a photo finish on my skin...</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and provide even application.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>I love the pink handles as well as the soft white and gold pouch they come in.  </li>
            <li>I also use the flat top kabuki brush for wet makeups like concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li>When I first open them up</li>
            <li>I love the case the brushes come in because it helps keep them organized (which helps since my bathroom is so small).  </li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>I had already intended to wash them so it was no trouble.</li>
            <li>They are so soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white with gold flowers very shiny.</li>
            <li>The brushes ate extremely soft.</li>
            <li>do they are so soft</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and apply makeup evenly.</li>
            <li>They are soft and dense and do not shed.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure that is due to being in a closed container for an extended time.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong when you first open them but is the white case , not the brushes, just open it for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>The small flat top for blending concealer does not blend well, product get stuck on the brush instead on blending it out on skin.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer these brushes over a very large portion of the ones I have owned previously and would recommenced these to anyone who needs to throw in a few extra face brushes into the rotation between cleanings (which surprisingly these hold up extremely well after cleanings, with no shedding).</li>
            <li>The carrying case is also very pretty and it comes with a little booklet that explains what each brush is used for.</li>
            <li>I am obsessed with how soft they are and how amazing they make my makeup go on.</li>
            <li>Once you open it and let them air out that completely goes away!,</li>
            <li>It left a natural look.</li>
            <li>The case these brushes came in is very convenient for travel or even slipping into your purse, book bag, or whatever.</li>
            <li>They are so dense, soft, blend well, distribute product evenly and has almost nothing left on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Although</li>
            <li>Very poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;The big ones are OK to use, but not well made like Real Technique.</li>
            <li>Brushes had a slight chemical smell from the carrying case when they first arrived</li>
            <li>These brushes not only came quick, but they are so thick and soft!</li>
            <li>They seem well put together, there were no loose hairs.</li>
            <li>As for how they work they blend very well and there is little fall out from them.</li>

            <li> most brushes</li>
            <li> I love the carrying case that they come in.  </li>
            <li> They are well balanced and I LOVE the case they come in.</li>
            <li> :) The picture is of my brushes and my liquid lipstick I ordered.</li>
            <li> I love them and will be adding them to my dealy use.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>

            <li> The brushes themselves are synthetic, super soft, and blend flawlessly.</li>
            <li> The best set I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, I got the pink ones, I love how they blend the make up</li>
            <li> Regardless, these brushes are absolutely fantastic and unlike many of the high dollar brushes I own, these do not shed!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes and I must say that they are a great quality, they feel soft and work great to give you that professional look that you want.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and I have experienced no fall out.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality set at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> rather buy good quality brushes from Real Technique.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I own a ton of brushes, this Soobest set is right up there with Sigma and Mac.</li>
            <li> I love them, they are cheap in price without being cheap in quality.</li>
            <li> They allow for a lot of product pick up so you won&#x27;t need to have much on the brush which is awesome to not waste product.</li>
            <li> I took a star off because when they arrive they have a strong spray paint smell.</li>
            <li> They blend so beautifully the face brushes leave an air brushed face skin.</li>
            <li> the brushes were fine, it was just the brush roll itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super soft..  great product</li>
            <li> Okay first of all this brushes are a must have!.</li>
            <li> There are many brushes for many different uses and each brush comes in handy.  </li>
            <li> This kit is great for beginners who  want to experiment with different make-up styles.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set, especially considering the price!</li>
            <li> The round kabuki blended my foundation flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Professional quality and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love the foundation brush, it makes it so much easier to get a smooth look!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are really soft, and that can be a good thing, however, i done like my brushes this</li>
            <li> My favorite face brush from this set is the powder brush, it resembles the Real Techniques face brush, it is more dense and rounder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thery are so soft and really good in my skin.</li>
            <li> and it was the first thing I woke up to!!</li>
            <li> I found my new favorite!</li>
            <li> So I was lucky enough to get a discount code to try these brushes at a great cost.</li>
            <li> Super soft and the quality is right up there with my MAC brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the carrying case, love the color of the brushes &amp; they&#x27;re very soft.</li>
            <li> I have recently begun wearing more makeup and quickly realized I did not have the right tools to apply makeup successfully.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just adorable, firstly, with its cute pink handles, and gorgeous storage bag.</li>
            <li> Additionally they work great with loose powders and compressed powers as well.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeeee these brushes .. they come in this cool roll up makeup brush holder.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s really affordable (most brushes at Sephora/MAC etc,</li>
            <li> These honestly feel just as soft as the brushes I&#x27;ve felt there.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft brushes definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> They are impressively dense, soooo soft and they are the prettiest pink ever!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering a new set for sure.</li>
            <li> I love that they are so soft!</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted and needed !</li>
            <li> I love that they are super soft</li>
            <li> I ordered the set in pink and not only are they beautiful brushes but the quality blew me away!!</li>
            <li> I love the soft feathery feel of these brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so cute and soft.</li>
            <li> Every brush in this set is useful, I find myself using all of them.</li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> I received them discounted through AMZ Review Trader, but they are worth every penny of the retail price.</li>
            <li> I love the color and they are so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eye brushes are really good for blending in the crease, however, I think this set lacks a more flat and smaller eye brush.</li>
            <li> And shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> They are very soft, and the case is easy to pack and store.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft (which is particularly nice if you have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are extremely soft, making make-up application and blending so easy.</li>
            <li> This brush set makes it more convenient and easier to apply my makeup with the necessary tools!  </li>
            <li> I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li> It makes you feel like your name is CoCo;)....</li>
            <li> It comes in a cute bag, the only thing bugging me is the smell of plastic.</li>
            <li> Rest assured I will be buying more of these at regular price as well!</li>
            <li> used several of them this morning and did not notice any more bristles falling out than I would expect from a brush</li>
            <li> a day have a big handle to hold them  better.</li>
            <li> They are really recommendable products!</li>
            <li> liked that I received a small card that explained what each brush was used for and how to clean them.  </li>
            <li> Super soft!</li>
            <li> They do have a strong smell when you first open them almost like a paint thinner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t hold up as long as the brand name brushes</li>
            <li> The bristles are full and soft.</li>
            <li> - I have several high end brushes that shed more than these.  </li>
            <li> only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is the brush roll, mine smelled so strong (chemically scent)</li>
            <li> They do smell a little when you first open them, but a little cleaner and there good to good.</li>
            <li> they are soft yet strong with a wide selection of types of brushes available.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is very high for the price.</li>
            <li> This brushes work really well.</li>
            <li> I love the storage bag and wide variety of brushes included.</li>
            <li> I got the pink and gold style one and love the color &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I can really smell it on the carrying case</li>
            <li> However the value was so much</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as dense as my morphe, but they hold product very well.</li>
            <li> The real kicker came when I used the foundation brush and no hairs where on my face.</li>
            <li> The case is retro and very compact.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> pink color just makes them very girly and cute.</li>
            <li> The dusty rose color is so girly and rich feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set especially if you travel alot and need something small to pack.</li>
            <li> There was a strange smell when I first opened the package, but it went away quickly after removing them from the box.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I am so amazed of the quality of these brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;They are super soft and sturdy, they glide in my skin smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So soft and looks exactly like the photos.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone needing a new set!</li>
            <li> I highly suggest these amazingly soft and pretty brushes.  </li>
            <li> The bristle seem decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The lucky ladies in my family will DEFINITELY be getting these brushes as stocking stuffers this year.</li>
            <li> The overall quality is OK for the big brushes.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes and high quality!</li>
            <li> and very soft!</li>
            <li> They are high quailty on par with her Mac.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a highly recommended makeup brush set.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup brush snob, so I am always scared when it comes to getting new brushes.</li>
            <li> They have absolutely fine quality bristles of the more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for in the past.</li>
            <li> a very strong plastic/chemical smell (which seems common in a lot of brush sets, regardless of price).</li>
            <li> These are high quality, professional brushes without a doubt.</li>
            <li> they are so very soft and give me a photo finish on my skin...</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and provide even application.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> I love the pink handles as well as the soft white and gold pouch they come in.  </li>
            <li> I also use the flat top kabuki brush for wet makeups like concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li> When I first open them up</li>
            <li> I love the case the brushes come in because it helps keep them organized (which helps since my bathroom is so small).  </li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> I had already intended to wash them so it was no trouble.</li>
            <li> They are so soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white with gold flowers very shiny.</li>
            <li> The brushes ate extremely soft.</li>
            <li> do they are so soft</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and apply makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> They are soft and dense and do not shed.  </li>
            <li> but I am sure that is due to being in a closed container for an extended time.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong when you first open them but is the white case , not the brushes, just open it for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> The small flat top for blending concealer does not blend well, product get stuck on the brush instead on blending it out on skin.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer these brushes over a very large portion of the ones I have owned previously and would recommenced these to anyone who needs to throw in a few extra face brushes into the rotation between cleanings (which surprisingly these hold up extremely well after cleanings, with no shedding).</li>
            <li> The carrying case is also very pretty and it comes with a little booklet that explains what each brush is used for.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with how soft they are and how amazing they make my makeup go on.</li>
            <li> Once you open it and let them air out that completely goes away!,</li>
            <li> It left a natural look.</li>
            <li> The case these brushes came in is very convenient for travel or even slipping into your purse, book bag, or whatever.</li>
            <li> They are so dense, soft, blend well, distribute product evenly and has almost nothing left on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Although</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;The big ones are OK to use, but not well made like Real Technique.</li>
            <li> Brushes had a slight chemical smell from the carrying case when they first arrived</li>
            <li> These brushes not only came quick, but they are so thick and soft!</li>
            <li> They seem well put together, there were no loose hairs.</li>
            <li> As for how they work they blend very well and there is little fall out from them.</li>
            <li> one complaint is the toxic smell when you first open them up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll replace my high end everyday brushes, but they will be my go</li>
            <li> these are cheap, but without those useless small brushes, you can get Real Technique for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only difference I have noticed are my higher end brushes are a little longer (not that these are short and hard to handle by any means), but that, for me personally, is not a flaw.</li>
            <li> Most brushes are stiff at first, then I was shocked that the brushes did not shed when I washed them.</li>
            <li> I will have to air it out for a long time</li>
            <li> I just left the case open and exposed the inside and brushes to air for a few days, and the smell has dissipated.</li>
            <li> My only con is that the smaller brushes are very wide and think making it hard to be in smaller areas of the eye.</li>
            <li> The card was small enough to keep with the brushes.</li>
            <li> They are dense enough to pack on the color without being to harsh.!</li>
            <li> However, I washed the brushes with dish soap and wiped the holder down with a wet rag and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not brave enough to order make up for her, but I felt same making this purchase.</li>
            <li> I also am not sure of the issues previous posters had with the smaller brushes, I had no issues with any of them so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t give off an odd odor like other brushes.</li>
            <li> There was a slight nail polish type smell</li>
            <li> The only downfall to these brushes would have to be that some of them look relatively similar so the pictures on the pamphlet are difficult to decipher which brush they are describing.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t typically use a brush case unless I travel.</li>
            <li> and I think the brushes just have a little smell from being in the case.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than getting a set of brushes only to have it leave bristles all over your face when you apply your makeup.</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive name brand set of brushes, and this set is very comparable.</li>
            <li> They have very little bristle fall out even after a severe scrubbjng.</li>
            <li> The small brushes  work well for concelers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use them everyday!</li>
            <li> handles are loose and about to come off (the section between the gold metal and pink wood).&lt;br /&gt;The smell is horrible as soon as I open the bag.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have so far is that when I opened the shipping container, I was greeted with a HORRIFIC smell....</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how soft they felt.</li>
            <li> The small ones for eyes are useless, it was too flimsy and did not pickup any product.</li>
            <li> I didnt get this,  lil bit expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the pattern of the case</li>
            <li> and I can compare them to the very expensive brand of the IT brushes.  </li>
            <li> they look very expensive!!!</li>

            <li> Ordered these for my wife and she loves them. I&#x27;m not brave enough to order make up for her, but I felt same making this purchase. They are high quailty on par with her Mac. Company products at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a MUA&#x27;s dream!! The case they come in is just beautiful. The brushes themselves are synthetic, super soft, and blend flawlessly. As a makeup artist I own a ton of brushes, this Soobest set is right up there with Sigma and Mac. There was no shedding during application, and no shedding during cleaning. These are high quality, professional brushes without a doubt. I can&#x27;t wait to order another set!</li>
            <li> This brushes work really well. They big brushes  work really good for foundations , compact powders. The small brushes  work well for concelers.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!!!! Super soft and the quality is right up there with my MAC brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the storage bag and wide variety of brushes included. Add a great rice and free Prime shipping and these makeup brushes cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeeee these brushes .. they come in this cool roll up makeup brush holder. they are soft yet strong with a wide selection of types of brushes available. I found my new favorite!</li>
            <li> These are amazing for the price! and very soft! I got the pink and gold style one and love the color &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have been shopping online for a set of good quality makeup brushes that werent gonna make me go bankrupt. I finally decided on this set and couldnt be happier. I ordered the set in pink and not only are they beautiful brushes but the quality blew me away!! I have ordered ALOT of things online and let me say this was by far my best purchase EVER!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft! I love the pink handles as well as the soft white and gold pouch they come in.  There are many brushes for many different uses and each brush comes in handy.  This brush set makes it more convenient and easier to apply my makeup with the necessary tools!  I love the soft feathery feel of these brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft (which is particularly nice if you have sensitive skin). The brushes don&#x27;t give off an odd odor like other brushes. Additionally they work great with loose powders and compressed powers as well. I also use the flat top kabuki brush for wet makeups like concealer and foundation. This kit is great for beginners who  want to experiment with different make-up styles. Not to mention it&#x27;s really affordable (most brushes at Sephora/MAC etc, are like $40-50 a brush) and these work just as well.</li>
            <li> Love the carrying case, love the color of the brushes &amp; they&#x27;re very soft. Have not used them yet since I just got them yesterday, so I will update after use. The paint smell is very strong I can really smell it on the carrying case and I think the brushes just have a little smell from being in the case.</li>
            <li> ive been getting so many compliments on my makeup!!! great for beginner contouring!! im in love they look very expensive!!! i will be buying in another color soon in case i lose one...i would fall over forever!!!</li>
            <li> Freakin&#x27; cute.!!! Nice and soft brushes definitely worth the money. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how nice these brushes are they come in a cute brush case and I love that they are so soft! I would for sure recommend these!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set, especially considering the price! It&#x27;s just adorable, firstly, with its cute pink handles, and gorgeous storage bag. The brushes themselves are extremely soft, making make-up application and blending so easy. They are much more dense than I would expect for this price. They are synthetic, so the couple of hairs that have shed from a couple of the brushes I would expect. The only negative I have so far is that when I opened the shipping container, I was greeted with a HORRIFIC smell....a very strong plastic/chemical smell (which seems common in a lot of brush sets, regardless of price). I suspect it came from the case, and not the brushes though. I just left the case open and exposed the inside and brushes to air for a few days, and the smell has dissipated. Overall, this is a great brush set for a great price. I recommend this to anyone needing a new set!</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing brushes! Really impressed in the quality especially for the cost!</li>
            <li> Brushes had a slight chemical smell from the carrying case when they first arrived but I removed the brushes and opened the case overnight and by morning the smell was fine.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these brushes are amazing. They have absolutely fine quality bristles of the more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for in the past. I use these daily with my mineral makeup and they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Super soft! The smell is a little strong when you first open them but is the white case , not the brushes, just open it for 5 minutes and that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, I got the pink ones, I love how they blend the make up and they&#x27;re great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great Brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of brushes and I was very impressed with these brushes.  They are a great value and I can compare them to the very expensive brand of the IT brushes.  I do have the IT brushes and these preformed the same.  However the value was so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the quality of the brushes - make-up went on the brushes easily and applied just as easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that I received a small card that explained what each brush was used for and how to clean them.  The card was small enough to keep with the brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these for review purposes but I am really impressed! They&#x27;re so cute and soft. There was a slight nail polish type smell but I think thats from the bag and I think it will fade.</li>
            <li> I love the quality and softness of these brushes! They are professional quality at a very good price! I would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality set at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good quality for the price. They have very little bristle fall out even after a severe scrubbjng. They aren&#x27;t as dense as my morphe, but they hold product very well. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll replace my high end everyday brushes, but they will be my go to travel brush set!!</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived today and I am beyond pleased! I have a very expensive name brand set of brushes, and this set is very comparable. Very soft brushes and high quality! The added brush case is also very elegant and folds for easy travel. I highly recommend this set. It even comes with a brochure explaining each brush and its use!</li>
            <li> Loved the quality of these!!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup brush snob, so I am always scared when it comes to getting new brushes. The thing is that my brushes at home where getting worn out and the handles where starting to peel. So I was lucky enough to get a discount code to try these brushes at a great cost. When I first open them up I was shocked at how soft they felt. Most brushes are stiff at first, then I was shocked that the brushes did not shed when I washed them. The real kicker came when I used the foundation brush and no hairs where on my face. It left a natural look. I will be ordering a new set for sure. If you are looking for a nice set of brushes do not look any longer then these!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft. The handle and metal look gorgeous together. The round kabuki blended my foundation flawlessly. Every brush in this set is useful, I find myself using all of them. I took a star off because when they arrive they have a strong spray paint smell. However, I washed the brushes with dish soap and wiped the holder down with a wet rag and the smell went away. I had already intended to wash them so it was no trouble. The quality of these brushes is very high for the price. So worth the money. I received them discounted through AMZ Review Trader, but they are worth every penny of the retail price. Sigma quality at drugstore prices.</li>
            <li> Very lovely set! Each brush is perfectly designed and blends flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes! I like the heft of the handles. The dusty rose color is so girly and rich feeling. It makes you feel like your name is CoCo;)....The bristles are soft and I have experienced no fall out. We&#x27;ll made! The case is retro and very compact.</li>
            <li> I have actually already received these brushes from a friend as a gift and I just made my very own purchase just now, of these brushes for another friend as a gift! I love them, they are cheap in price without being cheap in quality. These look and feel much better than some of the higher end brushes I own! The only difference I have noticed are my higher end brushes are a little longer (not that these are short and hard to handle by any means), but that, for me personally, is not a flaw. I actually prefer these brushes over a very large portion of the ones I have owned previously and would recommenced these to anyone who needs to throw in a few extra face brushes into the rotation between cleanings (which surprisingly these hold up extremely well after cleanings, with no shedding).</li>
            <li> Received my brushes yesterday. Very impressed by the quality. The bristles are full and soft. They allow for a lot of product pick up so you won&#x27;t need to have much on the brush which is awesome to not waste product. My only con is that the smaller brushes are very wide and think making it hard to be in smaller areas of the eye. If the set came with smaller tipped brushes I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The bristle seem decent quality for the price. It comes in a cute bag, the only thing bugging me is the smell of plastic. I will have to air it out for a long time</li>
            <li> These brushes are the BEST. I am obsessed with how soft they are and how amazing they make my makeup go on.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They are so soft.  They pick up a good amount of product.  I can&#x27;t wait to use them everyday!</li>
            <li> These brushes are phenomenal! The packaging they came in was adorable, something I wouldn&#x27;t mind to carry around. The case these brushes came in is very convenient for travel or even slipping into your purse, book bag, or whatever. The brushes came individually wrapped in plastic and they also came with a pamphlet explaining each of the brushes and their uses. The only downfall to these brushes would have to be that some of them look relatively similar so the pictures on the pamphlet are difficult to decipher which brush they are describing. Regardless, these brushes are absolutely fantastic and unlike many of the high dollar brushes I own, these do not shed! I repeat: THESE BRUSHES DO NOT SHED!!!!! Nothing worse than getting a set of brushes only to have it leave bristles all over your face when you apply your makeup. These brushes are extremely soft and my makeup went on flawlessly.  I cannot rave about these brushes enough. The lucky ladies in my family will DEFINITELY be getting these brushes as stocking stuffers this year. They are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this set at a discounted rate in exchanged for an unbiased review.  Rest assured I will be buying more of these at regular price as well! Love them!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes! Great quality and very soft!!! Also love their case to be able to keep them safe and all together</li>
            <li> I paid for 2 day shipping and it was the first thing I woke up to!! So soft and looks exactly like the photos. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet that&#x27;s why I put 4 stars but I expect great things. Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion. I love this set of brushes. They come in a beautiful bag with magnetic latches. It&#x27;s white with gold flowers very shiny. The brushes ate extremely soft. The best set I&#x27;ve had in a long time. A must have for any makeup Arsenal.</li>
            <li> love them they did shed a bit but most brushes do they are so soft</li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing! They are very soft, and the case is easy to pack and store. They are dense enough to pack on the color without being to harsh.! They do have a strong smell when you first open them almost like a paint thinner. However, that is just the packaging. Once you open it and let them air out that completely goes away!,</li>
            <li> These are beautiful brushes that are incredibly soft!! I love the carrying case that they come in.  Also the company is very easy to talk to and reach if you were to have any problems.  I highly suggest these amazingly soft and pretty brushes.  A great gift for any makeup guru!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are AMAZING! def. Professional quality and gorgeous. The case is gorgeous as well!</li>
            <li> I picked these up based on reviews in a makeup group I belong to. I am always on the hunt for good brushes but can&#x27;t get over the sticker shock of $50 each at Ulta/Sephora. These honestly feel just as soft as the brushes I&#x27;ve felt there. I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t hold up as long as the brand name brushes but I can buy 4 sets of these for the price of one brush there. They seem well put together, there were no loose hairs. They also came with a description of each brush and how to use it. They are well balanced and I LOVE the case they come in. It&#x27;s really cute and perfect for rolling up when you travel! I would definitely recommend these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is the toxic smell when you first open them up however they arrived while I was home on my lunch break so I left them open on the counter and by the time I returned home that night I couldn&#x27;t smell a thing.</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazing! I love them and recommend to anyone, would deff get more products from this company!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!  I have recently begun wearing more makeup and quickly realized I did not have the right tools to apply makeup successfully.  These brushes arrived yesterday and I could not wait to try them out this morning.  There was a strange smell when I first opened the package, but it went away quickly after removing them from the box.  I love the case the brushes come in because it helps keep them organized (which helps since my bathroom is so small).  The pattern of the case is cute too!  And there is a flap that protects the brushes and keeps them in the holders for storage which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used several of them this morning and did not notice any more bristles falling out than I would expect from a brush - I have several high end brushes that shed more than these.  I also am not sure of the issues previous posters had with the smaller brushes, I had no issues with any of them so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great set, and although I received a discount for this review, I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes. Great quality, and blends makeup well. The case is cute and holds all the brushes nicely.The case itself has an odor to it (like plastic) but I am sure that is due to being in a closed container for an extended time.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, soft and look really nice! I love the foundation brush, it makes it so much easier to get a smooth look! And shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I really liked these brushes. They&#x27;re very soft and work great! I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the pattern of the case but I don&#x27;t typically use a brush case unless I travel. It was great that there was a description card included describing each brush. Very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set especially if you travel alot and need something small to pack. The bristles are so soft and apply makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> I love them!!  Super soft..  great product</li>
            <li> Not the best set of brushes I owen, but they are not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are really soft, and that can be a good thing, however, i done like my brushes this soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> cheapest thing ever made and they suck!</li>
            <li> The brushes are awesome...they are so very soft and give me a photo finish on my skin...I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> These are great! I love the color and they are so soft. The case they come in is so convenient. Great price and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> So incredibly happy! These brushes not only came quick, but they are so thick and soft! I&#x27;d compare them to Mac! Amazing quality:) The picture is of my brushes and my liquid lipstick I ordered. I am a makeup artist, and it&#x27;s so nice getting a good set of brushes for a good price.</li>
            <li> Wow, I am so amazed of the quality of these brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;They are super soft and sturdy, they glide in my skin smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;The face brushes distributes my foundation neatly, making it look like it was airbrushed.&lt;br /&gt;The face brushes are also very dense, they pick up a good amount of product and they blend my makeup beautifully. My favorite face brush from this set is the powder brush, it resembles the Real Techniques face brush, it is more dense and rounder.&lt;br /&gt;The pink color just makes them very girly and cute. They look so nice in my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes are really good for blending in the crease, however, I think this set lacks a more flat and smaller eye brush. All of the brushes didnt shed on me when I washed them. They remained intact and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is the brush roll, mine smelled so strong (chemically scent) the brushes were fine, it was just the brush roll itself.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a highly recommended makeup brush set. The price is amazing and you get more of what you pay for. I used a promo code to purchase this for testing.</li>
            <li> I received these makeup brushes for the purposes of reviewing them. I love that they are super soft a day have a big handle to hold them  better. They do smell a little when you first open them, but a little cleaner and there good to good. As for how they work they blend very well and there is little fall out from them. I love them and will be adding them to my dealy use.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes and I must say that they are a great quality, they feel soft and work great to give you that professional look that you want. I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really loved the brushes ! They were exactly what I wanted and needed !</li>
            <li> love the brushes they are extremely soft and cute!!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.Thery are so soft and really good in my skin.They are really recommendable products!</li>
            <li> I didnt get this,  lil bit expensive for me. But i still like it thought</li>
            <li> These are great! They come in a beautiful case (that smells of plastic from packaging) that is going to be amazing for travel. I have a Sigma Kabuki set VERY similar to this set and I have to say, I am VERY impressed with this set. They are impressively dense, soooo soft and they are the prettiest pink ever! They are great quality, I haven&#x27;t had any shedding and they are very sturdy when i tug at them. This was an awesome purchase and I am so glad I got them!</li>
            <li> The overall quality is OK for the big brushes. The small ones for eyes are useless, it was too flimsy and did not pickup any product. The small flat top for blending concealer does not blend well, product get stuck on the brush instead on blending it out on skin. Very poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;The big ones are OK to use, but not well made like Real Technique. Although it is soft, but it was not straight or uniformly cut if that makes sense, it was crooked and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;The handles are loose and about to come off (the section between the gold metal and pink wood).&lt;br /&gt;The smell is horrible as soon as I open the bag. Very strong plastic chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather buy good quality brushes from Real Technique. They are so dense, soft, blend well, distribute product evenly and has almost nothing left on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Although these are cheap, but without those useless small brushes, you can get Real Technique for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes at a fraction of the price of name brand brushes.  I definitely recommend!  They are soft and dense and do not shed.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> This set is amazing! The bristles are very soft and provide even application. The carrying case is also very pretty and it comes with a little booklet that explains what each brush is used for.</li>
            <li> Okay first of all this brushes are a must have!. They blend so beautifully the face brushes leave an air brushed face skin.</li>
