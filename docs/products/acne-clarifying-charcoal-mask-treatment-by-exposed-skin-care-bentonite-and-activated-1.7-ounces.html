            <li>The Exposed Clarifying Masque is a great product to help clear up skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the tube lasts for a good while, depending on the user.</li>
            <li>product is really good, I apply this onto my face 2 a week as directed and my face feels soo much smoother and the appearence just looks fantastic</li>
            <li>that now I can truely go out with a sme on my face :)</li>
            <li>But all the products work so well together and are so gentle yet effective on your skin.</li>
            <li>but when I do use it, I am satisfied and feels fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to this one, and I have seen it going for about $7 - $10.</li>
            <li>I found the mask to be very useful in the war against acne.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week to help reduce oil and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>

            <li>This product is a great add on to the basic kit, used every second weeks the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>you are a true life saver</li>
            <li>As some other reviews have mentioned, I too use this produce 1 to 2 times per week with great results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that exciting for the price.</li>
            <li>I researched and discovered Exposed Skincare products, and they have really helped her complexion tremendously.  </li>
            <li>For a charcoal purifying facial mask that&#x27;s not overpriced, yet works very effectively, try the Giovanni D:Tox System Purifying Facial Mask.</li>
            <li>And acne tends to disappear very fast.</li>
            <li>After using it once my skin was soft and smooth</li>
            <li>THANKS EXPOSED!</li>
            <li>The refund policy is strictly for ordering a first time kit.</li>
            <li>The texture of the product is not overly thick, but provides a nice consistency and is easy to apply to the areas that are recommended on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It appears to be a sort of clay based mask, which gently absorbs oil and dirt from the pores, reducing the appearance of blackheads and matyifying the skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff really reduces breakouts.</li>
            <li>Now I feel confident that the products will help me keep any future outbreaks under control and clear the damage as if it never happened.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my skin feeling extra clean and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not a mask person (dries out my skin too much), but I decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>I have used lots of facial masks before; however, this mask really reduces acne and you can instantly feel the smooth skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>This mask has been very beneficial and helps to clear up any pimples that may be there.</li>
            <li>I have used every Exposed product and most recently ordered the Clarifying Mask, which I have only used once so far.</li>
            <li>This mask caused my face to be more oily afterwards and to break out- more than other masks I&#x27;ve tried with various other brands.</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally oily and this helps a ton!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>Usually buy a few at a time and take advantage of their great coupon offers they have from time to time.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with other product lines drying out my skin but have had nothing but tremendous results with the exposed product line.</li>
            <li>After I use it my skin feels clean and less oily in the t-zone.</li>
            <li>As someone who has sensitive skin and worries about different products causing breakouts, I am naturally very hesitant about the kinds of things I use.</li>
            <li>This product is really all about instant gratification for me!</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the fact that the clarifying mask does not have a fragrance, but smell natural and not offensive.</li>
            <li>Cure\\&quot; because it dried up my most recent acne outbreak within 12 hours without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>And using it for long term can really help acne.</li>
            <li>I feared that the marks left by the summer outbreak would be permanent but they have faded to nothing thanks to my subsequent use of Exposed Skin Care products.</li>
            <li>We tried several products, but she has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Since then, I have tried every over-the-counter and prescription product available on the market, but the prescription products especially were too harsh for my skin and dried out my face so much that I felt like I was wearing a mask.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that it helps reduce future breakouts especially in these areas as well as helps to clear up existing blackheads.  </li>

            <li> My daughter is 13, and she started having acne issues about a year ago.  We tried several products, but she has sensitive skin and they were too harsh.  I researched and discovered Exposed Skincare products, and they have really helped her complexion tremendously.  Her two favorite Exposed Skincare products are the \\&quot;Clarifying Mask\\&quot; and \\&quot;Probiotic Complex\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love this! I have always struggled with Acne, and have previously had to be on antibiotics to control it, but I wanted to be off them, so I tried the exposed skin care line (wash, serum, tonic and cream) and it kept my skin in line, but I still had some acne. I purchased this and use it twice a week, and I have got to say, that this works!! My skin is naturally oily and this helps a ton! I will keep using this and the exposed skin line. The price is worth it!</li>
            <li> This clarifying mask is only average as facial masks go. it didn&#x27;t cause any reactions or bad effects, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference either. It&#x27;s not that exciting for the price. For a charcoal purifying facial mask that&#x27;s not overpriced, yet works very effectively, try the Giovanni D:Tox System Purifying Facial Mask.

            <li> I use the Clarifying Mask once a week and I can&#x27;t imagine my life without it! This product is really all about instant gratification for me! My skin tone looks more even and radiant after using it! I depend on and trust the Clarifying Mask.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. It goes head-to-toe with the Proactive Clarifying Mask. I like that I can wear it around the house for a little while, without my facial oils overtaking the mask and causing a big wet mess on my face. It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the tube lasts for a good while, depending on the user. It has helped the clarity of my skin!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! After using it once my skin was soft and smooth and it also cleaned out my pores. I have had problems with other product lines drying out my skin but have had nothing but tremendous results with the exposed product line. THANKS EXPOSED!</li>
            <li> All the Products work great !</li>
            <li> I have suffered from \\&quot;uncomplicated\\&quot; facial acne since the age of 11. Since then, I have tried every over-the-counter and prescription product available on the market, but the prescription products especially were too harsh for my skin and dried out my face so much that I felt like I was wearing a mask. This past summer, after a horrifying outbreak of cystic acne, which I have never suffered from before, I started using the Exposed products and what a difference they have made! I feared that the marks left by the summer outbreak would be permanent but they have faded to nothing thanks to my subsequent use of Exposed Skin Care products. Now I feel confident that the products will help me keep any future outbreaks under control and clear the damage as if it never happened. The products are gentle on my skin and have eliminated, in addition to the worst of my acne, the flaky, dry skin and redness that used to plague me as a result of using other products.  I have used every Exposed product and most recently ordered the Clarifying Mask, which I have only used once so far. Even so, I have already renamed it the \\&quot;Miracle Cure\\&quot; because it dried up my most recent acne outbreak within 12 hours without drying out my skin. But all the products work so well together and are so gentle yet effective on your skin. I have never before used any other acne products that have not had the undesirable side effect of drying out my skin, and I never will again. Thank you Exposed, for the research you have put into developing such a terrific formula!</li>
            <li> The clarifying mask does a great job of cleaning out pores. After I use it my skin feels clean and less oily in the t-zone. I would definitely recommend using some facial lotion after using this product. Also, use of the product should not be every day, but once a week so that the skin does not get dried out. I also appreciate the fact that the clarifying mask does not have a fragrance, but smell natural and not offensive. The texture of the product is not overly thick, but provides a nice consistency and is easy to apply to the areas that are recommended on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Brought this product after I had a few extra pounds in my pocket and instead of spending it on something that I wont benefit from I drcided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thid product is really good, I apply this onto my face 2 a week as directed and my face feels soo much smoother and the appearence just looks fantastic, my friends say that I look soo well and good that now I can truely go out with a sme on my face :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Exposed you are a true life saver</li>
            <li> I have used lots of facial masks before; however, this mask really reduces acne and you can instantly feel the smooth skin afterwards. And using it for long term can really help acne. I no longer see big red acne. And acne tends to disappear very fast. Good luck to all of you! This has improved my life a lot.</li>
            <li> This mask caused my face to be more oily afterwards and to break out- more than other masks I&#x27;ve tried with various other brands. Be careful of their return policy- all individual items that have been opened are not refundable. So if you try this mask and don&#x27;t like it- you won&#x27;t be getting your money back. The refund policy is strictly for ordering a first time kit.</li>
            <li> As some other reviews have mentioned, I too use this produce 1 to 2 times per week with great results.  The clarifying mask helps especially in drying up oily areas around the nose and forehead.  I have also noticed that it helps reduce future breakouts especially in these areas as well as helps to clear up existing blackheads.  I would definitely recommend this product as a supplement to use in conjunction with the other Exposed products.</li>
            <li> A great product! I use it one to two times a week after washing. It always leaves my skin feeling extra clean and vibrant. A perfect addition to any medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> The Exposed Clarifying Mask is one of my favorite products. I use it about once a week, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean. As someone who has sensitive skin and worries about different products causing breakouts, I am naturally very hesitant about the kinds of things I use. This mask has been very beneficial and helps to clear up any pimples that may be there. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This mask is just what I have been searching for. I use it twice a week along with the regular Exposed Skin Care regimen and it helps to control my oily face and acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not a mask person (dries out my skin too much), but I decided to give this one a try.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.  It also helped to dry out other stubborn acne spots.  Very good buy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it all the time just for budget reasons but when I do use it, I am satisfied and feels fresh.</li>
            <li> This product is a great add on to the basic kit, used every second weeks the results are amazing. Usually buy a few at a time and take advantage of their great coupon offers they have from time to time.</li>
            <li> The Exposed Clarifying Masque is a great product to help clear up skin. I use it about once a week to help reduce oil and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean. A little bit of this product goes a long way. Definitely recommend this product for people with oily skin and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was just using the basic kit, but I decided to try this as well and this stuff really reduces breakouts. My skin feels much better after using it. I have found that twice a week is optimal.</li>
