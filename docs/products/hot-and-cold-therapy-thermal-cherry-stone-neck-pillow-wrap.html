            <li>AS IT IS SUPERIOR AS A HEAT PACK.</li>
            <li>Soooo nice and smells so good too.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Thought I would get her a nice one, so I read all the reviews.</li>
            <li>This is really nicely made, but my wife didn&#x27;t like the feel of the cherry stones inside the canvas.</li>
            <li>so nice.</li>
            <li>It stays warm for about 15 minutes if heated for 2 minutes in the microwave.</li>
            <li>I like it, though I have to warm it twice.</li>
            <li>Keeps me nice and warm at night during the winter.  </li>
            <li>filler material doesn&#x27;t seem to be effective.  </li>
            <li>(she lays it across her stomach and it keeps her warm).</li>
            <li>Yes, this is a super product that retains warmth, looks great, and has a nice weight  to it.    </li>
            <li>Our aging device is better than that.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the cherry stone is so nice you really enjoy the time you are using this cushion...</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, (gentle cherry scent) and makes a fabulous sound like a rain stick when moved.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>There is NO scent, which can aggravate headaches more, so that is also a plus.</li>
            <li>eventually you associate that smell with feeling better.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, this is an excellent product and if you suffer from head suture migraines</li>
            <li>I like the smell too, cherries :)</li>
            <li>No horrible cherry pit smell when you heat this pack for your aches and pains.</li>
            <li>- Made in the USA&amp;#34; instead, which she is enjoying.</li>
            <li>Significantly better heating ability than lavender warmers.</li>
            <li>she says this one is not form fitting and isn&#x27;t that comfortable.</li>
            <li>At best, heating this for two and a half minutes in 1000 watt</li>
            <li>This pack is great for headaches, neck, shoulder or back pain.</li>
            <li>The pillow curves comfortably around the neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>The light cherry aroma was to be a bonus.  </li>
            <li>There is no other good application for this product, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>I liked the fabric on their former wrap much better.</li>
            <li>The first time it cools off quick, after another warm up it stays hot a bit longer.</li>
            <li>Microwave gets it very hot -</li>
            <li>but it is well worth the benefit you get from it.</li>
            <li>I do use the pillow because I&#x27;m determined to get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I got this because I always have pain on my right shoulder since I do a lot of work on it like using the computer mouse &amp; carrying my purse.</li>
            <li>wonderful pillow to heal everything from a stiff neck to an aching back and any sore belly...</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my wife to replace her 15+ year old rice filled neck warmer.</li>
            <li>Picked up the first one in the gift shop of our hospital</li>
            <li>* is because it smells funny when it gets heated, like rotten bread or yeast, which I don&#x27;t think is even close to cherry.</li>
            <li>This cherry pit heating pack works exactly as it says it will.  </li>
            <li>Just makes me think of a hot mouthful of cherry pits that haven&#x27;t been spit out yet</li>
            <li>Be aware that it is NOT aromatherapy (per se) unless you like the smell of baked bread when heated.</li>
            <li>The pillow stays hot a lng time.</li>
            <li>Works as intended but smells funny.</li>
            <li>and WOW is all I can say!!!!</li>
            <li>The advertisement clearly states that the casing is full of cherry stones</li>
            <li>Very clever.  </li>
            <li>They are sorta chunky and large.</li>
            <li>It was to replace a home made product using field corn which my wife has used for ten years and, although it still functions fine, it is very worn.  </li>
            <li>High recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be so lumpy and noisy.  </li>
            <li>Better than any other product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it as a 60th birthday present for my wife, selecting it in part because it was high priced and had a few good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I actually like this new one better as there are two seams about a third of the way in from each end</li>
            <li>Found the exact one, made by the same company.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the same one but with a cover.  </li>
            <li>An old fashioned hot water bottle lasts ten times longer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cherry pits do not retain heat significantly longer  - IMO - than previous flax-seed based neck bolster</li>
            <li>It holds heat or cold for a long time and the mild cherry smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great for aches and pains cold or hot for the neck, high or low back pain or as a heat pack for &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; cramps.</li>
            <li>Holds heat and cold for a while love the sound of the cherry pits and the smell.</li>
            <li>It was the last thing I expected to find there-and was fortunate I did because I was on vacation and was in the throes of a headache.</li>
            <li>Natural product.</li>
            <li>It arrived so fast that it was actually here before I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I heat it up for my 84 yr old mother when she comes over</li>
            <li>I Use it all the time, it has literally taken the place of all of my other hot pads.</li>
            <li>HOLDS THE HEAT BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE USED IN THE PAST!!</li>
            <li>The pain is  now barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Only difference is my old one is a different color.  </li>

            <li> Only difference is my old one is a different color.  </li>
            <li> The neck pillow holds hard cherry pits so it&#x27;s not the kind of thing you&#x27;d want to put behind your back.  </li>
            <li> A long time ago I purchased this same neck wrap from a company and wanted to get another, as my family members were always fighting over the one we have.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use the pillow for cold therapy</li>
            <li> It can also be used for knee or other various aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I have even used it on my feet to warm them up on a cold night!</li>
            <li> We heated it as recommended and applied it and less than five minutes later it had lost its heat.  </li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I got sick of the herbal-type fragrances in many other products.  </li>
            <li> The other reason is because there are small bead-like balls inside the thermal &amp; once you take out the thermal from the container, the beads run off to either ends of the triangle leaving the middle part which goes around the neck empty.</li>
            <li> &amp; I can imagine using it on other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> Holds heat extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have never used this cold, but we microwave it all the time and it helps tremendously with sore necks/shoulders.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five, was the smell.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she did not like it, saying that it was too short to wrap around completely and too hard.  </li>
            <li> Feels like there are small rocks inside...</li>
            <li> and I like the way that the stones can be filtered through the seams which allows you to make the center compartment as thick or thin as you like.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the cold only lasts 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I DO NOT FEEL LIKE IT GETS COLD ENOUGH TO USE AS A COLD PACK</li>
            <li> uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try it as a cold</li>
            <li> It has weight to it and holds heat (and cold) like crazy.  </li>
            <li> So we returned the cherry stone wrap and bought her the &amp;#34;Aromatherapy Herbal &amp; Lavender - Microwave and Cold</li>
            <li> but I wish I had gotten a softer one that could hold the cold.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Performs as expected. Delivery time as estimated.&lt;br /&gt;Cherry pits do not retain heat significantly longer  - IMO - than previous flax-seed based neck bolster I had. At best, heating this for two and a half minutes in 1000 watt Microwave gets it very hot - but it looses heat over twenty-minutes to the point it needs heating again.</li>
            <li> This pack is great for headaches, neck, shoulder or back pain. It holds heat or cold for a long time and the mild cherry smell is pleasant. The pillow curves comfortably around the neck and shoulders. It can also be used for knee or other various aches and pains. 5 star product!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife to replace her 15+ year old rice filled neck warmer. Thought I would get her a nice one, so I read all the reviews. This is really nicely made, but my wife didn&#x27;t like the feel of the cherry stones inside the canvas. They are sorta chunky and large. She was bummed but we are returning it. Feels like there are small rocks inside... she likes to heat it up and lean back on it while reading or watching TV...she says this one is not form fitting and isn&#x27;t that comfortable.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a super product that retains warmth, looks great, and has a nice weight  to it.    High recommend!</li>
            <li> This product does not hold heat as thermal treatment products must.  I purchased it as a 60th birthday present for my wife, selecting it in part because it was high priced and had a few good reviews.  It was to replace a home made product using field corn which my wife has used for ten years and, although it still functions fine, it is very worn.  The light cherry aroma was to be a bonus.  We heated it as recommended and applied it and less than five minutes later it had lost its heat.  An old fashioned hot water bottle lasts ten times longer.  Our aging device is better than that.  There is no other good application for this product, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> wonderful pillow to heal everything from a stiff neck to an aching back and any sore belly... The smell of the cherry stone is so nice you really enjoy the time you are using this cushion...</li>
            <li> My mom loves this. Picked up the first one in the gift shop of our hospital and she said it was the best thing for her neck stiffness. Found this as a replacement for Mothers Day.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Just like the Aveda one I was looking for. Holds heat and cold for a while love the sound of the cherry pits and the smell.</li>
            <li> Natural product. Smells wonderful, (gentle cherry scent) and makes a fabulous sound like a rain stick when moved. Heats up in 2 minutes in microwave; Great for &amp;#34;computer neck&amp;#34; pain, and for warming up a bed. Love these. This is my second. Have given for gifts. Highly recommend. It arrived so fast that it was actually here before I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in a tourist trap in Copper Harbor, Michigan. It was the last thing I expected to find there-and was fortunate I did because I was on vacation and was in the throes of a headache. I brought it back to our cabin and heated it up in the microwave and WOW is all I can say!!!! I Use it all the time, it has literally taken the place of all of my other hot pads. It works GREAT on my head. The shape of it is perfect for your head, neck and shoulders. It contours and wraps around perfectly and it holds the heat so nice. Yes, you need to reheat it every 15 minutes or so but it is well worth the benefit you get from it. There is NO scent, which can aggravate headaches more, so that is also a plus. Like another reviewer wrote, the scent is like cherry pits warmed up and eventually you associate that smell with feeling better. Overall, for the price, this is an excellent product and if you suffer from head suture migraines it is a must have!!</li>
            <li> I got this because I always have pain on my right shoulder since I do a lot of work on it like using the computer mouse &amp; carrying my purse. This thermal pack works well to relieve the neck pain &amp; I can imagine using it on other parts of the body. It stays warm for about 15 minutes if heated for 2 minutes in the microwave. I didn&#x27;t try it as a cold pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave it 4* is because it smells funny when it gets heated, like rotten bread or yeast, which I don&#x27;t think is even close to cherry. The other reason is because there are small bead-like balls inside the thermal &amp; once you take out the thermal from the container, the beads run off to either ends of the triangle leaving the middle part which goes around the neck empty.</li>
            <li> A long time ago I purchased this same neck wrap from a company and wanted to get another, as my family members were always fighting over the one we have.  I searched on Amazon and AHA!  Found the exact one, made by the same company.  Only difference is my old one is a different color.  I actually like this new one better as there are two seams about a third of the way in from each end and it keeps the pits from all bunching up in the middle or ends.  Very clever.  I have never used this cold, but we microwave it all the time and it helps tremendously with sore necks/shoulders.  I have even used it on my feet to warm them up on a cold night!</li>
            <li> I like it, though I have to warm it twice. The first time it cools off quick, after another warm up it stays hot a bit longer. I like the smell too, cherries :)</li>
            <li> Great quality material.  No horrible cherry pit smell when you heat this pack for your aches and pains.</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  This cherry pit heating pack works exactly as it says it will.  My only complaint, and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five, was the smell.  Which I can&#x27;t get used to. Just makes me think of a hot mouthful of cherry pits that haven&#x27;t been spit out yet</li>
            <li> Keeps me nice and warm at night during the winter.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.</li>
            <li> I received one of these in an Aveda gift box years ago, but without a name-brand attached. This is exactly the same one but with a cover.  The neck pillow holds hard cherry pits so it&#x27;s not the kind of thing you&#x27;d want to put behind your back.  It&#x27;s for your shoulders and neck.  It has weight to it and holds heat (and cold) like crazy.  Better than any other product I have tried.  I have fibromyalgia and it relaxes my shoulders.  I highly recommend it.  I have given them as gifts and everyone has loved them.  Be aware that it is NOT aromatherapy (per se) unless you like the smell of baked bread when heated. I do.  I got sick of the herbal-type fragrances in many other products.  After a while the fragrance reminds one of health and wholeness, and it is so welcomed!</li>
            <li> I bought this, based on reviews, as a Christmas gift for my mom, who wanted a cold/warm wrap for her neck.  Unfortunately, she did not like it, saying that it was too short to wrap around completely and too hard.  So we returned the cherry stone wrap and bought her the &amp;#34;Aromatherapy Herbal &amp; Lavender - Microwave and Cold (Neck Pillow, Scented-12 Herbs) - Made in the USA&amp;#34; instead, which she is enjoying.</li>
            <li> relaxing, soothing, stress relieving and ideal for someone like me that has head aces all the time. Soooo nice and smells so good too.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it.  filler material doesn&#x27;t seem to be effective.  won&#x27;t hold the heat.  uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I keep one in the freezer and two for the microwave. Great for aches and pains cold or hot for the neck, high or low back pain or as a heat pack for &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; cramps.</li>
            <li> I had a severe neck pain. A heating pad reduced the pain somewhat but with the Cherry Stone Neck Pillow the recovery has been remarkable. The pain is  now barely noticeable. I use an elastic band to keep the pillow close to my neck. The pillow stays hot a lng time. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this neck pillow because I wanted something I could heat and chill.  The advertisement clearly states that the casing is full of cherry stones but I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be so lumpy and noisy.  It sounds like one of those native rain stick with the rocks inside.  I mostly use the pillow for cold therapy so I keep it in the freezer until I need it.  Unfortunately the cold only lasts 10-15 minutes.  I added a strap to the opening because it kept falling off my neck.  Several people commented on the smell which is described as a cherry smell, but to me, it smells like yeast.  I do use the pillow because I&#x27;m determined to get my money&#x27;s worth but I wish I had gotten a softer one that could hold the cold.</li>
            <li> I liked the fabric on their former wrap much better.</li>
            <li> Holds heat extremely well. smells a bit like cherry pits, but what do you expect? Significantly better heating ability than lavender warmers.</li>
            <li> The best one I have owned. Quality product.</li>
            <li> It helps me alot with my neck pain - Works the purpose - thank you!</li>
            <li> HOLDS THE HEAT BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE USED IN THE PAST!! I DO NOT FEEL LIKE IT GETS COLD ENOUGH TO USE AS A COLD PACK THOUGH. BUT STILL RATING A FIVE STAR AS IT IS SUPERIOR AS A HEAT PACK.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I bought this for my neck. Retains heat and I like the way that the stones can be filtered through the seams which allows you to make the center compartment as thick or thin as you like. I heat it up for my 84 yr old mother when she comes over (she lays it across her stomach and it keeps her warm).</li>
            <li> Works as intended but smells funny.</li>
