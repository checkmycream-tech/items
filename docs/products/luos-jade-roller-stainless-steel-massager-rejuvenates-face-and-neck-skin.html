            <li>I had ordered one of these rollers about a year ago from another company and it was, and still is in good condition.</li>
            <li>It feels good.</li>
            <li>The quality of the jade is not so good.</li>
            <li>I will just glue it and continue to use it cuz it feels good.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will do some good.  </li>
            <li>Using it on the jaw and jaw-joint area felt ever-so good.</li>

            <li>Great price for a handy tool.</li>
            <li>Works good as I can tell.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good quality product for the price.</li>

            <li>but I don&#x27;t think this is good for the face.</li>
            <li>I notice a difference on my skin--younger looking--and it feels good on my sinuses.  </li>

            <li>because they tell her that she looks more refreshed!</li>
            <li>This roller feels amazing.</li>
            <li>The jade roller is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>The speed of shipping was amazing.</li>
            <li>The roller itself feels nice on the face and neck.</li>
            <li>it is a nice stone but for those people that use the healing properties of stones it may make a difference in their choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually liked the product.</li>
            <li>nice i use it under my chin fat to roll off ha</li>
            <li>The roller didn&#x27;t seem to help much with my acne, but if you want to try and contour your face, this is the perfect product for that.</li>
            <li>gives nice cooling feeling though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to use in the morning after i&#x27;ve washed my face but still feel bit \\&quot;congested\\&quot; and i want to get a bit of blood flowing to my face.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this jade roller, I highly recommend for a lymphatic massage.</li>
            <li>Works great if you use it right!</li>
            <li>I liked this more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li>for me, i personally love it because i suffer from skin problems from hormones, and this is a really nice addition to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>For the most part, my order through Amazon was easy and the products were good.</li>
            <li>The roller feels cool to the touch and just feels good to use.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>These were nice stocking stuffers for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect much more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to give the 3 I ordered from this company as gifts.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product now.</li>
            <li>and I love it for the price, however as soon as I got it</li>
            <li>So smooth for the face!</li>
            <li>I found an adhesive for stone/glass/tile/metal and was able to reattach the end.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li>I am usually pleased with my Amazon purchases, but this one falls way below the mark.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the quality was there.</li>
            <li>They need better glue to set these with and need to drill all the way through the jade in the roller area so that they don&#x27;t keep popping out.</li>
            <li>This is okay for the price</li>
            <li>But the seller returned the amount that I paid so it is okay.</li>
            <li>Love the roller</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears that most jade rollers can be hit or miss no matter what Company you purchase from.</li>
            <li>Love the item, but one of the rollers came disconnected from the handle bar.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Il be getting more for gifts.</li>
            <li>Love my jade roller.</li>
            <li>The jade roller feels great and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>It came in perfect condition though the handle/center seems to be a different</li>
            <li>Nice but cheap and broke after a month or so</li>
            <li>nice and cool love the way it feels on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you always clean all of your beauty products (dish soap + water is a good way to clean).</li>
            <li>Love this, puts on face products easy, plus when I have sinus pressure it helps relieve it by rolling and putting pressure on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It is OK, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>the jade stays very cool</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference at this point, but I believe my face muscles feel more relaxed after using it.</li>
            <li>it is however grand for a light roller to keep in your toiletry bag for weekends away or when out and about.</li>
            <li>Good product helps my moisturizer absorb really well.</li>
            <li>Love these little rollers, and the seller is great too!!</li>
            <li>It does not roll easily and looks rusty.  </li>
            <li>A genuine jade roller at a good reasonable price.</li>
            <li>--it is easy to use while sitting around if you leave it in a convenient place.  </li>
            <li>The first night, i put it in ice for a minute before using it and it felt nice.</li>
            <li>I have used this one and it is working fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for me to keep at home though.</li>
            <li>but a bit of superglue &amp; it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I returned it via Amazon without any issues, and the others are all fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine,</li>
            <li>The jade is fine.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a super tool for a do it yourself massage!</li>
            <li>Does feel nice on headaches after being in the freezer though and also have used on some muscle knots in my arm with positive results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit:</li>
            <li>The manufacturer shoved paper in the side to try to make it fit.</li>
            <li>the handle is cheap.</li>
            <li>The surface of the material is smooth, but the holes were not done correctly.</li>
            <li>If you use it lightly, maybe it would work for you.</li>
            <li>The roller is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I test the item on my hand, and it doesn&#x27;t roll smoothly.</li>
            <li>It feel smooth on the hand and face</li>
            <li>This is CHEAP.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>better go with the higher priced jade rollers...</li>
            <li>Might not be using it to its best potential, but like it enough :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it right away!</li>
            <li>Overall a great little tool and a welcome addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>Always feels cool on the face.  </li>
            <li>but it feels soooo good, especially after a lactic peel.</li>
            <li>The jade stays cool.</li>
            <li>it stays cool all the time.</li>
            <li>This tool is cool to the touch ans soothing to that area.  </li>
            <li>It is a really nice little gadget, it feels nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Im going to have to put some super glue under the brass piece that connects to the jade stem.  </li>
            <li>When I first received this product, the packaging was sturdy and I was pretty confident about the product.</li>
            <li>Arrived Quickly</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this roller on my face very much.  </li>
            <li>Should be fine if you are just doing your face, but it cant take too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and fine quality</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and both rollers work fine.</li>
            <li>Amazingly after a few minutes of doing it I feel so much more relieved</li>
            <li>I have never dealt with such a nice and caring company.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth my time and money to bother returning it.</li>
            <li>You have to scrape the both ends of central bar to make sure that they will fit in the holders.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li>only using it couple times, not seeing it&#x27;s a effective tool for beauty.  </li>
            <li>super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel smooth, it does smooth out lines, and it relaxes the facial muscles.</li>
            <li>i like this roller very much, however the jade falls off and you have to keep re-attaching it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>this  is amazing for the money spent and all jade too.</li>
            <li>and my face looks different, like more relaxed and youthful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li>While they were inexpensive, I would expect to not have to make repairs before my first use.</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>broke on first use and scratched my face</li>
            <li>But you will notice improvement with your first use.</li>
            <li>It broke after first use</li>
            <li>Thanks for the replacement!</li>
            <li>Fell apart during first use</li>
            <li>The two tips have different sizes for more reach on the face and neck.</li>
            <li>After I started using the jade roller, I felt my skin better, felt the circulation and collagen was definitely boosted.</li>
            <li>the top part fell apart after several uses.</li>
            <li>feels pleasant to use but fairly small.</li>
            <li>I used a large plumbers wrench to make the bracket smaller and able to hold ball.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if i came in the nice little box with satin like some other sellers advertise .</li>
            <li>super sensitive skin has helped with puffy eyes</li>
            <li>You can easily find local sellers if you&#x27;re in a hurry to try this out.</li>
            <li>so do not lay any blame with them, just super busy and didn&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li>I find this to be a handy little tool to have around.</li>
            <li>I tend to grind my teeth at night and it leaves my cheeks really sore in the morning.</li>
            <li>I really like this face massager</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The larger roller does not even fit on the metal pieces that are supposed to hold it.</li>
            <li>Made with cheap low grade materials.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much pressure either.</li>
            <li>very well so I had to use WD-40 to get them going.  </li>
            <li>I did not find this product to help much with under eye puffiness, but am giving it 2 stars b/c</li>
            <li>It took about 14 days (which is consider fast) to reach me as I ordered from oversea.</li>
            <li>As for the quality of the product, can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>Such a simple tool feels great on the face, stimulate lymphatic drainage , cools and at the same time energizes the skin.</li>
            <li>The second night I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t rolling as smoothly already.</li>
            <li>Takes sm time can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li>It works gently on the area.</li>
            <li>the face feels very stimulated after.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t bother me much, might buy another soon (:</li>
            <li>When I unwrapped it, the jade roller felt very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I thought this was very gracious of them</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I really want to use it for my face.</li>
            <li>It looks cheap and the jade is of low quality.</li>
            <li>The only positive is that it&#x27;s cool on the skin.</li>
            <li>The roller would be good for tension headache especially if you put the roller in the Fridge first then roll starting at the back of the neck and work up and along temples</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they broke banging into each other and who knows what else during shipment out of country.</li>
            <li>the big stone does come off so you can clean it.</li>
            <li>I have notice that the grip at both end of the bigger roller has started to tarnish (after  a week of using), maybe because I put it through the running water to clean it after each use.</li>
            <li>Nice surprise for a small price.</li>
            <li>Jade has mythical healing, soothing properties that I can only hope are true.</li>
            <li>First of all when it arrived it looked old and used.</li>
            <li>At this price if it breaks down today it doesn&#x27;t owe me anything:))</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re  better off getting a more expensive one  that comes in a box, this one just ships in an envelope.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super affordable, sometimes the roller comes off, but I pop it back on and continue!</li>
            <li>:) it is only $12, so i wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call this a luxury item, but it is a product that some people can get away without using.</li>
            <li>Feels good, I didn&#x27;t like that there was a big glop of glue around one of the gold metal pieces that holds the sections together, makes me think it won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes and do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>a little worried about this situation, healthy?</li>
            <li>That does not mean it is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>But from personal experience, I can attest that it remains cool to cold, in all weather, and a facial massage with one of these feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it at least three times a day (often four or five times) for 5 to 10 minutes at a time for the past six weeks and it has held up perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit irritating, but it is still a good product.</li>
            <li>Someone from the company, after seeing the review that I posted, actually called me and asked how he could make it right.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality, and it really does stimulate your facial muscles.</li>
            <li>Perhaps should just clean it with wet cloth after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>changing this from 3 stars to 2 stars, because I only got it yesterday and already the larger roller, ontop of being corroded, has stopped turning smoothly.</li>
            <li>BUT, I have to roll very gently on the larger side because the metal does not go all the way through</li>
            <li>course, I can decide to return the merchandise, but the mailing postage and procedure is not worth since it is a cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>Even thought it was cheap, still not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The first roller I bought broke within a few days, but I contacted the seller and they got back to me very quickly about it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>He assured me that it was made from real jade and actually sent me a piece that he broke, along with the replacement product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the roller feels very soothing and relaxing, I have very deep 11&#x27;s and use the roller in all directions to help relax the muscles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has improved anything as far as looks, but I like it.</li>
            <li>The rollers are nice but they arrived broken.</li>
            <li>I had given a sub standard rating to this product a while back, and am editing my first review.  </li>
            <li>It was a real pleasure to deal with such a nice company that stands behind their product!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it back on/very tight fit.  </li>
            <li>it was broken (but kind of fixable) on the bigger side of the roller.</li>
            <li>I scraped my face with the metal piece that holds the roller, luckily it was on my upper cheek and not right at my eye.</li>
            <li>The roller squeeks a little, but the pain relief is worth it.</li>
            <li>It barely rolls when you try to slide it across your skin.</li>
            <li>One (out of the several I purchased) had a loose metal bar holding the large jade piece</li>
            <li>The other will turn if I really press on the skin</li>
            <li>Not worth buying, even at this reasonable price.</li>
            <li>One of the small rollers turns with a squeaking sound (it is not centered on the axis), the other one turns but pulls out of the handle.</li>
            <li>Absolutely cannot beat the price on this little do-hicky.</li>
            <li>Remember to always clean the roller after using it on your face or body - not washing the roller will cause it to retain grease and dead skin cells (and whatever other product you might have had on) which will clog your pores when you use it!</li>

            <li> Great affordable tool for self-massage.</li>
            <li> was happy I ordered since I cannot use product my skin all the time because I am</li>
            <li> As for the product, it was in great condition .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to use at the end of the day to help relax.</li>
            <li> I believe that massage is great for the face.</li>
            <li> The seller has been great about it.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Though i should expect excellent quality given its price, it doesn&#x27;t deserve its price, i have to be honest</li>
            <li> I have been using for about 4 months and it feels great.</li>
            <li> LOL..</li>
            <li> I am going to order more!!</li>
            <li> so I tried this roller and it has been very effective.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant cooling feeling, don&#x27;t expect any changes in your wrinkles</li>
            <li> Excellent service -- shipped very quickly; well packaged.</li>
            <li> so it feels very refreshing on the skin - very nice in the summer</li>
            <li> I had ordered one of these rollers about a year ago from another company and it was, and still is in good condition.</li>
            <li> It feels good.</li>
            <li> The quality of the jade is not so good.</li>
            <li> I will just glue it and continue to use it cuz it feels good.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will do some good.  </li>
            <li> Using it on the jaw and jaw-joint area felt ever-so good.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time, but the quality is not that good.</li>
            <li> Great price for a handy tool.</li>
            <li> Works good as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good quality product for the price.</li>
            <li> The price is good, but I was upset when I received the item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think this is good for the face.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference on my skin--younger looking--and it feels good on my sinuses.  </li>
            <li> Its a good roller.</li>
            <li> Its feels good on your face and it helps to relaxS  and help with lines in forehead.</li>
            <li> this is a good jade roller.</li>
            <li> Seems like a great tool for better looking skin</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> because they tell her that she looks more refreshed!</li>
            <li> This roller feels amazing.</li>
            <li> The jade roller is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> The speed of shipping was amazing.</li>
            <li> The roller itself feels nice on the face and neck.</li>
            <li> it is a nice stone but for those people that use the healing properties of stones it may make a difference in their choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually liked the product.</li>
            <li> nice i use it under my chin fat to roll off ha</li>
            <li> The roller didn&#x27;t seem to help much with my acne, but if you want to try and contour your face, this is the perfect product for that.</li>
            <li> gives nice cooling feeling though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to use in the morning after i&#x27;ve washed my face but still feel bit \\&quot;congested\\&quot; and i want to get a bit of blood flowing to my face.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this jade roller, I highly recommend for a lymphatic massage.</li>
            <li> Works great if you use it right!</li>
            <li> I liked this more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> for me, i personally love it because i suffer from skin problems from hormones, and this is a really nice addition to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> For the most part, my order through Amazon was easy and the products were good.</li>
            <li> The roller feels cool to the touch and just feels good to use.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> These were nice stocking stuffers for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect much more.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to give the 3 I ordered from this company as gifts.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product now.</li>
            <li> and I love it for the price, however as soon as I got it</li>
            <li> So smooth for the face!</li>
            <li> I found an adhesive for stone/glass/tile/metal and was able to reattach the end.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> I am usually pleased with my Amazon purchases, but this one falls way below the mark.</li>
            <li> It would be better if the quality was there.</li>
            <li> They need better glue to set these with and need to drill all the way through the jade in the roller area so that they don&#x27;t keep popping out.</li>
            <li> This is okay for the price</li>
            <li> But the seller returned the amount that I paid so it is okay.</li>
            <li> Love the roller</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears that most jade rollers can be hit or miss no matter what Company you purchase from.</li>
            <li> Love the item, but one of the rollers came disconnected from the handle bar.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Il be getting more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Love my jade roller.</li>
            <li> The jade roller feels great and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> It came in perfect condition though the handle/center seems to be a different</li>
            <li> Nice but cheap and broke after a month or so</li>
            <li> nice and cool love the way it feels on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you always clean all of your beauty products (dish soap + water is a good way to clean).</li>
            <li> Love this, puts on face products easy, plus when I have sinus pressure it helps relieve it by rolling and putting pressure on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It is OK, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> the jade stays very cool</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge difference at this point, but I believe my face muscles feel more relaxed after using it.</li>
            <li> it is however grand for a light roller to keep in your toiletry bag for weekends away or when out and about.</li>
            <li> Good product helps my moisturizer absorb really well.</li>
            <li> Love these little rollers, and the seller is great too!!</li>
            <li> It does not roll easily and looks rusty.  </li>
            <li> A genuine jade roller at a good reasonable price.</li>
            <li> --it is easy to use while sitting around if you leave it in a convenient place.  </li>
            <li> The first night, i put it in ice for a minute before using it and it felt nice.</li>
            <li> I have used this one and it is working fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for me to keep at home though.</li>
            <li> but a bit of superglue &amp; it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I returned it via Amazon without any issues, and the others are all fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine,</li>
            <li> The jade is fine.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a super tool for a do it yourself massage!</li>
            <li> Does feel nice on headaches after being in the freezer though and also have used on some muscle knots in my arm with positive results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit:</li>
            <li> The manufacturer shoved paper in the side to try to make it fit.</li>
            <li> the handle is cheap.</li>
            <li> The surface of the material is smooth, but the holes were not done correctly.</li>
            <li> If you use it lightly, maybe it would work for you.</li>
            <li> The roller is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I test the item on my hand, and it doesn&#x27;t roll smoothly.</li>
            <li> It feel smooth on the hand and face</li>
            <li> This is CHEAP.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> better go with the higher priced jade rollers...</li>
            <li> Might not be using it to its best potential, but like it enough :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it right away!</li>
            <li> Overall a great little tool and a welcome addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Always feels cool on the face.  </li>
            <li> but it feels soooo good, especially after a lactic peel.</li>
            <li> The jade stays cool.</li>
            <li> it stays cool all the time.</li>
            <li> This tool is cool to the touch ans soothing to that area.  </li>
            <li> It is a really nice little gadget, it feels nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Im going to have to put some super glue under the brass piece that connects to the jade stem.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this product, the packaging was sturdy and I was pretty confident about the product.</li>
            <li> Arrived Quickly</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this roller on my face very much.  </li>
            <li> Should be fine if you are just doing your face, but it cant take too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing and fine quality</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and both rollers work fine.</li>
            <li> Amazingly after a few minutes of doing it I feel so much more relieved</li>
            <li> I have never dealt with such a nice and caring company.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth my time and money to bother returning it.</li>
            <li> You have to scrape the both ends of central bar to make sure that they will fit in the holders.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> only using it couple times, not seeing it&#x27;s a effective tool for beauty.  </li>
            <li> super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel smooth, it does smooth out lines, and it relaxes the facial muscles.</li>
            <li> i like this roller very much, however the jade falls off and you have to keep re-attaching it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> this  is amazing for the money spent and all jade too.</li>
            <li> and my face looks different, like more relaxed and youthful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> While they were inexpensive, I would expect to not have to make repairs before my first use.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> broke on first use and scratched my face</li>
            <li> But you will notice improvement with your first use.</li>
            <li> It broke after first use</li>
            <li> Thanks for the replacement!</li>
            <li> Fell apart during first use</li>
            <li> The two tips have different sizes for more reach on the face and neck.</li>
            <li> After I started using the jade roller, I felt my skin better, felt the circulation and collagen was definitely boosted.</li>
            <li> the top part fell apart after several uses.</li>
            <li> feels pleasant to use but fairly small.</li>
            <li> I used a large plumbers wrench to make the bracket smaller and able to hold ball.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if i came in the nice little box with satin like some other sellers advertise .</li>
            <li> super sensitive skin has helped with puffy eyes</li>
            <li> You can easily find local sellers if you&#x27;re in a hurry to try this out.</li>
            <li> so do not lay any blame with them, just super busy and didn&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a handy little tool to have around.</li>
            <li> I tend to grind my teeth at night and it leaves my cheeks really sore in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really like this face massager</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The larger roller does not even fit on the metal pieces that are supposed to hold it.</li>
            <li> Made with cheap low grade materials.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much pressure either.</li>
            <li> very well so I had to use WD-40 to get them going.  </li>
            <li> I did not find this product to help much with under eye puffiness, but am giving it 2 stars b/c</li>
            <li> It took about 14 days (which is consider fast) to reach me as I ordered from oversea.</li>
            <li> As for the quality of the product, can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> Such a simple tool feels great on the face, stimulate lymphatic drainage , cools and at the same time energizes the skin.</li>
            <li> The second night I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t rolling as smoothly already.</li>
            <li> Takes sm time can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li> It works gently on the area.</li>
            <li> the face feels very stimulated after.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bother me much, might buy another soon (:</li>
            <li> When I unwrapped it, the jade roller felt very flimsy.</li>
            <li> I thought this was very gracious of them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I really want to use it for my face.</li>
            <li> It looks cheap and the jade is of low quality.</li>
            <li> The only positive is that it&#x27;s cool on the skin.</li>
            <li> The roller would be good for tension headache especially if you put the roller in the Fridge first then roll starting at the back of the neck and work up and along temples</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they broke banging into each other and who knows what else during shipment out of country.</li>
            <li> the big stone does come off so you can clean it.</li>
            <li> I have notice that the grip at both end of the bigger roller has started to tarnish (after  a week of using), maybe because I put it through the running water to clean it after each use.</li>
            <li> Nice surprise for a small price.</li>
            <li> Jade has mythical healing, soothing properties that I can only hope are true.</li>
            <li> First of all when it arrived it looked old and used.</li>
            <li> At this price if it breaks down today it doesn&#x27;t owe me anything:))</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re  better off getting a more expensive one  that comes in a box, this one just ships in an envelope.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super affordable, sometimes the roller comes off, but I pop it back on and continue!</li>
            <li> :) it is only $12, so i wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call this a luxury item, but it is a product that some people can get away without using.</li>
            <li> Feels good, I didn&#x27;t like that there was a big glop of glue around one of the gold metal pieces that holds the sections together, makes me think it won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes and do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> a little worried about this situation, healthy?</li>
            <li> That does not mean it is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> But from personal experience, I can attest that it remains cool to cold, in all weather, and a facial massage with one of these feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at least three times a day (often four or five times) for 5 to 10 minutes at a time for the past six weeks and it has held up perfectly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit irritating, but it is still a good product.</li>
            <li> Someone from the company, after seeing the review that I posted, actually called me and asked how he could make it right.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality, and it really does stimulate your facial muscles.</li>
            <li> Perhaps should just clean it with wet cloth after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> changing this from 3 stars to 2 stars, because I only got it yesterday and already the larger roller, ontop of being corroded, has stopped turning smoothly.</li>
            <li> BUT, I have to roll very gently on the larger side because the metal does not go all the way through</li>
            <li> course, I can decide to return the merchandise, but the mailing postage and procedure is not worth since it is a cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> Even thought it was cheap, still not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The first roller I bought broke within a few days, but I contacted the seller and they got back to me very quickly about it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> He assured me that it was made from real jade and actually sent me a piece that he broke, along with the replacement product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the roller feels very soothing and relaxing, I have very deep 11&#x27;s and use the roller in all directions to help relax the muscles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has improved anything as far as looks, but I like it.</li>
            <li> The rollers are nice but they arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I had given a sub standard rating to this product a while back, and am editing my first review.  </li>
            <li> It was a real pleasure to deal with such a nice company that stands behind their product!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it back on/very tight fit.  </li>
            <li> it was broken (but kind of fixable) on the bigger side of the roller.</li>
            <li> I scraped my face with the metal piece that holds the roller, luckily it was on my upper cheek and not right at my eye.</li>
            <li> The roller squeeks a little, but the pain relief is worth it.</li>
            <li> It barely rolls when you try to slide it across your skin.</li>
            <li> One (out of the several I purchased) had a loose metal bar holding the large jade piece</li>
            <li> The other will turn if I really press on the skin</li>
            <li> Not worth buying, even at this reasonable price.</li>
            <li> One of the small rollers turns with a squeaking sound (it is not centered on the axis), the other one turns but pulls out of the handle.</li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot beat the price on this little do-hicky.</li>
            <li> Remember to always clean the roller after using it on your face or body - not washing the roller will cause it to retain grease and dead skin cells (and whatever other product you might have had on) which will clog your pores when you use it!</li>
            <li> Only bad thing I have to say is I would spend a little  more and buy one with a longer shelf life as this particular one tends to not stand up very well to constant use.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long they last.</li>
            <li> It was in perfectly new condition and in a little storage box with a lid.  </li>
            <li> I received the new product within a few days.  </li>
            <li> , it helps to relax those tense muscles we are not even aware of.</li>
            <li> it has such a mild affect it feels useless, It will activate then skin, but it wont last</li>
            <li> expected to get this small item in whole.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t doing it as long or as often as I should using my fingers</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s useful if your fingers get tired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I got a new or used Jade Roller.  </li>
            <li> Should of ordered this long ago!</li>
            <li> My only issue is that one of them is a little squeaky and the other one doesn&#x27;t roll easily enough so there seems to be variation in the quality of each individual one.</li>
            <li> I tried to used the smaller - still attached- side and the roller broke off, not from the handle like the other side, it came off the hinges.</li>
            <li> I think it won&#x27;t make much different when you are using your hand to massage other than this tool.</li>
            <li> The only imperfection is that the larger roller squeaks, that is what the missing star is all about.  </li>
            <li> Definately looks used not new.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than brands available to spas</li>
            <li> I just pick it up throughout the day when I see it sitting there on the table next to where I work, roll it around a little (always roll up and out</li>
            <li> I really do love this roller, and it&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> I also use it on my scalp carefully so hair does not get caught in roller.</li>
            <li> The smaller roller is chipped and is not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> it is not very well made.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my facial skin in just a few days of using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> When i roll it on my face, i can see a flush of pink on my face</li>
            <li> I can see the little line crack and white powder from the file in between those small tiny lines.</li>
            <li> This little beauty took so long to arrive</li>
            <li> The other reason I did not give it 5 stars is the stone is not jade but Adventurine, (I make jewelry and use Adventurine)</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s actually doing anything</li>
            <li> .... other than that</li>
            <li> The seller noticed it and sent me an e-mail stating to replace my broken Jade Roller with a new one.</li>
            <li> Not useful at all.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, it broke within a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Both price and quality is better than ones sold in China Town, NYC.&lt;br /&gt;Larger stone while rolling makes noise which is annoying.</li>
            <li> What a let down</li>
            <li> It was broken when it arrived, the smaller end bracket was not attached and the ball was loose in the package.</li>
            <li> Out of round, not symmetrical from one side to the other.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical that a little rolling would improve my skin, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> The part of the roller (jade) has a few flow ,with some black spots.</li>
            <li> They were shipped together in a flimsy bag and a little bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself and for each of my friends as a little Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> My skin looked like it was lifted and like it was a little bit brighter.</li>
            <li> (only in a padded envelope - it needed to be bubble wrapped at least in in a box!)</li>
            <li> definately makes my skin glow a little brighter.</li>
            <li> apiece was missing an cracked from the handlei</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> You can see that with just a few rolls across your skin that it also increases blood flow.</li>
            <li> This took a few weeks to arrive, but came ahead of the scheduled 4 weeks delivery.</li>
            <li> This thing is a joke and waste of money.  </li>
            <li> So, used incorrectly this tool could actually make your skin worse.</li>
            <li> Used a few times and it is literally in 5 pieces.  </li>
            <li> The larger side came broken off from the handle when I recieved it</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> received broken :/ and it also took a long time to receive.</li>
            <li> The holes were awkwardly placed and not round nor circular.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I am too lazy to put it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> I have been using this jade roller for the past week at night.</li>
            <li> I usually use it after I have taken a shower and moisturized my skin already.</li>
            <li> The usual &#x27;remedies&#x27; just didn&#x27;t seem to work with me</li>
            <li> but I think those small lines and crack can cut the skin even if I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> Poor construction and missing small roller.</li>
            <li> and it worked just as well as the one I use at work, but obviously not as nice.</li>
            <li> This roller is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> You have to drill the the indentation on the side of roller because it is as shallow as flat surface and is impossible to hold</li>
            <li> not good.</li>
            <li> Super bad quality :(</li>
            <li> I hate to give bad reviews, but this broke after a few uses, my dad even fixed it</li>

            <li> I kept it as it was usable and return-mailing inconvenient.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This roller feels amazing. BUT, I have to roll very gently on the larger side because the metal does not go all the way through and they come apart causing the roller to fall out.</li>
            <li> Poor construction and missing small roller.</li>
            <li> I tend to grind my teeth at night and it leaves my cheeks really sore in the morning. I really like this face massager, it helps to relax those tense muscles we are not even aware of. Amazingly after a few minutes of doing it I feel so much more relieved and my face looks different, like more relaxed and youthful. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken... I&#x27;m very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> this item arrived broken- apiece was missing an cracked from the handlei the roller metal holder wouldnt stay up on the handle and woul just fall off- the roller bit wold pop out from the holder. totally worthless.</li>
            <li> when I got it it was broken</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re  better off getting a more expensive one  that comes in a box, this one just ships in an envelope. it&#x27;s squeaky and seems a bit flimsy. otherwise it rolls over your face like its supposed to. the big stone does come off so you can clean it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my jade roller came broken, so I am unable to use it. . .very disappointing. .</li>
            <li> This roller is ridiculous. It&#x27;s squeaky and does nothing. The only positive is that it&#x27;s cool on the skin.👎</li>
            <li> The rollers are nice but they arrived broken. While they were inexpensive, I would expect to not have to make repairs before my first use. The handle had yo be glued on upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Great affordable tool for self-massage. Tip - you can put it in a freezer in the morning and put on your under-eye bags - will make them disappear.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I used it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These were nice stocking stuffers for the cheap price. Don&#x27;t expect much more.</li>
            <li> broke on first use and scratched my face</li>
            <li> Super bad quality :( I hate to give bad reviews, but this broke after a few uses, my dad even fixed it and then another part broke..better go with the higher priced jade rollers...sorry :(</li>
            <li> Love this, puts on face products easy, plus when I have sinus pressure it helps relieve it by rolling and putting pressure on eyebrows.  Don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. I will repurchase from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these back in November for gifts and when I received them, all 3 were broken. For some reason my earlier review with pic did not get posted. They were shipped together in a flimsy bag and a little bubble wrap. Shipping label said the contents was a cell phone accessory. I&#x27;m sure they broke banging into each other and who knows what else during shipment out of country. Anyway, a great disappointment. I had ordered one of these rollers about a year ago from another company and it was, and still is in good condition. The roller itself feels nice on the face and neck. Makes your face feel smooth, it does smooth out lines, and it relaxes the facial muscles. I also use it on my scalp carefully so hair does not get caught in roller. I really do love this roller, and it&#x27;s too bad I wasn&#x27;t able to give the 3 I ordered from this company as gifts.</li>
            <li> With in 3 days of use in my spa 1 of 6 had already broke. This worries me. Over all it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I received the jade roller broken.  It took 4 weeks to get it.  What a let down</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Bought one for myself and for each of my friends as a little Christmas gift.  Everyone loved them! Nice surprise for a small price.</li>
            <li> Might not be using it to its best potential, but like it enough :)</li>
            <li> I had given a sub standard rating to this product a while back, and am editing my first review.  Someone from the company, after seeing the review that I posted, actually called me and asked how he could make it right.  He assured me that it was made from real jade and actually sent me a piece that he broke, along with the replacement product.  I received the new product within a few days.  I have used this one and it is working fine.  I have never dealt with such a nice and caring company.  I am completely satisfied with this product now. I will look and see what else this company may have to offer and purchase something else as well.  It was a real pleasure to deal with such a nice company that stands behind their product!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Arrived broken but since it was so inexpensive did not bother to return it.</li>
            <li> It feels good. Can&#x27;t wait to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use mine as it arrived broken. The smaller roller is chipped and is not smooth at all. The larger roller does not even fit on the metal pieces that are supposed to hold it. Also, the metal piece that attaches the smaller roller to the cylinder jade handle is too big. The manufacturer shoved paper in the side to try to make it fit. To use the smaller roller, I have to hold it with my hand. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I am going to order more!! Jade has mythical healing, soothing properties that I can only hope are true. But from personal experience, I can attest that it remains cool to cold, in all weather, and a facial massage with one of these feels wonderful. Get your facial qi rolling!</li>
            <li> The roller looks like it had been used.  It does not roll easily and looks rusty.  Disappointed definitely not as nice looking as the picture.</li>
            <li> Handle broke second day...i didn&#x27;t get to use at all</li>
            <li> It is OK, but not too strong. The wire does not go all the way through the jade, it is just supported at the ends. I wanted to use it on my body muscles. Should be fine if you are just doing your face, but it cant take too much pressure.  The muscle roller sticks all seem to come with grooves.There are taper stone rolling pins that do not spin/rotate, but I may just order a standard bread marble rolling pin or use a rollerblade/skate wheel on a rod..</li>
            <li> I received it totally broken. Not even worth my time and money to bother returning it. Junk. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.</li>
            <li> Always feels cool on the face.  Love it! Much less expensive than brands available to spas</li>
            <li> I still use mine and I love it for the price, however as soon as I got it it was broken (but kind of fixable) on the bigger side of the roller. It fell off n I scraped my face with the metal piece that holds the roller, luckily it was on my upper cheek and not right at my eye. Then the smaller roller fell off the stick 3 days after I got it. Im an esthetician and it worked just as well as the one I use at work, but obviously not as nice. It&#x27;s fine for me to keep at home though.</li>
            <li> Love it! So smooth for the face! Works great if you use it right!</li>
            <li> It was broken when it arrived, the smaller end bracket was not attached and the ball was loose in the package. I used a large plumbers wrench to make the bracket smaller and able to hold ball. I found an adhesive for stone/glass/tile/metal and was able to reattach the end. The other reason I did not give it 5 stars is the stone is not jade but Adventurine, (I make jewelry and use Adventurine) it is a nice stone but for those people that use the healing properties of stones it may make a difference in their choice.&lt;br /&gt;Using the roller feels very soothing and relaxing, I have very deep 11&#x27;s and use the roller in all directions to help relax the muscles. The roller would be good for tension headache especially if you put the roller in the Fridge first then roll starting at the back of the neck and work up and along temples and  where ever else it hurts.</li>
            <li> The part of the roller (jade) has a few flow ,with some black spots. The quality of the jade is not so good.</li>
            <li> The jade roller is simply amazing. I am an esthetician and this device is excellent for lymphatic massage and it helps my moisturizer/serums to penetrate better.&lt;br /&gt;It feels amazing and my skins circulation is improved dramatically!! It&#x27;s super affordable, sometimes the roller comes off, but I pop it back on and continue!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it...but, one was broken when it arrived...the handle is cheap.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping! great item!</li>
            <li> I am a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and use the jade rollers when I do cosmetic acupuncture.  I was extremely disappointed in the poor quality of the product.  I ordered two of these and within a matter of minutes, both devices fell apart. I am usually pleased with my Amazon purchases, but this one falls way below the mark.</li>
            <li> Ok. Some broke. I bought 18 of them. Let&#x27;s see how long they last.</li>
            <li> like using especially on lymph glands</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Made with cheap low grade materials.</li>
            <li> Like it but it was broken when it arrived. Had to attempt to repair before I could use it</li>
            <li> Disappointed. I actually liked the product. It had to be glued when it arrived and ultimately broke by the handle. It would be better if the quality was there. Maybe buy a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Came broken and the heads don&#x27;t fit on the handle anyway.</li>
            <li> Good product helps my moisturizer absorb really well. Only downside is it&#x27;s a bit noisy &amp; the end came off but a bit of superglue &amp; it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this roller on my face very much.  The problem is the roller has already slipped off the stem.  Im going to have to put some super glue under the brass piece that connects to the jade stem.  I&#x27;m not sure I got a new or used Jade Roller.  It looks worn.  I will just glue it and continue to use it cuz it feels good.</li>
            <li> Bought one and immediately had to replace it. The handle fell apart from the Jade. They need better glue to set these with and need to drill all the way through the jade in the roller area so that they don&#x27;t keep popping out. I don&#x27;t use much pressure either. Some others who have also bought it had the same problem.</li>
            <li> nice and cool love the way it feels on the skin.  was happy I ordered since I cannot use product my skin all the time because I am super sensitive skin has helped with puffy eyes</li>
            <li> This little beauty took so long to arrive I almost forgot I ordered it.  But it did not take any longer than the seller advertised -- no stars off for that.  I had never heard of jade rollers until I bumped in to this on Amazon and thought I would try it out. For $3--really?  It is a really nice little gadget, it feels nice on the skin.  Maybe it will do some good.  I found some demonstrations on youtube of how to use it.  It is relaxing and simple and I like it.  I just pick it up throughout the day when I see it sitting there on the table next to where I work, roll it around a little (always roll up and out, they say) and I&#x27;m done till the next time...  The only imperfection is that the larger roller squeaks, that is what the missing star is all about.  But still, $3?</li>
            <li> This massager does not roll! The holes were awkwardly placed and not round nor circular. The surface of the material is smooth, but the holes were not done correctly. Out of round, not symmetrical from one side to the other. Just awful.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical that a little rolling would improve my skin, but it really does work. Of course you&#x27;ll have to incorporate this into you daily habit as its not a miracle worker. But you will notice improvement with your first use. The roller feels cool to the touch and just feels good to use. You can see that with just a few rolls across your skin that it also increases blood flow. Overall a great little tool and a welcome addition to my beauty routine. My one gripe would be that it took three weeks to be delivered, but that&#x27;s my fault for not noticing that the seller was in China. You can easily find local sellers if you&#x27;re in a hurry to try this out.</li>
            <li> i like it, came ok !!!</li>
            <li> Very soothing and fine quality</li>
            <li> This is okay for the price but it came broken and is really cheap quality. Not useful at all. If I had the choice I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot beat the price on this little do-hicky. If you don&#x27;t mind subtitles pull up Empresses in the Palace on Netflix and roll along with Jiang Xin. Not sure it&#x27;s actually doing anything but it feels soooo good, especially after a lactic peel.</li>
            <li> it is not very well made. The back part does not rotate with the one I got. and the front part makes noise.But the seller returned the amount that I paid so it is okay.</li>
            <li> Love the roller but it came damaged.</li>
            <li> The bigger side of the roller does not always roll.  I did not contact the seller so do not lay any blame with them, just super busy and didn&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> it has such a mild affect it feels useless, It will activate then skin, but it wont last and it didn&#x27;t make a difference, not to me</li>
            <li> I purchased this in combination with another face roller. This took a few weeks to arrive, but came ahead of the scheduled 4 weeks delivery. I love it. I use this daily and can see a vast improvement. My skin is plumper and glowing, and I&#x27;m noticing a firmer jaw line. Would recommend to anyone looking for an anti aging device.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  i bought this for my mom and I.  I put my vitamin C cream, then acne medicine, then the night serum and lastly I roll this and massage my neck and face.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality! Each roller end fell off! One was off when I opened the package and the second one fell off as I was inspecting it. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> i dont believe this is jade! it is however grand for a light roller to keep in your toiletry bag for weekends away or when out and about. feels pleasant to use but fairly small. mine arrived with one roller detached</li>
            <li> I sell jade rollers in my Clinic for various reasons: for cooling the face/bringing circulation to the face &amp; skin, for relieve headaches and tension (head &amp; neck), to relieve arthritic pain in one&#x27;s hands, to alleviate tendonitis, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that most jade rollers can be hit or miss no matter what Company you purchase from. For the most part, my order through Amazon was easy and the products were good. One (out of the several I purchased) had a loose metal bar holding the large jade piece - I see this \\&quot;defect\\&quot; all the time from all the Companies who sell jade rollers. I returned it via Amazon without any issues, and the others are all fine.</li>
            <li> I have lymphedema in my neck after extensive surgery and need to massage my neck often.  I wasn&#x27;t doing it as long or as often as I should using my fingers so I tried this roller and it has been very effective.  I&#x27;ve used it at least three times a day (often four or five times) for 5 to 10 minutes at a time for the past six weeks and it has held up perfectly.  At this price if it breaks down today it doesn&#x27;t owe me anything:))</li>
            <li> Save your money.  This thing is a joke and waste of money.  Neither roller &amp;#34;rolled&amp;#34; very well so I had to use WD-40 to get them going.  I did not find this product to help much with under eye puffiness, but am giving it 2 stars b/c the cold feeling of it is nice when just held up to your eye</li>
            <li> it looks like used, just wrapped in a plastic bag. cannot believe it. a little worried about this situation, healthy?</li>
            <li> Love the item, but one of the rollers came disconnected from the handle bar.  I couldn&#x27;t get it back on/very tight fit.  I kept it as it was usable and return-mailing inconvenient.  Had it come intact, I would have given this item 5-stars.</li>
            <li> Feels good, I didn&#x27;t like that there was a big glop of glue around one of the gold metal pieces that holds the sections together, makes me think it won&#x27;t last long :/.... other than that though it is doing it&#x27;s job well, besides some squeaky sounds.</li>
            <li> The roller is wonderful. Using it on the jaw and jaw-joint area felt ever-so good. It is also very good for the sinuses. The roller squeeks a little, but the pain relief is worth it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Shipped on time, but the quality is not that good.</li>
            <li> It is a well made Jade Roller Massager for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue, I have was it squeaks when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit irritating, but it is still a good product.</li>
            <li> The jade stays cool. I am too lazy to put it in the fridge. Just keep it with my cosmetics put it stays cool all the time. Several youtube videos on how to use a jade roller. Seems like a great tool for better looking skin</li>
            <li> this  is amazing for the money spent and all jade too.</li>
            <li> Purchased the product after seeing some positve review on this product. It took about 14 days (which is consider fast) to reach me as I ordered from oversea. I freezed the roller before using it. It actually helps to reduce puffy eyes and outbreak. As for the quality of the product, can&#x27;t expect much. I have notice that the grip at both end of the bigger roller has started to tarnish (after  a week of using), maybe because I put it through the running water to clean it after each use. Perhaps should just clean it with wet cloth after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Althought the quality of the product is just so so, overall the product is alright to use.</li>
            <li> Both price and quality is better than ones sold in China Town, NYC.&lt;br /&gt;Larger stone while rolling makes noise which is annoying.</li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive.  As for the product, it was in great condition . It would have been nice if i came in the nice little box with satin like some other sellers advertise . However , you get what counts. A genuine jade roller at a good reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, it broke within a week. If you use it lightly, maybe it would work for you.</li>
            <li> I and everyone I&#x27;ve used these on loves them. Such a simple tool feels great on the face, stimulate lymphatic drainage , cools and at the same time energizes the skin. Love these little rollers, and the seller is great too!!</li>
            <li> First of all when it arrived it looked old and used. It was rusted where the metal is. The first night, i put it in ice for a minute before using it and it felt nice. The second night I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t rolling as smoothly already. This item is only alright. I just feel like I could do an equally stimulating facial massage from simply using my fingers. I suppose it&#x27;s useful if your fingers get tired. I haven&#x27;t seen any noticable face-thinning results yet but I might have to use it for longer.</li>
            <li> received broken :/ and it also took a long time to receive. this is a do not buy item</li>
            <li> It broke after first use</li>
            <li> Great price for a handy tool.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, and it really does stimulate your facial muscles. I suffer from sinus headaches, and I&#x27;ve found that if I refrigerate my roller before using it that it helps relieve my headaches. It&#x27;s also great to use at the end of the day to help relax. The speed of shipping was amazing. I ordered this on Labor Day, and it was in my mailbox 3 days later.</li>
            <li> Takes sm time can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li> I believe that massage is great for the face. I find this to be a handy little tool to have around. Only bad thing I have to say is I would spend a little  more and buy one with a longer shelf life as this particular one tends to not stand up very well to constant use. The seller has been great about it. I use it on my neck muscles, under my eyes, my cheek bones and I love it. I suffer from chronic pain in my jaw, neck, and upper back, it&#x27;s a super tool for a do it yourself massage!</li>
            <li> Works good as I can tell. Il be getting more for gifts.</li>
            <li> This tool was recommended to me by my physical therapist.  Since radiation I have a lot of scar tissue in my face and neck.  This tool is cool to the touch ans soothing to that area.  It works gently on the area.</li>
            <li> I have been using this jade roller for the past week at night. I usually use it after I have taken a shower and moisturized my skin already. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference at this point, but I believe my face muscles feel more relaxed after using it. Also, the pressure and rolling motion are helpful for bringing blood to the surface of the skin (basically feeding the skin to improve elasticity and texture). The roller is very attractive and looks like some sort of antique piece. Definitely a good quality product for the price. Remember to always clean the roller after using it on your face or body - not washing the roller will cause it to retain grease and dead skin cells (and whatever other product you might have had on) which will clog your pores when you use it! So, used incorrectly this tool could actually make your skin worse. Just make sure you always clean all of your beauty products (dish soap + water is a good way to clean). &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Love my jade roller. Should of ordered this long ago! I use it on a daily basis! the face feels very stimulated after.</li>
            <li> The price is good, but I was upset when I received the item.&lt;br /&gt;I expected to get this small item in whole. Instead, the parts are fallen all over the box when I received it. The following work must be done before you see the item like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;1. You have to drill the the indentation on the side of roller because it is as shallow as flat surface and is impossible to hold the hooks.&lt;br /&gt;2. You have to scrape the both ends of central bar to make sure that they will fit in the holders.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I can decide to return the merchandise, but the mailing postage and procedure is not worth since it is a cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> The jade roller feels great and is very relaxing. I recommend this purchase for anyone that loves Chinese beauty treatments.</li>
            <li> Just got mine today and I love it!!! It came in perfect condition though the handle/center seems to be a different it doesn&#x27;t bother me much, might buy another soon (:</li>
            <li> i like this roller very much, however the jade falls off and you have to keep re-attaching it.</li>
            <li> Item was broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase. Great product.</li>
            <li> nice i use it under my chin fat to roll off ha ha thx deb</li>
            <li> it brake off. not good.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this jade roller, I highly recommend for a lymphatic massage. It has helped my puffy eyes! I can not say one bad thing!</li>
            <li> the roller would fall off all the time. I constantly was trying to put this back together. I did like how the cold jade felt on my face, like a mini massage. I dont feel it helped my skin any though.</li>
            <li> The rollers on these massagers do not move properly. The larger roller on one won&#x27;t move unless I use my fingers to turn it. The other will turn if I really press on the skin but I don&#x27;t think this is good for the face. One of the small rollers turns with a squeaking sound (it is not centered on the axis), the other one turns but pulls out of the handle. Poorly crafted. Not worth buying, even at this reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I bought the jade roller in hopes of it helping with my acne-prone skin. The usual &#x27;remedies&#x27; just didn&#x27;t seem to work with me so I decided to look a bit outside the box. The roller didn&#x27;t seem to help much with my acne, but if you want to try and contour your face, this is the perfect product for that. I saw a difference in my facial skin in just a few days of using it twice a day. My skin looked like it was lifted and like it was a little bit brighter. It also seems to help with redness/ blotchiness. The first roller I bought broke within a few days, but I contacted the seller and they got back to me very quickly about it. I definitely recommend buying from this seller if you are looking to buy a jade roller!</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, the packaging was sturdy and I was pretty confident about the product. When I unwrapped it, the jade roller felt very flimsy. After using it a couple of times, the jade roller (big one) actually fell off. Mind you, I&#x27;ve only used it twice for 5 minutes each. I was quite disappointed and wrote my review on Amazon. The seller noticed it and sent me an e-mail stating to replace my broken Jade Roller with a new one. I thought this was very gracious of them and I appreciate their effort to stand by their products. I just got my replacement Jade Roller today and this time, did not feel flimsy at all. Thanks for the replacement! I&#x27;m going to use it right away!</li>
            <li> I have several, I have one that I place in ice water while I have that fist cup of coffee then roll my eyes and face and the puffiness is gone. I have another that I roll on the foot for an instant massage. These are a perfect stocking stuffer for the women who has it all!!!</li>
            <li> I heard about this type of roller before and was looking for the best manufacturer.  Even though this was more expensive I purchased it and received it within 8 days.  I was a little worried as I had read some bad reviews. It was in perfectly new condition and in a little storage box with a lid.  Very sturdy and both rollers work fine. I wish it had some instructions, but I guess it&#x27;s self-evident how to use. I have high hopes and do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The roller is cheaply made. I test the item on my hand, and it doesn&#x27;t roll smoothly. Tried on my face and it&#x27;s the same. Also the longer side was filed but not well enough. I can see the little line crack and white powder from the file in between those small tiny lines. I don&#x27;t know if I really want to use it for my face. It feel smooth on the hand and face but I think those small lines and crack can cut the skin even if I don&#x27;t see it. Will be returning the item.</li>
            <li> Fell apart during first use</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these after my acupuncturist used it on me.  I like it very much--it is easy to use while sitting around if you leave it in a convenient place.  I notice a difference on my skin--younger looking--and it feels good on my sinuses.  My only issue is that one of them is a little squeaky and the other one doesn&#x27;t roll easily enough so there seems to be variation in the quality of each individual one.</li>
            <li> Its a good roller. I like it. Its feels good on your face and it helps to relaxS  and help with lines in forehead.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.  Used a few times and it is literally in 5 pieces.  Even thought it was cheap, still not worth the money.  Also, it says it is a USA Seller.  That does not mean it is made in the USA.  The item came from China.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! This is CHEAP. The larger side came broken off from the handle when I recieved it (only in a padded envelope - it needed to be bubble wrapped at least in in a box!) I tried to used the smaller - still attached- side and the roller broke off, not from the handle like the other side, it came off the hinges. Also it is MUCH smaller in person than it looks. Don&#x27;t spend your money. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It looks cheap and the jade is of low quality. Though i should expect excellent quality given its price, it doesn&#x27;t deserve its price, i have to be honest</li>
            <li> I like it. The two tips have different sizes for more reach on the face and neck. After I started using the jade roller, I felt my skin better, felt the circulation and collagen was definitely boosted.</li>
            <li> Use it twice a day.It&#x27;s fine, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;See no difference, so far,because I&#x27;ve been using it for only couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It gives nice cooling feeling though.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue rolling it around my face, we&#x27;ll see.....</li>
            <li> I liked this more than I thought I would. I have been using for about 4 months and it feels great. I don&#x27;t know if it has improved anything as far as looks, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Arrived Quickly but there is corrosion and rust on the metal parts and there was a sticky film on the larger jade roller. Definately looks used not new. Does feel nice on headaches after being in the freezer though and also have used on some muscle knots in my arm with positive results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: changing this from 3 stars to 2 stars, because I only got it yesterday and already the larger roller, ontop of being corroded, has stopped turning smoothly. It barely rolls when you try to slide it across your skin.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. the top part fell apart after several uses. Don&#x27;t buy it. waste of money.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. My mom loves it!</li>
            <li> And rusts! Wanted to try for the price in spite of bad reviews. The jade is fine.</li>
            <li> Pleasant cooling feeling, don&#x27;t expect any changes in your wrinkles</li>
            <li> Every time I use the jade roller ppl stare at me and say &amp;#34;wow you look so pretty&amp;#34; it firms and lifts the skin. A must buy!</li>
            <li> arrived broke and the jade rollers don&#x27;t roll</li>
            <li> only using it couple times, not seeing it&#x27;s a effective tool for beauty.  I think it won&#x27;t make much different when you are using your hand to massage other than this tool.</li>
            <li> this is a good jade roller. it&#x27;s nice to use in the morning after i&#x27;ve washed my face but still feel bit \\&quot;congested\\&quot; and i want to get a bit of blood flowing to my face. definately makes my skin glow a little brighter. i also like to use the smaller end it at night to work in my eye cream. the jade stays very cool so it feels very refreshing on the skin - very nice in the summer :) it is only $12, so i wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call this a luxury item, but it is a product that some people can get away without using. for me, i personally love it because i suffer from skin problems from hormones, and this is a really nice addition to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Excellent service -- shipped very quickly; well packaged. The roller is beautiful and well made. Very happily rolling along.</li>
            <li> Nice but cheap and broke after a month or so</li>
            <li> It squeaks when you roll it...</li>
            <li> When i roll it on my face, i can see a flush of pink on my face and then my skin just glows and that lasts all day, my mom LOVES it! because it takes the puffiness away from her eye bags and it erases some of her wrinkles (temporarily), even her friends ask her now, what is she using!??  LOL.. because they tell her that she looks more refreshed!</li>
