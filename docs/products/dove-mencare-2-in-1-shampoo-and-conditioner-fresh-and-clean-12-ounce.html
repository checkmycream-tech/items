            <li>I&#x27;m not a picky man, so when I need shampoo I found the best rated bottle on amazon and ordered it.</li>

            <li>I will admit, I have never found a \\&quot;2-in-1 Shampoo and conditioner\\&quot; that was as good as shampoo and a seperate conditioner, but you know how they say \\&quot;Wash-rinse-repeat\\&quot;?</li>

            <li>I originally purchased this to try out the Dove men&#x27;s line when there were some great sale prices -- now I&#x27;m hooked on the scent.</li>
            <li>Smells great, easy to use and the ladies love my hair.</li>
            <li>The primary reason I purchased this shampoo is that I was greatly impressed with the fresh scent of the &amp;#34;Extra Fresh&amp;#34; bar soap</li>
            <li>Great product, and quick delivery</li>
            <li>Scent isnt very strong</li>

            <li>The menthol in this shampoo gives it a nice scent and makes it feel refreshing to use.</li>
            <li>smells good and minty fresh!</li>
            <li>The smell is great (the wife likes) and she even tried it out and commented that the women&#x27;s shampoo must be all water... because even with her waist length hair, she could use a little amount of this and it worked great!</li>
            <li>It smells good and gets you clean.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Menthol,Sodium Chloride,Methylchloroisothiazolinone (5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one), Caffeine and more.</li>
            <li>Dove is one of my favorite brands, so I bought a variety of Dove Men+Care products in a gift set at Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
            <li>Since then I have cancelled my subscription because the price has increased to more than the retail price.</li>
            <li>Never subscribe and save for more than two deliveries if you are doing a promotion.</li>
            <li>Somehow this is perfect for my semi-oily short hair.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells great, I have no clue if the caffeine actually accomplishes anything, but it&#x27;s a good option if you use it occassionally.</li>
            <li>One of the better shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>I love Dove products.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It seems to be stronger than most shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It smells okay.  </li>
            <li>Despite the fact that an unmistakable cream, this was the most slender of the 3.</li>
            <li>What more could a guy want?</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This 2 n 1 shampoo and conditioner keeps the oil out of his hair and makes it more fuller.</li>

            <li>It always feels clean, but I feel like there&#x27;s a better 2-in-1 shampoo out there.</li>

            <li>Keeps it clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;FOR DEEPLY CLEAN HAIR AND REFRESHMENT&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tingling head &#x3D; clean head</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and not coated with product after washing.</li>
            <li>The girlfriend loves the smell, it wakes me up in the morning, and I feel clean after use.</li>
            <li>Gets my hair clean, I like the cooling sensation it gives my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and does a very good job at cleaning the hair thoroughly without making your hair/scalp feel dry, red, itchy, etc</li>
            <li>Tried this for the boyfriend, he says smells good but only uses it as soap not on his hair!</li>
            <li>Aside from the cleaning aspect it feels really cool on the head and the freshness lingers for hours.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this it is very manly and not too over powering.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a cool soothing feeling when I use it.</li>
            <li>Smells good, solid product</li>
            <li>My husband loves this fresh and clean 2 in 1 shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and have been nothing short of impressed at the level of quality and still can&#x27;t get over that cooling menthol effect.  </li>
            <li>This actually gives off a tingly sensation, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Bought for my husband, he loves how it tingles on his scalp says its refreshing after shower and feels a lot cleaner than normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells manky and works great at leaving you feel like you could chop down 100 trees and build a cabin for your wife to deliver your baby.</li>
            <li>Gave this to the youngest in our tribe, a good looking and clean young man, and he commented that after using the Dove Men+Care Fresh Clean Fortifying 2 in 1 (12oz), it left him with a clean hair and tingling sensation that brought a feeling of a job well done.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling pretty clean.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday, works great.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh sensation it leaves on my head because of the menthol.</li>
            <li>It has a nice masculine smell that stays around for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Unlike many Dove or other shampoos, this one REALLY has a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the scent at all, which I guess I could live with for that price except the scent SOOOO strong.</li>
            <li>He said it lathers really well (a must with him for shampoo) and made his scalp feel tingly and clean, almost like it was \\&quot;waking\\&quot; his hair up.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this - it is powerful stuff that really cleans your hair super thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>cooling down my head&#x27;s skin and is good for my greasy hair</li>
            <li>so much-- when you rinse, you&#x27;re surrounded with the amazing sensation of a brief aromatherapy treatment!</li>
            <li>It does give my head a strange cool feeling if the shampoo is in my hair for more than about thirty seconds.</li>
            <li>Fresh Clean helps hair recover from all that action.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to clean well, and I liked the smell, but after a couple weeks of use it had really dried out my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>A great bargain compared to other men&#x27;s products costing much more and delivering much less.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it&#x27;s the same if not cheaper as in the stores.</li>
            <li>A hot day.  </li>
            <li>I want to give it a better rating because I use all of the Dove Men + Care products, but this one falls short in one peculiar way.</li>
            <li>but when the weather is hot, I find that by the end of the day my hair looks and feels oily.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I can say that this is the first 2 in 1 that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp break out or itch after use.</li>
            <li>I know that it isn&#x27;t as effective to use a 2-in-1 compared to two separate products, but my laziness makes me not really care.</li>
            <li>but he likes it so much we will be buying it again!</li>
            <li>It makes lots of suds, even on the first use.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this isn&#x27;t a universal issue.</li>
            <li>it was my first time using this</li>
            <li>The price was right as a shaved head doesn&#x27;t use too much shampoo..</li>
            <li>I am unclear on what exactly the purpose of putting this in a shampoo is, and I certainly didn&#x27;t get anything out of it.</li>
            <li>cleans good, and does give a &amp;#34;mentholated&amp;#34; feeling on the scalp, i just wish the scent was a little stronger, it smells great on my boyfriends hair (and mine too when i occasionally use it) but wears off after a few hours.</li>
            <li>the Fresh Clean Body Wash doesn&#x27;t give you that same &#x27;aromatherapy moment&#x27; that you get from this 2 in 1.)</li>
            <li>especially like the Fresh Clean scent and feeling it gives</li>
            <li>The item came busted open and the smell was unbelievably strong.</li>
            <li>Smell is good, not too overpowering, and it wont last too long after you shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily, for fear that it might be too strong.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but it likely works fine for others.</li>
            <li>I may purchase it again as I have not found another shampoo that I really like.</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband since he doesn&#x27;t really care what shampoo he uses and I some</li>
            <li>thanks for that hub.</li>
            <li>If you go to Target and use a coupon, you will get a much getter deal.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to keep my scalp from drying out as much.</li>
            <li>I have always had very oily hair.</li>
            <li>it does what it is supposed to and was much cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li>I really like this...</li>
            <li>Unless you really need something like this stay away from it, I am tossing the rest of the bottle to the trash god..</li>
            <li>Had to buy a tea tree oil conditioner to keep my head from drying out too much.</li>
            <li>meh i really dislike the smell</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my hair look and feel</li>
            <li>As a shampoo it works reasonably well, though still leaves my hair dryer than I would expect for a product that includes conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the way this shampoo cleans out my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Also the price to quantity ratio is very reasonable…</li>
            <li>Very tingly, like the scent.</li>
            <li>Really does help wake you up a bit.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- the 2 in 1 component isn&#x27;t so much a conditioner as it is shampoo</li>
            <li>it cares for the scalp which he really needs because he&#x27;s an athletic person</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>I have oily hair and this product works really well.</li>
            <li>Hi thanks</li>
            <li>how much easier can it get?</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice tingle, cold feeling after you rinse it off which kind of wakes you up.  </li>
            <li>, his hair is clean, and moisturized, and it gets rid of teenage &amp;#34;funk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not all foam; it actually works really great in small amounts as well.  </li>
            <li>really cannot tell much difference from other brand, but works fine</li>
            <li>For the price its a decent shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I lean toward particular shampoos and conditioners with the goal that I can let the conditioner assimilate for around 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>product has a subtle fresh clean scent that is masculine, long lasting and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Due to the strong aromas, everything else in the shipment reeked of this stuff.</li>
            <li>i normally just used whatever shampoo was in the shower</li>
            <li>a great smelling mess, but a mess.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend tried it after running out of her own, and she was surprised to find her hair wasn&#x27;t greasy the next day like all other shampoos.</li>
            <li>It was something new to try</li>
            <li>The cost of this shampoo is a bit more than what we usually pay</li>
            <li>…As I was reading the other reviews, it looks like the majority of the complaints are coming from the smell of the product more so than how it actually works.</li>
            <li>what really wakes you up is the knowledge you need to be careful with it and make sure you don&#x27;t get any in your eyes or even on your closed eyelids.  </li>
            <li>So far so goo!</li>
            <li>This may actually work a little better than intended -</li>
            <li>I love Amazon, product lines like this are hard to find in stores where the variety of slim to none.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, if helpful, below is a complete list of ingredients (in case you can identify something you are allergic to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp and the product hasn&#x27;t been causing any itching or irritation.</li>
            <li>, so it works really well as the last part of my cleaning regimne.</li>
            <li>It just leaves the hair soft.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve worked up a hard sweat, this product will clean you up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair less smooth than the different shampoos I had used before.</li>
            <li>Your hair will be ready for more chilling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did a good job cleaning and lightly conditioning my hair, no better or worse on that front than other similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair is well conditioned after use, and the your hair does not dry out with daily use.</li>
            <li>Worse still, the product has an extremely strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>The star rating may be a little biased seeing as how I only paid $1.17 with the amazon coupon deals but knowing how much this product costs in a store and the quality of all dove products I buy</li>

            <li> Aside from the cleaning aspect it feels really cool on the head and the freshness lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this it is very manly and not too over powering.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a cool soothing feeling when I use it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, solid product</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fresh and clean 2 in 1 shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and have been nothing short of impressed at the level of quality and still can&#x27;t get over that cooling menthol effect.  </li>
            <li> This actually gives off a tingly sensation, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband, he loves how it tingles on his scalp says its refreshing after shower and feels a lot cleaner than normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells manky and works great at leaving you feel like you could chop down 100 trees and build a cabin for your wife to deliver your baby.</li>
            <li> Gave this to the youngest in our tribe, a good looking and clean young man, and he commented that after using the Dove Men+Care Fresh Clean Fortifying 2 in 1 (12oz), it left him with a clean hair and tingling sensation that brought a feeling of a job well done.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling pretty clean.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, works great.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh sensation it leaves on my head because of the menthol.</li>
            <li> It has a nice masculine smell that stays around for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Unlike many Dove or other shampoos, this one REALLY has a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent at all, which I guess I could live with for that price except the scent SOOOO strong.</li>
            <li> He said it lathers really well (a must with him for shampoo) and made his scalp feel tingly and clean, almost like it was \\&quot;waking\\&quot; his hair up.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this - it is powerful stuff that really cleans your hair super thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> cooling down my head&#x27;s skin and is good for my greasy hair</li>
            <li> so much-- when you rinse, you&#x27;re surrounded with the amazing sensation of a brief aromatherapy treatment!</li>
            <li> It does give my head a strange cool feeling if the shampoo is in my hair for more than about thirty seconds.</li>
            <li> Fresh Clean helps hair recover from all that action.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to clean well, and I liked the smell, but after a couple weeks of use it had really dried out my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> A great bargain compared to other men&#x27;s products costing much more and delivering much less.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s the same if not cheaper as in the stores.</li>
            <li> A hot day.  </li>
            <li> I want to give it a better rating because I use all of the Dove Men + Care products, but this one falls short in one peculiar way.</li>
            <li> but when the weather is hot, I find that by the end of the day my hair looks and feels oily.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I can say that this is the first 2 in 1 that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp break out or itch after use.</li>
            <li> I know that it isn&#x27;t as effective to use a 2-in-1 compared to two separate products, but my laziness makes me not really care.</li>
            <li> but he likes it so much we will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> It makes lots of suds, even on the first use.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this isn&#x27;t a universal issue.</li>
            <li> it was my first time using this</li>
            <li> The price was right as a shaved head doesn&#x27;t use too much shampoo..</li>
            <li> I am unclear on what exactly the purpose of putting this in a shampoo is, and I certainly didn&#x27;t get anything out of it.</li>
            <li> cleans good, and does give a &amp;#34;mentholated&amp;#34; feeling on the scalp, i just wish the scent was a little stronger, it smells great on my boyfriends hair (and mine too when i occasionally use it) but wears off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> the Fresh Clean Body Wash doesn&#x27;t give you that same &#x27;aromatherapy moment&#x27; that you get from this 2 in 1.)</li>
            <li> especially like the Fresh Clean scent and feeling it gives</li>
            <li> The item came busted open and the smell was unbelievably strong.</li>
            <li> Smell is good, not too overpowering, and it wont last too long after you shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, for fear that it might be too strong.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but it likely works fine for others.</li>
            <li> I may purchase it again as I have not found another shampoo that I really like.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband since he doesn&#x27;t really care what shampoo he uses and I some</li>
            <li> thanks for that hub.</li>
            <li> If you go to Target and use a coupon, you will get a much getter deal.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to keep my scalp from drying out as much.</li>
            <li> I have always had very oily hair.</li>
            <li> it does what it is supposed to and was much cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li> I really like this...</li>
            <li> Unless you really need something like this stay away from it, I am tossing the rest of the bottle to the trash god..</li>
            <li> Had to buy a tea tree oil conditioner to keep my head from drying out too much.</li>
            <li> meh i really dislike the smell</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my hair look and feel</li>
            <li> As a shampoo it works reasonably well, though still leaves my hair dryer than I would expect for a product that includes conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the way this shampoo cleans out my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also the price to quantity ratio is very reasonable…</li>
            <li> Very tingly, like the scent.</li>
            <li> Really does help wake you up a bit.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- the 2 in 1 component isn&#x27;t so much a conditioner as it is shampoo</li>
            <li> it cares for the scalp which he really needs because he&#x27;s an athletic person</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and this product works really well.</li>
            <li> Hi thanks</li>
            <li> how much easier can it get?</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice tingle, cold feeling after you rinse it off which kind of wakes you up.  </li>
            <li> , his hair is clean, and moisturized, and it gets rid of teenage &amp;#34;funk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not all foam; it actually works really great in small amounts as well.  </li>
            <li> really cannot tell much difference from other brand, but works fine</li>
            <li> For the price its a decent shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I lean toward particular shampoos and conditioners with the goal that I can let the conditioner assimilate for around 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> product has a subtle fresh clean scent that is masculine, long lasting and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Due to the strong aromas, everything else in the shipment reeked of this stuff.</li>
            <li> i normally just used whatever shampoo was in the shower</li>
            <li> a great smelling mess, but a mess.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend tried it after running out of her own, and she was surprised to find her hair wasn&#x27;t greasy the next day like all other shampoos.</li>
            <li> It was something new to try</li>
            <li> The cost of this shampoo is a bit more than what we usually pay</li>
            <li> …As I was reading the other reviews, it looks like the majority of the complaints are coming from the smell of the product more so than how it actually works.</li>
            <li> what really wakes you up is the knowledge you need to be careful with it and make sure you don&#x27;t get any in your eyes or even on your closed eyelids.  </li>
            <li> So far so goo!</li>
            <li> This may actually work a little better than intended -</li>
            <li> I love Amazon, product lines like this are hard to find in stores where the variety of slim to none.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, if helpful, below is a complete list of ingredients (in case you can identify something you are allergic to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp and the product hasn&#x27;t been causing any itching or irritation.</li>
            <li> , so it works really well as the last part of my cleaning regimne.</li>
            <li> It just leaves the hair soft.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve worked up a hard sweat, this product will clean you up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair less smooth than the different shampoos I had used before.</li>
            <li> Your hair will be ready for more chilling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did a good job cleaning and lightly conditioning my hair, no better or worse on that front than other similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair is well conditioned after use, and the your hair does not dry out with daily use.</li>
            <li> Worse still, the product has an extremely strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> The star rating may be a little biased seeing as how I only paid $1.17 with the amazon coupon deals but knowing how much this product costs in a store and the quality of all dove products I buy</li>
            <li> But it performs very, very well if you have oily hair that is difficult to get looking decent without having to do wash, rinse, repeat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a body fragrance person, so finding &#x27;a long lasting scent&#x27; has never been my mission.</li>
            <li> I use the products of the company Dove a long time, because I like their quality and individual approach to customers.</li>
            <li> Before I used this product my hair was frizzy, dull, and very damaged from lack of care.</li>
            <li> Size was smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This is worth the money, and I am poor college student saying this.</li>
            <li> Made my son&#x27;s hair really dry</li>
            <li> I was looking for a milder shampoo for the winter when my hair tends to dry out, so decided to try Dove&#x27;s 2 in 1 option.</li>
            <li> Basically what it comes down to is if you fear menthol go elsewhere, but if you don&#x27;t care this shampoo should work decently enough for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they would be labeled as the same scent when they don&#x27;t smell the same.</li>
            <li> you hair is dry or even not very oily</li>
            <li> I have thin hair...and usually conditioners make them unruly - not this one...leave a decent amount of natural oils in...</li>
            <li> Yes, it has a relatively strong smell in comparison to other shampoos, but I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad at all.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the menthol, be careful about getting in your eyes (like any hair cleansing product), and don&#x27;t apply to any parts of your body where a menthol sensations will be unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;DIRECTIONS:  APPLY TO WET HAIR, LATHER AND RINSE</li>
            <li> After using for a couple of months, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair never really feels &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so rough it feels like it has a five o&#x27;clock shadow</li>
            <li> Not really noteworthy...</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize it was menthol; kind of annoying tingle.  </li>
            <li> This does not happen during the cold weather season, only during the hot months.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the scalp itchy, dry, or tight at all.</li>
            <li> but if it&#x27;s not on sale then we get other stuff.</li>
            <li> Only problem I had was mine had a small leak in the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair was stiff and not soft.</li>
            <li> I was starting to flake pretty badly.</li>
            <li> However, mine over time in the shower would start to get this wierd sour smell to it whenever I opened it for use.  </li>
            <li> they just need to tape the lid down.</li>
            <li> For me as a college kid, shampoo selection usually equates to whether I want hair that&#x27;s slightly dry or greasy at a price.</li>
            <li> Yeah there is menthol in here, but with my limited (there&#x27;s that lazy part)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too thick, almost translucent (probably enough said there).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a slight bit cheaper on amazon than else</li>
            <li> Dove has chosen an odd color and consistency for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Give me a half option</li>
            <li> The smell is like typical &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is not nearly as oily as it used to be, frizzy, or dull.</li>
            <li> made a mess.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my scalp is allergic to the caffeine or other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Like the smell and the little bit of tingling I feel in my scalp that the menthol creates.  </li>
            <li> He was worried that a 2 in 1 might make his hair greasy, like other products that he has used in the past.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m slightly disappointed in, is it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as some other 2 in 1 products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> so I no longer have to wash my hair everyday because it doesn&#x27;t get so oily</li>
            <li> Always made my hair feel really stiff.</li>
            <li> My fault should have saw the small green label.  </li>
            <li> I usually dont buy a 2 in 1, but I would get this again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately neither this shampoo nor the body wash (reviewed separately) smells the same.</li>
            <li> I need just a small amount.</li>
            <li> Also, not sure if I like the menthol effect...</li>
            <li> Several hours after use I smelled vaguely of&lt;br /&gt;Vicks rub with a woodsy note added.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the caffeine is for</li>
            <li> It had a medium quality manly smell which I uncertainty keeps going much past the shower time.</li>
            <li> This product exploded in the box due to poor packaging by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but the angled cap made it nearly impossible to turn upside down to get the last usable amount out.</li>
            <li> and if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough when you rinse off other parts of your body now get hit my a lower dose of this stuff.</li>
            <li> The soap is fine, but the packaging from Amazon was terrible.</li>
            <li> At least the smell is not a feminine one, but rather a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> The shampoo washed out well after producing a very thick lather.</li>
            <li> My fiance has thin oily hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who was tired of using two products for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> complaint is that the shampoo has been very irritating to my skin, causing peeling and flaking on my cheeks, forehead, and behind my ears.</li>
            <li> I failed to notice the Menthol on the front of the bottle before I ordered.</li>
            <li> Lots of crazy ingredients in this Shampoo.</li>
            <li> dangerous chemicals</li>
            <li> For nights when I&#x27;m really dirty, I&#x27;ll squeeze some onto the loufa and even use it on my body.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is that bad.</li>
            <li> But if you work construction and your hair is often filthy or you have oily hair - go for it.  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This actually gives off a tingly sensation, I am very pleased. I usually dont buy a 2 in 1, but I would get this again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo, the aroma stays for hours.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo. Like the smell and hair feel. Good price.</li>
            <li> I have this on subscribe and save. Love it.</li>
            <li> Its shampoo that cleans and smells good. Enough said.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon, product lines like this are hard to find in stores where the variety of slim to none.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, enjoyed the refreshing menthol sensation added.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an add-on item to get free shipping, Grandpa was happy with it!</li>
            <li> Invigorating lather with a great scent.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the boyfriend, he says smells good but only uses it as soap not on his hair!</li>
            <li> Works great. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that tingles when you use it. Very refreshing!  but it&#x27;s packaging was not designed to be shipped through the postal service. I have had the lid come off twice now.</li>
            <li> Great! My husband loves it &amp; the smell is amazing! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Be careful. Lots of crazy ingredients in this Shampoo. I failed to notice the Menthol on the front of the bottle before I ordered. Menthol,Sodium Chloride,Methylchloroisothiazolinone (5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one), Caffeine and more. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Good scent and the bottle lasts a good while</li>
            <li> Dove is one of my favorite brands, so I bought a variety of Dove Men+Care products in a gift set at Sam&#x27;s Club. The favorites were this shampoo and the body wash.  Love the smell of Men+Care products!</li>
            <li> The price was really good with a subscribe and ship promotion which was going on. Since then I have cancelled my subscription because the price has increased to more than the retail price. Never subscribe and save for more than two deliveries if you are doing a promotion. It won&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> i use it daily and works great for oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but the angled cap made it nearly impossible to turn upside down to get the last usable amount out.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize it was menthol; kind of annoying tingle.  I wish it was in the title</li>
            <li> Does the job and give you a refreshing cool in the morning.</li>
            <li> It smells good and gets you clean.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Have used everything from a bar of hand soap to $56 shampoo and conditioner from a salon. Somehow this is perfect for my semi-oily short hair. Keeps it clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I love tee tree in it gives a nice soothing feeling and the conditioner does soften my hair, it&#x27;s just a slight bit cheaper on amazon than else where, try this one very refreshing.</li>
            <li> The star rating may be a little biased seeing as how I only paid $1.17 with the amazon coupon deals but knowing how much this product costs in a store and the quality of all dove products I buy (their deodorant is the only brand I&#x27;ll use) this definitely deserves a solid five stars.</li>
            <li> smell good feel good!</li>
            <li> The primary reason I purchased this shampoo is that I was greatly impressed with the fresh scent of the &amp;#34;Extra Fresh&amp;#34; bar soap so I wanted more products with the same great smell. Unfortunately neither this shampoo nor the body wash (reviewed separately) smells the same. I&#x27;m not sure why they would be labeled as the same scent when they don&#x27;t smell the same. That being said, this is an interesting shampoo. A unique combination of menthol and caffeine helps me wake up in the morning. I may purchase it again as I have not found another shampoo that I really like.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old smells great, his hair is clean, and moisturized, and it gets rid of teenage &amp;#34;funk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband since he doesn&#x27;t really care what shampoo he uses and I some how got it for $1.50. I don&#x27;t like the scent at all, which I guess I could live with for that price except the scent SOOOO strong. Ya know that feeling you get when someone walks by that bathed in axe body spray? The feeling like you&#x27;re drowning and can&#x27;t breath yet you&#x27;re totally not under water?  Welcome to it in shampoo form.  If you&#x27;re one of THOSE axe kinda people... you&#x27;ll love this. If you&#x27;re not buy at your own risk.  As for how it cleans all my husband could tell me was &amp;#34; yeah my hair is clean&amp;#34; ......thanks for that hub.</li>
            <li> Love the Shampoo but I wish the price was better.  I ordered it because I did not do the research on the Ounces.  If you go to Target and use a coupon, you will get a much getter deal.  This review is based on price not quality.  Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, not as musky as the body wash that goes with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a picky man, so when I need shampoo I found the best rated bottle on amazon and ordered it. Turn out it was amazing, and fulfilled shampoo needs I didn&#x27;t even know I had. My girlfriend tried it after running out of her own, and she was surprised to find her hair wasn&#x27;t greasy the next day like all other shampoos. +1 changed my hair&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo and leaves my hair smelling good.</li>
            <li> Great price on Dove shampoo for men, smells manly, works fine for his short hair.</li>
            <li> Made my son&#x27;s hair really dry</li>
            <li> The only scent of Dove I&#x27;ll let my husband use! Very fresh and clean (hence the name!)</li>
            <li> Works great and smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> This lathers nicely and smells good. It also seems to keep my scalp from drying out as much. What more can you ask for from shampoo?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo. It works.</li>
            <li> Is this the best Amazon shampoo? I honestly believe so.</li>
            <li> Husband likes this shampoo. Nicely scented and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> really cannot tell much difference from other brand, but works fine</li>
            <li> The item came busted open and the smell was unbelievably strong. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> my son lves this 2 in 1 shampoo from dove. it really makes his hair bubbly :D</li>
            <li> I have always had very oily hair. Combination shampoos do not work for me. I have to use shampoo spefically for ouly hair. This works great. I need just a small amount. Smells nice and makes my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The price was right as a shaved head doesn&#x27;t use too much shampoo.. it does what it is supposed to and was much cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Smells great and leaves your head feeling refreshed and ready to start the day.  Wish it came in a larger bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li> Clean hair, smells nice</li>
            <li> I really like this... When you leave it in it gives you a nice menthol tingle on your scalp... kind of like OK... time to rinse</li>
            <li> Great price, delivered monthly, smells great what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s the same if not cheaper as in the stores. Perfect for my busy life</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that this product contains caffeine and menthol (so if you don&#x27;t like menthol sensations, then this product is not for you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a subtle fresh clean scent that is masculine, long lasting and pleasant.  Keep in mind that this is a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, so you don&#x27;t have to fuss with multiple hair care products.  It works especially well on oily type hair.  If you&#x27;ve worked up a hard sweat, this product will clean you up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the menthol, be careful about getting in your eyes (like any hair cleansing product), and don&#x27;t apply to any parts of your body where a menthol sensations will be unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the bottle of this shampoo says the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR DEEPLY CLEAN HAIR AND REFRESHMENT&lt;br /&gt;Smokey BBQs.  Muddy pitches.  A hot day.  Men relax their way.  Fresh Clean helps hair recover from all that action.  It has menthol to refresh while it washes away dirt and grease.  Your hair will be ready for more chilling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAN PROOF YOUR HAIR&lt;br /&gt;With caffeine + menthol.  For healthy looking hair full of strength and resilience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:  APPLY TO WET HAIR, LATHER AND RINSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, if helpful, below is a complete list of ingredients (in case you can identify something you are allergic to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:  WATER (AQUA), SODIUM LAURETH, SULFATE COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), DIMETHICONOL, MENTHOL, CARBOMER, CITRIC ACID, TEA-DODECYLBENZENE-SULFONATE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, TETRASODIU EDTA, DMDM HYDANTOIN, CAFFEINE, PPG-9, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Great product the smell is good.</li>
            <li> it is amazing and m good that finally dove produce somthing for mens too</li>
            <li> I like the fresh sensation it leaves on my head because of the menthol. Give it a try, it also has very good price.</li>
            <li> My fault should have saw the small green label.  The 1st time I used this not knowing they used caffeine and menthol in this shampoo, it&#x27;s like putting Vics vapor rub on your head and if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough when you rinse off other parts of your body now get hit my a lower dose of this stuff. As I type this review my head is on fire....  Unless you really need something like this stay away from it, I am tossing the rest of the bottle to the trash god..</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday for my son he love it the smell is so awesome I will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> smells good and minty fresh!</li>
            <li> After using for a couple of months, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair never really feels &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34;.  It always feels clean, but I feel like there&#x27;s a better 2-in-1 shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> the menthol is great.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this but if it&#x27;s not on sale then we get other stuff.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be writing a review for shampoo, but here it is. This shampoo is terrific! the aloe seeps into the hair and refreshes the scalp.</li>
            <li> Always made my hair feel really stiff. I will be subscribing to something else.</li>
            <li> i am feeling relax while i have a bath with that shampoo</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that makes my hair smell nice all day, even when I&#x27;m all sweaty. It feels cool on the scalp!</li>
            <li> Great product, and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Gave this to the youngest in our tribe, a good looking and clean young man, and he commented that after using the Dove Men+Care Fresh Clean Fortifying 2 in 1 (12oz), it left him with a clean hair and tingling sensation that brought a feeling of a job well done. The price was a very nice one, and since he is happy with the quality of this shampoo he suggested 4.5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Seemed to clean well, and I liked the smell, but after a couple weeks of use it had really dried out my hair and scalp. I was starting to flake pretty badly. Had to buy a tea tree oil conditioner to keep my head from drying out too much. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but it likely works fine for others.</li>
            <li> Nice product, my husband likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> meh i really dislike the smell</li>
            <li> This shampoo feel really great and amazing on the head. Aside from the cleaning aspect it feels really cool on the head and the freshness lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and it wakes me up in the morning</li>
            <li> Great 2 in 1 shampoo + conditioner, I can also recommend head and shoulder brand!</li>
            <li> It is trusted brand, everybody knows, but I never used shampoo of this brand before. It is really really very good shampoo. I buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing shampoo, being that its made with caffeine and menthol. Scent isnt very strong however i consider that a plus.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in better looking hair within 1 week, I love it.</li>
            <li> Works good, smells good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap.  Good, smelling, soap.</li>
            <li> Made my car smell pretty good since the contents of the box spilled all over. The soap is fine, but the packaging from Amazon was terrible.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair, and it does wake you up a bit with the caffeine so its perfect in the morning to get you started. Smell is good, not too overpowering, and it wont last too long after you shower.</li>
            <li> I want to give it a better rating because I use all of the Dove Men + Care products, but this one falls short in one peculiar way. I really like the way it makes my hair look and feel but when the weather is hot, I find that by the end of the day my hair looks and feels oily. This does not happen during the cold weather season, only during the hot months. So for me, it is a great fall and winter product.</li>
            <li> It makes my head tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tingling head &#x3D; clean head</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price, nice and clean, smells good</li>
            <li> Before I used this product my hair was frizzy, dull, and very damaged from lack of care. Ever since I tried this product I have noticed a HUGE difference. My hair is not nearly as oily as it used to be, frizzy, or dull. The price is amazing. I would most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It must be since it contains methanol and caffeine that my hair feels wonder after each and every use. !</li>
            <li> NIce man Smell - good conditioner....I have thin hair...and usually conditioners make them unruly - not this one...leave a decent amount of natural oils in...so Hair stay put..have a shine to them without being too stringy.</li>
            <li> Smells great, easy to use and the ladies love my hair.</li>
            <li> smells great and does the job, thats all I ask :)</li>
            <li> Just wait until you rinse! I can&#x27;t vouch for the technical cleaning &#x27;quality&#x27; of this 2 in 1 (shampoo + conditioner) as compared to others but it seems to do the job just fine. I can say that this is the first 2 in 1 that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp break out or itch after use. (Some conditioners do this to me as well.) The scent is fresh and pleasant and the very best part-- and the reason I like this so much-- when you rinse, you&#x27;re surrounded with the amazing sensation of a brief aromatherapy treatment! I originally purchased this to try out the Dove men&#x27;s line when there were some great sale prices -- now I&#x27;m hooked on the scent. I&#x27;m not a body fragrance person, so finding &#x27;a long lasting scent&#x27; has never been my mission. It leaves my hair feeling clean and not coated with product after washing. (Note: the Fresh Clean Body Wash doesn&#x27;t give you that same &#x27;aromatherapy moment&#x27; that you get from this 2 in 1.)</li>
            <li> Smells good and cleans my hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a milder shampoo for the winter when my hair tends to dry out, so decided to try Dove&#x27;s 2 in 1 option. As a shampoo it works reasonably well, though still leaves my hair dryer than I would expect for a product that includes conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is that the shampoo has been very irritating to my skin, causing peeling and flaking on my cheeks, forehead, and behind my ears. My skin is so rough it feels like it has a five o&#x27;clock shadow even when I&#x27;ve just shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to toss the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Good bottle of shampoo. I like that this battle against greasy hair. My hair looks healthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the bottle was a bit bigger though.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend, he seems to like it.  He likes the way it smells, will probably buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband, he loves how it tingles on his scalp says its refreshing after shower and feels a lot cleaner than normal shampoo. He will never use my shampoo again! Score. I order this thru my subscribe and save to auto ship and also get a wonderful discount.</li>
            <li> Excellent product met all my expectations!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair less smooth than the different shampoos I had used before.</li>
            <li> The menthaol feels really good on my scalp and this really cleans well so I no longer have to wash my hair everyday because it doesn&#x27;t get so oily</li>
            <li> The girlfriend loves the smell, it wakes me up in the morning, and I feel clean after use. What more do you want from your shampoo?</li>
            <li> Nice, straight to my door.</li>
            <li> I love this. Great shampoo (and body wash if you&#x27;re in a hurry in the mornings)</li>
            <li> good. dangerous chemicals</li>
            <li> Makes my boyfriends hair super soft and smelling delicious!</li>
            <li> My husband and father-in-law love this product line!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this shampoo cleans out my hair. I know that it isn&#x27;t as effective to use a 2-in-1 compared to two separate products, but my laziness makes me not really care. It cleans my hair out well and keeps it nice the longest in my fairly humid climate. Yeah there is menthol in here, but with my limited (there&#x27;s that lazy part) it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is that bad. It does give my head a strange cool feeling if the shampoo is in my hair for more than about thirty seconds. Even though it has menthol in it, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll change shampoos. It has a nice masculine smell that stays around for a reasonable amount of time. Basically what it comes down to is if you fear menthol go elsewhere, but if you don&#x27;t care this shampoo should work decently enough for you.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It smells good without going over the top &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; scent and leaves my hair feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of times, this shampoo is on super sale and you&#x27;re able to get it for the price of a travel size. When that happens, jump on it! You won&#x27;t regret the value for a quality 2 in 1 shampoo for men that won&#x27;t leave you smelling like you bathed in Brut.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional hair and body wash.  Hair is well conditioned after use, and the your hair does not dry out with daily use. The menthol is cooling and makes you feel very clean and very fresh.  It has a nice body and lathers well.  Perhaps most importantly, it smells clean, but not overpowering.  I use it daily and have been nothing short of impressed at the level of quality and still can&#x27;t get over that cooling menthol effect.  A great bargain compared to other men&#x27;s products costing much more and delivering much less.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fresh and clean 2 in 1 shampoo. He said it lathers really well (a must with him for shampoo) and made his scalp feel tingly and clean, almost like it was \\&quot;waking\\&quot; his hair up. I love that it leaves his hair nice and soft to the touch and gives it almost a \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; feeling. The cost of this shampoo is a bit more than what we usually pay but he likes it so much we will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Nothing can beat the price + prime shipping. Love it.</li>
            <li> It was something new to try but, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> good quality mens 2 in 1. It works, it cleans and it feels and smells good. I&#x27;m in!</li>
            <li> For the price its a decent shampoo.  However, mine over time in the shower would start to get this wierd sour smell to it whenever I opened it for use.  Also, not sure if I like the menthol effect...</li>
            <li> bought as a gift for brother</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shampoo! Moreover, this vial contains a conditioner which has medicinal and nutritional properties. Lovely of menthol flavor pairs perfectly with vitamin properties of the shampoo. After applying this product, hair remain silky and shiny. I use the products of the company Dove a long time, because I like their quality and individual approach to customers. Thank you a lot!</li>
            <li> Not the best but it&#x27;s great... Smells nice...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often wondered how you can both wash and condition hair at the same time since they&#x27;re somewhat opposing acts. This product shows that you can&#x27;t really do a good job with both simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, I have no clue if the caffeine actually accomplishes anything, but it&#x27;s a good option if you use it occassionally.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell that is released on contact! I wish it had a bit stronger conditioning power. I still have to use another conditioning product.</li>
            <li> While I like the results of this menthol shampoo, the scent is going to keep me from buying another bottle. The scent gets very strong in the shower then fades off as it dries. Several hours after use I smelled vaguely of&lt;br /&gt;Vicks rub with a woodsy note added. Dove has chosen an odd color and consistency for this shampoo. It&#x27;s a little too thick, almost translucent (probably enough said there). The shampoo washed out well after producing a very thick lather. I have a sensitive scalp and the product hasn&#x27;t been causing any itching or irritation. 4 stars for results, 2 stars for scent.</li>
            <li> This 2-in-1 daily shampoo + conditioner works well. It lathers nicely and does a very good job at cleaning the hair thoroughly without making your hair/scalp feel dry, red, itchy, etc…As I was reading the other reviews, it looks like the majority of the complaints are coming from the smell of the product more so than how it actually works. Yes, it has a relatively strong smell in comparison to other shampoos, but I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad at all. Honestly, I find the overall aroma of the shampoo to be nice and refreshing. At least the smell is not a feminine one, but rather a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell. Also the price to quantity ratio is very reasonable…</li>
            <li> This product exploded in the box due to poor packaging by Amazon. Due to the strong aromas, everything else in the shipment reeked of this stuff. Worse still, the product has an extremely strong fragrance. After using it to wash my hair, I had to wash it out with another shampoo. Awful. Avoid.</li>
            <li> I love the dove men&#x27;s line of products and was excited to try out their shampoo. This really doe a great job of cleaning your hair and has a very masculine smell. I was really excited how well it works and will definetly use again. Not sure what the caffeine is for but this product does a great job. Love the smell of this it is very manly and not too over powering.</li>
            <li> I will admit, I have never found a \\&quot;2-in-1 Shampoo and conditioner\\&quot; that was as good as shampoo and a seperate conditioner, but you know how they say \\&quot;Wash-rinse-repeat\\&quot;? The 2-in-1 products are great for the repeat part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the Fresh Clean scent and feeling it gives, so it works really well as the last part of my cleaning regimne.</li>
            <li> Unlike many Dove or other shampoos, this one REALLY has a nice lather.  And it&#x27;s not all foam; it actually works really great in small amounts as well.  Another perk is what I&#x27;m assuming is the menthol... it cleaned my scalp and took a bunch of the gunk out that had built up. I could literally feel the stuff coming off!  The smell is great (the wife likes) and she even tried it out and commented that the women&#x27;s shampoo must be all water... because even with her waist length hair, she could use a little amount of this and it worked great! She said it the women are getting ripped off! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An obvious 5 star shampoo for me!</li>
            <li> I mistakenly saw caffeine on the bottle and literally poured myself a cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is a good product. Nice tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it, put it on subscription.  Very tingly, like the scent.</li>
            <li> This 2 in 1 has a nice scent that goes along with the new Dove Men+Care line. It makes lots of suds, even on the first use. I have short hair and I don&#x27;t need a luscious conditioner. How can I tell it&#x27;s a conditioner too? It doesn&#x27;t leave that squeaky, stripped feeling. It just leaves the hair soft. I plan to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Who cares. It was an add-on. It&#x27;s just fine. It doesn&#x27;t deserve 5 stars and it doesn&#x27;t deserve 0 either. Give me a half option and that&#x27;s what it would get because WHO GIVES A F****?</li>
            <li> One of the better shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> Size was smaller than expected</li>
            <li> The product did achieve the end result that I was looking for. My hair was stiff and not soft. I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> I order this for my son. It&#x27;s a convenient 2 in 1 that smells really great. I love Dove products.</li>
            <li> Only problem I had was mine had a small leak in the bottom of the bottle. Pretty sure this isn&#x27;t a universal issue.</li>
            <li> For me as a college kid, shampoo selection usually equates to whether I want hair that&#x27;s slightly dry or greasy at a price. What I can say about this shampoo is that it sort of combines the best qualities from both sides of that spectrum, if that makes sense. It leaves your hair feeling light and completely clean. It puts hair into a state that&#x27;s very easy to work with, which is great if you use styling products. It doesn&#x27;t leave the scalp itchy, dry, or tight at all. The menthol gives it a very refreshing cooling effect, so it would probably be a great shampoo for summer or post-workout. This is worth the money, and I am poor college student saying this.</li>
            <li> Gets my hair clean, I like the cooling sensation it gives my scalp.  The only thing I&#x27;m slightly disappointed in, is it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as some other 2 in 1 products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> This stuff is definately for men. It smells manky and works great at leaving you feel like you could chop down 100 trees and build a cabin for your wife to deliver your baby.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Really does help wake you up a bit. I am a regular subscribe and save customer of this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I have short hair and only use a tiny bit. It seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> I cannot say I love the menthol &amp; caffeine feeling on my scalp.  It tingles which I guess is supposed to wake you up or something.  This may actually work a little better than intended - what really wakes you up is the knowledge you need to be careful with it and make sure you don&#x27;t get any in your eyes or even on your closed eyelids.  I was going to stop using it because of that.  But it performs very, very well if you have oily hair that is difficult to get looking decent without having to do wash, rinse, repeat.  I wash my hair once with this, don&#x27;t repeat, and it still looks good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hair is dry or even not very oily I wouldn&#x27;t buy this - it is powerful stuff that really cleans your hair super thoroughly.  But if you work construction and your hair is often filthy or you have oily hair - go for it.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t get any in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be stronger than most shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It smells okay.  However, using it causes me to get pimples on my head.  Not sure if my scalp is allergic to the caffeine or other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, works great. Its on my subscription list.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t read that it has menthol and caffeine but after initial surprise, i like the shampoo.  It gives you a nice tingle, cold feeling after you rinse it off which kind of wakes you up.  i normally just used whatever shampoo was in the shower but i might just start buying this one for me from now on.  Leaves hair feeling pretty clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man. I bought this because I&#x27;m a man. I used it and it felt great because it&#x27;s for men. Verified customer of this product, so you know i speak the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smell good now.</li>
            <li> makes my hubby smell great, but we had problems with the packaging &amp; it popped open during shipping. made a mess. a great smelling mess, but a mess. they just need to tape the lid down.</li>
            <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Affordable and cheap&lt;br /&gt;- Smells fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the 2 in 1 component isn&#x27;t so much a conditioner as it is shampoo</li>
            <li> So far so goo! No complains yet</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing! Dove is my favorite to buy him, I even sneak it sometimes because it smells so good ;)</li>
            <li> The smell is like typical &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; shampoo. Personally I do not like the smell of this shampoo, but it does what it does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the caffeine does anything. The smell is pretty nice, and it works like a 2 in 1 should. Nothing special, but most men don&#x27;t need anything special.</li>
            <li> great shampoo. leaves my hair feeling great. it was my first time using this</li>
            <li> Works well. I was hoping the smell would be nicer, but thats what I get for shopping online without knowing the product.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that an unmistakable cream, this was the most slender of the 3. It had a medium quality manly smell which I uncertainty keeps going much past the shower time. I lean toward particular shampoos and conditioners with the goal that I can let the conditioner assimilate for around 5 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t bode well to absorb your hair a cleanser and attempt to balance the impacts by including a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair, keeps money in my wallet. What more could a guy want?</li>
            <li> cleans good, and does give a &amp;#34;mentholated&amp;#34; feeling on the scalp, i just wish the scent was a little stronger, it smells great on my boyfriends hair (and mine too when i occasionally use it) but wears off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> giving this to my bf. it cares for the scalp which he really needs because he&#x27;s an athletic person</li>
            <li> Nice simple shampoo for a great price, my every day go-to product.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and my wife uses it alsoand likes it. A plus.</li>
            <li> Not really noteworthy... nice but I&#x27;ll search around for something that excites me!</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and this product works really well. didn&#x27;t realize it has caffein as well. I like Menthol, it leaves my scalp feels tingly and I love it.  fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it... cooling down my head&#x27;s skin and is good for my greasy hair</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> My fiance has thin oily hair. This 2 n 1 shampoo and conditioner keeps the oil out of his hair and makes it more fuller. Great Stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves my husbands hair clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Personally don&#x27;t like the menthol effect it has its like rubbing vix vapor rub on your face.  Doesn&#x27;t burn but makes my eyes water and opens up the lungs some people may like this effect its not for me.</li>
            <li> The menthol in this shampoo gives it a nice scent and makes it feel refreshing to use. In addition the fragrance they added is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a good job cleaning and lightly conditioning my hair, no better or worse on that front than other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do not understand however is the addition of the Caffeine. I am unclear on what exactly the purpose of putting this in a shampoo is, and I certainly didn&#x27;t get anything out of it.</li>
            <li> Like the smell and the little bit of tingling I feel in my scalp that the menthol creates.  It cleans well without drying, has a nice scent, feels nice on the scalp.  According to a study I read, caffeine has the ability to interact with your hair follicles, helping to guide your follicles&#x27; behavior and regulate hair growth. A study published in the &amp;#34;International Journal of Dermatology&amp;#34; in 2007 found that the presence of caffeine stimulated laboratory-cultured hair follicles, increasing hair growth. As a result, caffeine might help to restore hair growth, or prevent abnormal hair loss. However, the clinical effects of caffeine on promoting hair growth have not yet been thoroughly investigated.</li>
            <li> I love this flavor/version. I don&#x27;t use it daily, for fear that it might be too strong. But I use it the nights after I get back from my soccer games. What I love about this is the refreshing feel and tingle it leaves. For nights when I&#x27;m really dirty, I&#x27;ll squeeze some onto the loufa and even use it on my body. It leaves a super fresh feeling you will love.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who was tired of using two products for shampoo and conditioner. He was worried that a 2 in 1 might make his hair greasy, like other products that he has used in the past. Thankfully, this one does not. He loves it, and he is not turning back!</li>
            <li> So fresh and so clean! This is my go to for a while now. Does a great job of keeping my Dapper Dan hair squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> Hi thanks i like it smells good</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a cool soothing feeling when I use it. I especially like the smokey smell.</li>
            <li> smells great and has a 2 in 1 pop. how much easier can it get?</li>
            <li> Smells good, solid product</li>
