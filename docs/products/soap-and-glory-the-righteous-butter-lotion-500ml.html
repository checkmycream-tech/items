            <li>I suspect I&#x27;ll run through it more quickly than I&#x27;d like because it&#x27;s a thinner product, but the size is a good value</li>
            <li>and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>i love love love it</li>

            <li>This lotion smells better than anything I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Scent is great - doesn&#x27;t linger too long in a good way.</li>
            <li>the smell is wonderful and it makes your skin super soft ive been using it for about a week</li>
            <li>oh why did  a unique product like this that has that 1950&#x27;s retro vibe and scent change their ingredient list so soon?!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, but wish the ingredients were more organic or &#x27;body&#x27; friendly.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the smell, it&#x27;s a great lotion with a long list of amazing ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love the scent â€¦ skin feels smooth</li>
            <li>Great product, great smell and most importantly, really works on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is scented with their \\&quot;Original Pink\\&quot; scent as they call it, which I am completely in love with.</li>
            <li>Had bought the body butter but also wanted something that would spread all over my body after a shower very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and works very well !!</li>
            <li>woow fantastic this soap and glory&lt;</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>My twenty four year old daughter  loved the scent,  </li>
            <li>still recommend this for people who like the Pink fragrance and don&#x27;t mind sugary scents, because it is a very nice, moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other products with this scent are Clean On Me shower gel and Calm One</li>
            <li>but in a super moisturizing buttery form.</li>
            <li>OMG I am INFATUATED with this whole line of Soap and Glory (original &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; scent)!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I love it even more that the original righteous butter because it pumps out and spreads easily on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I  originally bought my first  Soap  and  Glory after watching  Samantha  Chapman from Pixiwoo.  </li>
            <li>Very silky smooth going on, soaks in quickly, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Not only is it not greasy or oily but the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Calm All bubble bath.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite product from the Soap and Glory lotion line.</li>
            <li>And the price was fair considering the size and that it&#x27;s harder to find the product in store.</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s right here.soap and</li>
            <li>The Righteous Butter Lotion supplies just the right amount of moisturizing</li>
            <li>My skin gets really dry in the winter time, so I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use S &amp; G Clean on Me because although it&#x27;s the same fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t have that super sweet note to it.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave this 4 stars is because the scent is very strong and stays with you for a long time.</li>
            <li>glory&#x27;s righteous butter lotion leaves your skin soft, lightly perfumed and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and overall product,.  </li>
            <li>My first time trying this product</li>
            <li>So smooth and all natural.</li>
            <li>:) I didn&#x27;t have to wait to long, it was shipped from over seas which I didn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>The smell stayed on for a really long time and was enjoyable.</li>
            <li>wow sweet dream</li>
            <li>and I really like that.</li>
            <li>It is very emollient</li>
            <li>AND REALLY LIKE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>you so much</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and VERY quick/easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>and it really helped.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing without being greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seller I ordered mine from was StephensonsOnline and it actually arrived pretty quickly for an overseas delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not over powering so it invites for your significant other to come close and smell you it also makes your skin feel smooth and soft</li>
            <li>In general, retro brands and products are the ones known for being better quality while sticking to their same formula for  years and years!</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the smaller size available here in the us, but it was actually larger so making the wait worth it.</li>
            <li>It settled in and warmed up and was a nice as usual.</li>
            <li>I personally like regular lotion, light smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>ON WHERE YOU LIVE I AM IN THE UNITED STATES</li>
            <li>makes skin very soft</li>
            <li>I find the scent very soft and pleasing.</li>
            <li>first purchased this specific brand and type of  body lotion in the summer of 2008 at Target.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;They made the US wait so long but was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I do not usually like body butters because they leave a greasy feel to the skin.</li>
            <li>After using only about a third of the bottle, I had to throw the rest out because I couldn&#x27;t stand that sweet smell</li>
            <li>so I feel soft and smooth without feeling even a little greasy or slimy.</li>
            <li>:  Once the lotion soaks in and the top notes of the fragrance die down, a sickly sweet dry down occurs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking sugary sweet that lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li>bottle will last a long time, so it is definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t purchased a new bottle of this in a long time(years).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s, as expected, thinner than the body butter (which I prefer) and the scent seemed a bit different as a result...but only at first.</li>

            <li> seller I ordered mine from was StephensonsOnline and it actually arrived pretty quickly for an overseas delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not over powering so it invites for your significant other to come close and smell you it also makes your skin feel smooth and soft</li>
            <li> In general, retro brands and products are the ones known for being better quality while sticking to their same formula for  years and years!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the smaller size available here in the us, but it was actually larger so making the wait worth it.</li>
            <li> It settled in and warmed up and was a nice as usual.</li>
            <li> I personally like regular lotion, light smells fresh.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> ON WHERE YOU LIVE I AM IN THE UNITED STATES</li>
            <li> makes skin very soft</li>
            <li> I find the scent very soft and pleasing.</li>
            <li> first purchased this specific brand and type of  body lotion in the summer of 2008 at Target.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;They made the US wait so long but was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I do not usually like body butters because they leave a greasy feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> After using only about a third of the bottle, I had to throw the rest out because I couldn&#x27;t stand that sweet smell</li>
            <li> so I feel soft and smooth without feeling even a little greasy or slimy.</li>
            <li> :  Once the lotion soaks in and the top notes of the fragrance die down, a sickly sweet dry down occurs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking sugary sweet that lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> bottle will last a long time, so it is definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t purchased a new bottle of this in a long time(years).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s, as expected, thinner than the body butter (which I prefer) and the scent seemed a bit different as a result...but only at first.</li>
            <li> and it moisturizes my dry legs like no other.</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product and was sad that Target quit selling it!</li>
            <li> that old bottle still has the lotion thick and the fragrance is stronger than the new 16 ounce bottle I own....and the scent lasts  longer on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i little goes a long way, so either size you buy will last a long time!!</li>
            <li> I guess I would describe it as not very sweet but not very masculine it that makes sense.</li>
            <li> LIKE I SAID IN THE REVIEW ON MY OTHER 2 PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> but other maybe&lt;br /&gt;than</li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> I go to visit my family in Little Rock during the holidays and my hands get very, very dry</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the shipper.</li>
            <li> ONLY reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is the time it took to ship and the texture, which is a little thin and the shipping time was surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t heard from them JUST A LITTLE FYI</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I notice softer skin after a few days of using this.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts for a few hours after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I found that out the hard way.</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find</li>
            <li> At least I got it!</li>
            <li> I recall when I purchased it, every time I applied it, the body lotion felt thick like butter on my hands and the fragrance was stronger and lasted longer!  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that this company didn&#x27;t catch on to that commonality if they are trying to give off that retro impression.</li>
            <li> You honestly can&#x27;t go wrong with either.</li>
            <li> Might be expensive,</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Ugly:  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Stuff smells amazing. My guy roommates even put it on because they like the scent.</li>
            <li> The Good:  This lotion works wonderful. Very silky smooth going on, soaks in quickly, and is not greasy. Very good in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  Once the lotion soaks in and the top notes of the fragrance die down, a sickly sweet dry down occurs.  I&#x27;m talking sugary sweet that lasts a long, long time. Blech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:  After using only about a third of the bottle, I had to throw the rest out because I couldn&#x27;t stand that sweet smell anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend this for people who like the Pink fragrance and don&#x27;t mind sugary scents, because it is a very nice, moisturizing lotion.  I&#x27;ll continue to use S &amp; G Clean on Me because although it&#x27;s the same fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t have that super sweet note to it.</li>
            <li> Yummy scent , great moisture!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! I love it even more that the original righteous butter because it pumps out and spreads easily on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, but wish the ingredients were more organic or &#x27;body&#x27; friendly.  Also wished the smell would last longer.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. To me, it&#x27;s kind of a perfume but in a super moisturizing buttery form. The scent doesn&#x27;t last all day but it does linger on your clothing and I really like that. The bottle is really cute as well and everyone loves good packaging.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!  My skin is super soft!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. It is very emollient and I love the scent. My husband uses Kiel&#x27;s, which I also like, but it&#x27;s nice having something more feminine.</li>
            <li> I  originally bought my first  Soap  and  Glory after watching  Samantha  Chapman from Pixiwoo.  My twenty four year old daughter  loved the scent,  so I  made her a  set by buying  several products... now all the girls want it.....</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, great light smell. makes skin very soft</li>
            <li> LIKE I SAID IN THE REVIEW ON MY OTHER 2 PRODUCTS DO NOT REPEAT DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. IF YOU ARE NOT IN A HURRY AND REALLY LIKE THIS STUFF THEN IT MY BE FOR YOU. AND I GUESS IT MAY DEPEND ON WHERE YOU LIVE I AM IN THE UNITED STATES AND IT TOOK A MONTH TO GET TO ME. AND i have ask the seller for a return label for a day now  i haven&#x27;t heard from them JUST A LITTLE FYI</li>
            <li> I can never find a lotion that both my husband and I can use. He hates anything that leaves an oil or feels greasy. This lotion gives tons of moisture but absorbs almost immediately into the skin. Scent is great - doesn&#x27;t linger too long in a good way. Will definitely buy again, and it was delivered a lot faster than I was anticipating.</li>
            <li> woow fantastic this soap and glory&lt;br /&gt;really i love love love it&lt;br /&gt; i will but other maybe&lt;br /&gt;than you so much</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the smaller size available here in the us, but it was actually larger so making the wait worth it. The price with shipping was still cheaper than i the stores here. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t purchased a new bottle of this in a long time(years).  I bought this 16 ounce size 2 months ago and the product has weakened compared to the product from 2008(when I purchased it then).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased this specific brand and type of  body lotion in the summer of 2008 at Target. It was the 8 ounce size. That was 7 years ago. I STILL have that bottle from 2008 because I was using this lotion sparingly. I recall when I purchased it, every time I applied it, the body lotion felt thick like butter on my hands and the fragrance was stronger and lasted longer!  Well, guess what...that old bottle still has the lotion thick and the fragrance is stronger than the new 16 ounce bottle I own....and the scent lasts  longer on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why oh why did  a unique product like this that has that 1950&#x27;s retro vibe and scent change their ingredient list so soon?!  In general, retro brands and products are the ones known for being better quality while sticking to their same formula for  years and years! It&#x27;s sad that this company didn&#x27;t catch on to that commonality if they are trying to give off that retro impression.</li>
            <li> OMG I am INFATUATED with this whole line of Soap and Glory (original &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; scent)!!!!!!!  I&#x27;m addicted.  Can&#x27;t get enough.  Love it ALL.  Had bought the body butter but also wanted something that would spread all over my body after a shower very quickly.  This did the trick.  Very moisturizing and VERY quick/easy to apply.  Just love it.  Cannot be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> always hunting for body lotion that&#x27;s not greasy or slimy? lotion that works all day? and has a great scent too? look no further, cuz it&#x27;s right here.soap and glory&#x27;s righteous butter lotion leaves your skin soft, lightly perfumed and lasts all day. and i little goes a long way, so either size you buy will last a long time!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and overall product,.  Too bad I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing. Sephora recently discontinued it although I hear Walgreens is picking it up. I want to smell lIke this all day. (I have looked up the EDT and dupes.) Aside from the smell, it&#x27;s a great lotion with a long list of amazing ingredients. I&#x27;m doing a good thing for myself all the while smelling great.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this product and I love it</li>
            <li> ONLY reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is the time it took to ship and the texture, which is a little thin and the shipping time was surprisingly long. It&#x27;s, as expected, thinner than the body butter (which I prefer) and the scent seemed a bit different as a result...but only at first. It settled in and warmed up and was a nice as usual. The moisturizing ingredients are impressive, not a bunch of dimethicone and mineral oil, there are some very good emollients use in the product. I suspect I&#x27;ll run through it more quickly than I&#x27;d like because it&#x27;s a thinner product, but the size is a good value so it&#x27;s maybe a wash.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite lotion.  Not only is it not greasy or oily but the smell is amazing.  I get stopped everywhere by people about the perfume I am wearing... but I am only wearing this lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this product , it smells good  and it is not greasy  at all!!!!!  Makes your skin soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> Best. Ever. Trust me.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this lotion.  My husband even uses it at night.  It just feels so good.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it&#x27;s my Fav.!! Use to buy at Sephora but they no longer sell it there, had no clue Amazon sold it. Too convenient, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love soap and glory! Its an amazing product and was sad that Target quit selling it! But I ordered it online and I got it a couple weeks after I ordered which was ok. Just happy to have the product! :) I didn&#x27;t have to wait to long, it was shipped from over seas which I didn&#x27;t know. At least I got it! overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this 4 stars is because the scent is very strong and stays with you for a long time. If you like that , then this rating would be a 5.</li>
            <li> OMG best I&#x27;ve used.  Smells so good it got lifted when I  was moved to another floor without notice and time to get my stuff together.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Saw advertised in a magazine and thought I&#x27;d try it. Have been buying it ever since! Wonderful and not greasy. My only complaint is the shipper. It takes a bit to receive mdse. So give yourself time to get products. Do not be in a rush. I found that out the hard way. Other than that...the product sells itself. I personally like regular lotion, light smells fresh. They have an ultra lotion as well, which is a bit heavier, and smell is a touch different. I just prefer the regular lotion. You honestly can&#x27;t go wrong with either. And makes great birthday and holiday gifts as well! Happy shopping!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, it smells so good, I get compliments everytime I use it.</li>
            <li> Entering my perimenopause phase in life has caused me to have drier skin. My husband even notices. Yuck. I notice softer skin after a few days of using this. My husband noticed that too. I love the way it smells. I use to buy this at sephora but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. Happy to see it on here.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> the smell is wonderful and it makes your skin super soft ive been using it for about a week and my skin has never been softer</li>
            <li> By far my favorite product from the Soap and Glory lotion line. And the price was fair considering the size and that it&#x27;s harder to find the product in store. Thanx</li>
            <li> This is a great summer lotion.  I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells better than anything I&#x27;ve ever encountered. It also moisturizes like nobody&#x27;s business. This is the world&#x27;s most perfect lotion and is all I&#x27;ll ever buy from now on.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel!</li>
            <li> My Mom uses this product.  I go to visit my family in Little Rock during the holidays and my hands get very, very dry so I used her lotion and it really helped.  I also use this after I wash my face</li>
            <li> Love the scent â€¦ skin feels smooth</li>
            <li> Love soap &amp; Glory!!!! Addicticed to their lotion and butter!!!! Makes your skin silky!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells soooo good!!! It&#x27;s not over powering so it invites for your significant other to come close and smell you it also makes your skin feel smooth and soft</li>
            <li> As stated in my review of the body butter cream....wonderful.  Great product, great smell and most importantly, really works on my dry skin.  Will not be caught without this.  If you don&#x27;t like a scented body lotion this would not work.  I find the scent very soft and pleasing.</li>
            <li> I chose to give this item five stars because it smells awesome and it moisturizes my dry legs like no other. Also, I gave it a five star rating because I ordered the product a week ago and it got to me a week later which was great considering this item is from overseas. Good job guys! I will definitely order from you guys again!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to able to get the soap and glory line online now.&lt;br /&gt;They made the US wait so long but was worth it.  This stuff smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and smells and feels great. :)</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! My favorite! Getting hard to find</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; smells awesome. It works wonders on itchy skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE this one GREAT smell and very moisturizing!! THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> The Righteous Butter Lotion supplies just the right amount of moisturizing so I feel soft and smooth without feeling even a little greasy or slimy. Absorbs quickly. Gorgeous smelling lotion, as with all of Soap and Glory&#x27;s bath products. This is scented with their \\&quot;Original Pink\\&quot; scent as they call it, which I am completely in love with. The smell lasts for a few hours after putting it on. Try it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. The scent is soap and glory&#x60;s &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; scent. It smells really good and girly. The lotion isn&#x27;t greasy and leaves my skin looking and feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> It is great to apply the lotion before I go sleep which like I sleep around the candy..wow sweet dream</li>
            <li> My favorite ever! So smooth and all natural. Smells great and is very soft and good to my skin. I totally recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I do not usually like body butters because they leave a greasy feel to the skin. This is the lotion version of The Righteous Butter and it is great. It is very moisturizing without being greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so wonderful and girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last a long time, so it is definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products with this scent are Clean On Me shower gel and Calm One Calm All bubble bath. They all go great together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller I ordered mine from was StephensonsOnline and it actually arrived pretty quickly for an overseas delivery. It was shipped from the UK and was here in about a week or so. I would definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li> The best lotion I have ever used!!  My skin gets really dry in the winter time, so I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I struggle with dry/irritated skin and this smoothed my skin almost as well as Nivea Creme. The smell stayed on for a really long time and was enjoyable. I guess I would describe it as not very sweet but not very masculine it that makes sense. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and works very well !! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion on the market. Not only does not smell great but it works great. I can put it on after my bath and you can still feel the softness of it days later. Might be expensive, But I got hooked. The body soap is just as great.</li>
