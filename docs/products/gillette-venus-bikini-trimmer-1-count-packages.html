            <li>To my pleasant surprise, they do a terrific job cleaning up unwanted hair</li>
            <li>I really like how this trimmer keeps things neat without touching your skin at all, so unlike waxing, you can use it whenever you want.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it for her with Amazon.com, thanks.</li>
            <li>Safe, fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>does exactly what its suppose to in an easy to use form factor.</li>
            <li>It trims bikini hair quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done easily, quickly, efficiently and painlessly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it costs as much for three of them as it does for 14 of the regular Venus disposables (I&#x27;d give 5 stars otherwise), but they&#x27;re great nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my pregnancy and it worked out great for when my belly was too big to be able to see downstairs clearly enough to shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast and easy for keeping things neat.</li>
            <li>I have discovered that this trimmer is great for leaving just the tiniest length of hair that I can still feel clean, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel raw and irritated.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>To me, this is better than a professional bikini wax, because of the cost &amp; time saved, the privacy, and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend finds them useful in his &#x27;manscaping&#x27; routine as well.</li>
            <li>This is my own personal grade.  </li>
            <li>and I received it in a very reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for</li>

            <li>I got this present for my daughter, and she was so static about it, she couldn&#x27;t find it any ware.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hairs a good length, not short, not long.</li>
            <li>It works really well, especially if you don&#x27;t want to be completely bare, but want a nice, neat look and feel.</li>
            <li>I was excited to finally find them, and at a pretty reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am still going to purchase them because they really do work and make the job much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li>In fact, it makes me upset how much many we spent on electric products when this thing out performs them every time.</li>
            <li>Plus, trimming in the shower is much tidier than using my electric trimmer in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man</li>
            <li>(and I didn&#x27;t even use it all that much).</li>
            <li>used to just use a razor in this area, but have sensitive skin and have had too many problems with razor bumps and ingrown hairs in recent years.</li>
            <li>well bought the electric personal trimmer (highest rated on Amazon) and didnt work nearly as well and much more bulky.</li>
            <li>I first used one of these as a bonus item in a new razor pack.  </li>
            <li>I am sure other people would like to use this.</li>
            <li>I do wish they had removable blades, but other than that they are outstanding.</li>
            <li>I got this product in a package of other razors and was so glad I tried it out since I am now sold on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since been using an electric trimmer, which has been doing a decent job but doesn&#x27;t always catch all the hair.</li>
            <li>works fine in the shower, but I thought it worked a little better on dry hair.</li>
            <li>You can never trim too much with this razor, the short blades leave you with just the right length and control.</li>
            <li>This little item is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I could use these without even looking and be sure that I wouldn&#x27;t be cut or uneven.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as an electric trimmer, and nearly as irritating as shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can use it first then shave or even shorten long hair before a bikini or Brazilian bikini wax since hair has to be a certain length.  </li>
            <li>find that the blade seems to dull quicker than the straight blades I use for shaving, but it is still a favorite item</li>
            <li>I love this little trimmer!  </li>
            <li>They really do the job like no other bikini razor.</li>
            <li>This trims very close, but does not give the bare effect, and so there&#x27;s never a chance for razor bumps or burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever seen them here on Amazon, but they&#x27;re a good deal because they last a few months.</li>
            <li>I you find it important to be \\&quot;neat\\&quot; down below</li>
            <li>Once you have trimmed a lot, then you can shave a little in the opposite direction to make sure you get a close trim.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I use Gillette Venus Sensitive Skin Disposable Razors and purchase them in bulk from Costco.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how well this worked.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it says to use it in the shower -it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested to see how long the blade lasts.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The only negative I have is that the top is not replaceable, you have to buy an entirely new trimmer whenever you need a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Keeps biking hair cropped short but without the skin irritation of shaving completely using a razor or without the risk of using scissors!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t shave bare.  </li>
            <li>As usual Amazon had exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>The razor is separated from your skin by the little comb-y things which keep the blade exactly 1/4 inch from you</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, not only does the Venus Bikini Trimmer suffer from the same problem with catching all the hair as my electric trimmer, but it was pulling out hair nearly as often as it was cutting it.</li>
            <li>SO much faster and less hassle than scissors or trimming with a leg razor.</li>
            <li>It trims my hair to just the right length, and it&#x27;s small enough to go everywhere</li>

            <li> I could use these without even looking and be sure that I wouldn&#x27;t be cut or uneven.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as an electric trimmer, and nearly as irritating as shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can use it first then shave or even shorten long hair before a bikini or Brazilian bikini wax since hair has to be a certain length.  </li>
            <li> find that the blade seems to dull quicker than the straight blades I use for shaving, but it is still a favorite item</li>
            <li> I love this little trimmer!  </li>
            <li> They really do the job like no other bikini razor.</li>
            <li> This trims very close, but does not give the bare effect, and so there&#x27;s never a chance for razor bumps or burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever seen them here on Amazon, but they&#x27;re a good deal because they last a few months.</li>
            <li> I you find it important to be \\&quot;neat\\&quot; down below</li>
            <li> Once you have trimmed a lot, then you can shave a little in the opposite direction to make sure you get a close trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I use Gillette Venus Sensitive Skin Disposable Razors and purchase them in bulk from Costco.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well this worked.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it says to use it in the shower -it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested to see how long the blade lasts.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that the top is not replaceable, you have to buy an entirely new trimmer whenever you need a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Keeps biking hair cropped short but without the skin irritation of shaving completely using a razor or without the risk of using scissors!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t shave bare.  </li>
            <li> As usual Amazon had exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The razor is separated from your skin by the little comb-y things which keep the blade exactly 1/4 inch from you</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, not only does the Venus Bikini Trimmer suffer from the same problem with catching all the hair as my electric trimmer, but it was pulling out hair nearly as often as it was cutting it.</li>
            <li> SO much faster and less hassle than scissors or trimming with a leg razor.</li>
            <li> It trims my hair to just the right length, and it&#x27;s small enough to go everywhere</li>
            <li> the hair was still long, i know that i can&#x27;t expect it to cut it super short, but i was hoping at least a manageable size.</li>
            <li> I love this product because for the first time ever, I can keep the area neat and clean without cutting myself or leaving those painful bumps that regular razors leave.  </li>
            <li> tried this product, worked great but hated using disposable.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> Trims it down so that you don’t have a plushie under your panties, or long strays sneaking out of your swimsuit, all without having to go bare and dealing with itchy regrowth and looking like your trying to look 8.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers expressed, I also wish that Gillette sold replacement heads for the trimmer like regular razors.</li>
            <li> I recommend storing this in a dry place because the blade can rust in places and become ineffective.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the mess you get with regular razors</li>
            <li> I agree with the other commentator - wish it had replaceable heads.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I will give it 5 stars when it has replaceable cartridges.</li>
            <li> Oh, and if the label here is confusing, you get 3 individual packages.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant as they are described as disposable.</li>
            <li> I tried just water, and it stung a little.</li>
            <li> This thing almost killed me and it hurt for days.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower -- no clean up required!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t let little kids get around it!  </li>
            <li> These little razors are hard to find.</li>
            <li> As others have said too bad you have to throw the whole assembly away when you could replace a blade, but that&#x27;s the way it is.</li>
            <li> Gillette should have no problem making these trimmers with replacement heads, not sure why they didn&#x27;t since almost all their products have that feature.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll echo the negative that it doesn&#x27;t have replacement heads for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> You should follow the growth when you start, and start slowly.</li>
            <li> They are a bit expensive, but I find that I can use them longer than I  would other disposable razors.</li>
            <li> No more scissors necessary (which can be a little dangerous!)!  </li>
            <li> He loves them because they leave enough hair that there is absolutely no risk of razor burn, cuts/nicks or that horrible itchiness</li>
            <li> I decided to try it to thin out the foliage around the edge of the forest.</li>
            <li> I got on Amazon looking for this item that a friend told me about and was unable to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> these are so expensive and there are no replacement heads.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job, sadly.</li>
            <li> I agree that it needs replacement heads, i hate having to store all these shavers.</li>
            <li> Trimming with an electric razor is horrible and usually painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s miserable.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best invention.  Lasts long.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer for your bikini area that shortens hair with no skin irritation.  It does not shave the skin but keeps everything short.  You can use it first then shave or even shorten long hair before a bikini or Brazilian bikini wax since hair has to be a certain length.  I definitely recommend and think for the price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even stand a leg wax, shudder at the idea of a bikini wax. And dipliatories just don&#x27;t work on the coarse hair. This fantastic product has been a savior! I agree with the other commentator - wish it had replaceable heads. Great alternative to shaving and I don&#x27;t worry about any nicks!</li>
            <li> I got on Amazon looking for this item that a friend told me about and was unable to find in stores.  It was exactly what I was looking for and I received it in a very reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Use it in the shower and have no razor bumps or burn.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could find it in more retail stores.  I am sure other people would like to use this.</li>
            <li> I first found this at Walmart. I have to say that I was impressed that such a thing existed. I like how easy it is to use and that it doesn&#x27;t cut all of the hair. Razor burn is non-existent. My hubby even uses it. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a trimmer that was disposable and did its job. This trimmer is perfect and trims the perfect length.</li>
            <li> Not as good as an electric trimmer, and nearly as irritating as shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to just use a razor in this area, but have sensitive skin and have had too many problems with razor bumps and ingrown hairs in recent years. I&#x27;ve since been using an electric trimmer, which has been doing a decent job but doesn&#x27;t always catch all the hair. After reading all of the enthusiastic reviews, I was excited to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, not only does the Venus Bikini Trimmer suffer from the same problem with catching all the hair as my electric trimmer, but it was pulling out hair nearly as often as it was cutting it. Two days after trying this product, and I still have dozens of itchy razor bumps only in the specific areas where I tried out this trimmer. Definitely switching back to the electric, and would not recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t keep their hair very short to begin with.</li>
            <li> This is the Bikini trimmer from Venus.  This little item is fantastic!  It trims bikini hair quickly and evenly.  You don&#x27;t get the mess you get with regular razors and you don&#x27;t clump up your razor.  I love this little trimmer!  Great idea.  The only negative I have is that the top is not replaceable, you have to buy an entirely new trimmer whenever you need a replacement.  Gillette should have no problem making these trimmers with replacement heads, not sure why they didn&#x27;t since almost all their products have that feature.  Anyway, I am still going to purchase them because they really do work and make the job much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Keeps biking hair cropped short but without the skin irritation of shaving completely using a razor or without the risk of using scissors! I&#x27;m surprised how well it worked. I&#x27;ll echo the negative that it doesn&#x27;t have replacement heads for the trimmer. In fact, that&#x27;s why I was just on Amazon looking to see if I could get replacement heads. If they were available, I&#x27;d give this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> tried this product, worked great but hated using disposable. well bought the electric personal trimmer (highest rated on Amazon) and didnt work nearly as well and much more bulky. its a shame these are so expensive and there are no replacement heads. I you find it important to be \\&quot;neat\\&quot; down below but dont want to look like a prepubescent girl- I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These things are great. Trimming with an electric razor is horrible and usually painful. Shaving is just asking for suffering. This is the most effective, painless, and easiest to use bikini area product we have tried yet. In fact, it makes me upset how much many we spent on electric products when this thing out performs them every time. I was a little hesitant as they are described as disposable. But you honestly get plenty of uses out of one before you need to toss it. So a package of 3 will last quite a while. Very happy. Definitely would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Nice razor.  Does the job.  Trims hair well.  The idea of safety built into the razor is great.  No cuts, no blood.</li>
            <li> Works great, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting nicked or anything. Last&#x27;s quite awhile and the price is great here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this bikini trimmer! It&#x27;s perfect for keeping my bikini area trim and tidy. I use it in the shower -- no clean up required! It gets the job done easily, quickly, efficiently and painlessly. I wish this product was easier to find and had replaceable heads. Nevertheless, I give it 5 stars for being such a wonderful product!  P.S. I use Gillette Venus Sensitive Skin Disposable Razors and purchase them in bulk from Costco. There is always a Gillette Venus Bikini Trimmer in the package. Because of that, I&#x27;ve never had to buy the Gillette Venus Bikini Trimmer separately.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well this worked. I used to get bikini waxes, but for various reasons - the expense, the pain, the time, etc., I quit going. To me, this is better than a professional bikini wax, because of the cost &amp; time saved, the privacy, and no skin irritation. I really like how this trimmer keeps things neat without touching your skin at all, so unlike waxing, you can use it whenever you want. I was surprised that it says to use it in the shower -it works fine in the shower, but I thought it worked a little better on dry hair. I&#x27;m interested to see how long the blade lasts. Like the other reviewers, I will give it 5 stars when it has replaceable cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s miserable.  I can&#x27;t wax.  I can&#x27;t nair.  I can&#x27;t shave bare.  So when I stumbled upon this tool I was amazed!  I can keep my hair trimmed *very* short, *very* neat, and very effectively with this tool!  And, the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my incredibly sensitive skin because the blade never touches my skin!  For anyone not wanting to go bare, or anyone with skin too sensitive to do so, this tool is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this. SO much faster and less hassle than scissors or trimming with a leg razor. Trims it down so that you don’t have a plushie under your panties, or long strays sneaking out of your swimsuit, all without having to go bare and dealing with itchy regrowth and looking like your trying to look 8.</li>
            <li> These little razors are hard to find. They work great though. I was excited to finally find them, and at a pretty reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Ladies, we all know waxing hurts, and shaving leaves itchy stubble. I have discovered that this trimmer is great for leaving just the tiniest length of hair that I can still feel clean, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel raw and irritated. And it is painless!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my pregnancy and it worked out great for when my belly was too big to be able to see downstairs clearly enough to shave. Great for doctors so that they can see the business without worries and not have to deal with shaving bumps. I do wish they had removable blades, but other than that they are outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer! It&#x27;s so fast and easy for keeping things neat. For someone like me who doesn&#x27;t really care to put a lot of time and effort into these things, this is perfect! I have never once cut myself with it, and it keeps everything even at a good length if you&#x27;re not into being prepubescent bald.</li>
            <li> Have been looking everywhere locally to buy just trimmer without having to purchase razor set.  As usual Amazon had exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> These bikini trimmers are such a great idea.  It&#x27;s basically a guarded razor &amp; it trims the bikini area very nicely.  No more scissors necessary (which can be a little dangerous!)!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. It is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. The only downside to this is you can&#x27;t replace the top.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this bikini trimmer by Gillette. It works really well, especially if you don&#x27;t want to be completely bare, but want a nice, neat look and feel. It also eliminates the fear of nicks and razor bumps. Like some of the other reviewers expressed, I also wish that Gillette sold replacement heads for the trimmer like regular razors. I purchased it in a set with a Venus razor, so I&#x27;m happy that Amazon sells them like this. I will definitely buy this product again. I recommend storing this in a dry place because the blade can rust in places and become ineffective.</li>
            <li> One of these came in a pack of razors I bought for my daughter recently. I decided to try it to thin out the foliage around the edge of the forest. Works great! Dramatically reduces the danger of nicking one of the boys, and doesn&#x27;t trim so close that there&#x27;s itchy irritation a day or two later. I can&#x27;t believe it costs as much for three of them as it does for 14 of the regular Venus disposables (I&#x27;d give 5 stars otherwise), but they&#x27;re great nonetheless. Plus, trimming in the shower is much tidier than using my electric trimmer in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man tested, girlfriend approved.</li>
            <li> safer, easier to use and more effective than an electric razor. my boyfriend finds them useful in his &#x27;manscaping&#x27; routine as well.</li>
            <li> This basically trims, it is not a close shave. That works for me. It basically gives you a &#x27;cleaner&#x27;, neat look. And I feel its more hygienic that way. It&#x27;s easy to use. I keep mine out of the shower when not using it to prevent rust, and it lasts forever that way.</li>
            <li> I got this present for my daughter, and she was so static about it, she couldn&#x27;t find it any ware. I am glad I found it for her with Amazon.com, thanks.</li>
            <li> Yep, Manscaping. I gave these to my husband and now his area is nice and tidy. He loves them because they leave enough hair that there is absolutely no risk of razor burn, cuts/nicks or that horrible itchiness one gets when hair grows back.</li>
            <li> I first used one of these as a bonus item in a new razor pack.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store.  It is the perfect tool for the job.  Just don&#x27;t let little kids get around it!  It resembles a comb- with quite a different effect!  LOL  I&#x27;ve ordered it several times now... Haven&#x27;t found anything better!</li>
            <li> This trims very close, but does not give the bare effect, and so there&#x27;s never a chance for razor bumps or burn. I&#x27;ve used the same blade for over a month with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers.  Glad I could get three at one time.  The movable parts are not what I am looking for when I take care of this area.  That is why these trimmers are the best!</li>
            <li> does exactly what its suppose to in an easy to use form factor. As others have said too bad you have to throw the whole assembly away when you could replace a blade, but that&#x27;s the way it is.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job, sadly. the hair was still long, i know that i can&#x27;t expect it to cut it super short, but i was hoping at least a manageable size.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for my wife, but sat idly in the closet. I decided to put my investment to use and give these a shot myself. To my pleasant surprise, they do a terrific job cleaning up unwanted hair anywhere you&#x27;ve got it. I imagine some guys may prefer to trim places I don&#x27;t or don&#x27;t need to and these would surely come in handy there too.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these at a CVS pharmacy last year and went to get another one recently only to find there were none to be had in any store. Went on line and found out from Gillette that they are only sold at Amazon.com. so ordered them. Was so happy to finally find them. They really do the job like no other bikini razor. Safe, fast and efficient. If you haven&#x27;t tried one of these, you will never use another razor the the bikini area again!</li>
            <li> Why not simplify your life and stay neat and groomed.  So easy without fear of injury!  It is priced fairly.  Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> This is my own personal grade.  This thing almost killed me and it hurt for days.  (and I didn&#x27;t even use it all that much).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using these for the rest of my life.  I always struggled with using my razor along the grain to try to trim up, but these are the easiest trimmers out there.  The razor is separated from your skin by the little comb-y things which keep the blade exactly 1/4 inch from you&#x27;re skin, ensuring an even trim with every stroke and zero razor burn or ingrown hairs because the blade never touches you.  I could use these without even looking and be sure that I wouldn&#x27;t be cut or uneven.  I&#x27;ve only ever seen them here on Amazon, but they&#x27;re a good deal because they last a few months.</li>
            <li> I love this product because for the first time ever, I can keep the area neat and clean without cutting myself or leaving those painful bumps that regular razors leave.  I got this product in a package of other razors and was so glad I tried it out since I am now sold on it.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for the shower.  It is quick and easy to use.  I bought the kit from the store but loved the razor so much that when I couldn&#x27;t find it locally I was more than happy to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the blade seems to dull quicker than the straight blades I use for shaving, but it is still a favorite item and I will continue to seek them out and use this product.</li>
            <li> I agree that it needs replacement heads, i hate having to store all these shavers. When you use this, remember water and soap is your friend, like with shaving. I tried just water, and it stung a little. Use lots of soap! You should follow the growth when you start, and start slowly. Once you have trimmed a lot, then you can shave a little in the opposite direction to make sure you get a close trim. It leaves the hairs a good length, not short, not long.</li>
            <li> These do just what they&#x27;re supposed to--trim to about 1/4 inch.  Oh, and if the label here is confusing, you get 3 individual packages.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It trims evenly and safely! I will buy another because it is very cost effective!</li>
            <li> I used to use an electric clipper to trim my bikini area, but that was quite bulky, so I decided to try this trimmer.  It is perfect!  It trims my hair to just the right length, and it&#x27;s small enough to go everywhere I want it to.  It lasts for many uses too.</li>
            <li> You can never trim too much with this razor, the short blades leave you with just the right length and control. They are a bit expensive, but I find that I can use them longer than I  would other disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Love this item can not find it in stores where I live great conditions and excellent timing. Recommend to everyone looking for something like this works great been using it for a long while now</li>
