            <li> Coty Airspun has been my favorite loose powder for a long time, but it is no longer available in stores in this shade.  </li>

            <li> So happy to have found this item.</li>
            <li> It was missing the powder puff and taped up with normal tape on the side so it had been opened.  Not the best product I have ever received on this site.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years now, I feel very comfortable using it and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great product, can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore, fast shipping, everything is good</li>
            <li> hate the quality of the product. it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> Works great for different skin tones. Blends in easy.  Was recommended by a make up artist but no longer carried in stores.</li>
            <li> I only apply once in the morning. When I am away from home I use another product. A small compact for oily spots.&lt;br /&gt;I have occasional oily spots on my forehead when outside on a hot day.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased by me, but it was for my mother.  She loves it.  Mother lives in an area that has Coty products, but not this one.  So do I.  But I told her, &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s go online and see,&amp;#34; and there it was at amazon.com.  I told her I had always had success with amazon.com&#x27;s deliveries, AND you delivered to her when you said you would, as usual.  Thanks Again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L. Orr&lt;br /&gt;Austin, Texas</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this color for months.  I was so excited when I found it.&lt;br /&gt;Received order is a timely manner</li>
            <li> Love it been using it for years!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t evaluate this product at this moment, because my wife didn&#x27;t use it yet. However it is made in China, and we weren&#x27;t aware about it. My wife usually buy cosmetic products from USA or Europe, no Chinese. It&#x27;s why I gave a neutral evaluation for this product.</li>
            <li> Love this powder as it is wonderful on top of makeup.  Hard to find!  Thank you for keeping it in stock!</li>
            <li> I have used this powder for years and it is wonderful. I am now unable to find the Rosey Beige color in stores so I was relieved to find it on Amazon. At 51 years old, my complexion has some challenges. This provides a truly lovely finish. I recently was shopping and was stopped by a woman who commented on how beautiful my skin is. That totally made my day and Coty Airspun is the reason.</li>
            <li> Coty Airspun has been my favorite loose powder for a long time, but it is no longer available in stores in this shade.  I thought it had been discontinued, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  This is the perfect loose powder to set your foundation and does not have a heavy powdery look that most of the pressed powders have.  I hope I can continue to purchase this at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed . Picture shows an open top easy access to the powder.What we got was a plastic holder . I could have purchased this a million times in any store. That was why I  was so excited to get it for my Mom, it is very hard to get the powder out of the tiny holes that are on the plastic one.If a certain picture is shown that is what you should expect in the mail. Will never order from this site again.</li>
            <li> My Mom has used this for years and was no longer able to find it in the local drugstore, so she was very pleased to see you still offered it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 90 year old mother....she had a heck of a time just opening the envelope it was sent in....and once the envelope was open she couldn&#x27;t open the container holding the powder....packaging and product should take &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; citizens into consideration....I probably wil not buy this again !</li>
            <li> I have used Coty face powder for years.  Occasionally I&#x27;ve tried another brand and I always go back to Coty.  It covers minor blemishes well and my skin looks so natural.  I was almost out and was so pleased to find it on Amazon.  Virginia Anderson</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 boxes of one color.  One box arrived in the color I ordered; the second was incorrect.  Can&#x27;t go through the aggravation and&lt;br /&gt;expense of returning it.  The powder is a good product, however.</li>
            <li> I have used for years and like it very much.</li>
            <li> Amazon has what we need.  This powder is great and very hard to find in many shades.  Well worth the cost. and we got it quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this powder on my skin. I strongly recommend it for light or fair skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my Mom, she loves it, A classic !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this very same powder for years - and like it as much now as when I started.  My only worry is that the company will stop making my shade.  Thanks for having it for me!</li>
