            <li>It&#x27;s the best popcorn I&#x27;ve ever eaten!!!</li>
            <li>All of the Quinn popcorn flavors are wonderful!</li>
            <li>This is the best tasting popcorn I have ever had!  </li>
            <li>It took me about 5 bags before I figured out how to get the perfect pop.</li>
            <li>But soooo good!!!!</li>
            <li>Flavor is great though.</li>
            <li>love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>Also good, the maple syrup flavor and the sea salt.</li>
            <li>Unique and delicious herby flavor.</li>
            <li>It has quickly become my go to snack!!!</li>
            <li>Try a variety pack to find your favorite, but this is mine!</li>
            <li>Tastes delicious, healthy and fresh!</li>
            <li>Wonderful - crisp and tasty with the seasoning and oil added.  </li>
            <li>Our favorite is the lemon!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Quinn popcorn!</li>
            <li>Tastes great, no GMOs, easy to make.</li>
            <li>Pop your own popcorn on the stove and throw some spices and oil in it, people.</li>
            <li>In a class of its own</li>
            <li>My favorite flavor although they all are so good.</li>
            <li>To be honest-</li>
            <li>so this is a really nice flavor.</li>
            <li>Welcome the world&#x27;s first truly healthy microwave popcorn.</li>
            <li>On top of that I don&#x27;t care for the idea that the paper bags may be lined with a chemical.  </li>
            <li>More vegan-friendly flavors, please :)</li>
            <li>However, this popcorn has a much better taste than storebought varieties like orville and others - you control the seasoning with the oil and flavor packets.</li>
            <li>They seemed okay with it.</li>
            <li>wait to get more.....</li>
            <li>but then I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I think I like the hickory smoked cheese flavor better.</li>
            <li>Words cannot even describe how much I love this popcorn.</li>
            <li>I LOVE all of Quinn&#x27;s flavors-</li>
            <li>which I love-</li>
            <li>You then drizzle olive oil on top (I&#x27;m guessing about 2 tsps).  </li>
            <li>Love all the Quinn&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>As much as I love movie popcorn, I feel like i&#x27;m killing myself when I eat it.  </li>
            <li>This popcorn isn&#x27;t cheap, but it tastes so good it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I love these products and I hope they continue to be available for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quinn Popcorn is my dream come true!  </li>
            <li>healthy great alternative than your regular microwave popcorn.</li>
            <li>A simple paper bag and pure, delicious  ingredients!</li>
            <li>This is fabulous popcorn .</li>
            <li>Quinn is a way to enjoy the stuff, and not die.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the BEST popcorn (&amp; I am not a huge fan of popcorn).  </li>
            <li>:) The tarragon adds just a tiny bit of sweetness, and the other herbs are perfectly balanced.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this popcorn on amazon at a better price than Whole Foods and so I ordered several.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tried the Olive Oil and Herbs, so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, all of Quinn Popcorn that I have tried (every flavor so far) has been high quality, and delicious (although the lemon flavor is my least favorite so far).</li>
            <li>Very tasty popcorn as it arrived on a timely basis!</li>
            <li>I came across Quinn Popcorn for the first time at &amp;#34;Cravings&amp;#34; in Lansing, MI, a popcorn store.</li>
            <li>I decided to write about this one though because hands down it is my bf&#x27;s favorite, and among their flavors it is unique, because of the Olive Oil.</li>
            <li>All the other flavors use another type of oil- like safflower or something, but this flavor uses Olive Oil which gives the popcorn a nice nutty flavor combined with the garlic, oregano-</li>
            <li>Great for this happy little vegan :) Quinn is a really stellar company -- eco conscious and makes you feel a lot less icky about eating microwave popcorn.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t tried their new more traditional flavors of salt and butter, etc.</li>
            <li>This is one of the flavors that I really</li>
            <li>Really like this popcorn.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d probably really dislike that aspect of this flavor.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I figure I&#x27;d mention it, so it&#x27;s not a surprise to anyone when they try it.</li>
            <li>No problem like this when I buy Quinn from Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>Way better than other microwave popcorn and certainly healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of earth and body friendly ingredients/practices.</li>
            <li>I backed this company on Kickstarter a  long time ago and just a few days ago saw their product on my local supermarket shelf, which makes me so happy for them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the other flavors but this one is my all time fav.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>These are mature flavors made from real ingredients.</li>
            <li>only downside is that these are slightly more messy than a normal bag of popcorn, but it is certainly made up for by the quality and flavor superiority!</li>
            <li>I bought this and a few other of their flavors on a whim at my local Whole Foods originally, when I wanted to try more of their flavors (trust me</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t sold anywhere near me (1.5 hours away from Lansing), so I have been ordering online.</li>
            <li>Wish I had just stuck to buying this at Whole Foods as I now have several boxes of popcorn that is basically inedible.</li>
            <li>Good popcorn, albeit a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li>We liked a little less the hickory and the lemon flavored.</li>
            <li>whatever other herbs might be in there really reminds me of garlic bread-</li>
            <li>Very tasty, not very greasy!</li>
            <li>I have a lactose intolerance, and finding microwave popcorn that is completely dairy free can be tough.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, not all kernals pop, and I usually get a bag only half full.</li>
            <li> At $6 for a box of two bags, neither of which I got to eat, thanks to the entire contents of both bags burning WAY before they were through popping, I&#x27;M NOT OKAY WITH IT.</li>
            <li> I was crushed when they stopped carrying them in my local grocery.</li>
            <li> Quinn is a small producer that seems to be new to Amazon - maybe even to the world...</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re one of those people who feels like popcorn is dry to eat and gets stuck in your throat-</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it was bad, just not my favorite of their flavors</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the same I have with any microwaveable popcorn - if you want maximum kernels popped you risk burning popped corn as well.</li>
            <li> They stay partially balled up and get burnt.  </li>
            <li> Plain popcorn is about ten cents a silo - I wish the inventors were as ashamed of their pricing and poor quality as I am of myself for being lazy enough to buy it in the first place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basic plain popcorn.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all the herbs - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> it would only be that the herbs are dry, so if you get a bite with a bunch of them in it, that it can feel a little like eating a bunch of pieces of small dried leaves (which basically you are!)in with your popcorn.</li>
            <li> Love the idea of non gmo, non chemical crap.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble getting it all to pop without burning some of it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was stored improperly or what</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be stopping at two consecutive wasted bags of this over-priced failure.</li>
            <li> The seasoning seemed to stick to the bottom of the bag, no matter how hard you shook it.</li>
            <li> but I seriously MUST have this popcorn.</li>
            <li> some may not like the subtle flavor of the olive oil &amp; herbs, but you can always add some yourself.  </li>
            <li> But at least Amazon sells it!  </li>
            <li> I did get at least two boxes that had the wrong flavor in them.</li>
            <li> That being said, I sadly gave this flavor a 3 star because it has nutritional yeast in it.</li>
            <li> I randomly picked it up since it was clearance at Ralphs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Olive oil and Herbs flavor has nutritional yeast in it so it almost tastes cheesy.</li>
            <li> Ill be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as something is wrong with the popcorn I received.  </li>

            <li> I have a lactose intolerance, and finding microwave popcorn that is completely dairy free can be tough.  On top of that I don&#x27;t care for the idea that the paper bags may be lined with a chemical.  This popcorn isn&#x27;t cheap, but it tastes so good it is worth every penny.  Delicious.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying that I adore Quinn popcorn. I&#x27;m a big fan of earth and body friendly ingredients/practices. That being said, I sadly gave this flavor a 3 star because it has nutritional yeast in it. Nothing wrong with that, it&#x27;s just not my favorite flavor. I bought this online and assumed it would just be olive oil and herbs. Just something to look out for when you&#x27;re purchasing this product. No issue with nutritional yeast (or never tried it), then give it a try! I wouldn&#x27;t say it was bad, just not my favorite of their flavors</li>
            <li> I bought this and a few other of their flavors on a whim at my local Whole Foods originally, when I wanted to try more of their flavors (trust me they are all good!!) I went to the Internet world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn doesn&#x27;t have toxic bags or faux flavors. A simple paper bag and pure, delicious  ingredients! It&#x27;s the best popcorn I&#x27;ve ever eaten!!! Yum!!!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!! healthy great alternative than your regular microwave popcorn. will definitely be buying this item again ...still have a couple flavors to try</li>
            <li> Unique and delicious herby flavor. Great for this happy little vegan :) Quinn is a really stellar company -- eco conscious and makes you feel a lot less icky about eating microwave popcorn. More vegan-friendly flavors, please :)</li>
            <li> All of the Quinn popcorn flavors are wonderful! These are mature flavors made from real ingredients. I was crushed when they stopped carrying them in my local grocery.</li>

However, this popcorn has a much better taste than storebought varieties like orville and others - you control the seasoning with the oil and flavor packets. Also good, the maple syrup flavor and the sea salt. We liked a little less the hickory and the lemon flavored.</li>
            <li> This is the best tasting popcorn I have ever had!  However, not all kernals pop, and I usually get a bag only half full.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer happily mentioned that it only took them FIVE BAGS to figure out how to properly pop this crap. They seemed okay with it. At $6 for a box of two bags, neither of which I got to eat, thanks to the entire contents of both bags burning WAY before they were through popping, I&#x27;M NOT OKAY WITH IT. And, yes, I stopped the microwave well before there was any delay between pops. I&#x27;ll be stopping at two consecutive wasted bags of this over-priced failure. Plain popcorn is about ten cents a silo - I wish the inventors were as ashamed of their pricing and poor quality as I am of myself for being lazy enough to buy it in the first place. Pop your own popcorn on the stove and throw some spices and oil in it, people. It&#x27;s not rocket science.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous popcorn . In a class of its own</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my sister -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The was a refreshing take on normally unhealthy microwave popcorn!  Quinn is a small producer that seems to be new to Amazon - maybe even to the world...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this flavor (olive oil and herbs) along with the lemon - both were amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to get more.....</li>
            <li> My favorite flavor although they all are so good. Tastes delicious, healthy and fresh!</li>
            <li> It took me about 5 bags before I figured out how to get the perfect pop. but then I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful - crisp and tasty with the seasoning and oil added.  I don&#x27;t use all the herbs - a little goes a long way.  But soooo good!!!!</li>
            <li> Good popcorn, albeit a bit on the expensive side. The seasoning seemed to stick to the bottom of the bag, no matter how hard you shook it. I think I like the hickory smoked cheese flavor better.</li>
            <li> Yummy popcorn without butter!  Go Vegan!</li>
            <li> Really like this popcorn. I have trouble getting it all to pop without burning some of it. Flavor is great though. I did get at least two boxes that had the wrong flavor in them. We got smokey cheddar in the box labeled butter and sea salt. Our favorite is the lemon!</li>
            <li> Words cannot even describe how much I love this popcorn. My local grocery store teased me with it by carrying it for a couple weeks and now they don&#x27;t stock it anymore. I&#x27;ve never ordered any food products from the internet but I seriously MUST have this popcorn. I&#x27;ve tried most of the other flavors but this one is my all time fav.</li>
            <li> To be honest- I LOVE all of Quinn&#x27;s flavors- well, all the ones I&#x27;ve tried. I still haven&#x27;t tried their new more traditional flavors of salt and butter, etc. But, my bf and I have tried 5 of their others and we are fans of all of them. I decided to write about this one though because hands down it is my bf&#x27;s favorite, and among their flavors it is unique, because of the Olive Oil. All the other flavors use another type of oil- like safflower or something, but this flavor uses Olive Oil which gives the popcorn a nice nutty flavor combined with the garlic, oregano- whatever other herbs might be in there really reminds me of garlic bread- which I love- so this is a really nice flavor. An added bonus is I think this flavor is the lowest calorie of their flavors.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to give one criticism it would only be that the herbs are dry, so if you get a bite with a bunch of them in it, that it can feel a little like eating a bunch of pieces of small dried leaves (which basically you are!)in with your popcorn. So, if you&#x27;re one of those people who feels like popcorn is dry to eat and gets stuck in your throat- you&#x27;d probably really dislike that aspect of this flavor. It really doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I figure I&#x27;d mention it, so it&#x27;s not a surprise to anyone when they try it.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this through Amazon.  Rather, my local grocery store.  I randomly picked it up since it was clearance at Ralphs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST popcorn (&amp; I am not a huge fan of popcorn).  Since having it, I have craved this each day.  It&#x27;s basic plain popcorn.  You then drizzle olive oil on top (I&#x27;m guessing about 2 tsps).  Then you shake to mix.  Follow with the spice pack (which is killer).  I have to fight my family off when I cook this as a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed that I can&#x27;t find this locally.  But at least Amazon sells it!  Ill be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Quinn popcorn! So far I&#x27;ve only tried the Olive Oil and Herbs, so good. I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest! The Olive oil and Herbs flavor has nutritional yeast in it so it almost tastes cheesy. I highly recommend it. :) The tarragon adds just a tiny bit of sweetness, and the other herbs are perfectly balanced. Everyone I&#x27;ve had try it is hooked!</li>
            <li> Tastes great, no GMOs, easy to make. Way better than other microwave popcorn and certainly healthier. Finally, a salty guilt-free snack!</li>
            <li> Very tasty, not very greasy!</li>
            <li> Love all the Quinn&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.  some may not like the subtle flavor of the olive oil &amp; herbs, but you can always add some yourself.  Love the idea of non gmo, non chemical crap.  As much as I love movie popcorn, I feel like i&#x27;m killing myself when I eat it.  Quinn is a way to enjoy the stuff, and not die.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this popcorn on amazon at a better price than Whole Foods and so I ordered several.  I was very disappointed as something is wrong with the popcorn I received.  Not sure if it was stored improperly or what but I can&#x27;t get the kernels to fully pop.  They stay partially balled up and get burnt.  No problem like this when I buy Quinn from Whole Foods.  Wish I had just stuck to buying this at Whole Foods as I now have several boxes of popcorn that is basically inedible.</li>
            <li> Quinn Popcorn is my dream come true!  Welcome the world&#x27;s first truly healthy microwave popcorn. It has quickly become my go to snack!!!</li>
