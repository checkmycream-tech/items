            <li>I love this, and would definately recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>It works best on short hair.</li>
            <li>I love this scent</li>
            <li>What could be better?</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my permed hair.</li>
            <li>While my daughter and I love this product, my wife finds it to be \\&quot;just</li>
            <li>I still love my spiral perms, lots of curls.</li>
            <li>TRY IT :-)</li>
            <li>I LOVE Herbal Essences products.  </li>
            <li>Love this smell, and it works well</li>
            <li>hair and I both simply love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>A hair dresser told me it&#x27;s because its drying your scalp then produces more oil to balence out the dryness thus a greasy scalp.</li>
            <li>I wish the conditioner was better.</li>
            <li>might work better on someone who has normal/silky hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my very favorite shampoos, gives your hair so much volume and bounce!!</li>
            <li>have long, naturally-curly hair, and this is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good shampoo, it froths up really well and feels good while using it.</li>
            <li>It has an attractive scent and it cleans my hair without stripping the natural oils.</li>
            <li>The scent has a pleasant fruit note that my daughter is particularly fond of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this shampoo system has worked for so many people, but unfortunately it is not for me.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in in-shower products.  </li>
            <li>The scent is good, but is almost completely gone by the time it dries.  </li>
            <li>This works great, lifts up my hair to give it a big full look.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair that is very fine.</li>
            <li>It really leaves your hair smelling great and clean and shining plus soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft and feeling great!</li>
            <li>I have stick straight hair and I still love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Why not change the name to Sweet Fruity Essences?</li>
            <li>After I did that, my curls are full and bouncy, and my hair is so shiny.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip all of the natural oils out, yet cleans effectively.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really maintains bounce, and even makes my hair slightly curlier :D</li>
            <li>I used to love this shampoo, it was fabulous for my curls and the only brand I would use -- I was very loyal --</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super curly hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend:)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, smells fantastic and it gets my hair super clean and really shiny.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just about the only kind I use.</li>
            <li>Works as intended and is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was surprised love</li>
            <li>but now I love how naturally curly my hair</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and was delivered right to my door!  </li>
            <li>I know it sounds ridiculous, but it&#x27;s true, lol.</li>
            <li>I inhaled the suds accurately and seriously nearly choked to death.</li>
            <li>Also this shampoo is actually more of a blue pastel color which I thought would be purple, because of the color of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it!  </li>
            <li>If they could improve the formula, make it more moisturizing and detangling, then I&#x27;d be totally sold.</li>
            <li>Turns out she now likes it because she&#x27;s had good results after using it a few times.  </li>
            <li>This smells really great, but it&#x27;s not good for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It does an okay job cleaning hair, but leaves it feeling very dry.</li>
            <li>It smells really fruity too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like wearing it straight</li>
            <li>/&gt; but not that much</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than I could buy it at the store.  </li>
            <li>the smell delivery was fast will order again</li>
            <li>My wife has straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, she says it leaves her straight hair very manageable</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, doesn&#x27;t make it curl.</li>
            <li>I really like how well this shampoo works on my hair.</li>
            <li>I always thought I wanted my hair to be straight</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter if you have curly or straight hair</li>
            <li>It even looks darker and greasy but the weriod thing is that its very drying.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very poufy and frizzy.</li>
            <li>and this really brings out the curl.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t do any more for me than any other of their products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(She&#x27;s been sneaking using it after she ran out of what she normally uses.. ha ha)  </li>
            <li>Puts the spring back in my curls &amp; leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>and I do NOT like the new sticky-sweet-candy smell.</li>
            <li>Could totally live without it.</li>
            <li>I am finding it more difficult to buy this particular product, in my local stores and was pleased to find it here.</li>
            <li>Usually use more natural products but was trying to save a few bucks, ended up wasting more money.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li>Funny how when I was younger</li>
            <li>I prefer that my natural hair stay nappy.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m growing out my natural color, which may have accounted for the difference on my ends and roots).  </li>
            <li>I got this for my wife because we could no longer find it in the stores near us.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and have already been using this product.</li>
            <li>It does, however, leave the hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>it adds shine and makes my hair so soft after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Previously it had a true &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; lavender scent, now it is a sugary-sweet-candy odor --</li>
            <li>The funny thing is that despite being so thick, it doesn&#x27;t soften the hair very much.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I find that this shampoo does not dry out our hair</li>

            <li> it adds shine and makes my hair so soft after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Previously it had a true &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; lavender scent, now it is a sugary-sweet-candy odor --</li>
            <li> The funny thing is that despite being so thick, it doesn&#x27;t soften the hair very much.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I find that this shampoo does not dry out our hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and after a while of using other shampoos it seems&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair goes flat.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely long, wavy, and coarse</li>
            <li> But, it feels thick because I have so much of it!  </li>
            <li> Left my hair greasy, flat, dry, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I would think someone that reaches for a product called &amp;#34;Herbal Essences&amp;#34; is looking for a natural herbal fragrance, not a sweet fruity scent.</li>
            <li> Thats hard to do with long hair, others I have tried softens the cirls to much.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually leaves the curl in my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This creamy shampoo smells heavenly (like all Herbal Essences products I have tried), but my very wavy thick and dry hair did not seem to benefit from it.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair really dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Item received as expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soapy compare to other brand.  </li>
            <li> other thing I like with this shampoo</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find a shampoo that tames my curls, but this shampoo definitely did the job!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if it doesn&#x27;t saturate in previously dyed hair well</li>
            <li> It seemed to gunk up and dull my roots and leave my ends dry and straw-like.  </li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned my hair once I received the product, because the curls were a little dull, and my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair curl up on ends a little.</li>
            <li> it just does not have as much spring to it anymore and ever since I have found this one there are days it can just get crazy curly as my daughter likes to call it.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out, wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> But then a few years ago they changed the fragrance</li>
            <li> A few days ago my wife told me she changed her mind about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and found that Herbal Essences Totally twisted Curl Shampoo works with my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using product or drying my hair with harsh equipment.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair flat and thin, this seems to be what every herbal essences shampoo does to our hair.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Herbal Essences totally screwed up Totally Twisted Curl Shampoo when they changed the fragrance.</li>
            <li> But sadly, not for me :(</li>
            <li> My other complaint is that it&#x27;s really thick and hard to dispense.</li>
            <li> I really like my shampoos to clarify and moisturize, and this product disappointed me on both accounts.  </li>
            <li> You have to squeeze the bottle really hard for the stuff to come out.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Thick wavy.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, normal-oily hair.  </li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Twisted Shampoo is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Felt like I was washing my hair with dirty dish water from greasy fried chicken pans.</li>
            <li> It burned my throat extremely bad and it took my breath away.</li>
            <li> Not great...not bad!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent of this shampoo and conditioner is terrible.  </li>

            <li> Helped keep the definition of my curl. I prefer that my natural hair stay nappy. It smells really fruity too. Looks like a blueberry sorbet.</li>
            <li> I did not find this to be hydrating or to help with the curl in my hair. It does an okay job cleaning hair, but leaves it feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. It smells so good! It&#x27;s just about the only kind I use. It is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually leaves the curl in my hair without weighing it down. I hope Herbal Essences continues to make this.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Twisted Shampoo is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I use it all the time. It keeps the curls&lt;br /&gt;from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> Super reduced price for a great product</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo. Smells really nice. This shampoo will NOT make your hair curly or anything like that, but it is still a nice shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. Makes my hair curl up on ends a little.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, smells fantastic and it gets my hair super clean and really shiny. I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, it&#x27;s kind of in between and I&#x27;ve never used curly shampoo before but I loved the smell of this so decided to try it. It really leaves your hair smelling great and clean and shining plus soft to the touch. And it&#x27;s so cheap! Can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
            <li> This creamy shampoo smells heavenly (like all Herbal Essences products I have tried), but my very wavy thick and dry hair did not seem to benefit from it.  I really like my shampoos to clarify and moisturize, and this product disappointed me on both accounts.  It seemed to gunk up and dull my roots and leave my ends dry and straw-like.  I&#x27;m wondering if it doesn&#x27;t saturate in previously dyed hair well (I&#x27;m growing out my natural color, which may have accounted for the difference on my ends and roots).  I&#x27;m glad this shampoo system has worked for so many people, but unfortunately it is not for me.</li>
            <li> Works as intended and is worth the money. It does well with my curly hair and it smells delicious with a fragrance that lasts throughout the day. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite shampoos, gives your hair so much volume and bounce!! I highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> I got a deal on this shampoo with a clip &amp; save coupon from Amazon. Great price and a great product! I have naturally straight hair that is very fine. I don&#x27;t like wearing it straight so I curl it. But some how the curls never seem to last and my hair goes flat. That&#x27;s where this shampoo comes in. I have no idea what is in it that makes my hair so curly, but whatever it is I love it! Now I can curl my hair and my style lasts all day &amp; night! Plus it smells wonderful! I think this is the best curling shampoo I have ever used. I will definitely be getting more!</li>
            <li> Great product love the scent</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good shampoo, it froths up really well and feels good while using it. It has an attractive scent and it cleans my hair without stripping the natural oils. I like to wash my hair every second day and this shampoo works out perfectly for that, while some others leave me looking oily after a day. For under 4$ a bottle you can&#x27;t beat the value!</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out, wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> this is not what they claim and i see somewhere it was 19 bucks noo i bought both for if i remember&lt;br /&gt; but not that much</li>
            <li> I got a great deals on this product with amazon subcribe membership!  It&#x27;s not as soapy compare to other brand.  I have spiky hair which are short, but sometimes I have to use twice to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair and I still love this stuff. Cleans good, smells good.</li>
            <li> I used to love this shampoo, it was fabulous for my curls and the only brand I would use -- I was very loyal -- But then a few years ago they changed the fragrance and I do NOT like the new sticky-sweet-candy smell. Previously it had a true &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; lavender scent, now it is a sugary-sweet-candy odor -- Makes me feel like I need to wash my hair again to get out the sticky sugar. I would think someone that reaches for a product called &amp;#34;Herbal Essences&amp;#34; is looking for a natural herbal fragrance, not a sweet fruity scent. Why not change the name to Sweet Fruity Essences? In my opinion, Herbal Essences totally screwed up Totally Twisted Curl Shampoo when they changed the fragrance. Every time I go to the store, I check to see if maybe they switched it back. Nope. Until they do, I won&#x27;t be buying it, because the smell makes me gag.</li>
            <li> Not great...not bad!!!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner for my fine wavy hair. Cleansing without stripping; moisturizing without weight. Puts the spring back in my curls &amp; leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned my hair once I received the product, because the curls were a little dull, and my hair was dry. After I did that, my curls are full and bouncy, and my hair is so shiny. I love this, and would definately recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because we could no longer find it in the stores near us.  If you want your hair to curl and have body this is the product for you.  It works best on short hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! I love this scent and I got it for a great price with my subscribe and save! Much cheaper than I could buy it at the store.  Left my hair soft and feeling great! It also has a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the way these Herbal Essence products smell and they work great on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo and with the coupon, I couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Both of my daughters love the smell!</li>
            <li> I thought this product only came with one shampoo it came with 2 I was surprised love the smell delivery was fast will order again</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have already been using this product. The price was reasonable and was delivered right to my door!  What could be better?</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair so soft!  I have thin, normal-oily hair.  But, it feels thick because I have so much of it!  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip all of the natural oils out, yet cleans effectively.  The scent is good, but is almost completely gone by the time it dries.  Also this shampoo is actually more of a blue pastel color which I thought would be purple, because of the color of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my permed hair. It cleans well, but doesn&#x27;t take the curl out.</li>
            <li> My wife has straight hair.  I have thick curly/wavy hair.  My daughter has a combo of our hair:  Thick wavy.  While my daughter and I love this product, my wife finds it to be \\&quot;just ok.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I find that this shampoo does not dry out our hair and it greatly reduces frizz.  The scent has a pleasant fruit note that my daughter is particularly fond of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably continue to order this shampoo for years to come (hopefully they won&#x27;t discontinue it).  I&#x27;ve never tried a product that tamed and protected my curly hair as well as this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/13/2015:  A few days ago my wife told me she changed her mind about this shampoo.  Turns out she now likes it because she&#x27;s had good results after using it a few times.  (She&#x27;s been sneaking using it after she ran out of what she normally uses.. ha ha)  Anyway, she says it leaves her straight hair very manageable and she loves the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using our third order.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this, my hair did great. In about 7 days I noticed my hair was getting dryer and dryer, so I switched to another brand, and it took about 10 days for my hair to re-mosturize.</li>
            <li> I still love my spiral perms, lots of curls. This works great, lifts up my hair to give it a big full look. Thats hard to do with long hair, others I have tried softens the cirls to much. TRY IT :-)</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in in-shower products.  My hair is extremely long, wavy, and coarse (well, some of it...the rest of it is very fine and so blonde it&#x27;s almost white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this shampoo and conditioner is terrible.  Stinky, almost,and I LOVE Herbal Essences products.  The wavy?  This doesn&#x27;t do any more for me than any other of their products.  Could totally live without it.</li>
            <li> got this by mistake...didn&#x27;t know it was for curly hair. My hair is straight, doesn&#x27;t make it curl. I use it every day. Got two sent to me by mistake.</li>
            <li> Love this smell, and it works well</li>
            <li> Nice deal&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product</li>
            <li> I thought this product would have a great smell to leave in my hair after a shampoo, but no luck!  It does, however, leave the hair soft and manageable.  I was looking for a shampoo that would also leave a pleasant smell in my hair.  Oh well, I will keep trying............</li>
            <li> My favorite! I wish these were on sale more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, naturally-curly hair, and this is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> I really like how well this shampoo works on my hair. I have naturally curly hair and after a while of using other shampoos it seems&lt;br /&gt;that it just does not have as much spring to it anymore and ever since I have found this one there are days it can just get crazy curly as my daughter likes to call it. Funny how when I was younger I always thought I wanted my hair to be straight but now I love how naturally curly my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I like with this shampoo not only does it make my curls come to life it adds shine and makes my hair so soft after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair and I both simply love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and found that Herbal Essences Totally twisted Curl Shampoo works with my hair. I am finding it more difficult to buy this particular product, in my local stores and was pleased to find it here.</li>
            <li> My sister Love It, Great Shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  The whole family uses it!  Doesn&#x27;t matter if you have curly or straight hair, it&#x27;s just good smelling shampoo that is priced right and does the job!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair flat and thin, this seems to be what every herbal essences shampoo does to our hair. It even looks darker and greasy but the weriod thing is that its very drying. A hair dresser told me it&#x27;s because its drying your scalp then produces more oil to balence out the dryness thus a greasy scalp. No thanks.</li>
            <li> The product smells delicious, and that&#x27;s the biggest plus for me. I wish the conditioner was better. It didn&#x27;t work at all on my hair. It made my hair very poufy and frizzy. I didn&#x27;t feel like it had any conditioning qualities at all. It&#x27;s a shame, because I do adore the way it leaves my hair so fragrant. If they could improve the formula, make it more moisturizing and detangling, then I&#x27;d be totally sold. My other complaint is that it&#x27;s really thick and hard to dispense. You have to squeeze the bottle really hard for the stuff to come out. The funny thing is that despite being so thick, it doesn&#x27;t soften the hair very much.&lt;br /&gt;This might work better on someone who has normal/silky hair. But sadly, not for me :(</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this Herbal Essences- cleans great, smells great and will definitely be subscribing for more!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using product or drying my hair with harsh equipment. This shampoo really maintains bounce, and even makes my hair slightly curlier :D Good scent too- but not the BEST scent.</li>
            <li> Works for my curly hair</li>
            <li> the smell is just perecttttt</li>
            <li> This smells really great, but it&#x27;s not good for my hair.  This makes my hair really dry and unmanageable. Also, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, but I accidentally grabbed this and put it in my hair thinking that it was conditioned. I inhaled the suds accurately and seriously nearly choked to death. It burned my throat extremely bad and it took my breath away. I&#x27;ve swallowed suds before and this had never happened. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it&#x27;s true, lol.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find a shampoo that tames my curls, but this shampoo definitely did the job!!</li>
            <li> Item received as expected</li>
            <li> I think the biggest thing that stands out with this ( and the rest of herbal essence) is the great fruity smell. As for shampoo, it washes well.</li>
            <li> Left my hair greasy, flat, dry, and frizzy. Felt like I was washing my hair with dirty dish water from greasy fried chicken pans. Usually use more natural products but was trying to save a few bucks, ended up wasting more money.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have naturally curly hair and this really brings out the curl.  They&#x27;ve discontinued the product in stores.  So Amazon is the only place I can purchase it.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
