    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great for us!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been the best thing for my skin.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the scent isn&#x27;t girlie; my husband can use this wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m here to tell you that, from someone who has tried it all; this is the best out there!</li>
            <li>The redness subsided dramatically and everyone was giving me compliments on how awesome my skin looks.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, Clearasil is the best for preventing acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This product is helpful, however not the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I HAVE PRICED CHECKED AND AMAZON IS THE BEST PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Very good face wash.</li>
            <li>When i get the good mix it great!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>lost count lol.</li>
            <li>Price is great and doorstep delivery</li>
            <li>ME.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A GREAT PRICE FOR THE AMOUNT OF WASH</li>
            <li>I quit the birth control and the cystic acne subsided but still experienced a lot of issues with breaking out along my chin.</li>
            <li>Price is Great.</li>
            <li>5 Stars to Clearasil for a great product.</li>
            <li>I find the smell pleasant</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good cleaner.</li>
            <li>This product is good there is no denieing it.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>good price, good product.</li>
            <li>No change, but to be fair...</li>
            <li>THE WASH IS GOOD</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with amazon prime shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>Ok, while the 12-hour claim didn&#x27;t work for me, I have been using this product once or twice a day for a week, to really nice results!</li>
            <li>not so effective as described</li>
            <li>son liked this product and I ended buying him a couple of tubes to take home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d still continue to use it as a face wash, but not as a way to effectively tackle my acne.</li>
            <li>Be sure to leave it on for a good 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if it is working..</li>
            <li>good stuff-like Noxema better</li>
            <li>and I kind of regret</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like I just took a bath in perfume.</li>
            <li>The cleanser itself has nice creamy feel and clean pleasant</li>
            <li>Salicylic acid is one of the most effective OTC solutions one has against acne.</li>
            <li>this product is nice and good and make your face feel better and smooth</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I have perfect facial skin.  </li>
            <li>best part is that it does not dry out my skin!  </li>
            <li>This face wash is good for relatively quickly reducing acne, but should not be considered a miracle solution.</li>
            <li>Clearasil makes many products for skin/acne care.  </li>
            <li>Each day I used the face wash, I saw more pimples emerge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flip top is also clever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to avoid products with Salycic Acid because it seemed to cause more breakouts, but now after some adjustment time, use a combination of the two.</li>
            <li>Most of them work somewhat but none of them has ever done the job</li>
            <li>It lathers on the skin ok, but then it takes forever to rinse off.</li>
            <li>From week to week, my skin has become more healthier...</li>
            <li>So, All-in-All OK product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will update my rating after watching her face for couple more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recamended it to my friend and his face broke out even more.</li>
            <li>I suggest trying more to see what helps your face.</li>
            <li>Tried several prescription and over the counter items, but this seems to work best for me and my daughter.  </li>
            <li>And this products has made the most difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this I use it every day 3 times a day and it helps my acne</li>
            <li>Looks like we&#x27;re still looking for that magic solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DYB</li>
            <li>so i wouldn&#x27;t be able to comment on it.</li>
            <li>and it causes me to break out more.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if salycilic acid works for you, you will love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of washing abilities, it&#x27;s quite potent for salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>THE SCRUB WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t think it would happen as I absolutely love the consistency of this wash</li>
            <li>I was very excited to see the results.</li>
            <li>That said, I have been using the product for about 3 weeks now and I can honestly say that it has cleared up my blemishes and significantly reduced breakouts.</li>
            <li>While it is ideally recommended to prevent or fight an outbreak of pimples, it does a nice job on blackheads and minor blemishes as well.</li>
            <li>I really liked how this product lathered up, and made my skin feel so clean.</li>
            <li>did a pretty good job of removing my sweat-proof makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pricing here on Amazon seems pretty good as this is a pack of 3.</li>
            <li>Overall very good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is some light scent associated with the product, but most will not feel the scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dispenses easily since the cap is on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly concentrate, so you don&#x27;t use a whole lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to store and easy to use.</li>
            <li>* Easy to store in shower or on counter&lt;br</li>
            <li>But yes this is something i would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin felt very clean after just lathering it on my face and neck and then rinsing with cool water.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a HUGE acne problem, but while using this</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten any whiteheads or huge zits since using this product.  </li>
            <li>BUT THE SCRUB HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great face wash, I&#x27;d definitely pick this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li>I also use the clearasil ultra scrub, but i buy that locally, it&#x27;s not such a great deal on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash works great for controlling acne and did not overdry me skin.</li>
            <li>Acne free skin.</li>
            <li>my teen uses this and it  comes at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much of an issue using Clearasil Ultra, unless I use it too many days in a row, and too many times a day.</li>
            <li>Some acne products have a very distinct odor, but this does</li>
            <li>My face feels really clean and smooth after use too</li>
            <li>can tell no difference between this product and original Noxema, which never did a thing for</li>
            <li>so far the only product that seems to be good is the good ol&#x27; bar of soap.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT rinse clean.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to reduce breakouts and keep my skin looking clean.</li>
            <li>Almost too clean.</li>
            <li>She uses it once a day and says her face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I find that this face wash often leaves a film on my face so it never feels really clean.  </li>
            <li>, Fighting acne especially in your teens is a bit challenging experience, To help prevent the oil buildup that can contribute to acne, I told my daughter to wash her face once or twice a day with a mild soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>I have a oily face specially around my nose and forehead.</li>
            <li>no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that the Clearasil Face Wash does not have a strong smell, it&#x27;s rather gently, I know that strong smelling face products can be a turn off.</li>
            <li>great, exactly the same as it is sold in walmart.</li>
            <li>i believe after a full month of useing this product my acne will be gone and my acne scars deminished.</li>
            <li>but if I don&#x27;t see any good results in the next month or two or when I finish the bottle, I&#x27;m never buying this brand from Clearisal ever again.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne - some stubborn blackheads on my nose, pimples that crop up fairly often and all over my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stronger than most salicylic washes and does a decent job of keeping your skin clean.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky you may see good results already within just a single day, but plan on having to use it for several days for it to be most effective.</li>
            <li>It also does so with a mild scent to it, so that the guys won&#x27;t be averse to using</li>
            <li>It is best for me personally to use it only once a day if I am going to be using it continuously for longer than a week at a time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using something more natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li>Facial cleanser leaves skin feeling clean and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>far as acne fighting goes, this stuff seems pretty effective.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really have a strong odor either.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>think this is better at preventing breakouts and LESS effective at treating acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product on my upper arms where I used to have bumps from dry skin ( keratosis pilaris) and it works great!</li>
            <li>It made my skin more tight and smooth, which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary product from the Amazon Vine program.  </li>
            <li>With Clearasil, the acne isn&#x27;t as abundant, and the acne I do get is tiny.</li>
            <li>skin is more soft and no pimples after using it two times a day.</li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;d say its worth it.</li>
            <li>Use it twice a day and rarely do I see any signs of breakout.  </li>
            <li>thanks you very much...for all..!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited for my 15 and 16 year old kids to try this product out.  </li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t get clearer in 12 hours, my pimples and zits didn&#x27;t magically disappear in this time span, in fact, even more zits and pimples appeared on one side of my face and not the other.</li>
            <li>I have not had any other irritations with it though, so that is good.</li>
            <li>It was just right.</li>
            <li>Me and my wife use this and were very suprised at how clean our faces feel and look after using this product we use it in the mornings and before we go to bed.</li>
            <li>Really cleans your face and makes your face feel really clean.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to take a risk of it working, go right ahead.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin and have battled acne throughout my teens and early adulthood, and I occasionally have bouts with it even now.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to family members they love it also , does not dry out our faces</li>
            <li>This is probably having a positive effect and is well worth trying.  </li>
            <li>It does not get foamy like other products, but it&#x27;s more important to me that it</li>
            <li>My system is to rotate between three different products that are all pivotal parts of my acne fighting routine.</li>
            <li>(although most are around $5--this one is no different in price).  </li>
            <li>find that my skin is quite smooth and soft after I use this.</li>
            <li>this product really works!</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have oily skin</li>
            <li>From the first time I used this product, I immediately felt a difference in my skin, it was smoother and softer and it reduced the size of my pimples.</li>
            <li>final verdict is - \\&quot;It is a OK product\\&quot;***:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>final verdict is - \\&quot;It is a OK product\\&quot;</li>
            <li>In fact, I saw a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I particularly love using this product after I shave, because that is usually when my skin becomes the most irritated.  </li>
            <li>For me, it was mostly the latter.  </li>
            <li>How many times have you read a review of a product telling you how it works wonders only to find out it doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li>I use it twice daily and have been using it for more than a week now.</li>
            <li>At first this product worked but now it makes my skin feel oily</li>
            <li>First off, let me state that most people assume/hope that a simple wash will cure all of your acne problems.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you have some mild acne, have some money to blow and want a decent wash, I&#x27;d say go for it.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was not expensive.</li>
            <li>but I was relieved to find such a better price as I have a couple teenagers who are going through this like water.</li>
            <li>I recently bought again because I remembered its quick, fantastic results.</li>
            <li>My teenage son has been using this twice a day for several months, and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done much good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try, but I wouldn&#x27;t highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to apply moisturizer immediately after to avoid any dry skin.</li>
            <li>So many products work on my acne, but my skin gets so dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I continued applying this all over my face as directed, but I started focusing on massaging the cream into these certain areas before rinsing, thinking that it would make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Yes, but make sure you&#x27;re aware of the fact that it takes some getting used to, since it doesn&#x27;t foam like the other cleaners.</li>
            <li>I would say it was definitely better within two days, and now a week later my skin is perfectly clear!</li>
            <li>I started using the product about three weeks ago with very high expectations.  </li>
            <li>it real help reduce your pure</li>
            <li>Sometimes drys my face too much and</li>
            <li>However, I really would like to get a foaming cleanser like Neutrogena or L&#x27;Oreal 360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like two things about this face wash: the fragrance and the tingly sensation my face has after I&#x27;ve washed with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really attest to it&#x27;s acne clearing effects.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed much of a difference in my breakout frequency or duration.</li>
            <li>I find that Clearasil really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and after I use it, I do feel that my face feels refreshed and much cleaner.</li>
            <li>, I know it works for others, so maybe it really depends on your skin type and what is causing your acne breakouts, but for us it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li>My nose and chin gets really oily but in the creases of my nose and on my forehead</li>
            <li>We were fortunate to review this product in our household because my wife and my teenage daughter also used</li>
            <li>After using this stuff my face feels really void of any oils.  </li>
            <li>Try cleansing your face as gently as you can using Clearasil and you will help ease the condition but IMHO not eradicate completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product really does what it says it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>considering how much you can stretch it out.</li>
            <li>and this is better than expected.</li>
            <li>fast service.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very misleading, it won&#x27;t cure your acne or make it disappear in 12 hours, like it suggests.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of an actual wash, I DID enjoy this.</li>
            <li>Fast forward</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have this condition!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for more than two weeks now and my face isn&#x27;t what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>The title almost says it all - this facial cleanser has the texture of glue coming out of the tube, and it took quite a bit of mixing with warm water to get the lather necessary to wash my face.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall for the clear skin fairy tale, that takes a bit more work than a simple wash.</li>
            <li>Clearsil is a daily treatment, helps your skin looking its best whether you are looking for gentle kind-to-skin face wash or rapid action spot fighters covered the products are formulated to remove dirty oil &amp; bacteria to help keep your skin clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Daily Gel Wash is good if you have acne because it will dry it out QUICKLY, but I do have moderately oily skin</li>
            <li>It turns out that I didn&#x27;t need much of this Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Daily Face Wash to work up a light lather all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with many of the other items from Clearasil in the past, but not this</li>
            <li>If you want a good facial product for cheaper then Clinque products then I recommend Aveeno facial wash, it actually works.</li>
            <li>I personally thought that was really cool.</li>
            <li>I had some major stress breakout all over my face -- including my cheeks, which never happens, and my normal face routine was just not cutting it.</li>
            <li>I particularly like it for its cleansing properties.</li>
            <li>We both started to use Clearasil Daily Face Wash daily, within two weeks we were both acne free!</li>
            <li>and though I do not suffer from severe acne, I do get occasional mild breakouts.</li>
            <li>I had a few pimples out at the time which wasn&#x27;t unusual at all; I tend to have one or two pimples continuously, although I rarely have full scale</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>Although it seems to working OK, I&#x27;ve seen no significant change in my daughter&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blaming allergies to one or more of the ingredients, as Clearasil has always had high quality products and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing for me at least</li>
            <li>One out of three or four has a bit too much chemicals that cause my sensitive skin to burn, and I try, but eventually need to just throw it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The face wash has this white, creamy consistency that I absolutely love, not to rough and really gentle.</li>
            <li>I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I normally use</li>
            <li>I would like this product more if it weren&#x27;t so harsh.  </li>
            <li>These bumps can be blackheads in some, whiteheads on some faces, pimples on most teens, or cysts in few others.</li>
            <li>and I must say that after just a few weeks my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Each person&#x27;s skin is different, but this is worth a try.</li>
            <li>my third week of having this product is now ending, I have pretty much given up on using it.  </li>
            <li>So, Me personally I wouldn&#x27;t use this unless my face is really breaking out, it&#x27;s too much of a drying product for me.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin feeling refreshed after every use, as opposed to dried out and tight (as a lot of products can leave you feeling); but most importantly, this has rid my face of all redness.  </li>
            <li>She got used to it, however, and the positive results certainly caused the only negative feature that much more insignificant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a tried and true rule applies to this product - some people will try it and love and some will try it with little or no success.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Still, all this would have been fine if the cleanser cleared up my slight acne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only undesirable comment came from my daughter when she first used the wash, stating that it felt \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; when applied.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price as long as you dont mind the bsd mix every now and then.</li>
            <li>I usually do not have a acne problem</li>
            <li>First off, the actual wash is almost metallic looking.</li>
            <li>2% medicine was much more than other products and the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely ecstatic!</li>
            <li>pHisoderm, which uses the same active ingredient (salysilic acid), works just as well for me and is a better deal.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s most likely to give you clean, soft skin, with the side effect of protecting you against further breakouts, and that seems worth it to me to at least give it a try.you clean, soft skin, with the side effect of protecting you against further breakouts, and that seems worth it to me to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have excessive acne, but I do battle breakouts on occasion, and my skin would never be described as clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>I normally use pHisoderm gel face wash to keep my face clear of any adult acne or blemishes.  </li>
            <li>The Clearasil has been ok so far, as long as I stick to minimal use - once a day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be a little &#x27;goopy&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much more for their skin than a simple bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>Within days, my face began to clear.  </li>
            <li>For those of you expecting your acne prone skin to miracley clear up....don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
            <li>My face is clear.</li>
            <li>i bought clearasil ultra to help clear my face.</li>
            <li>As a teenager, I used Noxema to help clear my acne.</li>
            <li>This brand was never on my radar so when I needed a face wash ( aveeno clear complexion pads was my go to product)</li>
            <li>and I was about to give up hope on my face being clear for it.</li>
            <li>Overall this Clearasil product really works.</li>
            <li>So far, yes.  </li>
            <li>My 15-year old son had to use this in between products that we were subscribing to via mail (web) order.</li>
            <li>Even at my age (I will not tell how old)</li>
            <li>I think I have to rinse my face for nearly five minutes to get all traces of this off my skin.</li>
            <li>I thought to myself this must be the old oils coming out of my pores and clearing up.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to avoid close contact to the sensitive areas around your eyes.</li>
            <li>While using this face wash, my skin tended to become soft, but the acne was still clearly visible.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 16 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>As an adult, I started breaking out with cluster acne pimples.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up at my local Walmart store as I made the switch from Zest bar soap, it really irritated my skin</li>
            <li>As it turns out, it actually works better than any other product he&#x27;s used and we&#x27;ve used about a dozen that were multiple step products.</li>
            <li>The wash never gets sudsy, and the product leaves your face clean, but not clean</li>
            <li>This face wash makes me feel clean and the scrub keeps dead skin away</li>
            <li>This is a decent facial wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my main concern was that the label said &#x27;only meant for face and neck use&#x27;, and I used it for my body acne.</li>
            <li>For my daughter it seems to be helping to get her skin clean enough that the other medication that she uses is clearing up her face</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve definitely felt that after using this product for a few weeks my skin is a bit more under control, but this product is definitely not a cure-all!</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;d think twice, but salicylic acid is sensitive in general when compared to benzoyl peroxide and the latter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying the new Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash for about a week, I can say that it still works as well on my face as it did before.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is my new staple face wash.</li>
            <li>it worked great for me and helped me nurse my face back to normal after a really bad break out</li>
            <li>In just 4 days of using Clearasil Ultra daily wash (twice a day) my face is almost completely clear!</li>
            <li>Now (2 weeks later), I have many small whiteheads and couple of big pimples.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to her experience and my visual inspection of her face, The Acne is still there and so are the red pimple marks after two weeks of light usage, but there is slight clearing of the pimple areas and it does not completely dry her skin either.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for me.a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve gone back to my old face cleansing routine.     </li>
            <li>There is no much suds or foaming either when you wash your face, just a gentle foam here and there is seen while washing the face.</li>
            <li>Near the end of the second week, I gave up on this product and turned to just using water and a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>I have occasional outbreaks of adult acne and had started to battle one just as this sample arrived.</li>
            <li>I have battled zits all my life and now that I am older, I am still victim to this pubescence nightmare.</li>
            <li>I used it daily or some times every other day and my skin was glowing from the first wash.</li>
            <li>The thing about how you get clear skin in as little as 12 hours is an absolute LIE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Judging from the other reviews of this product, it seems like it works very well for some people, while it just aggravates the skin of others.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the scarring also returned, so I assume this cream was just masking it somehow, which would be nice if it didn&#x27;t cause breakouts at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Does not dry skin</li>
            <li>Skin feels better, but i can&#x27;t see any difference on my acne, except it&#x27;s not as red as before, but only a little less red</li>
            <li>For the first time in about a year in a half!</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and anything really harsh will dry it out, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the Clearasil Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product for review got completely used, The verdict still remains same, It did help in controlling the pimples on my daughters face, but could not completely eradicate it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product for review got completely used, The verdict still remains same, It did help in controlling the pimples on my daughters face, but could not completely eradicate it.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions, which suggest you use it twice daily, then you can reduce your acne pretty well within a few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price-wise, Amazon&#x27;s price for this is fair, in my opinion, but the full 39 buck price listed for it is INSANE.</li>
            <li>Clearasil is one of those products that it most accessible when you compare it to the big, flashy, expensive products you have to &#x60;order&#x27;, and because of that those with serious acne issues may have an aversion to using this product, thinking that it can&#x27;t be as good as the &#x60;other stuff&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually use face wash from sephora but every month right around the same time (cough cough)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the middle of a not-so-pretty breakout right now and used it 3 times in the past 24 hours and can already see and feel results.</li>
            <li>This is the first acne wash that has never left my skin feeling streaky or tight or flaky!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually one that calls bluff on anyone who says that, but I&#x27;m serious; I saw it with my own eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is back to normal, with the one or two pimples active but no breakouts.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and amazing which shocked me since it contained salicylic acid.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great for us!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been the best thing for my skin.</li>
            <li> Best of all, the scent isn&#x27;t girlie; my husband can use this wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m here to tell you that, from someone who has tried it all; this is the best out there!</li>
            <li> The redness subsided dramatically and everyone was giving me compliments on how awesome my skin looks.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Clearasil is the best for preventing acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This product is helpful, however not the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I HAVE PRICED CHECKED AND AMAZON IS THE BEST PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Very good face wash.</li>
            <li> When i get the good mix it great!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> lost count lol.</li>
            <li> Price is great and doorstep delivery</li>
            <li> ME.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A GREAT PRICE FOR THE AMOUNT OF WASH</li>
            <li> I quit the birth control and the cystic acne subsided but still experienced a lot of issues with breaking out along my chin.</li>
            <li> Price is Great.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars to Clearasil for a great product.</li>
            <li> I find the smell pleasant</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good cleaner.</li>
            <li> This product is good there is no denieing it.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> good price, good product.</li>
            <li> No change, but to be fair...</li>
            <li> THE WASH IS GOOD</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with amazon prime shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Ok, while the 12-hour claim didn&#x27;t work for me, I have been using this product once or twice a day for a week, to really nice results!</li>
            <li> not so effective as described</li>
            <li> son liked this product and I ended buying him a couple of tubes to take home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d still continue to use it as a face wash, but not as a way to effectively tackle my acne.</li>
            <li> Be sure to leave it on for a good 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if it is working..</li>
            <li> good stuff-like Noxema better</li>
            <li> and I kind of regret</li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like I just took a bath in perfume.</li>
            <li> The cleanser itself has nice creamy feel and clean pleasant</li>
            <li> Salicylic acid is one of the most effective OTC solutions one has against acne.</li>
            <li> this product is nice and good and make your face feel better and smooth</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I have perfect facial skin.  </li>
            <li> best part is that it does not dry out my skin!  </li>
            <li> This face wash is good for relatively quickly reducing acne, but should not be considered a miracle solution.</li>
            <li> Clearasil makes many products for skin/acne care.  </li>
            <li> Each day I used the face wash, I saw more pimples emerge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flip top is also clever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to avoid products with Salycic Acid because it seemed to cause more breakouts, but now after some adjustment time, use a combination of the two.</li>
            <li> Most of them work somewhat but none of them has ever done the job</li>
            <li> It lathers on the skin ok, but then it takes forever to rinse off.</li>
            <li> From week to week, my skin has become more healthier...</li>
            <li> So, All-in-All OK product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update my rating after watching her face for couple more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recamended it to my friend and his face broke out even more.</li>
            <li> I suggest trying more to see what helps your face.</li>
            <li> Tried several prescription and over the counter items, but this seems to work best for me and my daughter.  </li>
            <li> And this products has made the most difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this I use it every day 3 times a day and it helps my acne</li>
            <li> Looks like we&#x27;re still looking for that magic solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DYB</li>
            <li> so i wouldn&#x27;t be able to comment on it.</li>
            <li> and it causes me to break out more.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if salycilic acid works for you, you will love this face wash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of washing abilities, it&#x27;s quite potent for salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> THE SCRUB WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t think it would happen as I absolutely love the consistency of this wash</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see the results.</li>
            <li> That said, I have been using the product for about 3 weeks now and I can honestly say that it has cleared up my blemishes and significantly reduced breakouts.</li>
            <li> While it is ideally recommended to prevent or fight an outbreak of pimples, it does a nice job on blackheads and minor blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this product lathered up, and made my skin feel so clean.</li>
            <li> did a pretty good job of removing my sweat-proof makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pricing here on Amazon seems pretty good as this is a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> Overall very good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is some light scent associated with the product, but most will not feel the scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dispenses easily since the cap is on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly concentrate, so you don&#x27;t use a whole lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to store and easy to use.</li>
            <li> * Easy to store in shower or on counter&lt;br</li>
            <li> But yes this is something i would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> My skin felt very clean after just lathering it on my face and neck and then rinsing with cool water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a HUGE acne problem, but while using this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten any whiteheads or huge zits since using this product.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE SCRUB HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great face wash, I&#x27;d definitely pick this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> I also use the clearasil ultra scrub, but i buy that locally, it&#x27;s not such a great deal on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash works great for controlling acne and did not overdry me skin.</li>
            <li> Acne free skin.</li>
            <li> my teen uses this and it  comes at a great price.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much of an issue using Clearasil Ultra, unless I use it too many days in a row, and too many times a day.</li>
            <li> Some acne products have a very distinct odor, but this does</li>
            <li> My face feels really clean and smooth after use too</li>
            <li> can tell no difference between this product and original Noxema, which never did a thing for</li>
            <li> so far the only product that seems to be good is the good ol&#x27; bar of soap.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT rinse clean.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to reduce breakouts and keep my skin looking clean.</li>
            <li> Almost too clean.</li>
            <li> She uses it once a day and says her face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I find that this face wash often leaves a film on my face so it never feels really clean.  </li>
            <li> , Fighting acne especially in your teens is a bit challenging experience, To help prevent the oil buildup that can contribute to acne, I told my daughter to wash her face once or twice a day with a mild soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> I have a oily face specially around my nose and forehead.</li>
            <li> no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that the Clearasil Face Wash does not have a strong smell, it&#x27;s rather gently, I know that strong smelling face products can be a turn off.</li>
            <li> great, exactly the same as it is sold in walmart.</li>
            <li> i believe after a full month of useing this product my acne will be gone and my acne scars deminished.</li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;t see any good results in the next month or two or when I finish the bottle, I&#x27;m never buying this brand from Clearisal ever again.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne - some stubborn blackheads on my nose, pimples that crop up fairly often and all over my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stronger than most salicylic washes and does a decent job of keeping your skin clean.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky you may see good results already within just a single day, but plan on having to use it for several days for it to be most effective.</li>
            <li> It also does so with a mild scent to it, so that the guys won&#x27;t be averse to using</li>
            <li> It is best for me personally to use it only once a day if I am going to be using it continuously for longer than a week at a time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using something more natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li> Facial cleanser leaves skin feeling clean and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> far as acne fighting goes, this stuff seems pretty effective.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really have a strong odor either.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> think this is better at preventing breakouts and LESS effective at treating acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product on my upper arms where I used to have bumps from dry skin ( keratosis pilaris) and it works great!</li>
            <li> It made my skin more tight and smooth, which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product from the Amazon Vine program.  </li>
            <li> With Clearasil, the acne isn&#x27;t as abundant, and the acne I do get is tiny.</li>
            <li> skin is more soft and no pimples after using it two times a day.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d say its worth it.</li>
            <li> Use it twice a day and rarely do I see any signs of breakout.  </li>
            <li> thanks you very much...for all..!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited for my 15 and 16 year old kids to try this product out.  </li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t get clearer in 12 hours, my pimples and zits didn&#x27;t magically disappear in this time span, in fact, even more zits and pimples appeared on one side of my face and not the other.</li>
            <li> I have not had any other irritations with it though, so that is good.</li>
            <li> It was just right.</li>
            <li> Me and my wife use this and were very suprised at how clean our faces feel and look after using this product we use it in the mornings and before we go to bed.</li>
            <li> Really cleans your face and makes your face feel really clean.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to take a risk of it working, go right ahead.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin and have battled acne throughout my teens and early adulthood, and I occasionally have bouts with it even now.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to family members they love it also , does not dry out our faces</li>
            <li> This is probably having a positive effect and is well worth trying.  </li>
            <li> It does not get foamy like other products, but it&#x27;s more important to me that it</li>
            <li> My system is to rotate between three different products that are all pivotal parts of my acne fighting routine.</li>
            <li> (although most are around $5--this one is no different in price).  </li>
            <li> find that my skin is quite smooth and soft after I use this.</li>
            <li> this product really works!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have oily skin</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this product, I immediately felt a difference in my skin, it was smoother and softer and it reduced the size of my pimples.</li>
            <li> final verdict is - \\&quot;It is a OK product\\&quot;***:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> final verdict is - \\&quot;It is a OK product\\&quot;</li>
            <li> In fact, I saw a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I particularly love using this product after I shave, because that is usually when my skin becomes the most irritated.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was mostly the latter.  </li>
            <li> How many times have you read a review of a product telling you how it works wonders only to find out it doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily and have been using it for more than a week now.</li>
            <li> At first this product worked but now it makes my skin feel oily</li>
            <li> First off, let me state that most people assume/hope that a simple wash will cure all of your acne problems.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you have some mild acne, have some money to blow and want a decent wash, I&#x27;d say go for it.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was not expensive.</li>
            <li> but I was relieved to find such a better price as I have a couple teenagers who are going through this like water.</li>
            <li> I recently bought again because I remembered its quick, fantastic results.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has been using this twice a day for several months, and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done much good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try, but I wouldn&#x27;t highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to apply moisturizer immediately after to avoid any dry skin.</li>
            <li> So many products work on my acne, but my skin gets so dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I continued applying this all over my face as directed, but I started focusing on massaging the cream into these certain areas before rinsing, thinking that it would make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Yes, but make sure you&#x27;re aware of the fact that it takes some getting used to, since it doesn&#x27;t foam like the other cleaners.</li>
            <li> I would say it was definitely better within two days, and now a week later my skin is perfectly clear!</li>
            <li> I started using the product about three weeks ago with very high expectations.  </li>
            <li> it real help reduce your pure</li>
            <li> Sometimes drys my face too much and</li>
            <li> However, I really would like to get a foaming cleanser like Neutrogena or L&#x27;Oreal 360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like two things about this face wash: the fragrance and the tingly sensation my face has after I&#x27;ve washed with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really attest to it&#x27;s acne clearing effects.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed much of a difference in my breakout frequency or duration.</li>
            <li> I find that Clearasil really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and after I use it, I do feel that my face feels refreshed and much cleaner.</li>
            <li> , I know it works for others, so maybe it really depends on your skin type and what is causing your acne breakouts, but for us it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> My nose and chin gets really oily but in the creases of my nose and on my forehead</li>
            <li> We were fortunate to review this product in our household because my wife and my teenage daughter also used</li>
            <li> After using this stuff my face feels really void of any oils.  </li>
            <li> Try cleansing your face as gently as you can using Clearasil and you will help ease the condition but IMHO not eradicate completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product really does what it says it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> considering how much you can stretch it out.</li>
            <li> and this is better than expected.</li>
            <li> fast service.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very misleading, it won&#x27;t cure your acne or make it disappear in 12 hours, like it suggests.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of an actual wash, I DID enjoy this.</li>
            <li> Fast forward</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have this condition!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for more than two weeks now and my face isn&#x27;t what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The title almost says it all - this facial cleanser has the texture of glue coming out of the tube, and it took quite a bit of mixing with warm water to get the lather necessary to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the clear skin fairy tale, that takes a bit more work than a simple wash.</li>
            <li> Clearsil is a daily treatment, helps your skin looking its best whether you are looking for gentle kind-to-skin face wash or rapid action spot fighters covered the products are formulated to remove dirty oil &amp; bacteria to help keep your skin clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Daily Gel Wash is good if you have acne because it will dry it out QUICKLY, but I do have moderately oily skin</li>
            <li> It turns out that I didn&#x27;t need much of this Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Daily Face Wash to work up a light lather all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with many of the other items from Clearasil in the past, but not this</li>
            <li> If you want a good facial product for cheaper then Clinque products then I recommend Aveeno facial wash, it actually works.</li>
            <li> I personally thought that was really cool.</li>
            <li> I had some major stress breakout all over my face -- including my cheeks, which never happens, and my normal face routine was just not cutting it.</li>
            <li> I particularly like it for its cleansing properties.</li>
            <li> We both started to use Clearasil Daily Face Wash daily, within two weeks we were both acne free!</li>
            <li> and though I do not suffer from severe acne, I do get occasional mild breakouts.</li>
            <li> I had a few pimples out at the time which wasn&#x27;t unusual at all; I tend to have one or two pimples continuously, although I rarely have full scale</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Although it seems to working OK, I&#x27;ve seen no significant change in my daughter&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blaming allergies to one or more of the ingredients, as Clearasil has always had high quality products and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing for me at least</li>
            <li> One out of three or four has a bit too much chemicals that cause my sensitive skin to burn, and I try, but eventually need to just throw it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The face wash has this white, creamy consistency that I absolutely love, not to rough and really gentle.</li>
            <li> I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I normally use</li>
            <li> I would like this product more if it weren&#x27;t so harsh.  </li>
            <li> These bumps can be blackheads in some, whiteheads on some faces, pimples on most teens, or cysts in few others.</li>
            <li> and I must say that after just a few weeks my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Each person&#x27;s skin is different, but this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> my third week of having this product is now ending, I have pretty much given up on using it.  </li>
            <li> So, Me personally I wouldn&#x27;t use this unless my face is really breaking out, it&#x27;s too much of a drying product for me.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling refreshed after every use, as opposed to dried out and tight (as a lot of products can leave you feeling); but most importantly, this has rid my face of all redness.  </li>
            <li> She got used to it, however, and the positive results certainly caused the only negative feature that much more insignificant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a tried and true rule applies to this product - some people will try it and love and some will try it with little or no success.</li>
            <li> I think a tried and true rule applies to this product - some people will try it and love and some will try it with little or no success.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, all this would have been fine if the cleanser cleared up my slight acne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only undesirable comment came from my daughter when she first used the wash, stating that it felt \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; when applied.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price as long as you dont mind the bsd mix every now and then.</li>
            <li> I usually do not have a acne problem</li>
            <li> First off, the actual wash is almost metallic looking.</li>
            <li> 2% medicine was much more than other products and the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely ecstatic!</li>
            <li> pHisoderm, which uses the same active ingredient (salysilic acid), works just as well for me and is a better deal.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s most likely to give you clean, soft skin, with the side effect of protecting you against further breakouts, and that seems worth it to me to at least give it a try.you clean, soft skin, with the side effect of protecting you against further breakouts, and that seems worth it to me to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have excessive acne, but I do battle breakouts on occasion, and my skin would never be described as clear and healthy.</li>
            <li> I normally use pHisoderm gel face wash to keep my face clear of any adult acne or blemishes.  </li>
            <li> The Clearasil has been ok so far, as long as I stick to minimal use - once a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be a little &#x27;goopy&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much more for their skin than a simple bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> Within days, my face began to clear.  </li>
            <li> For those of you expecting your acne prone skin to miracley clear up....don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
            <li> My face is clear.</li>
            <li> i bought clearasil ultra to help clear my face.</li>
            <li> As a teenager, I used Noxema to help clear my acne.</li>
            <li> This brand was never on my radar so when I needed a face wash ( aveeno clear complexion pads was my go to product)</li>
            <li> and I was about to give up hope on my face being clear for it.</li>
            <li> Overall this Clearasil product really works.</li>
            <li> So far, yes.  </li>
            <li> My 15-year old son had to use this in between products that we were subscribing to via mail (web) order.</li>
            <li> Even at my age (I will not tell how old)</li>
            <li> I think I have to rinse my face for nearly five minutes to get all traces of this off my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought to myself this must be the old oils coming out of my pores and clearing up.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to avoid close contact to the sensitive areas around your eyes.</li>
            <li> While using this face wash, my skin tended to become soft, but the acne was still clearly visible.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 16 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> As an adult, I started breaking out with cluster acne pimples.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up at my local Walmart store as I made the switch from Zest bar soap, it really irritated my skin</li>
            <li> As it turns out, it actually works better than any other product he&#x27;s used and we&#x27;ve used about a dozen that were multiple step products.</li>
            <li> The wash never gets sudsy, and the product leaves your face clean, but not clean</li>
            <li> This face wash makes me feel clean and the scrub keeps dead skin away</li>
            <li> This is a decent facial wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my main concern was that the label said &#x27;only meant for face and neck use&#x27;, and I used it for my body acne.</li>
            <li> For my daughter it seems to be helping to get her skin clean enough that the other medication that she uses is clearing up her face</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve definitely felt that after using this product for a few weeks my skin is a bit more under control, but this product is definitely not a cure-all!</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;d think twice, but salicylic acid is sensitive in general when compared to benzoyl peroxide and the latter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying the new Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash for about a week, I can say that it still works as well on my face as it did before.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is my new staple face wash.</li>
            <li> it worked great for me and helped me nurse my face back to normal after a really bad break out</li>
            <li> In just 4 days of using Clearasil Ultra daily wash (twice a day) my face is almost completely clear!</li>
            <li> Now (2 weeks later), I have many small whiteheads and couple of big pimples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to her experience and my visual inspection of her face, The Acne is still there and so are the red pimple marks after two weeks of light usage, but there is slight clearing of the pimple areas and it does not completely dry her skin either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve gone back to my old face cleansing routine.     </li>
            <li> There is no much suds or foaming either when you wash your face, just a gentle foam here and there is seen while washing the face.</li>
            <li> Near the end of the second week, I gave up on this product and turned to just using water and a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I have occasional outbreaks of adult acne and had started to battle one just as this sample arrived.</li>
            <li> I have battled zits all my life and now that I am older, I am still victim to this pubescence nightmare.</li>
            <li> I used it daily or some times every other day and my skin was glowing from the first wash.</li>
            <li> The thing about how you get clear skin in as little as 12 hours is an absolute LIE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Judging from the other reviews of this product, it seems like it works very well for some people, while it just aggravates the skin of others.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scarring also returned, so I assume this cream was just masking it somehow, which would be nice if it didn&#x27;t cause breakouts at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Does not dry skin</li>
            <li> Skin feels better, but i can&#x27;t see any difference on my acne, except it&#x27;s not as red as before, but only a little less red</li>
            <li> For the first time in about a year in a half!</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and anything really harsh will dry it out, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the Clearasil Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product for review got completely used, The verdict still remains same, It did help in controlling the pimples on my daughters face, but could not completely eradicate it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product for review got completely used, The verdict still remains same, It did help in controlling the pimples on my daughters face, but could not completely eradicate it.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions, which suggest you use it twice daily, then you can reduce your acne pretty well within a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price-wise, Amazon&#x27;s price for this is fair, in my opinion, but the full 39 buck price listed for it is INSANE.</li>
            <li> Clearasil is one of those products that it most accessible when you compare it to the big, flashy, expensive products you have to &#x60;order&#x27;, and because of that those with serious acne issues may have an aversion to using this product, thinking that it can&#x27;t be as good as the &#x60;other stuff&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use face wash from sephora but every month right around the same time (cough cough)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the middle of a not-so-pretty breakout right now and used it 3 times in the past 24 hours and can already see and feel results.</li>
            <li> This is the first acne wash that has never left my skin feeling streaky or tight or flaky!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually one that calls bluff on anyone who says that, but I&#x27;m serious; I saw it with my own eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face is back to normal, with the one or two pimples active but no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and amazing which shocked me since it contained salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I am using it for last two years, at first it made my skin little dry but not anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally, when I have pimples they&#x27;ve run their course in less than a week then disappear, allowing others to pop up elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes when I try something new, I will get small red, dry patches because my skin just doesn&#x27;t like the new product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and for $20.91 you&#x27;re really getting a LOT of face wash</li>
            <li> and I used this product for about 3 days and applied my daily moisturizer after, but this facial wash left the skin around my mouth, nose, and chin EXTREMELY dry.</li>
            <li> Little bit dry but not as much as neutrogena used too.</li>
            <li> I occasionally get minor breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Occasional blackheads occur but this product does not allow the breakout to stay for long.</li>
            <li> After you take it off you can feel it working, as your skin feels a little cooler and a little cleaner and has a bit of a fresh feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am not that careful or gentle when washing and can tell you that even with my eyes tightly shut you can feel a bit of burn around the eyes.</li>
            <li> But my big problem is a have combination oily and dry skin</li>
            <li> However, a week after starting to use this cleanser (twice a day as the label directed), I began to see several zits two weeks before they were expected.</li>
            <li> I figure, with a single daily use, you&#x27;d probably get two to three weeks of use out of each tube, which isn&#x27;t bad at all, especially if you find it to be effective for you.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t normally suffer from bad outbreaks of pimples, just the occasional one, I can&#x27;t speak to this face wash&#x27;s effectiveness against moderate to severe acne, but it does gently clean my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Not only is that merely a dream, it&#x27;s a pretty far fetched idea.</li>
            <li> I first tried this face wash in 2006 when I went off to college--it immediately cleared my skin up from the negative reaction it was experiencing transitioning from a dry climate to a humid climate.  </li>
            <li> Following the directions, I&#x27;ve gone in several instances from good-sized acne that was very obvious and distracting to, within a few days, a small discoloration that wasn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I use this product couple days, I feel my face very dry and red.</li>
            <li> Use the product in a very limited quantity and occasionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but after a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve gone back to my old face cleansing routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the product for about a week, nothing had changed with the pimples already out, which I found to be strange.  </li>
            <li> I began using it immediately, and the outbreak has still not completely subsided in two weeks.</li>
            <li> And after I washed it off it didn&#x27;t leave my skin red, irritated, or rough like Zest did.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my face is so rough and oily and after this facial wash it kinda gives my face life again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cuts down on grease and oil with just a simple wash daily.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that this wash would dry out my face (most products do).</li>
            <li> Formulated for daily use, it has a slightly astringent scent which deep cleanses without being too drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Clearasil product regularly over the past few weeks, mainly as a makeup remover at the end of my day, figuring that the salicylic acid in it will act as extra insurance against the intermittent blemishes that crop up here and there on my face.</li>
            <li> Clearasil does make other products in the Ultra line, but this daily face wash, when used alone twice per day does the trick.</li>
            <li> I also used this with my Clarisonic Mia and thought it performed as well as the other daily cleanser</li>
            <li> Obviously, this cream works for other people&#x27;s skin, but it doesn&#x27;t work for mine except for covering up scarring temporarily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but after a week of trying something else and breaking out, I always come back to clearasil ultra.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will use this for everyday use as I already have dry skin, live in the desert and am starting a topical acne regimen.  </li>
            <li> I learned to be very careful and tie back my hair before using this because if I get it in my hair, it takes a while to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s incredibly dry</li>
            <li> Nearly every product I&#x27;ve ever used has failed to really do the trick.  </li>
            <li> either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look of the product immediately reminded me of Noxzema&#x27;s original deep cleansing cream; this stuff has that same pearlescent white look to it, which might explain the cleans-without-drying effect, if the same base ingredients are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether you would like it, personally, will probably have to do with how you feel about the previously mentioned criteria.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an odd experience to have a product that is supposed to help control the acne</li>
            <li> and I did notice that I have less of the tiny pin point blackheads on my chin and nose.</li>
            <li> They tend to be stubborn things that don&#x27;t go away very quickly and are red and painful.</li>
            <li> This Daily face wash has helped her little bit to fight her acne outbursts that she has been having.</li>
            <li> She has had no major \\&quot;eruptions\\&quot; since using this whereas in the past she had occasional \\&quot;dermatology emergencies.\\</li>
            <li> A few years ago however, I used to use a generic version of Clearasil Ultra.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a residue that you can feel on wet skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used Clearasil and I decided to see what the hype was</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s working, but again I see no real change.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few salicylic acid washes, and this one was different.</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;ve spent A LOT of money on some universally praised products (Pro-Active and the like) and none of them have had a lasting effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I did notice that some scarring I had from previous acne was disappearing rapidly, which also was very strange for</li>
            <li> Otherwise my face tends to get a bit dry and tight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, due to the non-foaming nature of the wash, I never do feel like it&#x27;s working--but lacking breakouts, I assume it does so.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure about it, the Clearasil site is offering $1 off coupons for their products, but there&#x27;s already a clickable link here on Amazon to get $1 off this product, so you&#x27;ve got the same chance for savings</li>
            <li> It did not create any other problems</li>
            <li> It did not create any other problems</li>
            <li> It as her other acne meds will still remain on my re order list....</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend trying other creams.ahead.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend trying other creams.</li>
            <li> Not much to lose!</li>
            <li> I grabbed a bunch of this product the other day when it went on sale.</li>
            <li> Yes, I still get the occasional small pimple.</li>
            <li> 8 years, I&#x27;m not sure why I don&#x27;t use this regularly.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate for a quick fix, so I got this stuff.</li>
            <li> let it sit for a few minutes, and then wash it off and dab it dry.</li>
            <li> This one is slightly different from the ones I&#x27;ve typically used in the past due to</li>
            <li> Like others have said: it&#x27;s a little dry, but it did what it claimed, so I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I also started getting some really large pimples in places on my face where I&#x27;ve never had them before.</li>
            <li> old daughter has pimples and she has been pretty much frustrated as anyone of this age and used this product for past 2 weeks since I got this from Amazon Vine program</li>
            <li> She has fewer marks and her break outs have gone down to just a spot or two on each cheek.</li>
            <li> I get hormonal breakouts and this helps tone them down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been hesitant when using typical acne soaps because I&#x27;ve always heard they only make things worse because they dry your face out...</li>
            <li> /&gt;During week two, I had the worst break out that I had experienced in the past few months.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this face wash would clear them up, or at least slow down my acne, but I found no noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li> For the price, however, so is my liquid soap from Neutrogena which cost about half as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> consistency of this wash is odd and a bit off-putting.</li>
            <li> My skin did appear less oily</li>
            <li> I did notice less acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this face wash cleared up my skin in less than 36 hours.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly medicinal smell, but that sort of fits in with the idea.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne brought on by menopause, and my 17 year old son has very bad teen acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any increase in dryness, although my face often feels tight.</li>
            <li> I have little to no acne</li>
            <li> Ive used it three times since yesterday afternoon and there is noticeable improvement in all the little bumps and pimples.</li>
            <li> (a few zits a month in the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone)  </li>
            <li> The light fragrance seems to be a citrus base.</li>
            <li> Maybe a stress break out every few months or a zit when I buy a foundation that&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I also find that some of my trouble areas (creases around my nose) are clearer after using this.</li>
            <li> actually make the acne worse.</li>
            <li> The scrub I use every few days.  </li>
            <li> though that works wonders whenever i have a pimple i would just rubb it on it and in few days it would be dried up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 200 mL size at Walmart cost almost $7 so that wasn&#x27;t a waste of money, I don&#x27;t know how the experience is from buying it off of amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old female, didn&#x27;t have major acne issues until I got on a hormonal oral contraceptive which resulted in me experiencing terrible cystic acne.</li>
            <li> He seems to be breaking out like mad, but I can&#x27;t really say if anything else will help.</li>
            <li> One of the annoying things that I&#x27;ve discovered about growing older is that things that should have been left in my past - like acne - not only stick around but sometimes get worse.</li>
            <li> No strong scent.</li>
            <li> I usually use products with some level of Benzoyl Peroxide, but it can stain fabric.</li>
            <li> and I did notice a small improvement after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, Don&#x27;t scrub your face hard with a washcloth -- These stubborn acne vulgaris can&#x27;t be scrubbed away, and scrubbing may actually make it worse by irritating the skin and pores.</li>
            <li> Having said, this is not a miracle product that will totally eliminate pimple but on the other hand it is not too bad either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 23 year old daughter has very troubled skin.  </li>
            <li> I said, my serious bouts with acne are past me, but at times I have to take the offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so again, it is hard to tease out what is what.  </li>
            <li> others have said, this is a product that either will or won&#x27;t work for you, but I can&#x27;t imagine that you&#x27;d experience any negative effects from using it, unless you just happened to be allergic to one of its ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for aesthetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and has an almost mucous feel to it.</li>
            <li> The bottle says fights 100% of acne but that doesn&#x27;t mean it clears it.</li>
            <li> Ordering this online in bulk saves me a trip to the store so if you&#x27;re lazy (or efficient) like me, go ahead and buy!</li>
            <li> My son has worse skin than my daughter, but neither one of them saw any benefits, and they used the product faithfully for at least two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is not good at washing your face at all or keeping away blemishes like it claims it is.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get worse, but it also didn&#x27;t get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alas, what can you do.</li>
            <li> Shame on Clearasil for false advertising.</li>
            <li> Scrubbing is an unpleasant experience because the cleanser has an odd smell; something like rancid bubble gum.  </li>
            <li> bc my face seriously looked like a piece of pizza and it WORKED!</li>
            <li> Rinsing was somewhat difficult, it took a lot of water to rinse my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and clearasil isnt expensive at all.</li>
            <li> I was a angry when this happened</li>
            <li> stinks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in a vicious cycle under a lot of stress lately, which leads to stress eating which leads to oily/broken out skin, and so on.  </li>
            <li> It also contains EDTA which is bad for the planet.</li>
            <li> But nothing like the painful things I get when I don&#x27;t use this and the spot gel.</li>
            <li> but i got disappointed when i.almost finish the bottle.and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I struggle with acne and blackheads. My system is to rotate between three different products that are all pivotal parts of my acne fighting routine. Overall this Clearasil product really works. Sometimes drys my face too much and on those days I pair this with an acne moisturizing lotion. My acne has been under control for years now though and if I ever stop my routine pimples always come back</li>
            <li> I normally use pHisoderm gel face wash to keep my face clear of any adult acne or blemishes.  A few years ago however, I used to use a generic version of Clearasil Ultra.  I switched to pHisoderm only because they stopped making the generic version of Clearasil Ultra and I found the name brand product to be overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying the new Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash for about a week, I can say that it still works as well on my face as it did before.  I have pretty sensitive skin and anything really harsh will dry it out, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the Clearasil Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the Clearasil Ultra works well, I still think it&#x27;s overpriced.  pHisoderm, which uses the same active ingredient (salysilic acid), works just as well for me and is a better deal.</li>
            <li> Clearasil makes many products for skin/acne care.  This one is slightly different from the ones I&#x27;ve typically used in the past due to it&#x27;s non-foaming nature.  You put it in your palm and it&#x27;s almost the consistency of a grease.  The wash never gets sudsy, and the product leaves your face clean, but not clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is normal/oily and I have to say that using this product for a couple of weeks has kept my skin the same as it was prior to using it.  No breakouts except for the occasional 1 pimple somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, due to the non-foaming nature of the wash, I never do feel like it&#x27;s working--but lacking breakouts, I assume it does so.  Once done, if I continue to be breakout-free, I may consider purchasing this again.  However, I really would like to get a foaming cleanser like Neutrogena or L&#x27;Oreal 360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? So far, yes.  Is it affordable? Yes (although most are around $5--this one is no different in price).  Would I recommend?  Yes, but make sure you&#x27;re aware of the fact that it takes some getting used to, since it doesn&#x27;t foam like the other cleaners.</li>
            <li> My 15-year old son had to use this in between products that we were subscribing to via mail (web) order. As it turns out, it actually works better than any other product he&#x27;s used and we&#x27;ve used about a dozen that were multiple step products. Clearasil does make other products in the Ultra line, but this daily face wash, when used alone twice per day does the trick. We&#x27;ve very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> not so effective as described</li>
            <li> Even at my age (I will not tell how old) I occasionally get minor breakouts.  My 23 year old daughter has very troubled skin.  We both have been using this Wash for several weeks now and it seems to be making a difference.  For my daughter it seems to be helping to get her skin clean enough that the other medication that she uses is clearing up her face (she is required to wear makeup every day to work).  For myself it seems to be helping me not to get a breakout.  I hae not had one since I started using this product.  Works great for us!</li>
            <li> The title almost says it all - this facial cleanser has the texture of glue coming out of the tube, and it took quite a bit of mixing with warm water to get the lather necessary to wash my face. Scrubbing is an unpleasant experience because the cleanser has an odd smell; something like rancid bubble gum.  Rinsing was somewhat difficult, it took a lot of water to rinse my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, all this would have been fine if the cleanser cleared up my slight acne.  (a few zits a month in the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone)  However, a week after starting to use this cleanser (twice a day as the label directed), I began to see several zits two weeks before they were expected. I thought that the cleanser was not to blame so I kept using it. Each day I used the face wash, I saw more pimples emerge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I quit using the face wash.  Within days, my face began to clear.  I&#x27;m blaming allergies to one or more of the ingredients, as Clearasil has always had high quality products and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this is only my experience, and probably won&#x27;t be yours.</li>
            <li> I really like two things about this face wash: the fragrance and the tingly sensation my face has after I&#x27;ve washed with it. The light fragrance seems to be a citrus base. I can&#x27;t really attest to it&#x27;s acne clearing effects. I don&#x27;t have a HUGE acne problem, but while using this I have not noticed much of a difference in my breakout frequency or duration.</li>
            <li> I find that Clearasil really gets the job done. It&#x27;s affordable and after I use it, I do feel that my face feels refreshed and much cleaner. If you&#x27;re looking for a great face wash, I&#x27;d definitely pick this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this product. I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with many of the other items from Clearasil in the past, but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good cleaner. For the price, however, so is my liquid soap from Neutrogena which cost about half as much.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t overly drying. A plus if you have dry-ish or combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;It dispenses easily since the cap is on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly concentrate, so you don&#x27;t use a whole lot. This tube could probably last a couple of months if using twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;It did a pretty good job of removing my sweat-proof makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It stinks. Smells like medicine. Nothing floral or fruity.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s \\&quot;creamy\\&quot;. I guess that&#x27;s a pro if you like that sort of thing. Put me in mind of mayonnaise.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell no difference between this product and original Noxema, which never did a thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT rinse clean.  It leaves a residue that you can feel on wet skin. Not noticeable when it dries, though.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my acne.  I went back to my Neutogena regimine after trying this a while. My acne was getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you would like it, personally, will probably have to do with how you feel about the previously mentioned criteria. Just the facts, ma&#x27;am.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has been using this twice a day for several months, and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done much good. He seems to be breaking out like mad, but I can&#x27;t really say if anything else will help. We&#x27;re going to experiment, though, as this doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in a vicious cycle under a lot of stress lately, which leads to stress eating which leads to oily/broken out skin, and so on.  The last time I went out of my way to use an \\&quot;acne\\&quot; face scrub was when I was in the throes of my teenaged years and all puberty had to hurl at me.  From what I recall, this soap seems miles better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil control.  4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Scent. 3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Feel of skin after use. 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;Value. 4 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness. 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve definitely felt that after using this product for a few weeks my skin is a bit more under control, but this product is definitely not a cure-all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Clearasil product regularly over the past few weeks, mainly as a makeup remover at the end of my day, figuring that the salicylic acid in it will act as extra insurance against the intermittent blemishes that crop up here and there on my face. Since I don&#x27;t normally suffer from bad outbreaks of pimples, just the occasional one, I can&#x27;t speak to this face wash&#x27;s effectiveness against moderate to severe acne, but it does gently clean my skin without drying it out. It also does so with a mild scent to it, so that the guys won&#x27;t be averse to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging that Clearasil designed for their face wash, and think that it&#x27;s unisex enough looking that you could send your college-age kids off to school with this with no worries of them being embarrassed by having others see it on their bathroom countertops. The flip top is also clever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, Amazon&#x27;s price for this is fair, in my opinion, but the full 39 buck price listed for it is INSANE. I wouldn&#x27;t pay over seven bucks for a tube of this, so thankfully Amazon&#x27;s three pack falls short of that. I figure, with a single daily use, you&#x27;d probably get two to three weeks of use out of each tube, which isn&#x27;t bad at all, especially if you find it to be effective for you. If you&#x27;re not sure about it, the Clearasil site is offering $1 off coupons for their products, but there&#x27;s already a clickable link here on Amazon to get $1 off this product, so you&#x27;ve got the same chance for savings either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look of the product immediately reminded me of Noxzema&#x27;s original deep cleansing cream; this stuff has that same pearlescent white look to it, which might explain the cleans-without-drying effect, if the same base ingredients are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, this is a product that either will or won&#x27;t work for you, but I can&#x27;t imagine that you&#x27;d experience any negative effects from using it, unless you just happened to be allergic to one of its ingredients. I think it&#x27;s most likely to give you clean, soft skin, with the side effect of protecting you against further breakouts, and that seems worth it to me to at least give it a try.you clean, soft skin, with the side effect of protecting you against further breakouts, and that seems worth it to me to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is a decent facial wash. Formulated for daily use, it has a slightly astringent scent which deep cleanses without being too drying. While it is ideally recommended to prevent or fight an outbreak of pimples, it does a nice job on blackheads and minor blemishes as well. I particularly like it for its cleansing properties. My skin felt very clean after just lathering it on my face and neck and then rinsing with cool water. I also used this with my Clarisonic Mia and thought it performed as well as the other daily cleanser I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;My son liked this product and I ended buying him a couple of tubes to take home.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product from the Amazon Vine program.  I was very excited for my 15 and 16 year old kids to try this product out.  My son has worse skin than my daughter, but neither one of them saw any benefits, and they used the product faithfully for at least two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a little &#x27;goopy&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much more for their skin than a simple bar of soap.  I would not buy this product again, I know it works for others, so maybe it really depends on your skin type and what is causing your acne breakouts, but for us it&#x27;s a no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that the Clearasil Face Wash does not have a strong smell, it&#x27;s rather gently, I know that strong smelling face products can be a turn off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used Clearasil and I decided to see what the hype was but it turned out it was just that: hype. This product is not good at washing your face at all or keeping away blemishes like it claims it is. If you want a good facial product for cheaper then Clinque products then I recommend Aveeno facial wash, it actually works. This doesn&#x27;t so please save your money.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s, and I still get acne, especially when it&#x27;s nearing that time of the month.  With Clearasil, the acne isn&#x27;t as abundant, and the acne I do get is tiny. I haven&#x27;t gotten any whiteheads or huge zits since using this product.  It does not get foamy like other products, but it&#x27;s more important to me that it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is better at preventing breakouts and LESS effective at treating acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it does not dry out my skin!  This is the first acne wash that has never left my skin feeling streaky or tight or flaky!  My skin actually felt softer after the wash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for about a year on and off and it&#x27;s been the best thing for my skin. For those of you expecting your acne prone skin to miracley clear up....don&#x27;t hold your breath. This product is a daily face wash. Not an acne remover. The bottle says fights 100% of acne but that doesn&#x27;t mean it clears it. It just fights the things that cause you to break out. I have never had a problem with acne. Maybe a stress break out every few months or a zit when I buy a foundation that&#x27;s too oily. But my big problem is a have combination oily and dry skin and I have to use a lot of different things to get it to balance out. My nose and chin gets really oily but in the creases of my nose and on my forehead it&#x27;s incredibly dry and it&#x27;s awful. I bought this in the set with the wash, toner, lotion, and 4 hour zit creme. I used it daily or some times every other day and my skin was glowing from the first wash. I also recommended it to my sister who&#x27;s skin is acne prone and I could immediately tell when she started using it. She has fewer marks and her break outs have gone down to just a spot or two on each cheek. It&#x27;s pretty awesome stuff. I would recommend it to every one.</li>
            <li> I use an acne face wash twice a day as part of my regimen. I usually use products with some level of Benzoyl Peroxide, but it can stain fabric. I used to avoid products with Salycic Acid because it seemed to cause more breakouts, but now after some adjustment time, use a combination of the two. Clearisil Ultra just has Salycic Acid and glycerin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it seems to reduce breakouts and keep my skin looking clean.</li>
            <li> We were fortunate to review this product in our household because my wife and my teenage daughter also used the Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash. In fact, my wife and my daughter use this product regularly while I am an occasional user (I&#x27;ve only used it twice in over a month). Hormonal imbalances for various reasons also accompany my wife and daughter in their daily use of the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only undesirable comment came from my daughter when she first used the wash, stating that it felt \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; when applied. She got used to it, however, and the positive results certainly caused the only negative feature that much more insignificant.</li>
            <li> One of the annoying things that I&#x27;ve discovered about growing older is that things that should have been left in my past - like acne - not only stick around but sometimes get worse. Such is life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have excessive acne, but I do battle breakouts on occasion, and my skin would never be described as clear and healthy. I&#x27;ve tried various products to alleviate acne. Most of them work somewhat but none of them has ever done the job consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash for a couple of weeks on a trial basis. Here&#x27;s my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the tube and cap design of the package. It&#x27;s easy to store and easy to use. I also like the scent of this product. It has a light, pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like I just took a bath in perfume. Best of all, the scent isn&#x27;t girlie; my husband can use this wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this wash is odd and a bit off-putting. It&#x27;s thick and has an almost mucous feel to it. It lathers on the skin ok, but then it takes forever to rinse off. I think I have to rinse my face for nearly five minutes to get all traces of this off my skin. I learned to be very careful and tie back my hair before using this because if I get it in my hair, it takes a while to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that my skin is quite smooth and soft after I use this. I like that. I was afraid that this wash would dry out my face (most products do). I don&#x27;t see any increase in dryness, although my face often feels tight. I also find that some of my trouble areas (creases around my nose) are clearer after using this. Unfortunately, I also started getting some really large pimples in places on my face where I&#x27;ve never had them before. Pimples that take days to go away. It&#x27;s such an odd experience to have a product that is supposed to help control the acne actually make the acne worse. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the consistency of the wash. Perhaps even with all the rinsing I&#x27;m still not removing all of it from my skin? I&#x27;m not sure, but after a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve gone back to my old face cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a tried and true rule applies to this product - some people will try it and love and some will try it with little or no success. It doesn&#x27;t work for me.a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve gone back to my old face cleansing routine.     I think a tried and true rule applies to this product - some people will try it and love and some will try it with little or no success. It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> i have had severe acne for about a year now, and i have tried every thing from proactiv to maxclarity and even prescription acne medication. after having this product for 1 week i have noticed a substantial amount of difference in my acne and my acne scars. i believe after a full month of useing this product my acne will be gone and my acne scars deminished. and clearasil isnt expensive at all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I use as I have a oily skin and sebum comes out of pores in pounds. This face wash makes me feel clean and the scrub keeps dead skin away</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t approve of this product. I purchased this about a week or two ago and used it routinely. I was very excited to see the results. I saw some breakouts... I thought to myself this must be the old oils coming out of my pores and clearing up. Now (2 weeks later), I have many small whiteheads and couple of big pimples. I do attribute those breakouts to this because my skin was constant before. Don&#x27;t buy I&#x27;ve done a lot of research so far the only product that seems to be good is the good ol&#x27; bar of soap. Moderate Acne.</li>
            <li> Facial cleanser leaves skin feeling clean and has a nice scent. Almost too clean. After using this stuff my face feels really void of any oils.  It contains salicylic acid which is in the exfoliating facial cleanser I normally use so I don&#x27;t think that is the culprit.  The instructions say to avoid close contact to the sensitive areas around your eyes. Not the easiest thing to do when washing your face. I am not that careful or gentle when washing and can tell you that even with my eyes tightly shut you can feel a bit of burn around the eyes. Not unbearable but, definitely noticeable. The cleanser itself has nice creamy feel and clean pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;As far as acne fighting goes, this stuff seems pretty effective. Salicylic acid is one of the most effective OTC solutions one has against acne. I would like this product more if it weren&#x27;t so harsh.  It also contains EDTA which is bad for the planet.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne brought on by menopause, and my 17 year old son has very bad teen acne. We both started to use Clearasil Daily Face Wash daily, within two weeks we were both acne free! this product really works!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and I can honestly say I have perfect facial skin.  I have no acne or blemishes on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried alot of different brands, Clearasil Ultra is the only thing that works for me.  I also use the clearasil ultra scrub, but i buy that locally, it&#x27;s not such a great deal on Amazon.  The scrub I use every few days.  This I use daily and I could not imagine living without it. I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 5-8 years ... lost count lol.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have oily skin and though I do not suffer from severe acne, I do get occasional mild breakouts. That said, I have been using the product for about 3 weeks now and I can honestly say that it has cleared up my blemishes and significantly reduced breakouts. From the first time I used this product, I immediately felt a difference in my skin, it was smoother and softer and it reduced the size of my pimples. From week to week, my skin has become more healthier... I actually look forward to washing my face these days. The face wash itself has a creamy consistency and it is not drying at all. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Acne is a condition of the skin that shows up as different types of bumps. These bumps can be blackheads in some, whiteheads on some faces, pimples on most teens, or cysts in few others. Teens get acne because of the hormonal changes that come with puberty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 15yr old daughter has pimples and she has been pretty much frustrated as anyone of this age and used this product for past 2 weeks since I got this from Amazon Vine program and she has been using this every night on her face and wash before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some light scent associated with the product, but most will not feel the scent. There is no much suds or foaming either when you wash your face, just a gentle foam here and there is seen while washing the face. This Daily face wash has helped her little bit to fight her acne outbursts that she has been having. Having said, this is not a miracle product that will totally eliminate pimple but on the other hand it is not too bad either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to her experience and my visual inspection of her face, The Acne is still there and so are the red pimple marks after two weeks of light usage, but there is slight clearing of the pimple areas and it does not completely dry her skin either. So, All-in-All OK product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, Fighting acne especially in your teens is a bit challenging experience, To help prevent the oil buildup that can contribute to acne, I told my daughter to wash her face once or twice a day with a mild soap and warm water. Also, Don&#x27;t scrub your face hard with a washcloth -- These stubborn acne vulgaris can&#x27;t be scrubbed away, and scrubbing may actually make it worse by irritating the skin and pores. Try cleansing your face as gently as you can using Clearasil and you will help ease the condition but IMHO not eradicate completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing here on Amazon seems pretty good as this is a pack of 3. I will update my rating after watching her face for couple more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:**** Update ****:&lt;br /&gt; AUG 25, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product for review got completely used, The verdict still remains same, It did help in controlling the pimples on my daughters face, but could not completely eradicate it. It did not create any other problems either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final verdict is - \\&quot;It is a OK product\\&quot;***:&lt;br /&gt; AUG 25, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product for review got completely used, The verdict still remains same, It did help in controlling the pimples on my daughters face, but could not completely eradicate it. It did not create any other problems either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final verdict is - \\&quot;It is a OK product\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash works great for controlling acne and did not overdry me skin. So many products work on my acne, but my skin gets so dry and flaky. I really liked how this product lathered up, and made my skin feel so clean. It also helped reduce how \\&quot;oily\\&quot; my face gets during the day. Great product!</li>
            <li> When I drink sodas or energy drinks, I get pimples on and around my chin and jawline. They tend to be stubborn things that don&#x27;t go away very quickly and are red and painful. It is the same case around \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Clearasil Ultra seems to speed up the healing process a bit and the pimples vanish faster. I tend to have slightly sensitive skin and have to be picky and careful what products I use. I haven&#x27;t had much of an issue using Clearasil Ultra, unless I use it too many days in a row, and too many times a day. It is best for me personally to use it only once a day if I am going to be using it continuously for longer than a week at a time. Otherwise my face tends to get a bit dry and tight. I have not had any other irritations with it though, so that is good. Sometimes when I try something new, I will get small red, dry patches because my skin just doesn&#x27;t like the new product. The Clearasil has been ok so far, as long as I stick to minimal use - once a day. As I said, it does help the pimples go away faster, so once a day seems to be enough. My face feels really clean and smooth after use too and I did notice that I have less of the tiny pin point blackheads on my chin and nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to rave about skincare products.  I have fairly oily skin and have battled acne throughout my teens and early adulthood, and I occasionally have bouts with it even now.  Nearly every product I&#x27;ve ever used has failed to really do the trick.  I mean, I&#x27;ve spent A LOT of money on some universally praised products (Pro-Active and the like) and none of them have had a lasting effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, my serious bouts with acne are past me, but at times I have to take the offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim I decided to try this product and I must say that after just a few weeks my skin has never looked better.  In fact, I saw a difference after the first use.  I&#x27;m usually one that calls bluff on anyone who says that, but I&#x27;m serious; I saw it with my own eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling refreshed after every use, as opposed to dried out and tight (as a lot of products can leave you feeling); but most importantly, this has rid my face of all redness.  I particularly love using this product after I shave, because that is usually when my skin becomes the most irritated.  Clearasil is one of those products that it most accessible when you compare it to the big, flashy, expensive products you have to &#x60;order&#x27;, and because of that those with serious acne issues may have an aversion to using this product, thinking that it can&#x27;t be as good as the &#x60;other stuff&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m here to tell you that, from someone who has tried it all; this is the best out there!</li>
            <li> This product is good there is no denieing it. My face is clear. I recamended it to my friend and his face broke out even more. Everybody is different your face reacts differently to different products. I suggest trying more to see what helps your face. Overall very good product.</li>
            <li> Tried several prescription and over the counter items, but this seems to work best for me and my daughter.  Each person&#x27;s skin is different, but this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Use the product in a very limited quantity and occasionally. I would recommend using something more natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from prescription acne medications, oil cleansing, etc!! And this products has made the most difference in my skin. I get hormonal breakouts and this helps tone them down. My skin feels soft and amazing which shocked me since it contained salicylic acid. My skin is getting smoother and clearer by the day.</li>
            <li> I suffered for pimples for almost 10 years. I have used almost every cleaner in market with same or similar or comparable components. This is the only one worked for me. I am using it for last two years, at first it made my skin little dry but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin is more soft and no pimples after using it two times a day.</li>
            <li> Love this I use it every day 3 times a day and it helps my acne I recommend this to family members they love it also , does not dry out our faces it&#x27;s amazing for me at least</li>
            <li> i bought clearasil ultra to help clear my face. but i got disappointed when i.almost finish the bottle.and it.didn&amp;#34;t give mr any.good results. it makes my.skin.dry.and.itchi plus it makes acne worste</li>
            <li> Ok, while the 12-hour claim didn&#x27;t work for me, I have been using this product once or twice a day for a week, to really nice results! I had some major stress breakout all over my face -- including my cheeks, which never happens, and my normal face routine was just not cutting it. I was desperate for a quick fix, so I got this stuff. I would say it was definitely better within two days, and now a week later my skin is perfectly clear! Like others have said: it&#x27;s a little dry, but it did what it claimed, so I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like this Clearasil Ultra Acne Treatment Daily Face Wash cream alot, I use it twice a day and this is my 3rd purchased in 2 years.</li>
            <li> This I the only face wash I use. I have had an issue with consistency in the product though. One out of three or four has a bit too much chemicals that cause my sensitive skin to burn, and I try, but eventually need to just throw it out. When i get the good mix it great! Definitely worth the price as long as you dont mind the bsd mix every now and then.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2days and already got results. It gentle on your skin and I definetly got the results I wanted. Acne free skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with a acne probems... I do personally use it but my daughter loves it... Price is great and doorstep delivery just makes it sweeter.... It as her other acne meds will still remain on my re order list....</li>
            <li> Judging from the other reviews of this product, it seems like it works very well for some people, while it just aggravates the skin of others.  For me, it was mostly the latter.  I started using the product about three weeks ago with very high expectations.  I had a few pimples out at the time which wasn&#x27;t unusual at all; I tend to have one or two pimples continuously, although I rarely have full scale breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for about a week, nothing had changed with the pimples already out, which I found to be strange.  Normally, when I have pimples they&#x27;ve run their course in less than a week then disappear, allowing others to pop up elsewhere.  However, I did notice that some scarring I had from previous acne was disappearing rapidly, which also was very strange for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During week two, I had the worst break out that I had experienced in the past few months.  I felt pimples coming out everywhere.  My nose, my cheeks, my chin, and my forehead had bumps starting to cover them.  I continued applying this all over my face as directed, but I started focusing on massaging the cream into these certain areas before rinsing, thinking that it would make a difference.  It didn&#x27;t.  Everything continued to worsen.  Near the end of the second week, I gave up on this product and turned to just using water and a washcloth.  By the beginning of the third week, the breakouts had disappeared without ever fully developing.  Unfortunately, the scarring also returned, so I assume this cream was just masking it somehow, which would be nice if it didn&#x27;t cause breakouts at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my third week of having this product is now ending, I have pretty much given up on using it.  My face is back to normal, with the one or two pimples active but no breakouts.  Obviously, this cream works for other people&#x27;s skin, but it doesn&#x27;t work for mine except for covering up scarring temporarily.  If you&#x27;re willing to take a risk of it working, go right ahead.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend trying other creams.ahead.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend trying other creams.</li>
            <li> With acne products such as this, it&#x27;s all a matter of case by case basis. How many times have you read a review of a product telling you how it works wonders only to find out it doesn&#x27;t? After a while, you become immune to such words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, take this review with a grain of salt. While using this face wash, my skin tended to become soft, but the acne was still clearly visible. Two weeks into using the product, my acne hasn&#x27;t gone away at all. In fact, it feels like it is aggravating my skin condition.</li>
            <li> I have occasional outbreaks of adult acne and had started to battle one just as this sample arrived. I began using it immediately, and the outbreak has still not completely subsided in two weeks. It didn&#x27;t get worse, but it also didn&#x27;t get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* No strong scent. Some acne products have a very distinct odor, but this does not.&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to store in shower or on counter&lt;br /&gt;* Does not dry skin&lt;br /&gt;* My skin did appear less oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Did not see any noticeable difference in my outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;* If you&#x27;re allergic to aspirin, you might have an issue with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d still continue to use it as a face wash, but not as a way to effectively tackle my acne.</li>
            <li> This face wash is good for relatively quickly reducing acne, but should not be considered a miracle solution. You really don&#x27;t need much. A little goes a long way, and for $20.91 you&#x27;re really getting a LOT of face wash considering how much you can stretch it out. If you follow the directions, which suggest you use it twice daily, then you can reduce your acne pretty well within a few days. Just rinse the area off, spread some of this on it, let it sit for a few minutes, and then wash it off and dab it dry. Be sure to leave it on for a good 2-3 minutes. After you take it off you can feel it working, as your skin feels a little cooler and a little cleaner and has a bit of a fresh feeling afterwards. Following the directions, I&#x27;ve gone in several instances from good-sized acne that was very obvious and distracting to, within a few days, a small discoloration that wasn&#x27;t very noticeable. If you&#x27;re lucky you may see good results already within just a single day, but plan on having to use it for several days for it to be most effective.</li>
            <li> My children are in the teens and preteens....and hence, a couple are developing some acne.  In my search for the miracle product, I thought I&#x27;d try this one.  Although it seems to working OK, I&#x27;ve seen no significant change in my daughter&#x27;s skin.  She says it&#x27;s working, but again I see no real change.  Looks like we&#x27;re still looking for that magic solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DYB</li>
            <li> Very good face wash. I have been using neutrogena products for a while and this is better than expected. This makes my skin feel good. Little bit dry but not as much as neutrogena used too. I have a oily face specially around my nose and forehead. I use it twice daily and have been using it for more than a week now. I usually do not have a acne problem so i wouldn&#x27;t be able to comment on it. But yes this is something i would strongly recommend. This is a good deal for the price. I got them in just one day even though it was supposed to come after two days. I am very pleased with amazon prime shipping. Keep em coming!</li>
            <li> Clearsil is a daily treatment, helps your skin looking its best whether you are looking for gentle kind-to-skin face wash or rapid action spot fighters covered the products are formulated to remove dirty oil &amp; bacteria to help keep your skin clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> At first this product worked but now it makes my skin feel oily and i have oily skin already and it causes me to break out more. I have little to no acne a bump pops up every now and again. This product doesn&#x27;t work for me would not repurchase. But i would recommend the acne vanishing cream though that works wonders whenever i have a pimple i would just rubb it on it and in few days it would be dried up.</li>
            <li> Skin feels better, but i can&#x27;t see any difference on my acne, except it&#x27;s not as red as before, but only a little less red</li>
            <li> I usually use face wash from sephora but every month right around the same time (cough cough) I break out and my $30 face wash does nothing! I bought this yesterday bc my face seriously looked like a piece of pizza and it WORKED! Ive used it three times since yesterday afternoon and there is noticeable improvement in all the little bumps and pimples. This stuff is a godsend!</li>
            <li> my teen uses this and it  comes at a great price.  We recieved the goods in very short time as well.</li>
            <li> This works well to reduce and prevent acne if used daily.  Cuts down on grease and oil with just a simple wash daily.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 16 year old daughter.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if it is working.. Why?  Because her acne is under control.  Is that just her or is it this face wash?  She uses it once a day and says her face feels clean after using it. No side effects such as red or chaffed skin. She has had no major \\&quot;eruptions\\&quot; since using this whereas in the past she had occasional \\&quot;dermatology emergencies.\\&quot;  She occasionally uses a benzoyl peroxide product (also clearasil) so again, it is hard to tease out what is what.  This is probably having a positive effect and is well worth trying.  Not much to lose!</li>
            <li> good stuff-like Noxema better though</li>
            <li> I find the smell pleasant and I like the consistency of this face wash, but that&#x27;s where my affection for it ends.  I have mild to moderate acne - some stubborn blackheads on my nose, pimples that crop up fairly often and all over my face.  I was hoping this face wash would clear them up, or at least slow down my acne, but I found no noticeable improvement.  In fact, I find that this face wash often leaves a film on my face so it never feels really clean.  I have since stopped using it and began using Oxy Face Wash, with noticeable improvement.  Perhaps if salycilic acid works for you, you will love this face wash.  I will stick with Oxy and its benzoyl peroxide formula.</li>
            <li> I use this product couple days, I feel my face very dry and red. The I just stop use this product</li>
            <li> it worked great for me and helped me nurse my face back to normal after a really bad break out</li>
            <li> good price, good product. fast service.  Nothing to dislike.  I did get 3, so will keep you updated on when I finish the all 3 bottles &amp; how it goes.</li>
            <li> First off, let me state that most people assume/hope that a simple wash will cure all of your acne problems. Not only is that merely a dream, it&#x27;s a pretty far fetched idea. That&#x27;s what makes products like this sell. It&#x27;s very misleading, it won&#x27;t cure your acne or make it disappear in 12 hours, like it suggests. Shame on Clearasil for false advertising. Alas, what can you do. People fall for it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of an actual wash, I DID enjoy this. I&#x27;ve used quite a few salicylic acid washes, and this one was different. First off, the actual wash is almost metallic looking. It&#x27;s a white cream that has a metallic shine to it. I personally thought that was really cool. It didn&#x27;t really have a strong odor either. It was just right. I&#x27;m a sucker for aesthetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of washing abilities, it&#x27;s quite potent for salicylic acid. Then again, I have skin that resembles a rhino, so that could explain it too. It made my skin more tight and smooth, which I enjoyed. I did notice less acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my main concern was that the label said &#x27;only meant for face and neck use&#x27;, and I used it for my body acne. That concerned me, although after a while I noticed it was no big deal. It worked pretty well and I did notice a small improvement after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have some mild acne, have some money to blow and want a decent wash, I&#x27;d say go for it. For the price, I&#x27;d say its worth it. It&#x27;s stronger than most salicylic washes and does a decent job of keeping your skin clean. Don&#x27;t fall for the clear skin fairy tale, that takes a bit more work than a simple wash. If you have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;d think twice, but salicylic acid is sensitive in general when compared to benzoyl peroxide and the latter. It&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> After trying dozens and dozens of cleaners and face wash. I stumbled upon this product in the clearance aisle. I said &amp;#34; lets give it a shot &amp;#34;. To my surprise, this face wash cleared up my skin in less than 36 hours. I have rosacea and my face is always red. The redness subsided dramatically and everyone was giving me compliments on how awesome my skin looks. I have battled zits all my life and now that I am older, I am still victim to this pubescence nightmare. Finally, a product that works for me. Results may vary for each individual. I grabbed a bunch of this product the other day when it went on sale. Hopefully I can find the same deal at Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearasil?&lt;br /&gt;Who would have known.</li>
            <li> As a teenager, I used Noxema to help clear my acne. As an adult, I started breaking out with cluster acne pimples.  Noxema was not getting the job done anymore (I believe the product changed).  I received a sample of Clearasil  eight years ago, and I have not looked back.  In my opinion, Clearasil is the best for preventing acne breakouts.  I noticably see a difference.  My skin is clearer.  Occasional blackheads occur but this product does not allow the breakout to stay for long.</li>
            <li> Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Daily Gel Wash is good if you have acne because it will dry it out QUICKLY, but I do have moderately oily skin and I used this product for about 3 days and applied my daily moisturizer after, but this facial wash left the skin around my mouth, nose, and chin EXTREMELY dry. So, Me personally I wouldn&#x27;t use this unless my face is really breaking out, it&#x27;s too much of a drying product for me.</li>
            <li> I recently saw this on sale and decided to give it a try. This brand was never on my radar so when I needed a face wash ( aveeno clear complexion pads was my go to product) I wanted something that was not expensive. 2% medicine was much more than other products and the bottle was bigger. I use it with my sephora dual face brush and my skin loves it. It&#x27;s very important to apply moisturizer immediately after to avoid any dry skin. Overall this is my new staple face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all. I decided to give this a try and it&#x27;s actually worked. Yes, I still get the occasional small pimple. But nothing like the painful things I get when I don&#x27;t use this and the spot gel. Together, they work like a dream. My friends have even said that my face is clearer!</li>
            <li> Meh. No change, but to be fair...I haven&#x27;t found ANY acne medicine that&#x27;s worked well for my bacne.</li>
            <li> great, exactly the same as it is sold in walmart.</li>
            <li> It turns out that I didn&#x27;t need much of this Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Daily Face Wash to work up a light lather all over my face and neck. It has a slightly medicinal smell, but that sort of fits in with the idea. My ultra-sensitive skin was not irritated, and my blemishes are drying and not inflamed. It seems to be doing the job it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> this product is nice and good and make your face feel better and smooth&lt;br /&gt;and it real help reduce your pure</li>
            <li> I first tried this face wash in 2006 when I went off to college--it immediately cleared my skin up from the negative reaction it was experiencing transitioning from a dry climate to a humid climate.  Fast forward 8 years, I&#x27;m not sure why I don&#x27;t use this regularly.  I recently bought again because I remembered its quick, fantastic results. I&#x27;m in the middle of a not-so-pretty breakout right now and used it 3 times in the past 24 hours and can already see and feel results. I&#x27;m not sure I will use this for everyday use as I already have dry skin, live in the desert and am starting a topical acne regimen.  But I will definitely keep around in case of emergencies!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my upper arms where I used to have bumps from dry skin ( keratosis pilaris) and it works great! Paired with Vaseline cocoa butter lotion, it is now gone. Highly recommended if you have this condition!</li>
            <li> This product is helpful, however not the best on the market. It&#x27;s worth a try, but I wouldn&#x27;t highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> THE SCRUB WORKS BETTER I THINK.  THE WASH IS GOOD BUT THE SCRUB HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A GREAT PRICE FOR THE AMOUNT OF WASH YOU GET AS WELL AS THE PRICE YOU PAY... WALMART IS ALOT MORE EXPENSIVE AND OTHERS AS WELL.  I HAVE PRICED CHECKED AND AMAZON IS THE BEST PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old female, didn&#x27;t have major acne issues until I got on a hormonal oral contraceptive which resulted in me experiencing terrible cystic acne. I quit the birth control and the cystic acne subsided but still experienced a lot of issues with breaking out along my chin. My wedding is in 2 months and I was about to give up hope on my face being clear for it. I&#x27;ve always been hesitant when using typical acne soaps because I&#x27;ve always heard they only make things worse because they dry your face out...but at this point I figured I had nothing to lose! In just 4 days of using Clearasil Ultra daily wash (twice a day) my face is almost completely clear! For the first time in about a year in a half! I&#x27;m completely ecstatic!</li>
            <li> Only thing I found that works.  Use it twice a day and rarely do I see any signs of breakout.  I notice when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only face soap that works on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but after a week of trying something else and breaking out, I always come back to clearasil ultra. Ordering this online in bulk saves me a trip to the store so if you&#x27;re lazy (or efficient) like me, go ahead and buy!</li>
            <li> I picked this up at my local Walmart store as I made the switch from Zest bar soap, it really irritated my skin so I decided to switch to Clearasil and I kind of regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 200 mL size at Walmart cost almost $7 so that wasn&#x27;t a waste of money, I don&#x27;t know how the experience is from buying it off of amazon so I&#x27;ll just review the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash has this white, creamy consistency that I absolutely love, not to rough and really gentle. And after I washed it off it didn&#x27;t leave my skin red, irritated, or rough like Zest did. When I wake up in the morning my face is so rough and oily and after this facial wash it kinda gives my face life again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the reason why I gave this product two stars is because of the pros above, I would have given it one star if it wasn&#x27;t for that. The thing about how you get clear skin in as little as 12 hours is an absolute LIE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for more than two weeks now and my face isn&#x27;t what I expected it to be. My face didn&#x27;t get clearer in 12 hours, my pimples and zits didn&#x27;t magically disappear in this time span, in fact, even more zits and pimples appeared on one side of my face and not the other. I was a angry when this happened, I didn&#x27;t think it would happen as I absolutely love the consistency of this wash but if I don&#x27;t see any good results in the next month or two or when I finish the bottle, I&#x27;m never buying this brand from Clearisal ever again.</li>
            <li> Price is Great. I have been buying in the drug store but I was relieved to find such a better price as I have a couple teenagers who are going through this like water.</li>
            <li> Me and my wife use this and were very suprised at how clean our faces feel and look after using this product we use it in the mornings and before we go to bed. Really cleans your face and makes your face feel really clean. 5 Stars to Clearasil for a great product.</li>
            <li> thanks you very much...for all..!!!</li>
