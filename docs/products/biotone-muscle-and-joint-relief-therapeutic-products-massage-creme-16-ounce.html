            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is so soothing when applied to my skin.</li>
            <li>I had use it a couple of time and the relieve and sensation it provides can&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>I love this creme.</li>
            <li>i have to idea how this product is, mostly my dad uses it and say it does not work on him, maybe he is resisting the cream since he take too many medication</li>
            <li>I love Biotone products, just not this one.</li>
            <li>Love product.</li>
            <li>Perfect blend for deep tissue healing.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also - it does not smell as so many others do.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the product and use it daily in my practice.</li>
            <li>Love this for athletic massage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I do love that it is pump-able and</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than just Arnica which up until now I have considered the wonder drug.</li>
            <li>This makes my massage more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Be sure to ask your clients about allergic reactions and/or be aware of your own allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sue</li>
            <li>Easy glide for all techniques and no greasy after effects on the patients.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and it does help my muscles relax.</li>
            <li>Non greasy light weight formula.</li>
            <li>Buy it, its worth it!</li>
            <li>She was excited that we could order it.</li>
            <li>The special ingredient devil&#x27;s claw is what sets this pain relief ointment apart from others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>While it did work on my wife rather quickly I got it for my elbow</li>
            <li>it is absorbed to skin quickly than I hoped for.</li>
            <li>BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>It seems as though you must use more of it more often by comparison of other products.</li>
            <li>but has just the right glide</li>
            <li>creamy, very few reapplications, great glide).</li>
            <li>Light scented, smooth feel that lasts a entire session without reapplying.</li>
            <li>IT MADE MY HANDS VERY SOFT AND SMOOTH..</li>
            <li>IT HOT..</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product because its viscosity is just the right level for enough of a glide as well as grip.</li>
            <li>Liked product but stopped pumping after only a few uses... wasn&#x27;t even able to finish product using the pump.</li>
            <li>I work with older clients and weekend warriors!</li>
            <li>GOT HERE FAST AND RELIEVES MUSCLE ACHES WITH NO SMELL AND NO BURNING.  </li>
            <li>It is very helpful with my arthritic knees, it does not relieve all of the pain, but I find I do not take as much ibuprofen when I  use this product.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t evaporate too fast.</li>
            <li>As a LMT , I really like this one on myself.  </li>
            <li>I always warm my lotion when working on clients, so using it warm or cold</li>
            <li>The brand itself is top notch check out the other products</li>
            <li>I use it on many clients, and my wife says that it is extremely helpful for swelling she gets in her breasts each month.</li>
            <li>The FRAGRANCE LEFT A CLEAN AND</li>
            <li>Chiropractic masseuse uses this during massages and I bought this particular one for a knee problem I have.</li>
            <li>I just wanted it to work quickly as it did for my wife&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>The glide isn&#x27;t as lasting as the regular Biotone that I love.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Since I have an injury, Biotone Muscle and Joint Relief Massage Creme provides a gentle drag without drying out quickly.</li>
            <li>Only caution to be aware of is the shellfish allergy(which is labeled clearly on the jar).  </li>
            <li>I work long hours on my feet, and when I put this one it really helps to relax them.</li>
            <li>product was ok does help a little but not like I expected.</li>
            <li>AN OLD SMELL SUCH AS BEN-GAY..</li>
            <li>This stuff is quite thin and is more like a lotion than a cream.</li>
            <li>a little expensive but a great addition at my massage studio.</li>

            <li> This stuff is quite thin and is more like a lotion than a cream.</li>
            <li> a little expensive but a great addition at my massage studio.</li>
            <li> I do martial arts and after spending 2 hours on the mat I can be pretty sore, but after rubbing my knees and/or any other painful area before bed, I wake up pain free.</li>
            <li> After long day of massage I always grab the jar for myself on the hands and neck.  </li>
            <li> that is not heavy and the odor is not overwhelming and clients like the feel of it too.</li>
            <li> Next to Penetrex this is my other go to cream!</li>
            <li> CAREFUL NOT TO GET IT</li>
            <li> The other thing that I like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Instead, I use it on my legs when I am feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> Makes a slight difference.</li>
            <li> IT IS A LITTLE PRICEY</li>
            <li> Wait few minutes until the skin absorbs it before wearing clothes.</li>
            <li> I PUT SOME OF THE CREAM IN A SMALL BOWL AND HEATED</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was old or just a bad batch</li>
            <li> (JUST USE COMMON SENSE)  </li>
            <li> Never once would I think of changing and never have I had a complaint from a client.  </li>
            <li> IT SLOWLY IN THE MICROWAVE..</li>
            <li> BAD BACK..</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, there was no seal on the plastic container causing a lot of cream to spill plus the lid looked like somebody with dirty hands had closed it.</li>
            <li> Product was received with a broken pump and a broken container and it was leaking.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the seller at all!!!!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly disappointed since it is Biotone which I have used for over 20 yrs</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it is watery</li>

            <li> product was ok does help a little but not like I expected.</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;Is good not the best I&#x27;m still l</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time and was pleased with product</li>
            <li> Extremely silent, will not burn your skin compared to tiger balm which can give you a burning or freezing sensation</li>
            <li> Cream works great! When I opened the box, there was no seal on the plastic container causing a lot of cream to spill plus the lid looked like somebody with dirty hands had closed it. Not happy with the seller at all!!!!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT!  GOT HERE FAST AND RELIEVES MUSCLE ACHES WITH NO SMELL AND NO BURNING.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is so soothing when applied to my skin. I receive therapeutic massage on a weekly basis and I take this massage with me so that my massage therapist can use it on me. Since I have an injury, Biotone Muscle and Joint Relief Massage Creme provides a gentle drag without drying out quickly. This makes my massage more comfortable. The other thing that I like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I had use it a couple of time and the relieve and sensation it provides can&#x27;t be better. It works. Wait few minutes until the skin absorbs it before wearing clothes. I do recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a muscle crème that works.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  You can feel the difference in minutes.  Wonderful for arthritic hands and joint pain. I highly recommend this product.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I have been a therapist for 13 years. I love this creme. Not creme but has just the right glide</li>
            <li> I use this when I have my massage therapist come. She likes it too. My husband loves it too when he gets his massage.</li>
            <li> I always use Biotone so I thought I would try this. I don&#x27;t know if it was old or just a bad batch but it had no effect for muscle relief. Surprisingly disappointed since it is Biotone which I have used for over 20 yrs</li>
            <li> Product was received with a broken pump and a broken container and it was leaking.</li>
            <li> Light scented, smooth feel that lasts a entire session without reapplying. I like that is not heavy and the odor is not overwhelming and clients like the feel of it too. Win for me and win for clients! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! helps athletes and arthritic clients alike. a little expensive but a great addition at my massage studio.</li>
            <li> i have to idea how this product is, mostly my dad uses it and say it does not work on him, maybe he is resisting the cream since he take too many medication</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother&#x27;s aide to use when she massages her at night time..My mother loves this--</li>
            <li> The brand itself is top notch check out the other products as well they&#x27;re al</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the dual purpose cream but thought I&#x27;d try the muscle and Joint Relief. This stuff is quite thin and is more like a lotion than a cream. I had to reapply several times rendering this virtually unusable for me. Instead, I use it on my legs when I am feeling a little dry. I love Biotone products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been using it since my knee replacement surgery (after incision healed) and it helps with the pain. Arnica is great stuff.</li>
            <li> I always warm my lotion when working on clients, so using it warm or cold I was disappointed that it is watery and I had to continuously reapply it to get any kind of glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy Biotone again.  I am spoiled using Sacred Earth, it is pricey but well worth the cost for great results (creamy, very few reapplications, great glide).</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY IT AGAIN. I HAVE ALSO RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO SEVERAL PEOPLE..MY HUSBAND LOVED IT ALSO.. IT HAS A PLEASANT FRAGRANCE NOT AN OLD SMELL SUCH AS BEN-GAY.. THE PLUS WAS WHILE USING IT AS A MASSAGE CREAM FOR MY HUSBANDS BAD BACK.. IT MADE MY HANDS VERY SOFT AND SMOOTH..The FRAGRANCE LEFT A CLEAN AND SPA LIKE SMELL TO THE ROOM ALSO...I PUT SOME OF THE CREAM IN A SMALL BOWL AND HEATED IT SLOWLY IN THE MICROWAVE..CAREFUL NOT TO GET IT IT HOT..(JUST USE COMMON SENSE)  I HAVE ARTHRITIS IN MY FINGERS AND IT WAS A PLUS IN THE FACT THAT WHILE HELPING MY HUSBAND IT HELPED ME ALSO......IT IS A LITTLE PRICEY BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Chiropractic masseuse uses this during massages and I bought this particular one for a knee problem I have. Makes a slight difference. Love product. Non greasy light weight formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years on all of my patients.  Never once would I think of changing and never have I had a complaint from a client.  Easy glide for all techniques and no greasy after effects on the patients.  Perfect blend for deep tissue healing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I do martial arts and after spending 2 hours on the mat I can be pretty sore, but after rubbing my knees and/or any other painful area before bed, I wake up pain free.</li>
            <li> I loved the way this creme feels. I work long hours on my feet, and when I put this one it really helps to relax them. I love how it feels on my skin. Buy it, its worth it!</li>
            <li> While it did work on my wife rather quickly I got it for my elbow and it has lightened up the pain I just wanted it to work quickly as it did for my wife&#x27;s back. But progress is great.</li>
            <li> I use it on many clients, and my wife says that it is extremely helpful for swelling she gets in her breasts each month. Dramatically reduces her discomfort.</li>
            <li> This product came in just in time.  My clients actually prefer the feel of this versus the oils.  My employers likes it because it is in a functional pump and it won&#x27;t leak. I enjoy using this product because its viscosity is just the right level for enough of a glide as well as grip. Only caution to be aware of is the shellfish allergy(which is labeled clearly on the jar).  Be sure to ask your clients about allergic reactions and/or be aware of your own allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sue</li>
            <li> I work with older clients and weekend warriors! I am using this on occasion and I like the idea of the ingredients helping their issues.</li>
            <li> It is good....it is absorbed to skin quickly than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost two years.  It is very helpful with my arthritic knees, it does not relieve all of the pain, but I find I do not take as much ibuprofen when I  use this product.  The special ingredient devil&#x27;s claw is what sets this pain relief ointment apart from others I have tried.  I have bought this for friends and family and all agree it is the best pain relief ointment they have used. Also - it does not smell as so many others do.  I use it daily in the morning, and sometimes in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product and use it daily in my practice. It lives up to its name.</li>
            <li> Great product; great seller, great price</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Doesn&#x27;t evaporate too fast.</li>
            <li> As a LMT , I really like this one on myself.  I work out and this helps those joints you tend to over work.  After long day of massage I always grab the jar for myself on the hands and neck.  Next to Penetrex this is my other go to cream!</li>
            <li> My daughter first experienced this creme at her PT. She was excited that we could order it. This was what she and her husband wanted to Christmas so I ordered it for them and they were happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this for athletic massage.</li>
            <li> Liked product but stopped pumping after only a few uses... wasn&#x27;t even able to finish product using the pump.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. The glide isn&#x27;t as lasting as the regular Biotone that I love. It seems as though you must use more of it more often by comparison of other products. I do love that it is pump-able and the contain is nice.</li>
            <li> The box was greasy and inside both containers had cracks in the bottom and had leaked all over. But I love the cream, the product itself is great.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than just Arnica which up until now I have considered the wonder drug.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer thicker consistency, but does the job well.</li>
            <li> This product is the best that i have found. It goes on easy and it does help my muscles relax.</li>
            <li> Great texture and glide.  My clients seem to like it too.</li>
