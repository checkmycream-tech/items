    <ol>
            <li>It makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li>Perfect foundation!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent experience!  </li>
            <li>I always order this product online because I&#x27;m very fair</li>
            <li>but it probably wouldn&#x27;t be ideal for oily types.</li>
            <li>It is the most compatible foundation I have run across for hypersensitive skin, but that said, it still isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
            <li>Great when I can get it through Amazon at better price vs. in store.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when blotting papers come in handy.       </li>
            <li>It seems like there is no make up at all, but covers very well, flawless skin</li>
            <li>By far the best Mineral Foundation I have found on the market to date.  </li>
            <li>, this is the most effective coverage offered by a mineral powder that I have encountered.</li>
            <li>Great for light case of rosacea and easy to reapply as needed during the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a challenging sensation to describe.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooling, soothing, refreshing, but it is not a liquid.  </li>
            <li>It is more noticeable in the container than it is on one&#x27;s face.        </li>
            <li>I suspect that if you love it, you will also love this.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the coverage provided by this powder and how light it is on my skin!</li>
            <li>The soft, fine brush is superior to most \\&quot;default\\&quot; makeup brushes (those included as an aside to a package of makeup), and, in my approximation, it is the best makeup available for this price (the extraordinary Amazon price that makes Walgreens look</li>
            <li>Very unique.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and more even-toned and feels hydrated.    </li>
            <li>Another thing, this powder does NOT play nice with freshly applied liquid makeup.</li>
            <li>Good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>The packaging is compact and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing when applied.</li>
            <li>It feels very light weight but actually provides a good amount of coverage for me.</li>
            <li>Probably not, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li>I did mix a bit of liquid foundation (Revlon Colorstay) with my regular moisterizer (St. Ives Collegen Moisterizer) to fashion my own &amp;#34;BB cream&amp;#34; and found this actually applies very nice over that.</li>
            <li>It was the perfect time for me to buy not only because it was on sale at my local CVS, but it had a $2-off coupon attached.  </li>
            <li>I have problems with hot flases, this feels cool on my face</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice for on the go, but not necessarily for every morning.</li>
            <li>The brush included is nice for touch ups, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for regular application.</li>
            <li>I feel that its&#x27; coverage is much sheerer than the original Color Stay; it doesn&#x27;t cover as well</li>
            <li>Because the original Revlon ColorStay mineral foundation was discontinued, I had no choice but to try this new version, ColorStay Aqua.  </li>
            <li>Like it so much!  </li>
            <li>I wish they still sold the original, but it looks as if I&#x27;m going to have to change brands completely.</li>
            <li>Mineral makeup can be a very divisive product.  </li>
            <li>Love how it feels wet when it goes on.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price too.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I recently purchased Revlon ColorStay Aqua Mineral Makeup and I am not disappointed.    </li>
            <li>My second criticism of this product is that the powder does not stick consistently throughout the day without a sealant spray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Drawbacks: It used to be more hypoallergenic - as long as one rinses one&#x27;s face every night, the adverse effects to the skin are minimal.</li>
            <li>I wish the brush was a little more stable when open.</li>
            <li>The included brush is soft and supple and is conveniently located in the lid, however my preference is to use a full-size powder brush to apply my minerals.     </li>
            <li>Naturally, I do end up with some shine on my T-zone as the day progresses, but who doesn&#x27;t?  </li>
            <li>it looks lite and natural.</li>
            <li>I especially like to use this product in winter when the dry air tends to dry out my skin more.</li>
            <li>For dry skin, it&#x27;s the only powder foundation I have found that does&#x27;t dry my skin even more.  </li>
            <li>It feels weightless and does not settle into fine lines, nor exaggerate dry patches like other mineral foundations I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>:o  </li>
            <li>It may be the &#x27;aqua&#x27; in the title, but I found when I applied this powder with my own fluffy brush, it had a slight damp feeling to the skin, which I found strange.</li>

            <li> Otherwise you&#x27;re going to have a cakey, spackled mess on your face.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it requires a touch up at least once, usually twice, per wear (if used alone, without a sealant) and a little worse still on hot, sweltering days.</li>

            <li> Either wait till your liquid has dried and set, use this for touch ups, or by itself.</li>

            <li> Color is slightly darker than my skin and doesn&#x27;t match. I always order this product online because I&#x27;m very fair but this time it doesnt match.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am 23 with acne prone combination skin. This product does NOT cause me to break out and it provides a little boost of moisture to my dry skin. I especially like to use this product in winter when the dry air tends to dry out my skin more. It feels very light weight but actually provides a good amount of coverage for me. I typically use a tinted BB cream underneath and then swirl this mineral powder overtop. It makes my skin look great!</li>

This just might be the product that turns you into a lover!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Perfect foundation!!! Like it so much!  It seems like there is no make up at all, but covers very well, flawless skin</li>
            <li> I have problems with hot flases, this feels cool on my face I use a smaller brush to conseal and the I use the brush that comes with it for an all over cover.  it looks lite and natural.</li>
            <li> Because the original Revlon ColorStay mineral foundation was discontinued, I had no choice but to try this new version, ColorStay Aqua.  I figured it would be similar.  It was not.  I can see the appeal of the mineral powder feeling like it&#x27;s \\&quot;wet\\&quot; on the face, but I don&#x27;t like it.  It feels as if I&#x27;ve dipped my brush in water and brushed it on my face.    But that&#x27;s not my issue.  I feel that its&#x27; coverage is much sheerer than the original Color Stay; it doesn&#x27;t cover as well and it doesn&#x27;t last as long.  It&#x27;s a disappointment, and I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I wish they still sold the original, but it looks as if I&#x27;m going to have to change brands completely.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected it to be. I like the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling when applied and the bit of shimmer doesn&#x27;t bother me (I have dry/normal skin) but it probably wouldn&#x27;t be ideal for oily types. The packaging is nice for on the go, but not necessarily for every morning. I personally like to apply my powder with a fluffy face brush and the package is no where near big enough to get a fluffy brush in. The brush included is nice for touch ups, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for regular application. Another thing, this powder does NOT play nice with freshly applied liquid makeup. Either wait till your liquid has dried and set, use this for touch ups, or by itself. Otherwise you&#x27;re going to have a cakey, spackled mess on your face. I did mix a bit of liquid foundation (Revlon Colorstay) with my regular moisterizer (St. Ives Collegen Moisterizer) to fashion my own &amp;#34;BB cream&amp;#34; and found this actually applies very nice over that. You just need to experiment with this one, just like any other cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Very unique. Love this product. Cool and refreshing when applied. I wish the brush was a little more stable when open. But that&#x27;s minor</li>
            <li> By far the best Mineral Foundation I have found on the market to date.  Love how it feels wet when it goes on.  Stays all day.  For dry skin, it&#x27;s the only powder foundation I have found that does&#x27;t dry my skin even more.  Reasonable price too.  :o  MrsWils0n</li>
            <li> M.A.C.&#x27;s mineral foundation aside, this is the most effective coverage offered by a mineral powder that I have encountered. The soft, fine brush is superior to most \\&quot;default\\&quot; makeup brushes (those included as an aside to a package of makeup), and, in my approximation, it is the best makeup available for this price (the extraordinary Amazon price that makes Walgreens look foolish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks: It used to be more hypoallergenic - as long as one rinses one&#x27;s face every night, the adverse effects to the skin are minimal. It is the most compatible foundation I have run across for hypersensitive skin, but that said, it still isn&#x27;t ideal. My second criticism of this product is that the powder does not stick consistently throughout the day without a sealant spray. In my experience, it requires a touch up at least once, usually twice, per wear (if used alone, without a sealant) and a little worse still on hot, sweltering days.</li>
            <li> Great when I can get it through Amazon at better price vs. in store.  Great for light case of rosacea and easy to reapply as needed during the day.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love the coverage provided by this powder and how light it is on my skin! I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It may be the &#x27;aqua&#x27; in the title, but I found when I applied this powder with my own fluffy brush, it had a slight damp feeling to the skin, which I found strange. The coverage is sheer, but it lasts, I would say four hours, before it needs to be reapplied. This also may be my oily skin. Would I buy it again? Probably not, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Excellent experience!  I highly recommend! Love it!</li>
