            <li>I love this BB Cream!</li>

            <li>skin has taken kindly to this product and I will be using it for some time to come.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>I like this, but not on its own.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays for a good 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Light is good for me even when I am tanned.</li>
            <li>Color is good for light and basically does as advertised.</li>
            <li>does not go on very smooth.  </li>

            <li>I received this for free, and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>I love the BB cream.</li>
            <li>Saves time and looks better than the longer make up route</li>
            <li>Paraben and oil free!</li>
            <li>Still I like it better than powder mineral make up.</li>
            <li>This product is super soft, gives excellent coverage, and is an all in one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>wonderful, does the job not too oily not too dry.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and so effortlessly.</li>
            <li>The coverage is light, but nothing a dab or two of concealer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>Comfortable as I forget I have &#x27;makeup&#x27; on.</li>
            <li>Even the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; color is too dark for those of us with very fair skin.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li>I need to make sure I cleanse really thoroughly.</li>
            <li>protection.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, when I first got this and opened it up and put it on, I was worried it would be too light for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>on smoothly and felt good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Has a slight cosmetic odor</li>
            <li>It blends really well and leaves a silky, smooth surface and not oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>wow i love this foundation goes on</li>
            <li>I received my package within a couple of days and had to try the product right</li>
            <li>, it gives you a glow, this is too much of a matte finish!</li>
            <li>I read through the reviews before purchasing and was hoping that the light version would be light enough for my skin, but it&#x27;s honestly a bit too dark.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and the seller and hope to order again in the future.  </li>
            <li>wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
            <li>I really like this BB CREAM.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is SPF 30!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face was very oily and greasy looking before the end of the day.</li>
            <li>BTW I live in Singapore which is hot now</li>
            <li>They have been absolutely outstanding, extremely caring and have done everything possible to make this right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY pale and this product really have me a nice NATURAL color and non streak...</li>
            <li>It blends seamlessly and is a lighter texture which I really like because I am not a fan of wearing make up.  </li>
            <li>makes my face glow and feel soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves your face feeling soft and you know while your wearing it that it has Anti Aging elements to it.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the texture and coverage of the Tars bb cream, it&#x27;s just that the color wasn&#x27;t blending well enough for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or cakey.</li>
            <li>It evens my skin tone, but does not cover spots completely.</li>
            <li>I am having some eczema near my lips and chin.</li>
            <li>I do use a moisturizing toner before applying since my skin needs a little extra moisture, some may do fine without that.  </li>
            <li>It looks a bit dark for me, but goes on really well and natural.</li>
            <li>But I was wrong, it goes on looking light, but then it blends into your skin really well.  </li>
            <li>The dark tube works very well with my tan skin.  </li>

            <li> Just average, nothing I&#x27;d buy again</li>
            <li> wow i love this foundation goes on smoothly looks amazing doesn&#x27;t make my face feel all oily. I love how it has sun protection in it too! makes my face glow and feel soft not that cakey feeling like some foundation does. amazing product! I received for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> wonderful, does the job not too oily not too dry. wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Bellisimo, Manifique, C&#x27;est Ce Bon!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and stays for a good 3-4 hours. Its lightweight and leaves no residue. The only downside is that for the amount I feel its a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I once again am disappointed with the amount of this product. It was only 1 oz and it was almost $25. This is a BB cream that I do not like. I thought I was ordering the anti-aging tinted moisturizing sunscreen, this was not it!</li>
            <li> Jumped on this during a sale. Bought two bottles as this is my regular BB cream. Light is good for me even when I am tanned.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB CREAM.  It is non-oily which is wonderful for my skin that breaks out easily.  I like that it is Paraben-Free.&lt;br /&gt;I got the Medium color which is perfect.  It blends really well and leaves a silky, smooth surface and not oily feeling.  It has SPF30 which is great because I worry about sun damage and skin cancer.  It has everything in one tube.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I have to say that until I had received this, I didn&#x27;t know there was a tinted moisturizer that also gave you sunscreen protection.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, when I first got this and opened it up and put it on, I was worried it would be too light for my skin tone.  I have a dark tan.  But I was wrong, it goes on looking light, but then it blends into your skin really well.  I really like the fact that it is SPF 30!!&lt;br /&gt;Which means I can wear make up in the sun!!!!  I am at an age, I don&#x27;t leave the house without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your face feeling soft and you know while your wearing it that it has Anti Aging elements to it.  This is just a great all around type of moisturizer!  I received this for free, and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I like CC cream bett, it gives you a glow, this is too much of a matte finish!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product on 01/16/2015 and received the package on 01/20/2015 via UPS, opened the box and found that the item is set to expire on 02/2015, so basically it has 10 days left on its life. Also the tube was not sealed when I opened the cap. Pay close attention to expiration date. see the picture</li>
            <li> Excellent.  That&#x27;s all I can say. Since receiving the bb cream, I use it everyday not only as a moisturizer --  the tint in it is PERFECT for my coloring -- I use it as my prime foundation --  I only apply blush.</li>
            <li> Made my skin burn.  Didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I love the BB cream. However, I bought it last week and just realized it expires 02/2015! I realize it is discounted but come one now!</li>
            <li> Even the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; color is too dark for those of us with very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I received my package within a couple of days and had to try the product right away.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to see it blended with my light skin tone perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;Went on smoothly and felt good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Has a slight cosmetic odor but I found that the odor dissipated in a very short  amount of time and after using the creme for a couple of days I didn&#x27;t notice it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has taken kindly to this product and I will be using it for some time to come.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and a company that was very pleasant to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;I give this BB Cream my highest recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to blend than I would think and attempts to do so sometimes result in those tinted rolling flakes. Color is good for light and basically does as advertised.</li>
            <li> Second time I reordered this...I&#x27;m VERY pale and this product really have me a nice NATURAL color and non streak...I&#x27;m very impressed and happy with this product.  Saves time and looks better than the longer make up route</li>
            <li> I like this, but not on its own. I have fair skin. I read through the reviews before purchasing and was hoping that the light version would be light enough for my skin, but it&#x27;s honestly a bit too dark. What I&#x27;ve been doing is mixing this together with the light version of Philosophy&#x27;s hope in a jar bb cream, with great results. I really do like the texture and coverage of the Tars bb cream, it&#x27;s just that the color wasn&#x27;t blending well enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream! It goes on smooth and so effortlessly. It&#x27;s not heavy or cakey. With this and my concealer, I can have a beautiful face! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and will not switch to anything else - it&#x27;s the best! This product is super soft, gives excellent coverage, and is an all in one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li> The shade is too dark. I haven&#x27;t worn it enough to notice if it helps the skin.</li>
            <li> I like this bb cream a lot. It feels great on my skin, the color is perfect, and I don&#x27;t feel I need to wear my normal arsenal of moisturizers when I wear it. The coverage is light, but nothing a dab or two of concealer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz talked about BB cream but I wouldn&#x27;t try it because of the ingredients.  Paraben and oil free! Perfect for summer-SPF 30 &amp; water-resistant.  I have sensitive skin &amp; have trouble finding SPF in facial products that doesn&#x27;t cause break out.  A few uses &amp; no problem!</li>
            <li> does not go on very smooth.  I also feel like the coverage is too sheer.  My face was very oily and greasy looking before the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It looks a bit dark for me, but goes on really well and natural. It evens my skin tone, but does not cover spots completely. I am having some eczema near my lips and chin. These areas are flaky, so the cream keeps the flaking to a minimum. Comfortable as I forget I have &#x27;makeup&#x27; on. As I have oily/combination skin, it gives me a bit of bumps.I need to make sure I cleanse really thoroughly. Still I like it better than powder mineral make up.BTW I live in Singapore which is hot now, I will not have used it this time of the year had I have my usual Oily/combination skin. But use it during the year end months that tends to be cooler. Overall, I like it and will buy again before I run out.</li>
            <li> I went through a lot to get the product and finally received one tube of the dark, waiting for the Medium yet.  I have been in contact with the seller because there were shipping issue from the Amazon warehouse, not the sellers fault.  They have been absolutely outstanding, extremely caring and have done everything possible to make this right.  I cannot say enough about their customer service.  They are located in Australia and even called me!  The dark tube works very well with my tan skin.  It blends seamlessly and is a lighter texture which I really like because I am not a fan of wearing make up.  It gives my skin a nice glow.  I do use a moisturizing toner before applying since my skin needs a little extra moisture, some may do fine without that.  It also seems to last through my long days.  I really love this product and the seller and hope to order again in the future.  I have a feeling the tube will last awhile since a little goes a long way.</li>
