            <li>More like a wax.  </li>
            <li>I love RC.</li>
            <li>Be sure you get the POMADE.</li>
            <li>but I must say this is in my top three.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite pomade.  </li>
            <li>this is a product for anything much more fancy than that.  </li>
            <li>We have never been able to find it at either store.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Probably the most shiny pomade there is.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash out of hair nightly</li>
            <li>does a better job than the axe paste I was using and looks better.  </li>
            <li>I find that a healthy dose of this pomade layered on top of another</li>
            <li>In comparison i didn&#x27;t care for the consistency with it being too greasy and more like vasaline.</li>
            <li>My nephews favorite brand.</li>
            <li>I thought it seemed pretty good</li>
            <li>, firmer hold pomade like Dax High &amp; Tight Awesome Hold provides the ideal balance between hold and malleability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great shine, light hold, and decent fragrance.</li>
            <li>For the seller: Great price and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Washes out easy in my hair.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to use and wash out.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to wash out.  </li>
            <li>It is a little light to use on its own in the heat, but when the weather is cool the hold is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Works just as good as normal royal crown but with a stronger hold</li>
            <li>This pomade is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Pretty great classic pomade, the shine is killer!</li>
            <li>I use it as a light topper over a strong hold pomade.</li>
            <li>Throw away your cheap walmart pomades.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this pomade, it&#x27;s a medium weight</li>
            <li>On my search for the perfect pomade I came across Royal Crown and decided to give it a try based on the fact that a few people have recommended it to me and also that Johnny Cash and Elvis used to use it.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a light hold pomade.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for something on the light side Royal Crown is the way to go</li>
            <li>If you want to avoid the crisp hold of most pomade, this one is for you.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find this product.</li>
            <li>still feels fresh on after hours of use!</li>
            <li>I work 12 hour shifts in a clean room</li>
            <li>Great product and will buy more in a few months when it runs out!</li>
            <li>If it was good enough for Johnny Cash, its good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also full of cowlicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Occasionally I like to go for a retro look, this does a good job of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a greaser by any sorts, in fact I have more of a classic business cut that I like to comb over.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very inexpensive too, which is a huge advantage over all those modern, synthetic pomades that cost so much and don&#x27;t work as nicely.</li>
            <li>If you have thin or regular hair and If you&#x27;re looking to try out a decent oil based lite hold pomade with great shine and a great price, then you can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
            <li>Very good pomade, hard to find.</li>
            <li>Upon put it in I noticed that it looked really good and kept my hair looking wet all day.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the wet look, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>they discontinued my beloved Sweet Georgia Brown (red), I went in search of a new default, and ended up trying this.</li>
            <li>After trying some old-school hair products for that slick, neat look, I&#x27;ve determined that this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li>She looks great and shines like no other, but you later figure out she doesn&#x27;t want to hold onto you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as old school as you get, it keeps a great medium hold if you have a short, classic mens haircut, and the shine from Royal Crown pomade is unsurpassed.</li>
            <li>It left a nice shine but didn&#x27;t provide much hold.</li>
            <li>A true classic that has never gone out of style....</li>
            <li>Royal Crown Pomade provides a light, maleable hold with a medium to high shine, depending on how much is applied.  </li>
            <li>However, it is also a HUGE pain to completely wash out.</li>
            <li>After searching far and wide, I&#x27;ve finally found a perfect pomade.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, this stuff works pretty well for what it is.</li>
            <li>I used about two quarter sized amounts in my damp hair and it held pretty well all day.</li>
            <li>Like many traditional pomades, it&#x27;s just petroleum jelly with fragrance.</li>
            <li>When I first put this on my hair</li>
            <li>Scoops out pretty greasy considering</li>
            <li>This pomade is exactly what I was looking for, it will not wash out unless you use shampoo, now a lot of people aren&#x27;t looking for a product like that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to put in and washes out easily, but has strong hold (not overly strong, but strong enough to keep it neat during a relatively active day) and makes your hair look slick and amazing in general if you use it right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to the pomade market, around 8 months or so, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>But, for great, classic hairstyles and the ultimate in light-hold, high-shine and pliability look no further.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of Royal Crown is much more mild than other hair products.</li>
            <li>and this is very easy to restyle with wet hands when I climb out of my gear.  </li>
            <li>It is a little oily, but has the feel of more natural oils versus the chemicals in most &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; hair products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do note that while this product is great for pomps or other similar hair styles, it is NOT water-based and IS petroleum-based.  </li>
            <li>The slick wet shine is awesome.</li>
            <li>Waxy, more so than American Crew Pomade (which is what I normally use,</li>
            <li>Hair gel does not do the job for me, it always doesnt have a strong enough hold, however this does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a perfect pomade that works really well with my hair because not only is it very thick</li>
            <li>The real bonus is the shine it gives to your hair.  </li>
            <li>and you will need to use a very residue clearing product in order to get this stuff out of your hair.</li>
            <li>While you can find its lesser version, Royal Crown Hair Dressing, almost anywhere, this pomade version is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I recently turned (would-be) rocker and wanted a true &amp;#34;rocker&amp;#34; pomade.</li>
            <li>I have typically used Murray&#x27;s i wanted to try something lighter and shinier,  this stuff delivered, i love the smell and it spreads through my hair with ease.  </li>
            <li>I looked this one up and it offered more for less money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same product those lovable greasers from &amp;#34;Raising Arizona&amp;#34; were so devoted to, as well as being used by the like of Johnny Cash and Elvis; it&#x27;s definitely got the reputation as the go-to pomade of the rocker/greaser.</li>
            <li>A classic for a reason.</li>
            <li>It works as expected, smells pretty nice and gives a decent wet look.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to fellow greasers.</li>
            <li>A lot of people complain about that with these old oil based pomades and for me, I didn&#x27;t really see a problem.</li>
            <li>If you just walk around normally, it will hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li>so it does not melt from the Royal Crown Hair Dressing I use to finish my hairdo, kinda spendy but worth every last cent!!!</li>
            <li>First, this pomade will not dry out, it will not flake, it will not wash out in the rain or on a run, it will remain comb-able and pliable all day, every day.  </li>
            <li>but I like to try new products)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other main two that I tried, Brylcreem and Murray&#x27;s, worked fine but had their major drawbacks (Brylcreem was extremely oily and didn&#x27;t have that strong of a hold, and Murray&#x27;s was really hard to put in, work with, and wash out while having extremely strong hold), and Royal Crown is a pomade that has their strengths but not their weaknesses!</li>
            <li>; on, you realize you spent too much money on someone who wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Some might say too much shine, in my opinion there is no such thing as too much shine.</li>
            <li>This is a great cold weather pomade.  </li>
            <li>People ask me all the time if I just showered when  I wear it, and the shine last the whole day.  </li>
            <li>it even held up at the gym, staying in my hair the whole time and stayed in for a second combing after a shower.</li>
            <li>I have not figured out how to get this product out of my hair completely at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, you can still rinse or even wash your hair every day, just do not think you will be able to get all of the pomade back out everyday.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a strong hold, it&#x27;s a light hold</li>
            <li>I put it in my hair wet and slick my hair back, the hold is good enough that I don&#x27;t have to recomb very often.</li>
            <li>but that was easily remedied with a small application of water and a pocket comb.</li>
            <li>Royal crown is the classic all American pomade.</li>
            <li>This translates into several benefits and one main drawback.  </li>
            <li>It works really well for a slicked back wet look, but doesn&#x27;t add much volume.</li>
            <li>To start, I have thick, short/medium hair that&#x27;s more rebellious than the French from 1789</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hold...not to stiff, not too soft.  </li>
            <li>However, this stuff can be pretty oily if you put too much in and there will be an amount of build up that might be hard to get out of your hair.</li>
            <li>Its kind of difficult to get our of your hair</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, the product in the red can is a true pomade, which is thicker in it&#x27;s consistency, whereas the product in the green can is a hair dressing, which is thinner in it&#x27;s consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to apply with either wet or dry hair, although I prefer wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very, very thick hair and after trying many water based pomades (which had no hold until an hour later when they just turned into a gel)</li>
            <li>Does not have alot of stiff hold to get high pomps, but if you use a heavier weight pomade as a base, Royal Crown works awesome.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to allow my thick hair to be combed back and keep it in place.  </li>
            <li>A little will give some texture, but if you are trying to style an undercut slicked back, you will find yourself using a large amount.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical of the \\&quot;light to medium\\&quot; hold reviews, since I have thick hair that isn&#x27;t easy to keep in place, but Royal Crown exceeded my expectations in every category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> On my search for the perfect pomade I came across Royal Crown and decided to give it a try based on the fact that a few people have recommended it to me and also that Johnny Cash and Elvis used to use it.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a light hold pomade.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for something on the light side Royal Crown is the way to go</li>
            <li> If you want to avoid the crisp hold of most pomade, this one is for you.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to find this product.</li>
            <li> still feels fresh on after hours of use!</li>
            <li> I work 12 hour shifts in a clean room</li>
            <li> Great product and will buy more in a few months when it runs out!</li>
            <li> If it was good enough for Johnny Cash, its good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also full of cowlicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Occasionally I like to go for a retro look, this does a good job of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a greaser by any sorts, in fact I have more of a classic business cut that I like to comb over.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very inexpensive too, which is a huge advantage over all those modern, synthetic pomades that cost so much and don&#x27;t work as nicely.</li>
            <li> If you have thin or regular hair and If you&#x27;re looking to try out a decent oil based lite hold pomade with great shine and a great price, then you can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
            <li> Very good pomade, hard to find.</li>
            <li> Upon put it in I noticed that it looked really good and kept my hair looking wet all day.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the wet look, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> they discontinued my beloved Sweet Georgia Brown (red), I went in search of a new default, and ended up trying this.</li>
            <li> After trying some old-school hair products for that slick, neat look, I&#x27;ve determined that this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li> She looks great and shines like no other, but you later figure out she doesn&#x27;t want to hold onto you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as old school as you get, it keeps a great medium hold if you have a short, classic mens haircut, and the shine from Royal Crown pomade is unsurpassed.</li>
            <li> It left a nice shine but didn&#x27;t provide much hold.</li>
            <li> A true classic that has never gone out of style....</li>
            <li> Royal Crown Pomade provides a light, maleable hold with a medium to high shine, depending on how much is applied.  </li>
            <li> However, it is also a HUGE pain to completely wash out.</li>
            <li> After searching far and wide, I&#x27;ve finally found a perfect pomade.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, this stuff works pretty well for what it is.</li>
            <li> I used about two quarter sized amounts in my damp hair and it held pretty well all day.</li>
            <li> Like many traditional pomades, it&#x27;s just petroleum jelly with fragrance.</li>
            <li> When I first put this on my hair</li>
            <li> Scoops out pretty greasy considering</li>
            <li> This pomade is exactly what I was looking for, it will not wash out unless you use shampoo, now a lot of people aren&#x27;t looking for a product like that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to put in and washes out easily, but has strong hold (not overly strong, but strong enough to keep it neat during a relatively active day) and makes your hair look slick and amazing in general if you use it right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to the pomade market, around 8 months or so, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> But, for great, classic hairstyles and the ultimate in light-hold, high-shine and pliability look no further.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of Royal Crown is much more mild than other hair products.</li>
            <li> and this is very easy to restyle with wet hands when I climb out of my gear.  </li>
            <li> It is a little oily, but has the feel of more natural oils versus the chemicals in most &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; hair products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do note that while this product is great for pomps or other similar hair styles, it is NOT water-based and IS petroleum-based.  </li>
            <li> The slick wet shine is awesome.</li>
            <li> Waxy, more so than American Crew Pomade (which is what I normally use,</li>
            <li> Hair gel does not do the job for me, it always doesnt have a strong enough hold, however this does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a perfect pomade that works really well with my hair because not only is it very thick</li>
            <li> The real bonus is the shine it gives to your hair.  </li>
            <li> and you will need to use a very residue clearing product in order to get this stuff out of your hair.</li>
            <li> While you can find its lesser version, Royal Crown Hair Dressing, almost anywhere, this pomade version is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I recently turned (would-be) rocker and wanted a true &amp;#34;rocker&amp;#34; pomade.</li>
            <li> I have typically used Murray&#x27;s i wanted to try something lighter and shinier,  this stuff delivered, i love the smell and it spreads through my hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> I looked this one up and it offered more for less money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same product those lovable greasers from &amp;#34;Raising Arizona&amp;#34; were so devoted to, as well as being used by the like of Johnny Cash and Elvis; it&#x27;s definitely got the reputation as the go-to pomade of the rocker/greaser.</li>
            <li> A classic for a reason.</li>
            <li> It works as expected, smells pretty nice and gives a decent wet look.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to fellow greasers.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain about that with these old oil based pomades and for me, I didn&#x27;t really see a problem.</li>
            <li> If you just walk around normally, it will hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li> so it does not melt from the Royal Crown Hair Dressing I use to finish my hairdo, kinda spendy but worth every last cent!!!</li>
            <li> First, this pomade will not dry out, it will not flake, it will not wash out in the rain or on a run, it will remain comb-able and pliable all day, every day.  </li>
            <li> but I like to try new products)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other main two that I tried, Brylcreem and Murray&#x27;s, worked fine but had their major drawbacks (Brylcreem was extremely oily and didn&#x27;t have that strong of a hold, and Murray&#x27;s was really hard to put in, work with, and wash out while having extremely strong hold), and Royal Crown is a pomade that has their strengths but not their weaknesses!</li>
            <li> ; on, you realize you spent too much money on someone who wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Some might say too much shine, in my opinion there is no such thing as too much shine.</li>
            <li> This is a great cold weather pomade.  </li>
            <li> People ask me all the time if I just showered when  I wear it, and the shine last the whole day.  </li>
            <li> it even held up at the gym, staying in my hair the whole time and stayed in for a second combing after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have not figured out how to get this product out of my hair completely at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, you can still rinse or even wash your hair every day, just do not think you will be able to get all of the pomade back out everyday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong hold, it&#x27;s a light hold</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair wet and slick my hair back, the hold is good enough that I don&#x27;t have to recomb very often.</li>
            <li> but that was easily remedied with a small application of water and a pocket comb.</li>
            <li> Royal crown is the classic all American pomade.</li>
            <li> This translates into several benefits and one main drawback.  </li>
            <li> It works really well for a slicked back wet look, but doesn&#x27;t add much volume.</li>
            <li> To start, I have thick, short/medium hair that&#x27;s more rebellious than the French from 1789</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of hold...not to stiff, not too soft.  </li>
            <li> However, this stuff can be pretty oily if you put too much in and there will be an amount of build up that might be hard to get out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Its kind of difficult to get our of your hair</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, the product in the red can is a true pomade, which is thicker in it&#x27;s consistency, whereas the product in the green can is a hair dressing, which is thinner in it&#x27;s consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to apply with either wet or dry hair, although I prefer wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very, very thick hair and after trying many water based pomades (which had no hold until an hour later when they just turned into a gel)</li>
            <li> Does not have alot of stiff hold to get high pomps, but if you use a heavier weight pomade as a base, Royal Crown works awesome.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to allow my thick hair to be combed back and keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> A little will give some texture, but if you are trying to style an undercut slicked back, you will find yourself using a large amount.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the \\&quot;light to medium\\&quot; hold reviews, since I have thick hair that isn&#x27;t easy to keep in place, but Royal Crown exceeded my expectations in every category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I go for the straight slick back</li>
            <li> A classic pomade for a slick looking pomp.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for an old-school, inexpensive pomade for a slick, old-fashioned hairdo.</li>
            <li> If I had to say one negative thing about this product I would say that it is very oily for a lite pomade.</li>
            <li> So, if you plan to completely wash out your pomade everyday, look elsewhere for a water-based pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually purchase the Suavecito pomade but decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this classic pomade does the job.  </li>
            <li> I walk around and occasionally smell a subtle scent and think to myself, &amp;#34;Someone has some class with a subtle crisp scent,&amp;#34; only to realize that the scent is this product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hold is weak but very pliable.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of using the crown,  I wanted to try a different pomade</li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> The choice of Johnny Cash, Brian Setzer, and other rockabilly favorites.</li>
            <li> Undercut Slick Back</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> so I just got my hair wet, put in some conditioner, let it sit for a half an hour,  and took a shower.</li>
            <li> Hubby got tired of using Vaseline, as it doesn&#x27;t have near the effect of Royal Crown.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus because the rumor I hear is this is what the Man in Black wore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing for my hubby who is a black man.  </li>
            <li> As you lay sobbing on the floor clenched tightly to the guitar you plan to learn &amp;#34;Where</li>
            <li> use it to slick back my hair, its not too hard</li>
            <li> Very hard to find locally</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> There were a few flyaways here and there</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy pomade with a lot of hold, this isn&#x27;t the stuff.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want any smell, you can use plain Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it held my extremely thick hair down, it will hold yours.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, I just have use less which unfortunately gives my thick crazy hair less hold.</li>
            <li> She tells you she&#x27;s not ready for a serious relationship, and that you were always the serious relationship type of guy.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find, I don&#x27;t care if Walmart sells it or Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> This is THE real deal pomade here, olive oil and petroleum jelly base</li>
            <li> Makes for a very slick look.</li>
            <li> so when they bought this they were probably surprised and disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product is VERY THICK and very heavy.  </li>
            <li> Not for the weak hearted.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad cowlicks and after a few hours, all the products I use usually lose there effectiveness before the end of the work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I opened the container I knew the hold wouldn&#x27;t be what I was expecting and the sheen was beyond my expectations,almost ridiculous!</li>
            <li> If you put this stuff in your hair and you shake your head violently, your hair will get a little messed up.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars but the shipping was expensive and it took a while to get here.</li>
            <li> This is nothing but expensive petrolatum.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect is to have some crazy hold.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great deal, fast shipping</li>
            <li> More like a wax.  The hold is weak but very pliable.  If you want to avoid the crisp hold of most pomade, this one is for you.  If trying to hold hair in place, then avoid.</li>
            <li> Very good pomade, hard to find. The choice of Johnny Cash, Brian Setzer, and other rockabilly favorites. Has a nice scent and medium hold. Throw away your cheap walmart pomades. I would have given 5 stars but the shipping was expensive and it took a while to get here.</li>
            <li> I love RC. It&#x27;s as old school as you get, it keeps a great medium hold if you have a short, classic mens haircut, and the shine from Royal Crown pomade is unsurpassed. I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> After searching far and wide, I&#x27;ve finally found a perfect pomade.  Just the right amount of hold...not to stiff, not too soft.  A true classic that has never gone out of style.... If it was good enough for Johnny Cash, its good enough for me.  &amp;#34;The pleasing smell is part of the appeal.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works just as good as normal royal crown but with a stronger hold</li>
            <li> Great shine, light hold, and decent fragrance. I use it in combination with heavier weight pomades and even some water based pomades. Makes a great topper. The slick wet shine is awesome. Does not have alot of stiff hold to get high pomps, but if you use a heavier weight pomade as a base, Royal Crown works awesome. Highly recommend it to fellow greasers. Be sure you get the POMADE. Royal Crown also makes a \\&quot;Hair Dressing\\&quot; which I do not like at all and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I like Royal Crown. Not too heavy. Great shine. Washes out easy in my hair. The smell is great, reminds me of my grandpa. Ya he always smelled good.</li>
            <li> After trying some old-school hair products for that slick, neat look, I&#x27;ve determined that this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far!

            <li> This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;I use it to slick back my hair, its not too hard and i can comb it with my hands.it still feels fresh on after hours of use! Its kind of difficult to get our of your hair but if you.use it daily like i do you wont have a problem with it at all. I would definitely buy again! Ive had it for 5 months and im bearly running out. Its a must buy for me</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this pomade, it&#x27;s a medium weight so it&#x27;s easy to use and wash out.  Also the price is reasonable and best of all there are no funky smells.  I put it in my hair wet and slick my hair back, the hold is good enough that I don&#x27;t have to recomb very often.</li>
            <li> On my search for the perfect pomade I came across Royal Crown and decided to give it a try based on the fact that a few people have recommended it to me and also that Johnny Cash and Elvis used to use it. I&#x27;m not a greaser by any sorts, in fact I have more of a classic business cut that I like to comb over. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a perfect pomade that works really well with my hair because not only is it very thick but it&#x27;s also full of cowlicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I popped this thing open it smelled so good and looks so shiny that I couldn&#x27;t wait to put it in my hair. Upon put it in I noticed that it looked really good and kept my hair looking wet all day.  Bottom line, this stuff works pretty well for what it is. I used about two quarter sized amounts in my damp hair and it held pretty well all day. There were a few flyaways here and there but that was easily remedied with a small application of water and a pocket comb.However, this stuff can be pretty oily if you put too much in and there will be an amount of build up that might be hard to get out of your hair. A lot of people complain about that with these old oil based pomades and for me, I didn&#x27;t really see a problem. After a few days of using the crown,  I wanted to try a different pomade so I just got my hair wet, put in some conditioner, let it sit for a half an hour,  and took a shower. Afterwords my hair was back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect pomade but I must say this is in my top three. If I had to say one negative thing about this product I would say that it is very oily for a lite pomade. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, I just have use less which unfortunately gives my thick crazy hair less hold. If you have thin or regular hair and If you&#x27;re looking to try out a decent oil based lite hold pomade with great shine and a great price, then you can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
            <li> This pomade is hands down the best. It has the best hold and it smells the best, life doesn&#x27;t get any tighter than this.</li>
            <li> Royal Crown pomade is just as I remembered it to be when I was a kid.  Great hold and smells good too.</li>
            <li> For the seller: Great price and super fast shipping. Couldn&#x27;t of asked for anything more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the product: It&#x27;s a light hold pomade. I style my hair in a slicked back style and this product did just that. I have very, very thick hair and after trying many water based pomades (which had no hold until an hour later when they just turned into a gel) I decided to get an oil-based pomade. If you put this stuff in your hair and you shake your head violently, your hair will get a little messed up. Surprise surprise. If you just walk around normally, it will hold your hair in place. If it held my extremely thick hair down, it will hold yours. Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t want any pomp or volume to my hair so I can&#x27;t speak to its ability to hold a 4 inch pomp up all day, but for what I use it for, it does the trick! Smells good (lavender but not noticeable unless you put ur nose in my hair) and has a nice shine to it (not even close to car grease as people claim). Doesn&#x27;t entirely washout with shampoo and conditioner, but will come out after a day of not reapplying it. Not a big deal!!! Great product and will buy more in a few months when it runs out!</li>
            <li> Royal Crown is a great pomade for its shine.  Being petroleum based, it has a good buildup.  I use it as a light topper over a strong hold pomade.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite pomade.  It is strong enough to allow my thick hair to be combed back and keep it in place.  It seems to be a good moisturizer and it is easy to wash out.  If you don&#x27;t mind the wet look, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this classic pomade does the job.  Great stuff! Keep in mind, the product in the red can is a true pomade, which is thicker in it&#x27;s consistency, whereas the product in the green can is a hair dressing, which is thinner in it&#x27;s consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to the pomade market, around 8 months or so, and this is by far my favorite.  I&#x27;ve been playing the field with different pomades and I always come back to this.  It&#x27;s extremely easy to apply with either wet or dry hair, although I prefer wet hair.  I work 12 hour shifts in a clean room and this is very easy to restyle with wet hands when I climb out of my gear.  I go for the straight slick back and it doesn&#x27;t seem like this is a product for anything much more fancy than that.  Towards the end of the day my hair starts falling to the sides, which I don&#x27;t mind as I start to look like Opie from SOA.  I&#x27;ve also never had any issues with getting grease on my pillow when I sleep in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus because the rumor I hear is this is what the Man in Black wore.</li>
            <li> Great product. Perfect for my hair. Makes for a very slick look. A classic pomade for a slick looking pomp.</li>
            <li> This is a great cold weather pomade.  It is a little light to use on its own in the heat, but when the weather is cool the hold is perfect.  The real bonus is the shine it gives to your hair.  People ask me all the time if I just showered when  I wear it, and the shine last the whole day.  A classic for a reason.</li>
            <li> BRUH THIS IS THE BEST POMADE IVE EVER USED, SUAVECITO HAS NO COMP ON THIS. THIS IS SOME NEXT LEVEL S***. BUY IT WHILE YOU CAN. #TYBG</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing for my hubby who is a black man.  This product is hard to find, I don&#x27;t care if Walmart sells it or Walgreens.  We have never been able to find it at either store.  Hubby got tired of using Vaseline, as it doesn&#x27;t have near the effect of Royal Crown.  We got it in the mail today and my husband is very happy.  He showed me the difference in products and he is very pleased that I thought of Amazon, where one can buy just about anything.  And ladies....it&#x27;s sooo wonderful on the feet!</li>
            <li> Like many traditional pomades, it&#x27;s just petroleum jelly with fragrance. If you don&#x27;t want any smell, you can use plain Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of Royal Crown is much more mild than other hair products. I would describe the scent as cinnamon and mothballs.</li>
            <li> I have typically used Murray&#x27;s i wanted to try something lighter and shinier,  this stuff delivered, i love the smell and it spreads through my hair with ease.  it even held up at the gym, staying in my hair the whole time and stayed in for a second combing after a shower. if you are looking for something on the light side Royal Crown is the way to go</li>
            <li> Greasy greasy greasy! When I first put this on my hair I thought it seemed pretty good but then when I tried to wash it off my hands I had to wash them over and over to get it off. When I came back from work and showered it to three shampoos to get it off my hair. Trash can!</li>
            <li> Best old school Pomade out there.</li>
            <li> Hair Style: Undercut Slick Back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Good hold for a Pomade (Not too strong or weak)&lt;br /&gt;2. I walk around and occasionally smell a subtle scent and think to myself, &amp;#34;Someone has some class with a subtle crisp scent,&amp;#34; only to realize that the scent is this product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Waxy, more so than American Crew Pomade (which is what I normally use, but I like to try new products)&lt;br /&gt;2. I have not figured out how to get this product out of my hair completely at the end of the day. Shampoo is not doing the trick (Probably attributed to the con #1)</li>
            <li> I got this pomade because I had heard good things about the way it shines all day, which it does! If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy pomade with a lot of hold, this isn&#x27;t the stuff. It works really well for a slicked back wet look, but doesn&#x27;t add much volume. It does work well for re-styling if your hair gets messed up throughout the day, which it probably will if you change shirts or wear hoodies, stuff like that. I go for a neat side part and I love it.</li>
            <li> Do I have anything great or spectacular to say about this product?  Not really.  It works as expected, smells pretty nice and gives a decent wet look.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great shine, alot of people like the smell, which is something like a barber shop if that makes sense, but not for me. This is a great topper thpugh all in all.</li>
            <li> To start, I have thick, short/medium hair that&#x27;s more rebellious than the French from 1789-1799.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Royal Crown pomade is like a beautiful girlfriend that you get together with the summer before you leave for college. You hear so many good things about her. She looks great and shines like no other, but you later figure out she doesn&#x27;t want to hold onto you. She tells you she&#x27;s not ready for a serious relationship, and that you were always the serious relationship type of guy. You tell her you can change but it&#x27;s no use. As you lay sobbing on the floor clenched tightly to the guitar you plan to learn &amp;#34;Where Did My Baby Go&amp;#34; on, you realize you spent too much money on someone who wasn&#x27;t worth it. Good shine, no hold, and pricy for what it is - olive oil and petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just great. I was skeptical of the \\&quot;light to medium\\&quot; hold reviews, since I have thick hair that isn&#x27;t easy to keep in place, but Royal Crown exceeded my expectations in every category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they discontinued my beloved Sweet Georgia Brown (red), I went in search of a new default, and ended up trying this. It smells awesome (subtle, but awesome), looks great, holds well but has a smooth texture, etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try. It&#x27;s been around for a while for a reason.</li>
            <li> This is THE real deal pomade here, olive oil and petroleum jelly base so it does not melt from the Royal Crown Hair Dressing I use to finish my hairdo, kinda spendy but worth every last cent!!!</li>
            <li> Royal crown is the classic all American pomade. A good medium to light hold, nice shine and a great scent.</li>
            <li> Pretty great classic pomade, the shine is killer! Probably the most shiny pomade there is. Some might say too much shine, in my opinion there is no such thing as too much shine. Scoops out pretty greasy considering the ingredients are petrolatum, olive oil, and fragrance. It&#x27;s not a strong hold, it&#x27;s a light hold so don&#x27;t expect is to have some crazy hold.</li>
            <li> Good for a comb-back pomade.  Occasionally I like to go for a retro look, this does a good job of it.  It is a little oily, but has the feel of more natural oils versus the chemicals in most &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; hair products.</li>
            <li> Not for the weak hearted.  Product is VERY THICK and very heavy.  A little will give some texture, but if you are trying to style an undercut slicked back, you will find yourself using a large amount.  Make sure to wash out of hair nightly and you will need to use a very residue clearing product in order to get this stuff out of your hair.</li>
            <li> great hold, great shine !!!!!</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first.  I have really bad cowlicks and after a few hours, all the products I use usually lose there effectiveness before the end of the work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does a better job than the axe paste I was using and looks better.  The smell is nice too.  Wish I could buy this in stores though.</li>
            <li> While you can find its lesser version, Royal Crown Hair Dressing, almost anywhere, this pomade version is fantastic.  Royal Crown Pomade provides a light, maleable hold with a medium to high shine, depending on how much is applied.  I find that a healthy dose of this pomade layered on top of another, firmer hold pomade like Dax High &amp; Tight Awesome Hold provides the ideal balance between hold and malleability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that while this product is great for pomps or other similar hair styles, it is NOT water-based and IS petroleum-based.  This translates into several benefits and one main drawback.  First, this pomade will not dry out, it will not flake, it will not wash out in the rain or on a run, it will remain comb-able and pliable all day, every day.  However, it is also a HUGE pain to completely wash out. So, if you plan to completely wash out your pomade everyday, look elsewhere for a water-based pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, you can still rinse or even wash your hair every day, just do not think you will be able to get all of the pomade back out everyday.  But, for great, classic hairstyles and the ultimate in light-hold, high-shine and pliability look no further.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase the Suavecito pomade but decided to try something new. I looked this one up and it offered more for less money. In comparison i didn&#x27;t care for the consistency with it being too greasy and more like vasaline. It left a nice shine but didn&#x27;t provide much hold.</li>
            <li> My nephews favorite brand. Very hard to find locally</li>
            <li> I had heard many good reviews from friends and decided to give it a try. As I opened the container I knew the hold wouldn&#x27;t be what I was expecting and the sheen was beyond my expectations,almost ridiculous! If you&#x27;re looking for something greasy with a light/medium hold this is your stuff. This just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> This is nothing but expensive petrolatum.</li>
            <li> This pomade is exactly what I was looking for, it will not wash out unless you use shampoo, now a lot of people aren&#x27;t looking for a product like that so when they bought this they were probably surprised and disappointed. If you are looking for a gel that will keep you hair back all day, this is your product. Hair gel does not do the job for me, it always doesnt have a strong enough hold, however this does.</li>
