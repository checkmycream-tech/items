            <li>wonderful.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is the best.</li>
            <li>I LOVED THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use to keep pimples under control without over drying your face.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Works great to reduce breakouts.</li>
            <li>Tea tree is great for acne and washing body after pools and lakes since its an antifungal.  </li>
            <li>My face feels great as soon as I wash it off.</li>
            <li>It cleans your skin very effectively.  </li>
            <li>Great, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It produces a very good lather and a refreshing wash that removes oil and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product, really happy I tried it.</li>
            <li>Great face wash that I have been using for many years now.</li>
            <li>i love it and def recommend it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>it great and skin friendly.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;d say for sensitive skin that is prone to being oily on occassion...probably not the best choice.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, effective, and feels and smells great - unlike a lot of prescription and drug store products.</li>
            <li>I love using Body Shop tea tree oil products.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too.</li>
            <li>i love the body shop tea tree products, this is no exception.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are people that this product works for.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;m sure it works for someone, but it isn&#x27;t helping my breakouts.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference but got even better results with the non foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>Made me break out even more.</li>
            <li>the foam soap who comes out is very gentle and pleasant to apply to the face.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice clean feel to your face and the tea tree wakes you up and helps you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting smell - not bad, just interesting - that took a couple days to get used to, and I wish it had a bit more foaming to it.  </li>
            <li>I really like cleansers with a foaming pump, and the Tea Tree wash does a good job of dispensing a lot of foam per pump, and rather than rubbing my hands together to lather the cleanser</li>
            <li>First, I LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li>Refreshing clean smell, works well as a cleanser on my oily skin</li>
            <li>It is really strong but it smells so clean.</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and my skin feels clean and smooth</li>
            <li>Made my skin better even after the first use.  </li>
            <li>first I enjoyed the feeling of stripping everything from my face - oils and all, but overtime</li>
            <li>Makes my face tingly clean, and not as oily as before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my face so clean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are great for dry scalp!</li>
            <li>placed a hand full of this product.</li>
            <li>at first the smell was strong, but i got used to it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, use it with all the other tea tree products from the body shop.</li>
            <li>It has made my previously controlled skin break out, and the smell is horribly strong and not relaxing or pleasant at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the squeaky clean cleanser from this line and loved it, so I had high hopes this would have similar cleansing abilities.</li>
            <li>The cleanser makes my face feel pretty clean and does remove any excess oil on my skin, but if you&#x27;re looking to really scrub off heavy-duty makeup you might want to look for a cleanser that has some exfoliating material and provides more gentle abrasion.</li>
            <li>But I used it everyday, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the blemish gel as well without any success.  </li>
            <li>Also the whole foaming thing and washing just doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling clean as a lather would.</li>
            <li>I have been using tea tree products for the past four years , it great on my skin, my skin has improved greatly from pimples etc, My completion is so much clearer than it was before, I would recommend this product to everyone male and female,</li>
            <li>I started out using the tea tree foaming cleanser first.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li>When you wash off the foam, there is a momentary refreshing feeling but not really lasting.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent and the tingle of the tea tree, but the foaming cleanser doesn&#x27;t seem to get my skin as clean as other types.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is very astringent, but this smells heavily of hot tar.  </li>
            <li>Compared to Clinique&#x27;s foaming wash this foam is less creamy and disappears more quickly.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face daily and my face feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>i bout this face wash at a discount store just to try it out and no other product has kept my face so clean.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Back then my skin was blotchy, scarred, and oily; now I get comments on how radiant and smooth it looks.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used concealer in ages thanks to the Body Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>Gently cleans all makeup and face.  </li>
            <li>Exactly the one I wanted &amp; basically was new and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I repeated this twice I left in on for 20min before washing it with warm water (help remove wax) do not rub and air dry face.</li>
            <li>It took away redness left my face feeling cool and no longer burning or  itching.</li>
            <li>I usually love the Tea Tree product line, but this one is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Not too harsh and has a cool, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was forced to give it away to a good home - to someone who swore by this product to clear up their acne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist highly recommended for roseacea.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t break out on my forehead</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty heavily of what I assume is the tea tree oil, but the scent is more acrid and chemical than fresh and green.  </li>
            <li>but like my face clear!</li>
            <li>This is the only tea tree/Body Shop product she uses at present, but we may use an extended line of the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree oil facial products just to see if we can get a handle on controlling her blemishes more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Took about a month for my face to get back to normal (which is a completely clear face with the exception of 1 or 2 around &amp;#34;that time&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not generally very oily but have been super shiny since using this product.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know how much I appreciated this product until I used a different foaming cleanser after I had run out of this</li>
            <li>....is so soft after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;The handle pressure to get the soap is quite soft and</li>
            <li>I have used this for 10 days so far without any improvement.  </li>
            <li>The amount it contains is quite adequate, I think the only point to improve would be to increase the concentrate of Tea Tree, but this is due to the high PH of my skin.</li>
            <li>i have oily skin and certain products dry my face out</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to work well with my Clarisonic and lasts a pretty long time even with daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would use it only when i broke out and it would clear up my face in a couple of days!</li>
            <li>wash (foaming and regular) is the ONLY thing that has kept my face clear!!</li>
            <li>I started using this when i was a teenage year old boy.</li>
            <li>I have to immediately apply moisturizer, and the one that goes with it barely moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have semi sensitive combination skin prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>I bought the toner, face mask, foaming face wash, and lotion just to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t mixing &amp; matching (and unintentionally making my skin worse).</li>
            <li>This product really cleans my face and keeps my acne down to a minimum!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive and oily and the cleanser was a bit harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time (and I use two pumps every time).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t believe in throwing out something that may have some long term use.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m broken out all over my face right now.</li>
            <li> This product DOES dry out my skin</li>
            <li> But, this cleanser overdries my skin, which makes me break out and SHINE (in a bad way) much more.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> as compared to other soaps.  </li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> usually use it in the shower for the steam, but if I&#x27;m just washing my face</li>
            <li> Really - when you wash your face with it, keep your mouth firmly closed - it tastes terrible!!</li>
            <li> The odor is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Even still... my face is so completely broken out in painful red bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li> I will use the rest of this product because it is expensive</li>
            <li> I am on a flightdeck 12 hours a day getting blasted in the face with jet exhaust, dirt and grease.</li>
            <li> i have to use lotion afterwards because this cleanser dries my skin bad.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> I keep using it because I hate to be wasteful.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was having absolutely horrible, horrendous, embarrassing breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst scent in the world.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Made my skin better even after the first use.  Not too harsh and has a cool, clean feeling.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this product am and pm ......it cleans without drying and I like the foaming.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use to keep pimples under control without over drying your face. I love using Body Shop tea tree oil products.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. You just need to put a bit and it&#x27;s great. Makes my face tingly clean, and not as oily as before. I love the scent too. I will repurchase after finished.</li>
            <li> Works great to reduce breakouts. i have oily T zones and this has the cleansing power to do that,</li>
            <li> Pros: Refreshing clean smell, works well as a cleanser on my oily skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know how much I appreciated this product until I used a different foaming cleanser after I had run out of this one.&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it is supposed to.  It produces a very good lather and a refreshing wash that removes oil and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work well with my Clarisonic and lasts a pretty long time even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this as my go-to cleanser.</li>
            <li> Tea tree is great for acne and washing body after pools and lakes since its an antifungal.  The shampoo and conditioner are great for dry scalp!</li>
            <li> Its Tea tree. Ofcourse its awesome. I started using this when i was a teenage year old boy. My parents bought me it</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product twice daily, and she is a teen with some acne.  She has stated that she has seen a reduction in her blemishes, but she still does have blemishes.  This is the only tea tree/Body Shop product she uses at present, but we may use an extended line of the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree oil facial products just to see if we can get a handle on controlling her blemishes more efficiently.</li>
            <li> i love the body shop tea tree products, this is no exception. i use 2 pumps of foam every day and it lasts for 3-4 months. it&#x27;s tingly like toothpaste, makes my face feel so refreshed. i have to use lotion afterwards because this cleanser dries my skin bad.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, use it with all the other tea tree products from the body shop. I like it a lot</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW IF IT WOULD HELP EVEN MY SKIN. IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AFTERWARD. I THINK THAT SOMETHING ELSE WILL GIVE FASTER RESULTS.</li>
            <li> This product really cleans my face and keeps my acne down to a minimum!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my skin. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really like cleansers with a foaming pump, and the Tea Tree wash does a good job of dispensing a lot of foam per pump, and rather than rubbing my hands together to lather the cleanser I can just start washing my face.  Compared to Clinique&#x27;s foaming wash this foam is less creamy and disappears more quickly.  It also smells pretty heavily of what I assume is the tea tree oil, but the scent is more acrid and chemical than fresh and green.  You do get used to it, though.  The cleanser makes my face feel pretty clean and does remove any excess oil on my skin, but if you&#x27;re looking to really scrub off heavy-duty makeup you might want to look for a cleanser that has some exfoliating material and provides more gentle abrasion.</li>
            <li> Exactly the one I wanted &amp; basically was new and fast shipping</li>
            <li> it is of excellent quality, got here in a timely manner. a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face daily and my face feels clean and fresh.  I recommend over soap which can leave a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are people that this product works for.  It does not work for me.  I keep using it because I hate to be wasteful.  But, this cleanser overdries my skin, which makes me break out and SHINE (in a bad way) much more.  I have to immediately apply moisturizer, and the one that goes with it barely moisturizes.  Like I said, I&#x27;m sure it works for someone, but it isn&#x27;t helping my breakouts.</li>
            <li> The Body Shop Tea Tree face wash (foaming and regular) is the ONLY thing that has kept my face clear!! I was having absolutely horrible, horrendous, embarrassing breakouts. I found this stuff, read some reviews, and about 2 weeks later, I was seeing results. Took about a month for my face to get back to normal (which is a completely clear face with the exception of 1 or 2 around &amp;#34;that time&amp;#34;). ONLY THING THAT WORKED FOR ME!</li>
            <li> I went from weekly breakouts to a zit a month after I started using this. Back then my skin was blotchy, scarred, and oily; now I get comments on how radiant and smooth it looks. It&#x27;s fast, effective, and feels and smells great - unlike a lot of prescription and drug store products. I haven&#x27;t used concealer in ages thanks to the Body Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it in the shower for the steam, but if I&#x27;m just washing my face I use an exfoliant to open up the pores first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t sing enough praises. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using tea tree products for the past four years , it great on my skin, my skin has improved greatly from pimples etc, My completion is so much clearer than it was before, I would recommend this product to everyone male and female, it great and skin friendly.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m in the navy and I use this every time i go underway. I am on a flightdeck 12 hours a day getting blasted in the face with jet exhaust, dirt and grease. When i started using this i didnt break out once!!</li>
            <li> It cleans your skin very effectively.  The only drawback is the smell.  Tea tree oil is very astringent, but this smells heavily of hot tar.  Perhaps it could have been gentled with some mint or rosemary.  Really - when you wash your face with it, keep your mouth firmly closed - it tastes terrible!!</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to like this product but it just didn&#x27;t work out like I hoped. I&#x27;m sensitive and oily and the cleanser was a bit harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I enjoyed the feeling of stripping everything from my face - oils and all, but overtime I noticed breakouts and dryness in spots I wasn&#x27;t used to. I was forced to give it away to a good home - to someone who swore by this product to clear up their acne. So it does work for some people, just not me.</li>
            <li> i bout this face wash at a discount store just to try it out and no other product has kept my face so clean. at first the smell was strong, but i got used to it. Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad. I&#x27;ve never had my face so clean. i would use it only when i broke out and it would clear up my face in a couple of days! Don&#x27;t like the price but like my face clear! Also, it gives your face a wonderful after wash feeling! i love it and def recommend it! i have oily skin and certain products dry my face out but this never did that. wonderful.</li>
            <li> ....is so soft after using this product.  It made a noticably difference!  It has an interesting smell - not bad, just interesting - that took a couple days to get used to, and I wish it had a bit more foaming to it.  But I used it everyday, and it works great.  It has definitely become an essential in my skin care regimen!</li>
            <li> First, I LOVE the scent! It is really strong but it smells so clean. It lasts a long time (and I use two pumps every time). I bought the toner, face mask, foaming face wash, and lotion just to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t mixing &amp; matching (and unintentionally making my skin worse). Even still... my face is so completely broken out in painful red bumps everywhere. I normally don&#x27;t break out on my forehead but I&#x27;m broken out all over my face right now. I&#x27;ve used it for around a month and it reminds me a lot of how I reacted to Proactiv. I&#x27;m not generally very oily but have been super shiny since using this product. So, I&#x27;d say for sensitive skin that is prone to being oily on occassion...probably not the best choice.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was having breakouts and my Dr. suggested I use a tea tree skin cleanser.  I did notice a difference but got even better results with the non foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the tingle of the tea tree, but the foaming cleanser doesn&#x27;t seem to get my skin as clean as other types. I&#x27;ve used the squeaky clean cleanser from this line and loved it, so I had high hopes this would have similar cleansing abilities. I&#x27;ll definitely still use it, but would probably purchase a different type in the future.</li>
            <li> Cleans but left a burning sensation after use</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve never been prone to breakouts or anything, but this helps keep away the occasional blemish. My face feels great as soon as I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Gently cleans all makeup and face.  I have sensitive skin and this did not bother it.  Tea tree oil is the best.</li>
            <li> Yes, a man uses this product.  Been using it for some time at the urging of my wife.  It keeps my facial skin cleaner and fresher-feeling that any soap could.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used it for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;The handle pressure to get the soap is quite soft and the foam soap who comes out is very gentle and pleasant to apply to the face. The amount it contains is quite adequate, I think the only point to improve would be to increase the concentrate of Tea Tree, but this is due to the high PH of my skin.</li>
            <li> I started out using the tea tree foaming cleanser first. I have mixed feelings about this product because I feel on some days it works and on others it doesn&#x27;t. Also the whole foaming thing and washing just doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling clean as a lather would. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the scent of the tea tree line but I&#x27;ve learned to accept it. It&#x27;s not the worst scent in the world. Overall I have semi sensitive combination skin prone to break outs. This product DOES dry out my skin so I have to follow up with a creamy moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have breakouts I&#x27;d suggest trying the tea tree line but if you&#x27;re using a device within the clarisonic line stay away from the tea tree line and go with aloe.</li>
            <li> My sister had recommend and asked I try this product ..because she swears by it. I did and I like it.. but it wasn&#x27;t till I went to my salon for a wax that burned and left my face itching and red! I went home placed a hand full of this product. .it stopped the itching and cooled it on the spot! I repeated this twice I left in on for 20min before washing it with warm water (help remove wax) do not rub and air dry face. It took away redness left my face feeling cool and no longer burning or  itching. I&#x27;ve used this on my son&#x27;s hand rash cleared up on the third day! I LOVED THIS PRODUCT!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!  :o)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you  Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower in the morning. You only need about 2 pumps to wash your face. It provides a nice clean feel to your face and the tea tree wakes you up and helps you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love this product, really happy I tried it. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I will use the rest of this product because it is expensive and I don&#x27;t believe in throwing out something that may have some long term use.  I have used this for 10 days so far without any improvement.  The foam is the only beneficial feature.  The odor is not pleasant.  There is a drying effect which may be part of the treatment.  When you wash off the foam, there is a momentary refreshing feeling but not really lasting.  I will not buy this line of products again.  I have tried the blemish gel as well without any success.  Since everyone is different though, your chemistry may work with this product.</li>
            <li> Great face wash that I have been using for many years now.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money. Made me break out even more.</li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredients, it&#x27;s made with several oils, and I have never had a face wash leave my skin feeling this oily so soon after I use it.  It has made my previously controlled skin break out, and the smell is horribly strong and not relaxing or pleasant at all.  Tea tree oil isn&#x27;t meant for everything, especially face wash for \\&quot;oily skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Great, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I usually love the Tea Tree product line, but this one is not worth the money.  It does not lather well (at all) as compared to other soaps.  Try something else.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because this product is fantastic. I use it morning and night&lt;br /&gt;it cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and my skin feels clean and smooth</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot</li>
            <li> Dermatologist highly recommended for roseacea. Amazing</li>
