            <li>Which is why I started playing with the ingredients to make my own.</li>
            <li>I found dispensing the toner via spray is not as effective as a liquid application would be.</li>
            <li>My daughter took it and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>The application could be better but it is still highly effective for encouraging good skin.</li>
            <li>love to mist my face during the day anytime I need a freshening, it does a nice job of &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; makeup that has settled into lines and creases.</li>
            <li>It is directed to use twice daily for best results.</li>

            <li>I love the Arbonne products.</li>
            <li>I really do love this spray, but the price...</li>
            <li>I love arbone products, but the containers are invariably a problem.</li>
            <li>Great products at very affordable prices.  </li>
            <li>Glad you carry the product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Arbonne product.  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing to spray on each morning</li>
            <li>It really is great to find something that really works.</li>
            <li>I love all the arbonne product line.</li>
            <li>I FEEL IN LOVE WITH IT THEN</li>
            <li>Love this product easy to travel with</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is volatile and can become unstable extremely easily.</li>
            <li>This is easy to put on but you have to get used to spraying yourself in the face.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ll probably be fine with it, but it&#x27;s just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>This one jets out a stream on your face instead of a fine mist.</li>
            <li>It is a fine mist</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth it for all age groups!  </li>
            <li>Thought I was ordering the size that came in my original kit.</li>
            <li>BUT WELL WORTH EVERY CENT!</li>
            <li>Who knows if this is true but</li>
            <li>Did not feel full upon arrival.</li>
            <li>I love the whole RE9 line.</li>
            <li>This toner gives the skin a nice glow and prepares the face for the rest of the RE9 daily products.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product is nice but not terrific.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>If used consistently skin tone starts evening out quickly.</li>
            <li>but it will make a small difference which is more than most beauty products can claim.</li>
            <li>Now truth be told, I have dissected the ingredients and actually been able to come up with a pretty close DIY recipe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not know what the level was when I first purchased it, but the vitamin c properties after 3 weeks were just not beneficial.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Such a refreshing start to my day.</li>
            <li>THIS IS PRODUCT IS IN THE TOP TEN.</li>
            <li>know you&#x27;re getting a brand new FULL product with pump that works.</li>
            <li>This toner really tightens and firms your skin.    </li>
            <li>The spray doesn&#x27;t cover my whole face with one spritz and from what I know about Arbonne, the products are concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Gosh I sound like a commercial</li>
            <li>and I absolutely swear by there RE9 cleanser, toner and lotion.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone willing to pay the price for clear, moisturized, even skin.</li>
            <li>I use the full line of Arbonne RE9 products (skincare) and have had people tell me how much younger I look since I started using it</li>
            <li>All the Arbonne products have the slight orange fragrance which is so refreshing.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is not your main purpose for purchase</li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER HIGH END PRODUCTS, BUT BY FAR</li>
            <li>Would not purchase from this merchant--would suggest buying from Arbonne direct for a few dollars more and</li>
            <li>I was not using it at first, but now I use it daily.</li>
            <li>It has been one of the factors for my clear skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and it does not irratate.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving 3 stars for this particular product review was when I received my toner the bottom of the bottle was damaged so product leaked out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I rarely get acne and my skin seems soft with less wrinkles.</li>
            <li>it actually helped clear up my seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of money on various products and prescriptions to treat acne and dry skin and this series of products helps with it all!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste a whole other spritz on the other side of my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a home show and never really used it.  </li>
            <li> and I also had an empty bottle to pour the remaining product into.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and you will notice a difference.  </li>

            <li> What I wanted for less.  </li>
            <li> IT IS A LITTLE PRICEY</li>
            <li> This was rather disappointing to me, because like I said, I really like it and found that my skin does too.</li>
            <li> I have used Arbonne for a few years now and this is one product that I like to keep on hand.  </li>
            <li> Use this everyday and what a difference it has made in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I realize it is pricey, but it works and you need very little.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to - even if it is a small thing, if it is one small thing I can keep out of the landfill</li>
            <li> Theregular day creme is thick and dr.  </li>
            <li> I mean that.</li>
            <li> what I do like about it is the fact that I see a subtle difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is way to expensive to put up with this.</li>
            <li> It has gotten difficult for me to get them.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the size of the Regenerating Toner.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered Advancede Restorative Day Cream and received Restorative Day Cream.  This is the second time this has happened to me.  Theregular day creme is thick and dr.  I can;t use this product either ut don&#x27;t have the time to go through sending it back.</li>
            <li> The Arbonne sales lady said the toner helps regenerate the turnover of skin cells. Who knows if this is true but what I do like about it is the fact that I see a subtle difference when I use it. I rarely get acne and my skin seems soft with less wrinkles. My pores seem diminished as well. Is this going to miraculously cut off 10 years? No but it will make a small difference which is more than most beauty products can claim. Arbonne&#x27;s moisturizers don&#x27;t work for me but their primer and this toner I will splurge on. The only downside is the stupid spray which will only cover one side or if you direct it towards your nose you can possibly get most of your face covered though not all. It is directed to use twice daily for best results.</li>
            <li> i love this toner it is really good for your face ilove all of the arbonne products  they are really good.</li>
            <li> This toner is a part of the RE9 Advanced Moisture set for women over 40 and upwards! This toner gives the skin a nice glow and prepares the face for the rest of the RE9 daily products. A friend of mine swears by this, so I tried it along with the other Arbonne products - I was not using it at first, but now I use it daily.</li>
            <li> The greatest toner available, love spraying it on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Friends have mentioned how my skin always looks alive and moist.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it feels good, and I&#x27;m 70..</li>
            <li> All of the Arbonne products are excellent!  This toner really tightens and firms your skin.    From:  Faithful User</li>
            <li> I have used Arbonne for a few years now and this is one product that I like to keep on hand.  It has been one of the factors for my clear skin.</li>
            <li> I love the Arbonne products. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really do love this spray, but the price...notsomuch, hence the star deduction. I bought mine at an Arbonne party simply because I didn&#x27;t want to be the only one walking away without a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I love to mist my face during the day anytime I need a freshening, it does a nice job of &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; makeup that has settled into lines and creases. Now truth be told, I have dissected the ingredients and actually been able to come up with a pretty close DIY recipe.&lt;br /&gt;While the recipe may cost about the same as buying a bottle, it ends up being a fraction of the price when you consider that I can make enough to fill 12 bottles....now that said, I simply just would not do that because of the concern of vitamin c oxidization. Which is actually another reason I knocked a star off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just not sure that this brand has done enough to protect the vitamin c content of this product. Vitamin C is volatile and can become unstable extremely easily. I had my bottle for about three weeks when it occurred to me that I should test the pH levels. It tested at a pH of 5. Vitamin C is best absorbed by the skin at levels of 3.5 or lower. I do not know what the level was when I first purchased it, but the vitamin c properties after 3 weeks were just not beneficial. This was rather disappointing to me, because like I said, I really like it and found that my skin does too. Which is why I started playing with the ingredients to make my own. This way I can make smaller batches and ensure that the vitamin c remains stable.&lt;br /&gt;If Vitamin C is not your main purpose for purchase then you&#x27;ll probably be fine with it, but it&#x27;s just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;BTW - Amazon doesn&#x27;t list the ingredients so in case you are wondering -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Witch Hazel Water, Glycerin, Isoceteth-20, Polysorbate 80, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Betula Alba Leaf Extract, Cucumber, Hypericum Perforatum Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Clover Flower Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Thioctic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenate Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Polyamino Sugar Condensate, Stearamine, Urea, Lecithin, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbatehamnoides Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Thioctic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenate Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Polyamino Sugar Condensate, Stearamine, Urea, Lecithin, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;mist\\&quot; mode of application, however. The spray doesn&#x27;t cover my whole face with one spritz and from what I know about Arbonne, the products are concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot. I don&#x27;t want to waste a whole other spritz on the other side of my face. I do one spray on my face and spread it with my fingertips and a second spray on my neck and also spread it with my fingertips. The directions also suggest using a cotton ball but I don&#x27;t want to - even if it is a small thing, if it is one small thing I can keep out of the landfill then I will do that.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and what a difference it has made in my complexion. Wouldn&#x27;t use any other products on my face!</li>
            <li> Arbonne products are a terrific skin care regiment.  Use all the facial products and truly see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOVVVE this toner!!!!!! I use this product every day! doesnt irritate my skin...it actually helped clear up my seborrheic dermatitis. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I love arbone products, but the containers are invariably a problem. This one jets out a stream on your face instead of a fine mist. I have dumped it into another sprayer to fix the problem. This stuff is way to expensive to put up with this.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is acceptable.  I found dispensing the toner via spray is not as effective as a liquid application would be.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a home show and never really used it.  My daughter took it and really liked it.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The product came on time even sooner than projected.  Great products at very affordable prices.  Recommend this company for Arbonne Products.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like the product and will continue to use it.  Feels very refreshing when I spray it on.  Glad you carry the product.</li>
            <li> What I wanted for less.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use the full line of Arbonne RE9 products (skincare) and have had people tell me how much younger I look since I started using it (and I&#x27;m 49 and have been using these products for 4 years).  Finding a good deal on Amazon makes it easier on my pocketbook too!!</li>
            <li> This is easy to put on but you have to get used to spraying yourself in the face. It doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. I think it adds moisture back into my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is nice but not terrific.  I use it because it came with the entire set. I can&#x27;t actually see a difference when using it</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of money on various products and prescriptions to treat acne and dry skin and this series of products helps with it all!  I know it&#x27;s spendy but it is definitely worth it for all age groups!  A little goes a long way and you will notice a difference.  Gosh I sound like a commercial don&#x27;t I?  Not trying to sell this product but I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone willing to pay the price for clear, moisturized, even skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Arbonne product.  It is refreshing to spray on each morning and it makes your face feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> Excellent toner and lasts quite a while</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference in my skin when I use this toner.  It balances the PH after washing even with water.</li>
            <li> I love Arbonne products!  It has gotten difficult for me to get them. Thank you Amazon. This products is a face prefector.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne products for well over a year now and I absolutely swear by there RE9 cleanser, toner and lotion. The only reason I am giving 3 stars for this particular product review was when I received my toner the bottom of the bottle was damaged so product leaked out of the bottle. Thankfully when they ship they put them in plastic bags and I also had an empty bottle to pour the remaining product into. For the amount of product you get for the price every drop matters.</li>
            <li> I felt or saw no difference with the product and would not recommend it to anyone, but just did not work for me</li>
            <li> I use this toner all of the time.  My skin never feels dry, only hydrated just like it should feel</li>
            <li> Such a refreshing start to my day.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!! I mean that. I realize it is pricey, but it works and you need very little. It is a fine mist so it last forever and makes such a difference in my skin. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful. The ingredients are all natural and not at all harsh. All the Arbonne products have the slight orange fragrance which is so refreshing. I use their face care products daily and over the last year have seen such a difference in my skin. It really is great to find something that really works.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order from this distributor again!!! Happy customer.</li>
            <li> Love this product easy to travel with</li>
            <li> I love all the arbonne product line. I have nothing but wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Things go say. I use this product along with the face wash, scrub and day cream</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the size of the Regenerating Toner. Thought I was ordering the size that came in my original kit.</li>
            <li> Have been using Arbonne for years!  It does not dissapoint!  My skin is soft and it does not irratate.</li>
            <li> Disapointed that the pump did not work. Did not feel full upon arrival. Would not purchase from this merchant--would suggest buying from Arbonne direct for a few dollars more and know you&#x27;re getting a brand new FULL product with pump that works.</li>
            <li> I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS PRODUCT ABOUT 2 YRS AGO. I FEEL IN LOVE WITH IT THEN AND I AM STILL HOOKED. I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER HIGH END PRODUCTS, BUT BY FAR THIS IS PRODUCT IS IN THE TOP TEN. IT IS A LITTLE PRICEY BUT WELL WORTH EVERY CENT!</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised.  So glad to have my supply replenished!</li>
            <li> Arbonne products are the best.  I love the whole RE9 line.</li>
            <li> If used consistently skin tone starts evening out quickly. It is definitely worth the price. The application could be better but it is still highly effective for encouraging good skin.</li>
