            <li>Been my favorite since I&#x27;ve got it!</li>
            <li>Island Fantasy smells like mouthwatering citrus with a nice dose of violet and sugar on top (all of my favorites!).</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>, it really could be a wonderful gem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Britney Spears perfume</li>
            <li>The scent is nice...</li>
            <li>I am loving this perfume</li>
            <li>I wish I bought what I knew I liked....</li>
            <li>ok sounds good....</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, wears off too fast.</li>
            <li>It smells nice for 5 minutes after you spray it, but then starts to fade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: ISLAND FANTASY is pleasant and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>I love Britney Spears, and I love her perfumes!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know this when I bought it because I thought that all Britney perfumes were eau de parfum, which is probably the reason why they age exceptionally well and stay a longer while and just get better and better.</li>
            <li>Island Fantasy is a sparkling happy perfume that smells like pure honey sunshine, I love it!</li>
            <li>It looks so beautiful sitting out just ready to be sprayed.</li>
            <li>If you try it, Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I figured I would love this one as well.</li>
            <li>Very summer-ry :) great price too</li>
            <li>its just ok.</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Love it to death</li>
            <li>oops :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell it is one of my favorite Fantasy perfumes.</li>
            <li>I has more of a orangy tanginess to it.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>The price was really great to and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li>If it had more vanilla it would be better.  </li>
            <li>I love this version of Fantasy .</li>
            <li>I love the scent...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unique.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this and it would also make a great gift.</li>
            <li>2 for the would be scent and the 3rd star for the beautiful bottle which really does remind one of a beautiful tropical island.</li>
            <li>Smells good but not as good as regular fantasy.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty and looks nice with the rest of my Fantasy collection.  </li>
            <li>its sweet with notes of citrus and passion fruit with a creamy finish perfect for everyday or evening its a summer scent for sure !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells like strong flowers with musk and a hint of vanilla....</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on and got a blast of strong perfumey fruit.  </li>
            <li>It is an EDT which isn&#x27;t supposed to be as strong as EDP.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that struck me when I smelled it was the citrus smell, which fades slightly to a nice floral scent.</li>
            <li>its juicy fruity sweet and so light!  </li>
            <li>If you like light, fruity, summer scents...</li>
            <li>It is so fresh and the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li>Has a very breezy kind of melon scent to it.</li>
            <li>I will upload my own personal photo of my bottle I own.</li>
            <li>it is nice light smelling that stays with you the whole day.</li>
            <li>Never thought I would go for &amp;#34;Artiste&amp;#34; scents, but the clean lines of this product by Britney Spears is an amazing perfume and really lasts</li>
            <li>but I prefer midnight fantasy and the original fantasy smell over this one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick around like the original Fantasy even though I thoroughly douse myself in it.</li>
            <li>So I actually bought this perfume because the reviews on it were really good.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the bottle came super fast</li>
            <li>But this is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>I went through a bottle so quickly -</li>
            <li>You will really enjoy this if you like fresh light scents rather then very sugary sweet scents.</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I saw that island fantasy was available, although not as readily as the others</li>
            <li>Which I very much like!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this perfume doesn&#x27;t last long at all, I&#x27;d say 15 best minutes, and the reason why is because it is an Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li>I keep sampling different brands of Britney Spears&#x27; perfumes and every time they just keep getting better!  </li>
            <li>I love the way this smells, but only have it three stars because it wears off very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This one offers a very light  calm scent.</li>
            <li>It is worth it to get it.</li>
            <li>Clearly I was expecting all the sweet-fruity scents I read online however this fragance is more citrusy than anything else.</li>
            <li>Better smell than most of my other perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into this scent really, it smells like the original fantasy with a after scent of like lemon-y, citrus-y.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t smell it without putting it right up to my face.</li>
            <li>The only one I haven&#x27;t really liked is Circus Fantasy, but I looooooooooove this one so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is some sandalwood here, as after a few hours ISLAND FANTASY begins to remind me of J.Lo Love &amp; Glamour, which uses bucket loads of it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Island Fantasy because it reminds me of being back home on the beach.</li>
            <li>is the first one I was like &amp;#34;wow, that smells nothing like what it says&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Her</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, a new favorite, it smells so tropical, but light not heavy like some of her other perfumes!</li>
            <li>well..........&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell like ANY citrus, berry or fruity smell of ANY kind that was stated were in there (as well as the other notes).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly its so much fresher than the original scent but at the same time similar.</li>
            <li>it came sealed and new like it was advertised!!  </li>
            <li>Overall, the scent is nice and definitely for the hot summer days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a summer scent, and it could be nicer but something about it doesn&#x27;t really work with my chemistry.  </li>
            <li>People say the scent goes away to fast , That however is not the case.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as original Fantasy, but while it is there, it is strong.  </li>
            <li>I love this smell out of all her other fantasy scents but it is toilette</li>
            <li>This fragrance is so juicy and fruity and fresh and light, I literally pictured myself on a tropical beach with a warm salty breeze coming off the crystal clear blue water onto the white sand with tall Palm trees everywhere and a clear blue sky....</li>
            <li>Island fantasy is the only fantasy that smells diffrent from the original</li>
            <li>To me it smells like watery greens with a tiny bit of sweet.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never seen this particular one in the store.</li>
            <li>I sprayed a good amount on a shirt that I wasn&#x27;t wearing to see how long it would last (keeping it away from myself to eliminate the olfactory fatigue factor) and went back in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Another total plus is the bottle, it is absolutely stunning with a lovely lime green fading into a tropic malibu blue and accented with sparkling crystals.</li>
            <li>the scent does not last long nor does it make me feel sexy.  </li>
            <li>New box, but the bottle itself was loose around the neck and looked like it wasn&#x27;t full.  </li>
            <li>Might just be my new</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not that long lasting or strong,</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t your typical tropic scent of coconut or so; it&#x27;s rather a berry and light island flower type of scent.</li>
            <li>I will enjoy this bottle while it lasts but with the frequency I am using it that may be a month or less.</li>
            <li>other ones have always stayed true to their notes.</li>
            <li>Just a little too light for me.</li>
            <li>The mandarin is the strongest fruit note on me and, and coupled with the raspberry, gives the fragrance a soft, fuzzy feel.</li>
            <li>My mom sent this too me as an early christmas gift.</li>
            <li>all I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li>I blind bought this because I&#x27;m a fan of Britney spears fantasy line and had read all the good reviews for this, and</li>
            <li>There is a breeze of orange blossom, freesia and occasional hint of violet underneath it all, but none of the floral notes are truly strong enough to stand out from the fruits for long.</li>
            <li>It lasts exceptionally long, which I DO like, so I think I may be getting more use out of this perfume than previously thought.</li>
            <li>it is more subtle then the others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely light and summery but for this reason, I&#x27;m not sure if I like it.</li>
            <li>&#x27;go to&#x27; fragrance (prior one was new formulation Ambush).</li>
            <li>that other users are talking about, it pretty much smells like watermelon with a slight floral undertone to me.</li>
            <li>Could not get the sweet notes, watermelon, or other things previously described.</li>
            <li>It is light, a little fruity, and a little citrusy.</li>

            <li> it came sealed and new like it was advertised!!  </li>
            <li> Overall, the scent is nice and definitely for the hot summer days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a summer scent, and it could be nicer but something about it doesn&#x27;t really work with my chemistry.  </li>
            <li> People say the scent goes away to fast , That however is not the case.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as original Fantasy, but while it is there, it is strong.  </li>
            <li> I love this smell out of all her other fantasy scents but it is toilette</li>
            <li> This fragrance is so juicy and fruity and fresh and light, I literally pictured myself on a tropical beach with a warm salty breeze coming off the crystal clear blue water onto the white sand with tall Palm trees everywhere and a clear blue sky....</li>
            <li> Island fantasy is the only fantasy that smells diffrent from the original</li>
            <li> To me it smells like watery greens with a tiny bit of sweet.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never seen this particular one in the store.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a good amount on a shirt that I wasn&#x27;t wearing to see how long it would last (keeping it away from myself to eliminate the olfactory fatigue factor) and went back in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Another total plus is the bottle, it is absolutely stunning with a lovely lime green fading into a tropic malibu blue and accented with sparkling crystals.</li>
            <li> the scent does not last long nor does it make me feel sexy.  </li>
            <li> New box, but the bottle itself was loose around the neck and looked like it wasn&#x27;t full.  </li>
            <li> Might just be my new</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that long lasting or strong,</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t your typical tropic scent of coconut or so; it&#x27;s rather a berry and light island flower type of scent.</li>
            <li> I will enjoy this bottle while it lasts but with the frequency I am using it that may be a month or less.</li>
            <li> other ones have always stayed true to their notes.</li>
            <li> Just a little too light for me.</li>
            <li> The mandarin is the strongest fruit note on me and, and coupled with the raspberry, gives the fragrance a soft, fuzzy feel.</li>
            <li> My mom sent this too me as an early christmas gift.</li>
            <li> all I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li> I blind bought this because I&#x27;m a fan of Britney spears fantasy line and had read all the good reviews for this, and</li>
            <li> There is a breeze of orange blossom, freesia and occasional hint of violet underneath it all, but none of the floral notes are truly strong enough to stand out from the fruits for long.</li>
            <li> It lasts exceptionally long, which I DO like, so I think I may be getting more use out of this perfume than previously thought.</li>
            <li> it is more subtle then the others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely light and summery but for this reason, I&#x27;m not sure if I like it.</li>
            <li> &#x27;go to&#x27; fragrance (prior one was new formulation Ambush).</li>
            <li> that other users are talking about, it pretty much smells like watermelon with a slight floral undertone to me.</li>
            <li> Could not get the sweet notes, watermelon, or other things previously described.</li>
            <li> It is light, a little fruity, and a little citrusy.</li>
            <li> Do not get me wrong, it is a nice scent, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> how long fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li> I usually like my perfumes a bit stronger, and this is definitely not strong, but I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s an EDT and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other Fantasy perfumes, but it does last longer than Escada&#x27;s Rockin Rio for me</li>
            <li> So yeah; this is quieter and doesn&#x27;t wear as long as the rest of the Fantasy line, so beware of that</li>
            <li> ISLAND FANTASY does go close to the skin fairly quickly, but a faint woody scent is still detectable five hours later.</li>
            <li> It does not last as long as the other Fantasy perfumes though, but then some of those can seem to be a bit overbearing.</li>
            <li> Soft delicate fragrance in a very pretty green bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Not very strong or lasting at all.</li>
            <li> Basically the same scent, but for some reason I smelled less watermelon in that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally like my perfumes a little stronger smelling and to me this perfume smells like a hollister type perfume.</li>
            <li> have ALL of her perfumes (minus that circus one..smells like a hamster cage)!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My favorite parfums are fruity and tropical scents and if you like this type, you will not be disappointed with Britney&#x27;s newest fragrance in the Fantasy collection.</li>
            <li> Reduced rating from 5 to 4 due to</li>
            <li> I put it in the breakroom at my work for other girls to wear</li>
            <li> compared to the other installments of Fantasy by Britney Spears.</li>
            <li> After it calmed down, all I could smell was watermelon and an odd scent in the background.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a fruity perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant trickle of summery fruits.</li>
            <li> It is just not a very strong scent</li>
            <li> I have collected all the Britney fantasy perfumes, faves include Hidden and Midnight fantasy.</li>
            <li> It is a Britney&#x27;s perfume, so I couldn&#x27;t expect less that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll mainly stick to wearing it on casual days, but you could get away with wearing it to work if you wanted to.</li>
            <li> I tried it again and got a little citrus and florals, too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is a coincidence, but my arm felt a little itchy after I wore this.  </li>
            <li> but I am not a huge fan,</li>
            <li> The description saying it is for hair and describing it as such is totally false....</li>
            <li> I also tried a small bottle I bought at another store.  </li>
            <li> Smells like a weak pineapple juice.</li>
            <li> But this one does not, if anything it gets progressively worse because the alcohol smell comes out as it ages and it just keeps going downhill from there.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I would not recommend it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> bad</li>

            <li> Better smell than most of my other perfumes.  And I have way over 30 bottles of perfume.  Will define buy this again and again!!!!</li>
            <li> Island Fantasy is a sparkling happy perfume that smells like pure honey sunshine, I love it! My favorite parfums are fruity and tropical scents and if you like this type, you will not be disappointed with Britney&#x27;s newest fragrance in the Fantasy collection. It isn&#x27;t your typical tropic scent of coconut or so; it&#x27;s rather a berry and light island flower type of scent. It&#x27;s very unique. Another total plus is the bottle, it is absolutely stunning with a lovely lime green fading into a tropic malibu blue and accented with sparkling crystals. It looks so beautiful sitting out just ready to be sprayed. If you try it, Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Queen Britney&#x27;s perfumes are so amazing! The only one I haven&#x27;t really liked is Circus Fantasy, but I looooooooooove this one so much! Amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells good but not as good as regular fantasy.</li>
            <li> I have collected all the Britney fantasy perfumes, faves include Hidden and Midnight fantasy. I was super excited when I saw that island fantasy was available, although not as readily as the others and I can see why. The first thing that struck me when I smelled it was the citrus smell, which fades slightly to a nice floral scent. Overall, the scent is nice and definitely for the hot summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this perfume doesn&#x27;t last long at all, I&#x27;d say 15 best minutes, and the reason why is because it is an Eau de Toilette. I didn&#x27;t know this when I bought it because I thought that all Britney perfumes were eau de parfum, which is probably the reason why they age exceptionally well and stay a longer while and just get better and better. But this one does not, if anything it gets progressively worse because the alcohol smell comes out as it ages and it just keeps going downhill from there. I am giving it 3 stars because I am being generous. 2 for the would be scent and the 3rd star for the beautiful bottle which really does remind one of a beautiful tropical island. Unfortunately I would not recommend it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I do hope they attempt to revise this perfume, it really could be a wonderful gem. Perhaps incorporate a smidgen of coconut and make it eau de parfum.)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!! it came sealed and new like it was advertised!!  I love it</li>
            <li> So I actually bought this perfume because the reviews on it were really good. I&#x27;ve always liked Britney Spears perfume and I&#x27;ve never seen this particular one in the store. The price wasn&#x27;t bad so I bought it and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s smells like summer in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Island Fantasy is one of the best Britney perfumes. It&#x27;s one of my favorites. It makes you think of a fruity, girly drink or something relaxing. I love it.</li>
            <li> The mandarin is the strongest fruit note on me and, and coupled with the raspberry, gives the fragrance a soft, fuzzy feel. The lemon gives the quieter fruit a bit of bite and energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floral notes used in ISLAND FANTASY remain watery and in the background. There is a breeze of orange blossom, freesia and occasional hint of violet underneath it all, but none of the floral notes are truly strong enough to stand out from the fruits for long. This is definitely a fruity perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant trickle of summery fruits. I&#x27;m sure there is some sandalwood here, as after a few hours ISLAND FANTASY begins to remind me of J.Lo Love &amp; Glamour, which uses bucket loads of it. I also detect a coconut scent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official Scent notes: citruses, mandarin, clementine, red berries, jasmine, violet, freesia, musk and sugar cane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: ISLAND FANTASY is pleasant and easy to wear. I&#x27;ll mainly stick to wearing it on casual days, but you could get away with wearing it to work if you wanted to. ISLAND FANTASY does go close to the skin fairly quickly, but a faint woody scent is still detectable five hours later. So yeah; this is quieter and doesn&#x27;t wear as long as the rest of the Fantasy line, so beware of that</li>
            <li> I love this smell out of all her other fantasy scents but it is toilette so it&#x27;s not that long lasting or strong,</li>
            <li> The description for the product did not match what the advertised product was to be sold as. This perfume was described as an oil treatment for hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence with this perfume. The scent is nice... It reminds me of the tropics, and is not over-powering at all. It&#x27;s definitely light and summery but for this reason, I&#x27;m not sure if I like it. I usually like my perfumes a bit stronger, and this is definitely not strong, but I&#x27;m not disappointed. It lasts exceptionally long, which I DO like, so I think I may be getting more use out of this perfume than previously thought. If you like light, fruity, summer scents... I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love the scent! On my skin-watermelon and musk. Might just be my new &#x27;go to&#x27; fragrance (prior one was new formulation Ambush). Reduced rating from 5 to 4 due to how long fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li> This is one of britney&#x27;s best perfumes. It is so fresh and the bottle is huge! You will really enjoy this if you like fresh light scents rather then very sugary sweet scents. To me it smells like watery greens with a tiny bit of sweet.</li>
            <li> My mom sent this too me as an early christmas gift. Its amazing. Honestly its so much fresher than the original scent but at the same time similar. I love it.</li>
            <li> I loveeeee fantasy perfumes so I figured I would love this one as well. I personally like my perfumes a little stronger smelling and to me this perfume smells like a hollister type perfume. Just a little too light for me. My mom thinks it smells good but I prefer midnight fantasy and the original fantasy smell over this one.</li>
            <li> I am loving this perfume</li>
            <li> I blind bought this because I&#x27;m a fan of Britney spears fantasy line and had read all the good reviews for this, and all I can say is wow.  This fragrance is so juicy and fruity and fresh and light, I literally pictured myself on a tropical beach with a warm salty breeze coming off the crystal clear blue water onto the white sand with tall Palm trees everywhere and a clear blue sky....this fragrance is amazing!  its juicy fruity sweet and so light!  And the bottle it comes in is absolutely gorgeous!  I would highly recommend this and it would also make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would go for &amp;#34;Artiste&amp;#34; scents, but the clean lines of this product by Britney Spears is an amazing perfume and really lasts</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! One of my favorites from Brittney. Very summer-ry :) great price too</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, a new favorite, it smells so tropical, but light not heavy like some of her other perfumes!</li>
            <li> Island Fantasy smells like mouthwatering citrus with a nice dose of violet and sugar on top (all of my favorites!). Definitely delicious smelling if you enjoy tropical scents.  I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s an EDT and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other Fantasy perfumes, but it does last longer than Escada&#x27;s Rockin Rio for me so I would still recommend this.</li>
            <li> I wish I bought what I knew I liked....the scent does not last long nor does it make me feel sexy.  It&#x27;s just blah</li>
            <li> Soft delicate fragrance in a very pretty green bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Of course!! It is a Britney&#x27;s perfume, so I couldn&#x27;t expect less that this perfect and delicious perfume. I recomend it for Britney&#x27;s fans like me Lol!! It is worth it to get it. If you haven&#x27;t gotten any Britney&#x27;s perfume before, you should try this one. It goes perfectly for summer days. I love the bottle!! I got perfect on time and with a super nice wrap.</li>
            <li> I love Britney Spears, and I love her perfumes! I love the scent of Island Fantasy because it reminds me of being back home on the beach. It is light, a little fruity, and a little citrusy. I love the box, and the bottle is just so beautiful! I will upload my own personal photo of my bottle I own. &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I read the notes of what scents are in this Bottle....so I was like...ok sounds good....well..........&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell like ANY citrus, berry or fruity smell of ANY kind that was stated were in there (as well as the other notes).&lt;br /&gt;Smells like strong flowers with musk and a hint of vanilla....any&lt;br /&gt;Fruity smell it states it has, is NOT there...prolly lost in the&lt;br /&gt;Intense scent of flowers, and musk.&lt;br /&gt;I have ALL of her perfumes (minus that circus one..smells like a hamster cage)!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first one I was like &amp;#34;wow, that smells nothing like what it says&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Her other ones have always stayed true to their notes.</li>
            <li> I keep sampling different brands of Britney Spears&#x27; perfumes and every time they just keep getting better!  Reminds me of Spring and Summer!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, wears off too fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into this scent really, it smells like the original fantasy with a after scent of like lemon-y, citrus-y. I put it in the breakroom at my work for other girls to wear but I am not a huge fan, its just ok.</li>
            <li> This is ok. Not very strong or lasting at all. Smells like a weak pineapple juice.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes at a great price!! Arrived very quickly!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  it is nice light smelling that stays with you the whole day. The smell is hypnotic that takes me to another place. Love it to death</li>
            <li> This scent is outstanding!! Can&#x27;t get enough of it. I went through a bottle so quickly - couldn&#x27;t stop using it. oops :)</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon, then realized the description is for some sort of hair care product, but you do actually get the perfume not the hair care product. I love the smell it is one of my favorite Fantasy perfumes. It has a orange floral scent with a touch of lemon citrus to it. It does not last as long as the other Fantasy perfumes though, but then some of those can seem to be a bit overbearing.</li>
            <li> Island fantasy is the only fantasy that smells diffrent from the original its sweet with notes of citrus and passion fruit with a creamy finish perfect for everyday or evening its a summer scent for sure ! Best thing is its not a repackaged version of fantasy</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this fragance. Clearly I was expecting all the sweet-fruity scents I read online however this fragance is more citrusy than anything else. I has more of a orangy tanginess to it. Could not get the sweet notes, watermelon, or other things previously described. Do not get me wrong, it is a nice scent, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was described as a tropical scent. I don&#x27;t pick up all the hints of vanilla, musk, raspberry, etc. that other users are talking about, it pretty much smells like watermelon with a slight floral undertone to me. It smells nice for 5 minutes after you spray it, but then starts to fade. I sprayed a good amount on a shirt that I wasn&#x27;t wearing to see how long it would last (keeping it away from myself to eliminate the olfactory fatigue factor) and went back in 10 minutes. I couldn&#x27;t smell it without putting it right up to my face. I will enjoy this bottle while it lasts but with the frequency I am using it that may be a month or less. I will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with it!! It&#x27;s the perfect smell of beachy wonderfulness!! Been my favorite since I&#x27;ve got it!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells, but only have it three stars because it wears off very quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t stick around like the original Fantasy even though I thoroughly douse myself in it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  Always get compliments</li>
            <li> Beautiful Bottle &amp; Fragrance</li>
            <li> This perfume smells very good. I am always impressed with Britney Spears perfumes and this one is no exception. The price was really great to and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the bottle came super fast and i couldnt be happier!</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago but just got around to opening it.  Saved it for summer.  New box, but the bottle itself was loose around the neck and looked like it wasn&#x27;t full.  However nothing spilled in the box.  I sprayed it on and got a blast of strong perfumey fruit.  I didn&#x27;t like it.  After it calmed down, all I could smell was watermelon and an odd scent in the background.  Watermelon is the predominant note I get from this.  I tried it again and got a little citrus and florals, too.  If it had more vanilla it would be better.  It needs something to soften it.  As I wear it, the watermelon keeps coming out.  I also tried a small bottle I bought at another store.  Basically the same scent, but for some reason I smelled less watermelon in that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a summer scent, and it could be nicer but something about it doesn&#x27;t really work with my chemistry.  It is an EDT which isn&#x27;t supposed to be as strong as EDP.  But this is pretty strong.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as original Fantasy, but while it is there, it is strong.  I don&#x27;t know if it is a coincidence, but my arm felt a little itchy after I wore this.  I didn&#x27;t see a rash, just an itchy feeling at times.  Never had that with any of the Fantasy perfumes, and I have them all except for the two newest ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.  The bottle is very pretty and looks nice with the rest of my Fantasy collection.  That&#x27;s the best part of it.</li>
            <li> I love this version of Fantasy . The Bottle is absolutely beautiful! I love the scent...compared to the other installments of Fantasy by Britney Spears. This one offers a very light  calm scent. Has a very breezy kind of melon scent to it. People say the scent goes away to fast , That however is not the case. It is just not a very strong scent it is more subtle then the others. Which I very much like!</li>
            <li> This is not a hair product...It is a perfume....The description saying it is for hair and describing it as such is totally false....Just FYI...In no way is this a detangling product for hair. You could spray it in your hair as one way to wear the perfume, but it is not a leave-in conditioning product in any way.</li>
