            <li>I would recommend these kind of hair ties to all of my friends.</li>
            <li>which kind of defeats the purpose of &amp;#34;no crease hair ties&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They stretch out very easily.</li>
            <li>I love these kind of hair ties.</li>
            <li>These work great and are gentle on your hair!</li>

            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>I love these hair ties.  </li>
            <li>The downside is, you have to keep in mind where the knot is when you&#x27;re styling so it looks better.</li>
            <li>My favorite go to hair ties.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Will definitly be ordering more after I lose all the ones I have now</li>
            <li>These ties are cute but leave creases just like the discount store hair elastics I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>They virtually disappear, which means they are not a distraction when used in creative ways.  </li>
            <li>themselves are okay.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick with scrunchies:)</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>I have kind of largish wrists and they fit so comfortably around my wrist.</li>
            <li>love love these hair ties.....does not break hair and perfect black color for my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I need my hair held more securely.</li>
            <li>Still, these are nice quality and worth the price.  </li>
            <li>So I was very happy to find a set of black ones on Amazon.</li>
            <li>, I see a crease, so claiming that it leaves no crease isn&#x27;t really accurate.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so light that they fall off without me</li>
            <li>It is best to make the loop a bit uneven</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product; will definitely purchase more when I lose them all or hand them off to others to try.</li>
            <li>such fast shipping and great product!!</li>
            <li>These hair ties are great and have lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li>The hair ties themselves are cute, nice material, and holds hair well overall.</li>
            <li>think if my hair was pressed or I was only trying to tie up a portion of my hair, these would be good.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even look cool.  </li>
            <li>One of the Hair Ties popped pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Mine have already stretched out and don&#x27;t hold a good form at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and really flexible.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic &amp; they really don&#x27;t make a dent in your hair.</li>
            <li>Good product, quality as expected.</li>
            <li>Came quick and are exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>It can be tough to find these ties in a store, so going though Amazon is ideal.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more of these.</li>
            <li>I have first seen them at YogaTree in San Francisco, but they were pricey.</li>
            <li>They fall right out of my hair and aren&#x27;t elastic enough to twist around to a snug fit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for good long lasting ponytails.</li>
            <li>The picture of the ties is so large that I thought these were going to be the size of the Ouchless &amp;#34;headbands&amp;#34;, not the ponytail bands.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;ll be fine for folks with thinner, more delicate strands of hair - thus it&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;No Crease&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Every tie was much shorter than the ones I bought before and don&#x27;t fit my hair properly.</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t leave dents or creases in my hair.</li>
            <li>these are the only hair bands that i use now, they work amazing with my straight hair, they are the only hair ties i trust with my straight hair</li>
            <li>shipping is fast, and got coupon code.</li>
            <li>These wider ones are much gentler.</li>
            <li>I really like them a lot.</li>
            <li>Very slippery, don&#x27;t stay well.</li>
            <li>I have only used these in low ponytails and they do look nice like a bracelet.</li>
            <li>These specific ones work better than regular hair ties, but, STILL brake your hair.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>a high ponytail doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>Overall, I will still use these because they are better than regular hair ties, they feel soft in your hair, and do not pull your hair.</li>
            <li>I think the colored ones are very tacky (except for small girls on whom they&#x27;re cute).  </li>
            <li>However, this most recent batch is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>These bands are nowhere near large enough to pull that off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough on my curls</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the no creasing capabilities of these ribbon ties since I have 4a/4b natural hair.</li>
            <li>but I truly don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between these and the regular hair ties.</li>
            <li>These hair ties can only really be used singly, on a ponytail, which limits them very much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the product description halfway down the page before purchasing - only the descriptors at the top next to the product pictures.  </li>
            <li>But they are still better then the goody ouch-less brand that always seemed to stretch after a few uses and when use them that stretched out</li>
            <li>These will last and you won&#x27;t have to buy new ones over and over again.</li>
            <li>I much prefer these ties to regular elastics when I am doing any sort of updo that begins with a ponytail holder, but ESPECIALLY flip-through (topsy turvy) styles, like the Gibson Tuck, or its variations.  </li>
            <li>more or less what i expected for the low price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very enamored with the small clear rubber bands used on braids.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they do stretch out over time like other reviewers say, but so do normal hair ties.  </li>
            <li>I use the other ones in low ponytails and high ponytails.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, thin, somewhat fine but processed hair.</li>

            <li> more or less what i expected for the low price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very enamored with the small clear rubber bands used on braids.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they do stretch out over time like other reviewers say, but so do normal hair ties.  </li>
            <li> I use the other ones in low ponytails and high ponytails.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thin, somewhat fine but processed hair.</li>
            <li> Hair ties will last a long time unless you lose one, so ten is plenty.  </li>
            <li> They stretched out after one use, so I got five uses total.  </li>
            <li> By the second day, it&#x27;s stretched out a bit</li>
            <li> ) the tie is kinda spent and when I put it on my wrist after work, it is missing by the time I get ready for bed, looking for it to hold back my hair to was my face.  </li>
            <li> They were busy stretching and sliding down.</li>
            <li> I hope these are very long lasting.</li>
            <li> They do get stretched out, but I&#x27;m still using the same two stretched out ones that I started using the day that these arrived in the mail, so they seem to last a long time in spite of being stretched out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, it&#x27;s not super tight or pulls out any of my hair which is a plus and very reassuring.</li>
            <li> We can put a man on the moon but are apparently unable to make hair ties that work and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> With a normal hair tie, there is usually a lot of hair stuck to the tie when I take it out.  </li>
            <li> The bands feel thick and sturdy enough to secure hair without snapping, and I had to do some serious picking to undo the knot</li>
            <li> The other eight in the pack are brand-new and untouched, so this pack should last a while.</li>
            <li> It could barely hold my ponytail up, I&#x27;m not sure &amp;#34;No Crease&amp;#34; actually happened or not.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a hair and when my hair is loose I like to wear it in a fro with the hair</li>
            <li> For some reason I can never find a set of all black ones in stores; only multi-colored packs.</li>
            <li> They leave a crease if I put them into wet hair ofcourse, but no crease if used on dry hair.</li>
            <li> These are unlike other hair ties that get all stretched out and break your hair off.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get any of that plastic, rubbery (almost glue-like) residue in your like the other hair ties when they get all stretched out.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use them, they&#x27;re just not as tight as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stretch very well and have a big uncomfortable knot.  </li>
            <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave lasting creases in my hair, but just like the Goody Ouchless hair ties, these are too small initially to loop 4 times for a tight hold, so</li>
            <li> I got these other ones I have reviewed them as well</li>
            <li> When I use these, I usually don&#x27;t lose any hairs, but if I do, it&#x27;s only one or two.</li>
            <li> My set of ties are all a shiny black - no choice for any other color.</li>
            <li> They still crease my hair ever so slightly, but I like how they don&#x27;t snag or pull my hair.</li>
            <li> Still, they are a nice change from boring black rubber bands.  </li>
            <li> These hair ties do not fit as tightly on my ponytail as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair on my head, and these were yet another dissapointing product which couldn&#x27;t deal with heavy mass of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I work everyday with my hair up, running around after kids.</li>
            <li> I usually have to tie  it 3 times to leave comfortably tight.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold hair tightly, but have yet to get stuck in my hair!</li>
            <li> Just know that this won&#x27;t keep a very tight ponytail.</li>
            <li> These little ties elevate a pony tail into a hair style without trying too hard.</li>
            <li> They started to stretch out and the thick band parts started to get creases and folds after few uses.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> it will be too loose and I will have to constantly keep doing it and is just gets annoying.</li>
            <li> Does not crease hair or leave that annoying bump like other hair ties do when you let down your hair.</li>

            <li> Great hair ties!! Definitely the only hair tie I use now since I&#x27;m a curly girl. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, it&#x27;s not super tight or pulls out any of my hair which is a plus and very reassuring. It&#x27;s gentle enough on my curls AND it does a great job of holding all this hair in place. No longer are the days of me having to double up on hair ties. It&#x27;s a really good product; will definitely purchase more when I lose them all or hand them off to others to try.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t leave dents or creases in my hair. I have wavy, thin, somewhat fine but processed hair. And I love them. They also don&#x27;t hurt when wearing on my wrist like some hair ties do.</li>
            <li> These are smaller than the hair ties I&#x27;m used to. Too lose if I do loops twice for my pony tail, too tight if three loops. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for good long lasting ponytails. I got these other ones I have reviewed them as well but they seem to stretch out and can fall off my wrist now, but I can still use them. But they are still better then the goody ouch-less brand that always seemed to stretch after a few uses and when use them that stretched out it doesn&#x27;t hold well or they break. I use the other ones in low ponytails and high ponytails. I have only used these in low ponytails and they do look nice like a bracelet. I hope these are very long lasting. I would buy these again!</li>
            <li> Love them.  I&#x27;ve reordered these cuz after a year they do stretch out - but then again my hair is very thick.  My roommate stole one from me and it holds her hair up well.  Her hair is thin</li>
            <li> I love these hair ties.  Yes, they do stretch out over time like other reviewers say, but so do normal hair ties.  With a normal hair tie, there is usually a lot of hair stuck to the tie when I take it out.  But not with these.  And, like their description, they don&#x27;t leave a crease in your hair after staying tied up for hours.</li>
            <li> I love these hair ties! It doesn&#x27;t snap, pull, or rip your hair out. It&#x27;s smooth and really flexible. You can even adjust it to your liking, you just untie the knot and make the opening wider or smaller depending on your hair thickness and then re-tie the knot. These are unlike other hair ties that get all stretched out and break your hair off. You don&#x27;t get any of that plastic, rubbery (almost glue-like) residue in your like the other hair ties when they get all stretched out. These will last and you won&#x27;t have to buy new ones over and over again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand these ties.  They don&#x27;t stretch very well and have a big uncomfortable knot.  Sigh...We can put a man on the moon but are apparently unable to make hair ties that work and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good hair ties. Just know that this won&#x27;t keep a very tight ponytail. Does not crease hair or leave that annoying bump like other hair ties do when you let down your hair.</li>
            <li> these are the only hair bands that i use now, they work amazing with my straight hair, they are the only hair ties i trust with my straight hair, i use one all day with no crease. shipping is fast, and got coupon code. would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I did not get 10 as listed, only five.  They stretched out after one use, so I got five uses total.  Spend your money somewhere else.</li>
            <li> The thin hair ties that I used to use were causing my hair to break. These wider ones are much gentler. I really like them a lot. For some reason I can never find a set of all black ones in stores; only multi-colored packs. So I was very happy to find a set of black ones on Amazon. They do get stretched out, but I&#x27;m still using the same two stretched out ones that I started using the day that these arrived in the mail, so they seem to last a long time in spite of being stretched out. The other eight in the pack are brand-new and untouched, so this pack should last a while. I will definitely order more of these.</li>
            <li> These ties are so great for hair. You don&#x27;t have to hurt anymore when you put these ties in your hair.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic &amp; they really don&#x27;t make a dent in your hair. I have kind of largish wrists and they fit so comfortably around my wrist. I would recommend these kind of hair ties to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> These hair ties leaves no creases in your hair.  No problems with elastic stretching and the hair ties don&#x27;t unravel.  Hair ties will last a long time unless you lose one, so ten is plenty.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I much prefer these ties to regular elastics when I am doing any sort of updo that begins with a ponytail holder, but ESPECIALLY flip-through (topsy turvy) styles, like the Gibson Tuck, or its variations.  When I use a regular fabric-covered elastic band, I lose about 20 hairs taking the elastic out.  When I use these, I usually don&#x27;t lose any hairs, but if I do, it&#x27;s only one or two.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the no creasing capabilities of these ribbon ties since I have 4a/4b natural hair. I bought this to reduce hair being caught in my elastics. Even the non-metal one&#x27;s with the glue adhesive would pull my hair out. I don&#x27;t have a problem with these at all. The downside is, you have to keep in mind where the knot is when you&#x27;re styling so it looks better.</li>
            <li> My favorite go to hair ties. They don&#x27;t damage or leave creases in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very slippery, don&#x27;t stay well. They fall right out of my hair and aren&#x27;t elastic enough to twist around to a snug fit.  I wish I could return them</li>
            <li> Came quick and are exactly what I want. I love these kind of hair ties. Also got a coupon for future ordering!</li>
            <li> everyone talks about how these type of hair ties are the best...but I truly don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between these and the regular hair ties.</li>
            <li> Love these. I have first seen them at YogaTree in San Francisco, but they were pricey. This 10 pack is a great price and quality.</li>
            <li> These work great and are gentle on your hair!</li>
            <li> They started to stretch out and the thick band parts started to get creases and folds after few uses. I have a lot of hair on my head, and these were yet another dissapointing product which couldn&#x27;t deal with heavy mass of my hair. I think it&#x27;ll be fine for folks with thinner, more delicate strands of hair - thus it&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;No Crease&amp;#34;. It could barely hold my ponytail up, I&#x27;m not sure &amp;#34;No Crease&amp;#34; actually happened or not. They were busy stretching and sliding down.</li>
            <li> these are awesome for my hair. Happy that I bought them. will by them in colors next time.</li>
            <li> Great! Especially for the price! Will definitly be ordering more after I lose all the ones I have now lol</li>
            <li> love love these hair ties.....does not break hair and perfect black color for my hair.  when inserted it looks like my hair.</li>
            <li> My set of ties are all a shiny black - no choice for any other color. Not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave lasting creases in my hair, but just like the Goody Ouchless hair ties, these are too small initially to loop 4 times for a tight hold, so a high ponytail doesn&#x27;t stay. By the second day, it&#x27;s stretched out a bit and I can loop it 4 times, but by then (definitely by the third day) the tie is kinda spent and when I put it on my wrist after work, it is missing by the time I get ready for bed, looking for it to hold back my hair to was my face.  They&#x27;re so light that they fall off without me noticing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big benefit of these are they don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re pulling out my hair and I don&#x27;t have an aching headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will still use these, as well as the Goody Ouchless ones.</li>
            <li> They work well! Everything you&#x27;d expect from a hair tie! They work well on your wrist for up-do emergencies. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> These ties are cute but leave creases just like the discount store hair elastics I have used for years.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair tie for my very fine hair.  They do not slip off, nor do they catch on my hair.  The colors are great.</li>
            <li> Great! Just as shown and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> such fast shipping and great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these before and loved them.  However, this most recent batch is not what I expected.  Every tie was much shorter than the ones I bought before and don&#x27;t fit my hair properly.</li>
            <li> I went to visit my sister in FL and she had one of these, I tried them and fell in love with them! I decided to buy them, so gave these ones a try. These specific ones work better than regular hair ties, but, STILL brake your hair. I cannot do a ponytail by going twice around it..it will be too loose and I will have to constantly keep doing it and is just gets annoying. I usually have to tie  it 3 times to leave comfortably tight. When I do this, and I leave it for a couple hours and take it off, I see a crease, so claiming that it leaves no crease isn&#x27;t really accurate. Maybe my sister has these types of hair ties, but different brand. I am going to ask her where she bought hers. I remember hers did not leave a crease in my hair. Overall, I will still use these because they are better than regular hair ties, they feel soft in your hair, and do not pull your hair.</li>
            <li> These hair ties do not fit as tightly on my ponytail as I&#x27;d hoped.  I like the look of them and find them quite chic but I need my hair held more securely. Two revolutions are not enough and there&#x27;s not room enough to do it three times.  Still, they are a nice change from boring black rubber bands.  I think the colored ones are very tacky (except for small girls on whom they&#x27;re cute).  I&#x27;m very enamored with the small clear rubber bands used on braids.  They virtually disappear, which means they are not a distraction when used in creative ways.  These hair ties can only really be used singly, on a ponytail, which limits them very much. Still, these are nice quality and worth the price.  I will definitely use them, they&#x27;re just not as tight as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I work everyday with my hair up, running around after kids. After work I like to take my hair out without needing to shower all over again because of all the crazy creases and stuff. The hair ties themselves are cute, nice material, and holds hair well overall. BUT, there are always creases when I take my hair out...which kind of defeats the purpose of &amp;#34;no crease hair ties&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Teen daughter loves...</li>
            <li> Great price when you consider these as a disposable product. They stretch out very easily.</li>
            <li> When I cut open the packaging, two of the hair ties were cut as well and i had to throw them out immediately!&lt;br /&gt;the hair ties themselves are okay. they don&#x27;t crease the hair, as promised, but they stretch out quite a bit over time.&lt;br /&gt;they do the job, but aren&#x27;t exceptional. more or less what i expected for the low price.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday! They still crease my hair ever so slightly, but I like how they don&#x27;t snag or pull my hair.</li>
            <li> Good product, quality as expected.</li>
            <li> i only got 3 hair ties and got them 3 days ago</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold hair tightly, but have yet to get stuck in my hair! Breakage has been greatly minimized, which is wonderful. They leave a crease if I put them into wet hair ofcourse, but no crease if used on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like they keep me from popping my hair out, but at the same time, they are way overpriced.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the product description halfway down the page before purchasing - only the descriptors at the top next to the product pictures.  So that was my bad, not a reflection on the owner&#x27;s advertising.  BUT in an effort to prevent someone else from making the same oversight, wanted to post a review to mention:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the measurements in the product description before purchasing.  The picture of the ties is so large that I thought these were going to be the size of the Ouchless &amp;#34;headbands&amp;#34;, not the ponytail bands.  I have 3c/4a hair and when my hair is loose I like to wear it in a fro with the hair pulled back to maybe the start of my crown.  These bands are nowhere near large enough to pull that off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if my hair was pressed or I was only trying to tie up a portion of my hair, these would be good.  The bands feel thick and sturdy enough to secure hair without snapping, and I had to do some serious picking to undo the knot the ends are tied into, which means they&#x27;re unlikely to unravel when under elastic stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll kkep these so that if I ever decide to press my hair or do ponytails, I have plenty of low hair stress bands.</li>
            <li> It can be tough to find these ties in a store, so going though Amazon is ideal. These little ties elevate a pony tail into a hair style without trying too hard. It is best to make the loop a bit uneven so it looks casual and a bit unfinished. Keeps it from being too cutesy. These ties are a nice quality that tie easily and stay put. Good purchase. I&#x27;m going to circle back and purchase some in different colors.</li>
            <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get these things?  What&#x27;s all the fuss?  They don&#x27;t even look cool.  Mine have already stretched out and don&#x27;t hold a good form at all.  I think I&#x27;ll stick with scrunchies:)</li>
            <li> These hair ties are great and have lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> I received my item on time. They came as pictured. LOVE them! SO much better for my hair!</li>
            <li> Came on time as advertised. They work great.</li>
            <li> It was okay. One of the Hair Ties popped pretty easily.</li>
