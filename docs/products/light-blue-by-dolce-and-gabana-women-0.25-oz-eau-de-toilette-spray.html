            <li>Fully satisfied with purchase!</li>
            <li>Really wanted to try this fragrance to see if I liked it and this has been the perfect trial size.</li>
            <li>When I recieved this it smelled so similiar to dove&#x27;s refreshing body mist, the lemongrass kind.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance was originally a gift from my brother who loved it every time a coworker passed his office.</li>

            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell than and love it more now.  </li>
            <li>I love thew pricew as well.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Too many products are overwhelming for my taste and this is not.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to use every day throughout the entire year.</li>
            <li>But I do purchase body sprays for refreshing during the day.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance however,  has clean refreshing scent that seems to lasts most of the day- not all.</li>
            <li>This is a daytime scent, and it&#x27;s pretty popular in that people recognize it when i wear it.</li>
            <li>I wish it stayed on longer and its the perfect size for my little purse.</li>
            <li>I thought the value was excellent and the description was clear and concise..  </li>
            <li>Smells like a cheap alcohol based spray.</li>
            <li>bottle size is handy, but defiently not the real thing.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much I bought it for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it.</li>
            <li>It is light, a touch of citrus and feminine without being &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I dont buy cheap perfume or knockoffs of any sort.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved it, shopped around all the department stores and could not find it anywhere near the price I paid for on here.</li>
            <li>Cool little bottle that would fit great in her purse.</li>
            <li>Love the size, means I didn&#x27;t have to commit completely.</li>
            <li>But its the real thinggggg!</li>
            <li>I first smelled this fragrance on one of my daughters.</li>
            <li>Lovvve light blue!</li>
            <li>I had a few friends that tried this and liked it</li>
            <li>This particular product is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>A little smaller than I tought it would be, but all in all it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also bigger than I expected &amp; fits nicely in my purse.  </li>
            <li>even though it appeared authentic, the nozzle clogged within a week, it was disappointing, as a light blue wearer for many years</li>
            <li>Did not appear new.  </li>
            <li>Favorite perfume I&#x27;ve changed to other scents but always come back to this one,.</li>
            <li>So far, no leakage.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>;  The first spray or two had a slight alcohol scent, but I didn&#x27;t shake the bottle before using.  </li>

            <li> This fragrance is one I&#x27;ve become addicted to!</li>

            <li> even though it appeared authentic, the nozzle clogged within a week, it was disappointing, as a light blue wearer for many years I was excited to receive it, sad when it clogged and I had to attempt to take the nozzle off to use the contents which was still 3/4left</li>
            <li> Great! item as described!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to carry in your purse. This is a must have for me. Favorite perfume I&#x27;ve changed to other scents but always come back to this one,. Great service,. Very Pleasant and nice sellers.</li>
            <li> Smells like a cheap alcohol based spray. bottle size is handy, but defiently not the real thing. Spend the extra $$ and buy it ay Macy&#x27;s!!!</li>
            <li> The company I work with has a scent similar to this, but it&#x27;s not available in personal care products.  Someone recommended this scent as a substitute, so I stopped in at the local Ulta.  I loved it, so of course, I ordered it from Amazon.  The box was sealed in plastic wrap (as I would expect from a department store), and the box is labeled &amp;#34;made in Germany.&amp;#34;  The first spray or two had a slight alcohol scent, but I didn&#x27;t shake the bottle before using.  Since then, it&#x27;s been perfect; although it does have more of a hint of citrus than I remember.  The bottle is also bigger than I expected &amp; fits nicely in my purse.  At the end of the day, this is a nice scent at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I buy it alot. I even get it for my family members. They love it to</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be a knock off because a lot of reviews for perfume on Amazon are bad. But its the real thinggggg! I didn&#x27;t know they had this cute travel size. Its a good price and a good amount. Lovvve light blue! Will def buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This particular product is the real thing.  It is not only obvious by smell but also by the package (the fuzzy blue box).  I know it is pricey but this little bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much I bought it for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it. Stuff is spendy though for such a small quantity. but she&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I wish it stayed on longer and its the perfect size for my little purse. Will def buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the size, means I didn&#x27;t have to commit completely. This is a daytime scent, and it&#x27;s pretty popular in that people recognize it when i wear it.</li>
            <li> Loved the size.  Perfect for purse and travel.  Really wanted to try this fragrance to see if I liked it and this has been the perfect trial size. Would recommend buying this from Amazon since it was affordable and delivered promptly</li>
            <li> The pefume smells great and the size is perfect to carry in a wristlet or small clutch. I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The packaging was terrible.  It was delivered without the blue box and was fastened around the cap.  Did not appear new.  Definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this fragrance on one of my daughters. I love the smell than and love it more now.  I love thew pricew as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter was delighted.  I thought the value was excellent and the description was clear and concise..  Arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> She loved it...she wanted a small perfume to carry in her purse...she uses it everyday and needs a refresher daily</li>
            <li> I like this product as it is small enough to carry in my bag at all times. On the days I run out and forget to put it on, I will now have some in my purse for those days,</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. It is light, a touch of citrus and feminine without being &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;. Too many products are overwhelming for my taste and this is not.</li>
            <li> This fragrance was originally a gift from my brother who loved it every time a coworker passed his office. It is a very beautiful and clean scent. It is wonderful to use every day throughout the entire year.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer this Christmas for my girlfriend. The item arrived promptly, and was as described by the seller. Cool little bottle that would fit great in her purse. A little smaller than I tought it would be, but all in all it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Arrived in plenty of time for Christmas. This fragrance is one I&#x27;ve become addicted to! So when I saw this little purse-sized product, I had to order it.</li>
            <li> A light, fresh, beautiful scent in a travel size. Just what I ordered. So far, no leakage. Fully satisfied with purchase!</li>
            <li> I had a few friends that tried this and liked it and I wanted to try it myself. Very light scent that works well with me.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it, shopped around all the department stores and could not find it anywhere near the price I paid for on here.</li>
            <li> great stocking stuffers!  Great prices for the product purchased.  I would recommend this product to friends and family.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this bc pep were saying &amp;#34;it smells sooo good!&amp;#34; LOL.  When I recieved this it smelled so similiar to dove&#x27;s refreshing body mist, the lemongrass kind.  I was surprised. I know this has been out way longer than the dove body mist. Im not saying that they copied it or anything, Im saying that there is a $3.80 version at Walmart.  Im serious.  I dont buy cheap perfume or knockoffs of any sort.  But I do purchase body sprays for refreshing during the day.  Dont believe me? Find the Dove body spray in lemongrass and see for yourself.  This fragrance however,  has clean refreshing scent that seems to lasts most of the day- not all.</li>
