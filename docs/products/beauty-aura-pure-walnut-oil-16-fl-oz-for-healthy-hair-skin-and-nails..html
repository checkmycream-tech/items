    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for hair and body</li>
            <li> This oil is very clear and leaves a great finish on your wooden items. I used it on a wooden spoon so I wanted something that is food safe - and what is better than an oil from something you eat anyway?  It brings out the natural wood grain without dyeing the item. It has no smell (someone else may smell something, but I did not) and doesn&#x27;t turn rancid. I like this a lot!</li>
            <li> I use walnut oil on my hair.  It is great to seal in the moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a great discovery for me. I oil paint and find this is a great medium. No more having to deal with the chemicals I have used in the past. The walnut oil also makes the oil colors I use vibrant and I like that. Makes my work as an artist so much easier.</li>
            <li> The oil was great. Afraid of being ripped off cause i read some of the horror stories of buying oils online but this brand is perfect. the oil is great and just what i wanted! No fake stuff in it, no harmful chemicals or preservatives. Organic and hexane free. Perfect for my  oil cleanse!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil,I use it for massage my skin,or for my hair too.It absorbs quickly and the smell is pleasant,maybe I&#x27;ll try it in some salads:) very good product,recommend !!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the walnut oil to assist with my hair growth and so far I am very pleased with the results.  I am also including it in my salads and love the taste.</li>
            <li> Walnut oil is typically cold pressed and has a pale yellow appearance.  It normally has a light taste and little to no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I have lately been fascinated with different oils from a viewpoint of beauty skin-care and hair enhancement remedies.  The last few weeks, I have been using experimenting with walnut oil solely for both skin, and hair benefits.  Walnut oil has a variety of health advantages, but my review will spotlight on both skin and hair improvements and usages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Skin Care:  As a skin benefit, I use the Walnut Oil on my dry skin, after my shower before toweling dry.  This has worked to keep my naturally dry skin moisturized in the hot summer desert climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Skin Care:  I have received amazing results as a facial skin treatment.  This has been the only oil that I have used daily on my face for the past few weeks, in order to obtain clear and impartial findings. Walnut Oil is a dense product, not as greasy as petroleum, and not as thick as Castor Oil, but it is one of the denser oils.  I used the Walnut Oil after an application of my regular face serum, and in the place of a moisturizer.  Very few drops are needed, and after just a few minutes, it is absorbed into my dry skin.  My facial skin was soft and supple and my make-up foundation glided on smoothly.  The Walnut Oil did NOT leave a shiny residue, and my skin was suitably hydrated which continued throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other regular use of Walnut Oil is in conjunction with derma roll sessions.  I use just a few drops of this pure oil to lubricate my face before my nightly derma rolling.  In the process of derma rolling, my face is stripped of my natural facial oils and my skin becomes dry and irritated.  Therefore, a little pre-lubricant prevents the irritation, which enables me to extend my sessions without the pain.  I also reapply the oil after my nightly serum, and before my evening moisturizer.  I have received positive results, regarding my facial fine lines are noticeably softer, less pronounced, and appear diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Care:&lt;br /&gt;My Hair condition: Dry, coarse textured, thick, and color treated hair, (frizzy hair in both humid and dry climates) about an inch longer than shoulder length, with a small patch of itchy dry psoriasis in the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be honest, this year I have concentrated on the usage of different oils in place of my usual hair conditioners and moisturizers.  I have used Argan, Castor, Olive, Almond, Avocado, and now Walnut Oil as substitute replacements, a trial of one a month.  In this span of 6 months, my once damaged hair is now unbelievably and incredibly healthy.  So over the last month I have not given myself any &#x60;deep conditioning treatments&#x27; or any oil conditioning masques.  Instead, this month I only used the Walnut Oil, in conjunction with my shampoo.  After I pour a sufficient amount of shampoo into the palm of my hand, I splash in a healthy amount of Walnut oil, stir this concoction with my finger, lather up my hair, and end with a brisk scalp massage.  I then leave this mixture on my scalp to condition while I finish my shower and then end with a thorough lukewarm water hair rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this capacity, I have received positively, satisfactory results using Walnut Oil exclusively as a hair conditioning and moisturizing agent in this one-step process while shampooing.  Now, last spring and summer, I had experienced some excessive hair shedding problems, and although my hair grew back completely with the help of the supplement of Biotin, I am very aware of any shredding especially during both a hair wash and blow-drying.  During my hair wash I was conscious of the loss of 5 hairs, combing out with my large space tooth comb another seven, and my roll brush that is used for blow drying, only 4 more.  Therefore, I can attest that the addition of each different oil including the Walnut has definitely helped to stop any hair loss issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results following a shampoo are as follows.  I did not have the slippery clean feeling that had been accustomed to after using a chemical based conditioner.  However, my hair combed out easily and there were not any tangles.  I proceeded to my usual blow-dry and these are my results.  My hair was soft, manageable, and very smooth but it did not have the silky feeling that I received when I used argan oil. There was a nice amount of body, and a &#x60;finished&#x27; look, that included a nice subtle clean shine.  The walnut oil did give my hair the moisture retention that my hair requires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion:  Walnut Oil works remarkably well for me as a skin and facial skin care product and the results as a hair conditioner and moisture retention met my expectations. I am going to continue to investigate using the Walnut mixed with different oils, as I believe they all have some essential skin, hair, and scalp care benefits, and perhaps working in conjunction with each other I will receive even more improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concludes my review on Walnut Oil, however if you wish to read further I have written about some other ways in which Walnut Oil benefits other issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walnut oil contains the high vitamins and proteins, which add benefits to the skin, therefore walnut oil is added into beauty care treatments and products.

            <li> Nice product. I&#x27;ve mixed it with my shampoo (you don&#x27;t need much) and used it on my skin and face. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d consume it; I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other versions. The price is good, too, as I&#x27;ve checked stores and other companies. The bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> This oil is a good choice.I use it for a beauty product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It is easy to use and does not leave a residue when wiped properly. I reconditioned two beautiful cutting boards with this, and also used it on a wooden salad bowl. It is sold as a cosmetic, but seems to work fine for me. It also works to hide scratches on wooden furniture. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have used almond oil along with castor oil to cleanse my face and also to oil my hair in the past. But i never considered using walnut oil for this purpose. When i saw Beauty Aura Walnut oil for skin care i decided to do a little research and this is what i found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walnut Oil Benefits&lt;br /&gt;Although its culinary uses are limited, walnut oil is also popular among people who work in the massage industry. Combined with other aromatic oils, walnut oil is deemed to have certain soothing qualities. The oil is quick-drying, which often tends to leave a person&#x27;s skin feeling less greasy. For skin care, walnut oil is often used for moisturizing and to treat wrinkles, mainly because it is an unsaturated fat. It also helps fight fungal infections, eczema etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading this i bought this product and I am seeing some good results. I use it on my face, neck and hair and the results are great!</li>
            <li> This is light oil. I used it to make my homemade body lotion. The lotion is light and not greasy at all. It feels good but better for summer. I need more nourishing oil for our dry and cold winter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I bought for oil painting as walnut oil in art store is 5x the price and walnut oil is walnut oil.  My wife found it and uses it on her skin and she loves it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it as a body moisturizing and carrier oil with essential oils. It iworks great and very high quality. I will definitely repurchase when I run out. It it a large bottle and a little goes a long way, so it should last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I used it to finish my walnut butcherblock countertop.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I used this product, along with the Beeswax I purchased, to  make Wood Butter.  It worked  out well.</li>
