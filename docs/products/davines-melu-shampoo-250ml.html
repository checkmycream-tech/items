            <li>the smell is wonderful and it makes my hair so manageable!</li>
            <li>best for straighter wavier textures.  </li>
            <li>and I must admit that this is the best product I ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product however, if you are not allergic.</li>
            <li>my salon used this on my hair and it smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for your hair</li>
            <li>Very good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I used it and loved it!</li>
            <li>but honestly wasn&#x27;t hugely impressed with it.</li>
            <li>my Suave for curly hair did a great job</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but if your scalp begins to itch and burn after use, save yourself a trip to the dermatologist and cease use.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Smells soooo good</li>
            <li>and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Good for colored treated hair or split ends.</li>
            <li>An excellent product really works well on my hair makes me feel like a movie star</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Davine&#x27;s products on my hair for over a year now and my hair performs so much better with this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the product was OK.  </li>
            <li>But smell is so important!</li>
            <li>okay....</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I just think i could go with another moisturizing shampoo and safe on cost and then follow up with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t reorder but do like many davines products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I think it smells better then</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo love the smell and how it makes my hair feel would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>But everytime I use the davines set my hair turns out so nice and straight and glossy and smooth (even without blowdrying it!).</li>
            <li>and thats fine.  </li>
            <li>and it is also sulfate free and 2.99</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fine, smells good, but I like my other Davines shampoo better</li>
            <li>The smell is not floral or fruity, but doesn&#x27;t quite hit the mark on clean either.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products that shall straighten and smoothen your hair now and neither of them really did work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and static free which is a huge plus for the winter time and the dry air.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to buy it from your salon first to find out if you are allergic (so you can return your used product).  </li>
            <li>The way this brand works is different than most and it will not work as well, mainly the conditioner, with build up on your hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Always a high quality product!</li>
            <li>worked better on my brazilian virgin weave than on my african american relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has worked really well so far.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>any of the products by far.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair but during the winter I wear it straight which requires the use of a blow dryer and flat iron.</li>
            <li>came full, no variances from what i&#x27;d purchased previously at the salon.</li>
            <li>I have long and naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>My hair has been breaking a lot less and the body and curl has been looking much healthier.</li>

            <li> My hair has been breaking a lot less and the body and curl has been looking much healthier.</li>
            <li> it doesnt last long when you have super thick curly dense hair though.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new hair product and my previous hairdresser used this brand.</li>
            <li> She recommended the Melu products to me because it&#x27;s made for strengthening long hair.</li>
            <li> My stepmother who is a hairstylist gave this to me along with the big conditioner box and a little leave-in-spray</li>
            <li> My hair looks okay, but this product&#x27;s scent is really bad.  </li>
            <li> I would continue to use Davines products, only if there is something that is comparable with a completely different scent - maybe something with a citrus, or at the very least &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really dry and not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> And because of my stepmother being extra carefully with things like silicons, there&#x27;s nothing bad in there!</li>
            <li> Seriously I&#x27;m definately gonna buy this again.</li>
            <li> â€¦ Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> I use this throughout the cold months and even into the spring.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> came full, no variances from what i&#x27;d purchased previously at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Davine&#x27;s products on my hair for over a year now and my hair performs so much better with this product.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist uses Davines products in her salon. She recommended the Melu products to me because it&#x27;s made for strengthening long hair. I have naturally curly hair but during the winter I wear it straight which requires the use of a blow dryer and flat iron. I&#x27;ve been using the Melu shampoo, conditioner, and serum in my hair for almost a month. My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> And the conditioner. I use this throughout the cold months and even into the spring. Makes my hair shiny and static free which is a huge plus for the winter time and the dry air. I would def recommend trying this for yourself!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new hair product and my previous hairdresser used this brand. Smells soooo good but honestly wasn&#x27;t hugely impressed with it. My hair didn&#x27;t look drastically different from using this than it does from using drug store shampoos. Eh.</li>
            <li> It is a great shampoo, and I would buy it again! the smell is wonderful and it makes my hair so manageable!</li>
            <li> Does anyone else think this product smells like a public bathroom.  The smell is not floral or fruity, but doesn&#x27;t quite hit the mark on clean either.  Otherwise the product was OK.  But smell is so important!</li>
            <li> i like it.  it detangles.  it doesnt last long when you have super thick curly dense hair though.  best for straighter wavier textures.  worked better on my brazilian virgin weave than on my african american relaxed hair.  not sudsy and thats fine.  smells okay....i say buy it on sale...  my Suave for curly hair did a great job and it is also sulfate free and 2.99</li>
            <li> An excellent product really works well on my hair makes me feel like a movie starâ€¦ Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fine, smells good, but I like my other Davines shampoo better (naturaltech well-being) because I feel like this one doesn&#x27;t cleanse quite as well for me.</li>
            <li> My stepmother who is a hairstylist gave this to me along with the big conditioner box and a little leave-in-spray and I must admit that this is the best product I ever used. I have long and naturally wavy hair that&#x27;s really dry and not smooth at all. I&#x27;ve tried so many products that shall straighten and smoothen your hair now and neither of them really did work. But everytime I use the davines set my hair turns out so nice and straight and glossy and smooth (even without blowdrying it!). And because of my stepmother being extra carefully with things like silicons, there&#x27;s nothing bad in there! Seriously I&#x27;m definately gonna buy this again. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> So this is supposed to be a miracle shampoo to revive damaged tresses. Well, it&#x27;s okay. I would truly say the miracle stuff is the conditioner. AMAZING! It&#x27;s not bad. I just think i could go with another moisturizing shampoo and safe on cost and then follow up with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair. I feel neutral about this product. I won&#x27;t reorder but do like many davines products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  However, I have come to find that I am allergic to something in it.  This is a great product, but if your scalp begins to itch and burn after use, save yourself a trip to the dermatologist and cease use.  My suggestion is to buy it from your salon first to find out if you are allergic (so you can return your used product).  This is a wonderful product however, if you are not allergic.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo at home because it&#x27;s what my hairdresser uses on my hair when I get it cut/colored.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, and I also use the conditioner that comes in the tub.  My hair looks okay, but this product&#x27;s scent is really bad.  My husband says it smells like the urinal cake in a men&#x27;s bathroom.  Now, that&#x27;s all I can think about when I shampoo my hair.  I would continue to use Davines products, only if there is something that is comparable with a completely different scent - maybe something with a citrus, or at the very least &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> my salon used this on my hair and it smells wonderful.  I think it smells better then any of the products by far.</li>
            <li> Always a high quality product!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has worked really well so far. My hair has been breaking a lot less and the body and curl has been looking much healthier.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for your hair and it smells so good. Good for colored treated hair or split ends. Very good price on Amazon. Also get the Melu Serum.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo love the smell and how it makes my hair feel would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I worked at a place that sold this product. I used it and loved it! But before using this you should use a clarifing shampoo. The way this brand works is different than most and it will not work as well, mainly the conditioner, with build up on your hair. This build up is from styling products and cheaper hair care products.</li>
