            <li>I love the bright citrusy scent of this body polish.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like when you cover your body in a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t absorb well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a finish that is oily but not the kind of oil to break out.  </li>
            <li>Great price fast delivery very satisfied</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, after seeing how easy it is to make my own, I&#x27;d be a fool to pay 60</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth, soft and smelling delightful.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t tilt it after opening and let the oils spill out. :)</li>
            <li>I just simply love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love to treat myself now and then.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product, too.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>The texture is great, it&#x27;s just enough roughness to do the trick.</li>
            <li>I love Fresh products and I really want to love this body polish, but...</li>
            <li>so I was excited to start it again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too time consuming to have to clean the shower every time I scrub.</li>
            <li>your skin feels soft and moisturized, you will love it!</li>
            <li>Still works great &amp; smells great in the shower but not much order when you dry off.  </li>
            <li>This product really makes my skin feel so smooth</li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, but that could be because it&#x27;s so full of oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell love and last all day.</li>
            <li>I like the prooduct so much I am willing to overlook any \\&quot;buts\\&quot; I might have.  </li>
            <li>The brown sugar body scrub smells nice and works effectively as a moisturizer and exfoliator, but it&#x27;s incredibly expensive.</li>
            <li>Fresh, simple, clean and crisp~</li>
            <li>Sephora gives out decent sized samples if you ask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divine stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for a good citrus scent in the shower.  </li>
            <li>My favorite body exfoliator - hands down</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I use it between showers on my feet in the summer, keeps them soft and ready for sandals</li>
            <li>/&gt;You only use a little, so it may be worth it, but go easy</li>
            <li>Your body will be extremely soft all over  </li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t store the container in a completely upright position, there is liquid that runs out of the jar in my shower.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but worth the splurge :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through the awful ones with plastic beads, this brown sugar polish is natural and much more effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to get going on a slow, lazy morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well the sugar is quite big in size so that first time when I used, it was not easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s lasts long enough, does the trick so I don&#x27;t mind the price.  </li>
            <li> I still like the smoothness after i use the product.&lt;br /&gt;The smoothness of skin lasts really long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time as only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a coat of oil on the bottom of my shower making it so slippery that I need to carefully move around so that I don&#x27;t fall.  </li>
            <li> A few tablespoons of demerara  sugar mixed with some olive oil and bingo!</li>
            <li> Feels like wet sand on your body.</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet and heel areas to get rid of the rough skin during this winter.  </li>
            <li> product would receive a full 5 stars from me if it weren&#x27;t for the greasy feeling and the oil slick it leaves behind in the bath.  </li>
            <li> do think that a lot of the smoothness of my skin is due to residual oil.  </li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling greasy and not really clean.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re that attached to the scent, I suppose you could add a few drops of a citrus oil or maybe vanilla extract or something.</li>
            <li> To harsh for tye face.</li>
            <li> but the product is very messy to use</li>
            <li> After I used up the tub I bought on a splurge, I decided to see how hard it would be to duplicate at home.</li>
            <li> scrub in slow circular motions focusing on knees and elbows and anywhere else you please except for the face area.</li>
            <li> You can spend that much on a worthless meal out.  </li>

            <li> I love Fresh products and I really want to love this body polish, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great!  I love the bright citrusy scent of this body polish.  I&#x27;m a sucker for a good citrus scent in the shower.  It&#x27;s a nice way to get going on a slow, lazy morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, but that could be because it&#x27;s so full of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so oily that as I use it the water in the shower starts to bead up and roll off of me as if I were a duck.  It also leaves a coat of oil on the bottom of my shower making it so slippery that I need to carefully move around so that I don&#x27;t fall.  I also need to follow up my shower by giving the floor a good scrub with a cleanser so the next person to use the shower doesn&#x27;t slip and fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that a lot of the smoothness of my skin is due to residual oil.  It leaves me feeling greasy and not really clean.  Kind of like when you cover your body in a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t absorb well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would receive a full 5 stars from me if it weren&#x27;t for the greasy feeling and the oil slick it leaves behind in the bath.

            <li> I enjoy using this product. It leaves your skin smooth, soft and smelling delightful. No need for lotion after using it. Just don&#x27;t tilt it after opening and let the oils spill out. :)</li>
            <li> My favorite body exfoliator - hands down</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for years so I was excited to start it again.  Still works great &amp; smells great in the shower but not much order when you dry off.  I think it used to be stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through the awful ones with plastic beads, this brown sugar polish is natural and much more effective.  I use the Face Polish and Body Polish.</li>
            <li> I just simply love love love this stuff. Great scrub for your body.  Do not use on face. Smell love and last all day. Fresh, simple, clean and crisp~ Your body will be extremely soft all over  I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> The texture is great, it&#x27;s just enough roughness to do the trick. the smell is exotic! your skin feels soft and moisturized, you will love it!</li>
            <li> The brown sugar body scrub smells nice and works effectively as a moisturizer and exfoliator, but it&#x27;s incredibly expensive. After I used up the tub I bought on a splurge, I decided to see how hard it would be to duplicate at home. A few tablespoons of demerara  sugar mixed with some olive oil and bingo! You have essentially the same product, while spending just pennies. If you&#x27;re that attached to the scent, I suppose you could add a few drops of a citrus oil or maybe vanilla extract or something. Anyway, after seeing how easy it is to make my own, I&#x27;d be a fool to pay 60+ dollars for the same thing.</li>
            <li> Best Exfoileator out there in my opionion. Feels like wet sand on your body. Water will just bead onto and off yoyr skin as it leaves a silky feeling exiting the shower .. scrub in slow circular motions focusing on knees and elbows and anywhere else you please except for the face area. To harsh for tye face. Love love love this product!  Happy scrubbing. A must buy!  Summer V</li>
            <li> This is a must have! Love the exfoliation! It moisturizes great too!</li>
            <li> This contains BHT a well known cancer causing agent.</li>
            <li> I love this body polish!!  I use it on my feet and heel areas to get rid of the rough skin during this winter.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Quality of the product is just as advertised.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  But a bit pricey!  Good for those bumps on arms. Lasts a long time as only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> I love to treat myself now and then.  It&#x27;s lasts long enough, does the trick so I don&#x27;t mind the price.  You can spend that much on a worthless meal out.  I use it between showers on my feet in the summer, keeps them soft and ready for sandals</li>
            <li> Great price fast delivery very satisfied</li>

            <li> This stuff is divine...it smells like strawberries and brown sugar.  Rough enough to exfoliate but soft enough to keep from abrasively damaging your skin.  Has a finish that is oily but not the kind of oil to break out.  Just to soften.  I&#x27;d use it all over if it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only use a little, so it may be worth it, but go easy and it&#x27;s going to last awhile.  Sephora gives out decent sized samples if you ask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divine stuff!</li>
