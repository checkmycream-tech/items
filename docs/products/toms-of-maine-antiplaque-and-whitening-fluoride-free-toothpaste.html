            <li>works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for our globe trotting offspring who were forever stealing our toothpaste tubes to meet the limits for carry&#x3D;ons</li>
            <li>This is a great product</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste, use it all the time.  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>We travel often so I was very excited to find a travel size of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste with no fluoride!</li>
            <li>The dirt loving tree hugging yogi friend that makes purchases based on his morals.</li>
            <li>Pepsodent may not be trendy, but it leaves my mouth feeling clean----no</li>
            <li>Instead consider this wonderful old version of fluoride-free Peppermint today, while you still can.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the fresh mint, but all of Toms are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon had them</li>
            <li>The toothpaste comes in many flavors.  </li>
            <li>peppermint is one of the better flavors.  </li>
            <li>Sure wish travel size came in Fennel.</li>
            <li>I love toms tooth paste.</li>
            <li>Still doesn&#x27;t taste like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothpaste, but leaves a much more clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I dislike things that are STRONGLY SPICY or \\&quot;sharp\\</li>
            <li>I like it fine otherwise.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you acnt find the flouride free toothpaste anymore.</li>
            <li>this is a great alternative to other toothpaste :)</li>
            <li>Toms has a unique niche market for those of us that know we are being poisoned by our product choices.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Love Tom&#x27;s of Main toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>True Mint]], and</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I was realy glad to find this toothpaste and for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I learned that fluoride is good for teeth as long as you don&#x27;t swallow it.  </li>
            <li>I researched my options and changed to PEPSODENT original flavor w/ fluoride \\&quot;complete care\\&quot;, which has a mild wintergreen flavor &amp; (after using it for a week)</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li>Better order this very affordable 12-pack of Tom&#x27;s FLUORIDE-FREE Peppermint Antiplaque Tartar Control with Whitening Toothpaste, today, because Tom&#x27;s of Maine was sold to Colgate in 2006, and what is now appearing on our grocery shelves bears little resemblance to the above former, wonderful, trustworthy product Tom&#x27;s of Maine used to offer.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, everything in this toothpaste is benign, unlike the ingredients in most commercial toothpastes.</li>
            <li>It tastes okay when I&#x27;m leaning over the bathroom sink, but if I straighten-up and any gets in my throat, undiluted, it can burn enough to make me choke.  </li>
            <li>I am 80 years young and still have all my original teeth.</li>
            <li>Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the new *WICKED FRESH* chemical aftertaste.</li>
            <li>&quot; flavors----I like mostly MILD (not bland)</li>
            <li>My wife and I gagged through a whole tube and then bought this flavor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>turning super strong after a few uses and BURNING MY THROAT</li>
            <li>The above old Peppermint formula was indeed a strong, incredibly fresh oil of peppermint paste--you didn&#x27;t even need a mouthwash--and it was a definite plaque and tarter inhibitor, bearing a minty freshness likened only to chewing fresh mint leaves from the garden.</li>
            <li>For in addition to assaulting the immune system, Fluoride, even in toothpaste, is highly toxic.</li>
            <li>I used to have to pick a little plaque off the inside of lower teeth weekly, but not any more.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.  </li>
            <li>I love their flouride-free toothpaste, I trust their products, and we needed small tubes, for travel, and for our bed-and-breakfast business.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>When she went back, she had to go buy some Tom&#x27;s because she felt like regular toothpaste just didn&#x27;t clean her teeth as well.    </li>
            <li>It DOES leave a slightly bitter taste in my mouth, but that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sicky sweet like other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s makes natural products.  </li>
            <li>what you didn&#x27;t know is that the moment that tooth brush enters your mouth you consume small portions of it as the bristles of your toothbrush spay it down your throat (kind of an oxymoron</li>
            <li>I pick my tooth paste very carefully and Tom&#x27;s of Maine is my first choice.</li>
            <li>: Has an eggy after taste when applying food to the tongue (but only after first does).&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride is a chemical used on to kill rats (rat poison), it kills brain cells, is the cousin of Corine, and dumbs people down in ways they cannot detect (until detected).</li>
            <li>i dont know how fast it is in relation to other products but in conclusion, toms of maine is a definite re-buy</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find fluoride free travel size tubes of toothpaste</li>

But alas, the current (commercial) version, WICKED FRESH Peppermint *with FLUORIDE* bearing the Tom&#x27;s brand, tastes like a combination of hand sanitizer and Tidy-bowl. Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the new *WICKED FRESH* chemical aftertaste. After prolonged use, one might also want to contact your local poison control center. For in addition to assaulting the immune system, Fluoride, even in toothpaste, is highly toxic. (Most other commercial brands at least instruct the user not to swallow!) Instead consider this wonderful old version of fluoride-free Peppermint today, while you still can.</li>

            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people.  It was founded in 1970 and then purchased by Colgate in 2006.  Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s makes natural products.  The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring.  By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf.  It contains \\&quot;flavor,\\&quot; whatever that is, \\&quot;saccharine,\\&quot; and \\&quot;propylene glycol.\\&quot;  The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze.  One advantage of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tom&#x27;s for years.  The toothpaste comes in many flavors.  On Amazon, you can find [[ASIN:B001EJOQAG Peppermint]], [[ASIN:B001EJOPJS Spearmint]], [[ASIN:B0000532QH Fennel]], [[ASIN:B001EJOQGK Orange-Mango]], [[ASIN:B001EJOPUC Cinnamint]], [[ASIN:B000MANVT0 Wintermint]],  [[ASIN:B001EJOR14 Apricot]], [[ASIN:B002K8QUBS Soothing Mint]], [[ASIN:B002K8QUD6 True Mint]], and [[ASIN:B0000532QK Gingermint]], among others.  I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.  The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom&#x27;s.  Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.  The prices do vary from vendor to vendor, so check for the best price.</li>
            <li> peppermint is one of the better flavors.  Still doesn&#x27;t taste like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothpaste, but leaves a much more clean feeling.  A friend of ours stayed came to town and stayed with us for a week.  When she went back, she had to go buy some Tom&#x27;s because she felt like regular toothpaste just didn&#x27;t clean her teeth as well.    Flouride is evil, do the research.  Cue people hating on my review, because I made an alarming comment that can be backed up by research and imperical data.</li>
            <li> Love Tom&#x27;s of Main toothpaste!  Sure wish travel size came in Fennel.</li>
            <li> I used to have to pick a little plaque off the inside of lower teeth weekly, but not any more.  Product actually works!</li>
            <li> I am 80 years young and still have all my original teeth. I pick my tooth paste very carefully and Tom&#x27;s of Maine is my first choice.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is legit i dont have to consume the rat poison in other (fluoride) toothpastes like crest and colgate plus it reall does whiten your teeth! ive been noticing a drastic change in the whiteness of my teeth. i dont know how fast it is in relation to other products but in conclusion, toms of maine is a definite re-buy</li>
            <li> Not as foamy as other toothpastes and not as sharp of a minty taste, but that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be. Absolutely no more mouth sores inside the mouth after we started using this. Name brand was making my tongue start to burn after brushing, also.</li>
            <li> Toms has a unique niche market for those of us that know we are being poisoned by our product choices.&lt;br /&gt;For addressing that issue I would have given this toothpaste a 5 star BUT...&lt;br /&gt;We started off with fennel flavor - WOW, it was so bad. My wife and I gagged through a whole tube and then bought this flavor.&lt;br /&gt;This flavor is a type of mint but it doesn&#x27;t resemble the mint of other toothpastes. As a result, my wife no longer uses it.&lt;br /&gt;The mint isn&#x27;t as offensive as the fennel but it was an obvious problem for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it to my friends? Well, one of them... The dirt loving tree hugging yogi friend that makes purchases based on his morals. Yep. I&#x27;d give toms a nod for that guy. I&#x27;m that guy too so I know he&#x27;d like it but we are 2 out of 100 that would make the change. Try it. You&#x27;re body will appreciate it but your tastebuds might be a little ticked for a while.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste, use it all the time.  Tried it three years ago and been using it ever since and had great dental checkups.  It isn&#x27;t sicky sweet like other toothpastes. This purchase was for travel size as you can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I love toms tooth paste. Fresh and clean. My favorite is the fresh mint, but all of Toms are great.</li>
            <li> We travel often so I was very excited to find a travel size of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste with no fluoride! Love it!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find fluoride free travel size tubes of toothpaste so I was happy to buy this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. since this company was bought out by colgate I think! you acnt find the flouride free toothpaste anymore. its also hard to find the pepermint flavor...I was realy glad to find this toothpaste and for a decent price. The small tubes are coveinent for travel!!!</li>
            <li> fluoride is really bad for you so I don&#x60;t buy it. this is a great alternative to other toothpaste :)</li>
            <li> Likes: No fluoride&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: Has an eggy after taste when applying food to the tongue (but only after first does).&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride is a chemical used on to kill rats (rat poison), it kills brain cells, is the cousin of Corine, and dumbs people down in ways they cannot detect (until detected). It&#x27;s just not good for you. Even your local dentist will advise you not to consume fluoride while brushing your teeth with fluoridated toothpaste but what you didn&#x27;t know is that the moment that tooth brush enters your mouth you consume small portions of it as the bristles of your toothbrush spay it down your throat (kind of an oxymoron when you think of it)). This is why I use Tom&#x27;s, because it has no fluoride but holds the same capabilities that all fluoridated toothpaste brands present. However, you won&#x27;t have to worry about the side-effects those other brads manifest. Ever had a headache for no reason? FLUORIDE. Once you get used to the taste you will never go back. I like and I prefer it. And if you&#x27;re a parent you won&#x27;t have to worry about your kids drinking up all the fluoride within it because it HAS no fluoride. Now everybody&#x27;s a winner. lol</li>
            <li> UPDATE on 7/15/14:  I got fed up with the 1 oz. size tubes  (don&#x27;t know about the larger sizes)  turning super strong after a few uses and BURNING MY THROAT (and I NEVER SWALLOW ANY toothpaste, this trickled into my  throat DURING brushing) to the point of making me gag.  So I had to give all the unopened ones of the 12 tubes away.  I dislike things that are STRONGLY SPICY or \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; flavors----I like mostly MILD (not bland) flavors----so I researched my options and changed to PEPSODENT original flavor w/ fluoride \\&quot;complete care\\&quot;, which has a mild wintergreen flavor &amp; (after using it for a week) works perfectly for me.  I learned that fluoride is good for teeth as long as you don&#x27;t swallow it.  Pepsodent may not be trendy, but it leaves my mouth feeling clean----no bitter aftertaste---- and \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL COMMENTS:&lt;br /&gt;I bought a dozen one-ounce sized tubes of this for travel, but have used it daily at home for months.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have flouride. It tastes okay when I&#x27;m leaning over the bathroom sink, but if I straighten-up and any gets in my throat, undiluted, it can burn enough to make me choke.  Don&#x27;t know what ingredient causes that, but wish they could leave that ingredient out!  However, I seldom need to straighten-up while brushing, so I like it fine otherwise.  It DOES leave a slightly bitter taste in my mouth, but that dissipates quickly.</li>
