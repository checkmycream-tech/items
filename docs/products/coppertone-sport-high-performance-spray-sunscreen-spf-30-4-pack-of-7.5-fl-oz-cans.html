            <li>Great service, great product!</li>
            <li>Great suntan spray, I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years.</li>
            <li>I end up like the Eustace dragon in the BBC&#x27;s Voyage of the Dawn Treader....which is not an attractive look when you&#x27;re out on the beach with friends.</li>
            <li>Works great and at a good prize.</li>
            <li>Great product good price</li>
            <li>Good price for a good product</li>
            <li>Good price -- should have bought 2 or 3</li>
            <li>And even in the hot summer  in Thailand like april - may, it works perfect</li>
            <li>but it kind of dries out his skin.</li>
            <li>My grand kids also use it.</li>
            <li>We used to run at 6:30 AM, where it was nice and cool, but now we run at 2:30 PM.</li>
            <li>looks fine hope it works as well</li>
            <li>This keeps me from getting burned, which is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I also only put this on 15 minutes before I run and it still works great.</li>
            <li>We have a pool and are outside a lot, we have always loved the spray because it is easier to put on.</li>
            <li>good for your back and legs</li>
            <li>In fact when I complete this review I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, not uncomfortable and lasts most of the day during moderate activity.</li>
            <li>The stain was mostly on the right side of my pants, near where my hand goes in the pocket.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and I received the product promptly.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t beat coppertone and the price is right</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>On a good day it&#x27;s at least 95 degrees.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It made a dirty-looking reddish stain that so far has not gone away after two washings.  </li>
            <li>I am currently running cross country for my high school.</li>
            <li>We were out in the sun for a few others last weekend (in South Florida) with a sunfilled sky and hot temperatures and no one got burnt</li>

            <li> Works great and at a good prize. Strangely my package came with a three pack and one additional bottle separately. However a surprise is mine came with a sport sunscreen stick. We have a pool and are outside a lot, we have always loved the spray because it is easier to put on. We were out in the sun for a few others last weekend (in South Florida) with a sunfilled sky and hot temperatures and no one got burnt</li>
            <li> Great suntan spray, I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years. Easy to apply, not uncomfortable and lasts most of the day during moderate activity. The price was right and I received the product promptly. Highly recommend! In fact when I complete this review I&#x27;m ordering more. My grand kids also use it.</li>
            <li> This worked well, but not a lot in the bottle.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat coppertone and the price is right</li>
            <li> Good price for a good product</li>
            <li> This keeps me from getting burned, which is fabulous. And it *does* seem sweat-proof, in that I can run around in it and not get pink. However, there&#x27;s a nasty white residue that forms if there&#x27;s any sort of friction against your skin...which there usually is if you&#x27;re out playing sports, or reapplying, or just...normal. So that&#x27;s a pain. I end up like the Eustace dragon in the BBC&#x27;s Voyage of the Dawn Treader....which is not an attractive look when you&#x27;re out on the beach with friends.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen ruined a pair of kakki shorts in July 2015.  It made a dirty-looking reddish stain that so far has not gone away after two washings.  I will update the review if the stain ever goes away.  For the record (in case the formulation changes) here is the ingredients list from the back of the bottle: Alcohol Denat., Acrylates/Octylacrylamide copolymer, stearoxytrimethylsilane, gylcerin, diethylhexyl syringylidenemalonate, tocopherol (vitamin E), Fragrance, retinyl palmitate (vitamin A palmitate), caprylic/capric triglyceride  The stain was mostly on the right side of my pants, near where my hand goes in the pocket.  (I sprayed some of the suntan lotion on my hand to apply it manually to my face, because I didn&#x27;t want to breath the fumes while spraying it onto my face.)</li>
            <li> Several years, I use this spray. And even in the hot summer  in Thailand like april - may, it works perfect</li>
            <li> Great product good price</li>
            <li> good for your back and legs</li>
            <li> it blocks sun!  Good price -- should have bought 2 or 3</li>
            <li> My husband uses it all the time but it kind of dries out his skin. It works well as a sunscreen though.</li>
            <li> Great service, great product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This spray stains!!! It took me a long time to recognize what kept staining my kids&#x27; clothes and swimsuits. It was this sunscreen. It stains dark yellow on white. I have had several outfits and swimsuits ruined. Also have worn to sporting events and it stains jerseys! It even yellowed a navy blue swimsuit. Extremely upset over it. For a bit I just thought my kids were spilling or getting stuff on themselves, I usually have a few different brands of sunscreen at once, so I never blamed one in particular. But I know this one is awful because it was all my in-laws had at their house. Day 1 Navy blue janie and jack swimsuit ruined, Day 2- another swimsuit yellowed! Then I asked my Mother in law and she said several of their baseball jerseys were also stained, the only common denominator was this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> looks fine hope it works as well</li>
            <li> I am currently running cross country for my high school. We used to run at 6:30 AM, where it was nice and cool, but now we run at 2:30 PM. On a good day it&#x27;s at least 95 degrees. I have yet to get burnt after a week of running in high heat while sweating heavily. I also only put this on 15 minutes before I run and it still works great. Highly recommended.</li>
