            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I have used the competitors brand for years but found the ingredients in Dr. Wood to be more soothing enriching and better for exfoliation</li>
            <li>love anything with coconut oil but thus was just so so.</li>
            <li>I love the soap but the scent does not smell like lavender to me, it just smells &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap.</li>

            <li>The scent is not too strong so anyone will love it.</li>
            <li>The castle soap easily cleans the oil off my hands and the shea butter keeps them from drying out better than any moisturizing soap I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
            <li>Great natural product, my wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>EVER felt so Squeaky Clean!  </li>
            <li>GREAT ALL NATURAL SOAP</li>
            <li>Not as good as the real Castile soap.  </li>
            <li>What I like about it the most as that it can be used to clean almost everything, not just my hands.</li>
            <li>This works well, is much less drying than sls-based soap, and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>I enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li>Great substitute for the equally high-quality Dr. B&#x27;s Castile soaps (with a bit of a savings to boot), which we also still use.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily to wash my baby and toddler head to toe-</li>
            <li>Really nice gentle soap.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, packaging nicely done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells great and leaves skin feeling soft and clean, I have sensitive skin issues and this works amazing.</li>
            <li>The scent is fine to me but if you are expecting a true lavender scent this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>This product wins my loyalty!</li>
            <li>I feel clean when I wash it off</li>
            <li>I use as a hair and body wash, hair is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Makes you feel clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>She feels super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The all in one wash leaves my hair and skin feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>rosemary smell is pretty strong, I like it but maybe not for everyone.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is mild yet has a calming, comforting effect.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle, fresh cleansing I get from using Dr Woods - Shea Vision Castile Soap with Lavendar.  </li>
            <li>My children and I loved it because of the smell and it didn&#x27;t leave our dry skin even dryer.  </li>
            <li>Environmentally friendly, no scary ingredients whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>It is versatile, natural and can be used for so many things .</li>
            <li>This product does so and is quite economical.</li>
            <li>(I never thought in my life i would like a liquid soap which smelled like lavender but great as you are not left smelling like a wild flower -as</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and silky, and I love that it&#x27;s biodegradable.</li>
            <li>Considering that I have a 4.5 yr old and the Mouse is my dark overlord, I delightedly picked it up and put it in the cart, reveling in the anticipated adoration that surely would occur when I showed it to my daughter</li>
            <li>I like a foamy lather to feel like I am really getting clean.</li>
            <li>I bought the 32 ounce bottle and that big guy has lasted since Sept 2014 and is still going strong!</li>
            <li>I like the scent and the lather very much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love this Castile soap for body products, especially making homemade foaming soap.</li>
            <li>I bought this last summer, and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Bronners&#x27;!</li>
            <li>My face feels clean &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves there skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>nice soap, much cheaper than the other castile soap I used to buy.</li>
            <li>Had Dr Bronners lavender Castile soap and honestly don&#x27;t notice much a difference excepting slight scent differences.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle with a pleasing aroma.  </li>
            <li>Really like this soap for showering.  </li>
            <li>Recommend highly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used this as a bubble bath a couple of times and it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
            <li>really like it</li>
            <li>It goes fast if you use it for your shower, cloths and floor.</li>
            <li>very drying.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on my skin unlike bar soaps.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the mix of lavender and Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Dr. Woods is twice as thick and smells really good.</li>
            <li>Like all Dr. Woods soaps I feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>This one is very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>My whole family agrees that&#x27;s why we bought a half a dozen more thank you Amazon</li>
            <li>It smells great, and my hair feels much healthier without all the harsh chemicals from other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I dont particularly like the smell.  </li>
            <li>Better than any other shower soap used and has all natural ingredients without toxic parabens, sulphates and formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant light lavender scent with the natural clean-green scent of Castile for the base.</li>
            <li>I like that this castile soap was actually thicker and suds up really well</li>
            <li>Also since I have been using natural soaps I have noticed I don&#x27;t get dandruff anymore.</li>
            <li>My old brand has gotten like water regardless of where I buy it.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t strip the skin and hair of their natural oils.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the fact that its natural and will not harm our animals.</li>
            <li>Also is notice to know that when she mops that when they lick their paws that its natural and will not hurt them.</li>
            <li>it cause he says its masculine.  </li>
            <li>Smell is soft and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I use it all over and it makes my hair and skin feel soft and moisturized after bathing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they had enough consideration to package it plastic ziploc bags so that there would be no accidents even though the bottles are sealed under the cap; some places are careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t as many scent options for Dr. Woods as there are for Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i did feel the skin was left with a very soft touch and feel,  </li>
            <li>I am always searching for a product with as few chemical additives as possible which will clean and prevent my hands from drying out.</li>
            <li>We dilute and use it for body wash, shampoo, hand soap, addition to laundry, general cleaning.  </li>
            <li>But that could be because I&#x27;m on the fence about lavender in general.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this because of its natural properties and effects and cost.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but has a fake lavender aspect to it.  </li>
            <li>Also occasional use it for delicate washables - leaves the clothes clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far inferior to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in lather, concentration, smell and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Very tempted to dump it down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great substitute for the equally high-quality Dr. B&#x27;s Castile soaps (with a bit of a savings to boot), which we also still use.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily to wash my baby and toddler head to toe-</li>
            <li> Really nice gentle soap.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, packaging nicely done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells great and leaves skin feeling soft and clean, I have sensitive skin issues and this works amazing.</li>
            <li> The scent is fine to me but if you are expecting a true lavender scent this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> This product wins my loyalty!</li>
            <li> I feel clean when I wash it off</li>
            <li> I use as a hair and body wash, hair is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> She feels super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> The all in one wash leaves my hair and skin feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> rosemary smell is pretty strong, I like it but maybe not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is mild yet has a calming, comforting effect.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle, fresh cleansing I get from using Dr Woods - Shea Vision Castile Soap with Lavendar.  </li>
            <li> My children and I loved it because of the smell and it didn&#x27;t leave our dry skin even dryer.  </li>
            <li> Environmentally friendly, no scary ingredients whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It is versatile, natural and can be used for so many things .</li>
            <li> This product does so and is quite economical.</li>
            <li> (I never thought in my life i would like a liquid soap which smelled like lavender but great as you are not left smelling like a wild flower -as</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and silky, and I love that it&#x27;s biodegradable.</li>
            <li> Considering that I have a 4.5 yr old and the Mouse is my dark overlord, I delightedly picked it up and put it in the cart, reveling in the anticipated adoration that surely would occur when I showed it to my daughter</li>
            <li> I like a foamy lather to feel like I am really getting clean.</li>
            <li> I bought the 32 ounce bottle and that big guy has lasted since Sept 2014 and is still going strong!</li>
            <li> I like the scent and the lather very much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this Castile soap for body products, especially making homemade foaming soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer, and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Bronners&#x27;!</li>
            <li> My face feels clean &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves there skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> nice soap, much cheaper than the other castile soap I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Had Dr Bronners lavender Castile soap and honestly don&#x27;t notice much a difference excepting slight scent differences.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle with a pleasing aroma.  </li>
            <li> Really like this soap for showering.  </li>
            <li> Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this as a bubble bath a couple of times and it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
            <li> really like it</li>
            <li> It goes fast if you use it for your shower, cloths and floor.</li>
            <li> very drying.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle on my skin unlike bar soaps.  </li>
            <li> but I really like the mix of lavender and Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Dr. Woods is twice as thick and smells really good.</li>
            <li> Like all Dr. Woods soaps I feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> This one is very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> My whole family agrees that&#x27;s why we bought a half a dozen more thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> It smells great, and my hair feels much healthier without all the harsh chemicals from other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I dont particularly like the smell.  </li>
            <li> Better than any other shower soap used and has all natural ingredients without toxic parabens, sulphates and formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant light lavender scent with the natural clean-green scent of Castile for the base.</li>
            <li> I like that this castile soap was actually thicker and suds up really well</li>
            <li> Also since I have been using natural soaps I have noticed I don&#x27;t get dandruff anymore.</li>
            <li> My old brand has gotten like water regardless of where I buy it.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t strip the skin and hair of their natural oils.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the fact that its natural and will not harm our animals.</li>
            <li> Also is notice to know that when she mops that when they lick their paws that its natural and will not hurt them.</li>
            <li> it cause he says its masculine.  </li>
            <li> Smell is soft and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I use it all over and it makes my hair and skin feel soft and moisturized after bathing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they had enough consideration to package it plastic ziploc bags so that there would be no accidents even though the bottles are sealed under the cap; some places are careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t as many scent options for Dr. Woods as there are for Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i did feel the skin was left with a very soft touch and feel,  </li>
            <li> I am always searching for a product with as few chemical additives as possible which will clean and prevent my hands from drying out.</li>
            <li> We dilute and use it for body wash, shampoo, hand soap, addition to laundry, general cleaning.  </li>
            <li> But that could be because I&#x27;m on the fence about lavender in general.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this because of its natural properties and effects and cost.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but has a fake lavender aspect to it.  </li>
            <li> Also occasional use it for delicate washables - leaves the clothes clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far inferior to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in lather, concentration, smell and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Very tempted to dump it down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it did not mean anything to me until I used it since a long time ago I had used some other Shea soaps and did not notice any difference whatsoever and thought that Shea thing was a gimmick until</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never sure how much I have to use.</li>
            <li> I use a little apple cider vinegar occasionally to remove the heaviness that natural shampoos can leave.  </li>
            <li> I would use this all the time, however, my husband who does not have dry but oily skin, did not prefer the feeling it left his skin.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding a body cleanser because I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Feel your skin after one week of use and you won&#x27;t go back to any other.  </li>
            <li> I also only use this and other Dr. Woods products in my home.</li>
            <li> A lot of times I just add it to other soaps that are supposed to smell like lavender so that it will be properly scented.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands or hair and works well in automatic soap dispensers too.</li>
            <li> It plus lotion has helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems to last a lot longer than my other cleaners!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the really dry skin feeling after rinsing it off!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, we busted it open and not wanting to waste, we&#x27;ve been using the toxic goo.</li>
            <li> Only takes a few drops to offer generous cleaning.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this specific supplier&#x27;s Dr. Woods soap, but I&#x27;ve used Dr. Woods soap in the past and found no problem with the quality of the soap itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try some of the other scents too.</li>
            <li> it , it so pricey other place sale for $10 😡</li>
            <li> Smells nicer than the other brand of castile soap that I used to use.  </li>
            <li> I use some other mixes in my bodywash</li>
            <li> Also, the sudsing action is poor.</li>
            <li> I bought some Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and was surprised by how thin it was.</li>
            <li> Way thicker and and didn&#x27;t spray me down when I pumped the soap dispenser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it is rather thin; although, using it in recipes requires the same amount as any other castile soap, so I have no real complaints there.  </li>
            <li> No more winter dry skin!!  </li>
            <li> And it works just as well at less cost!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed however that it arrived with the top cracked off.</li>
            <li> scent I&#x27;m still not sure if I like it or don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> None leaked out thanks to the foil film under the cap, but unfortunately I am trying to find a replacement bottle because I am unable to keep close it now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a soap that will both remove the massage oil and not leave my hands dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> It smelled like the essential oil went bad in it too!</li>
            <li> It would just shoot out of our soap dispenser in crazy ways, so I tried this brand.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great sudsy soap for the shower or bath</li>
            <li> My face feels clean &amp; soft. I use it with a foaming pump:  60% water, 20% soap, and 20% air. Makes a nice, rich lather.</li>
            <li> Good price,lasts forever and smells great as well as leaving your skin well .......</li>
            <li> I like that this castile soap was actually thicker and suds up really well</li>
            <li> Better than any other shower soap used and has all natural ingredients without toxic parabens, sulphates and formaldehyde.  Smell GREAT too.  Feel your skin after one week of use and you won&#x27;t go back to any other.  My skin smoother than ever before at 48!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this soap. It is versatile, natural and can be used for so many things . I especially liked the price that was offered from this company. The product came on time and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and love it. Lasts a long time too. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that this is organic.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  I feel clean when I wash it off and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way.  We dilute and use it for body wash, shampoo, hand soap, addition to laundry, general cleaning.  It&#x27;s gentle with a pleasing aroma.  Environmentally friendly, no scary ingredients whatsoever.  Great substitute for the equally high-quality Dr. B&#x27;s Castile soaps (with a bit of a savings to boot), which we also still use.</li>
            <li> This soap is Wonderful!!!  I use it with my facial exfoliating brush and then rinse.  My face NEVER EVER felt so Squeaky Clean!  A little goes a long way so I use it on my face and use it as a body wash in the shower.  I never tried it as a shampoo or for anything else.  But I truly LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I use it on my hair.  I have a low iron and blood levels that leaves my hair brittle.  This soap/shampoo clears the brittleness, makes my hair stronger and healthy looking.  I use a little apple cider vinegar occasionally to remove the heaviness that natural shampoos can leave.  The scent is great not too strong.  I will be buying this product again.  Also since I have been using natural soaps I have noticed I don&#x27;t get dandruff anymore.</li>
            <li> This product wins my loyalty! As a nurse I wash my hands more than 30 times a day. I am always searching for a product with as few chemical additives as possible which will clean and prevent my hands from drying out. This product does so and is quite economical.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It is a great price! She feels super clean afterwards. So Glad we got this body wash.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this specific supplier&#x27;s Dr. Woods soap, but I&#x27;ve used Dr. Woods soap in the past and found no problem with the quality of the soap itself. As for the supplier, they sent it and it was received without any problems or delays. I&#x27;m glad they had enough consideration to package it plastic ziploc bags so that there would be no accidents even though the bottles are sealed under the cap; some places are careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t as many scent options for Dr. Woods as there are for Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s less expensive. I&#x27;d say that the lavender scent is most preferred for me.</li>
            <li> Really wonderful. Very impressed. Will not use anything else now. Would like to buy by the gallon.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong but does a good job of washing.</li>
            <li> I love this Castile soap for body products, especially making homemade foaming soap. I bought the 32 ounce bottle and that big guy has lasted since Sept 2014 and is still going strong! What a value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can attest to its moisturizing properties. Take this for example---I have been reusing various foaming dispensers...well, I was in Target and noticed a foaming Method dispenser shaped like Mickey Mouse. Considering that I have a 4.5 yr old and the Mouse is my dark overlord, I delightedly picked it up and put it in the cart, reveling in the anticipated adoration that surely would occur when I showed it to my daughter (spoiler alert: it receive lukewarm accolades--the Mouse was displeased).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, we busted it open and not wanting to waste, we&#x27;ve been using the toxic goo. My hands feel like sandpaper--I have to moisturize constantly after just a day of use. Very tempted to dump it down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Woods also is a great body wash--I haven&#x27;t used it for anything but handsoap and body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Summary--great moisturizing soap, and I&#x27;ve sacrificed my ideals for a frickin&#x27; soap dispenser that my daughter wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with.</li>
            <li> nice soap, much cheaper than the other castile soap I used to buy. I use as a hair and body wash, hair is squeaky clean. lavender/rosemary smell is pretty strong, I like it but maybe not for everyone. I&#x27;d like to try some of the other scents too.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my kids.  Leaves there skin soft and clean.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Overall I like this soap but I still find myself having to use conditioner because after using this as shampoo my hair needs to be softened to brush through. I thought using castile soap you wouldn&#x27;t need conditioner.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap as I wanted a more eco-friendly product. What I like about it the most as that it can be used to clean almost everything, not just my hands. I now use it for dishes, laundry and for my hair too. Great smell and very economical. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands or hair and works well in automatic soap dispensers too. Thank you Shea Vision!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just discovered Dr Woods after using exclusively Dr Bronners for years. And it works just as well at less cost! Love the smell and it cleans like a champ. I use this as a shampoo and body wash and it makes my hair smell and feel great!!!</li>
            <li> I always use this product. Leaves your skin nice and smooth with the fragrance of lavender. Also great for your hair. No complaints. will contintue to use.</li>
            <li> It love this soap. I put it in my foam dispenser with some distilled water and it foams nicely and leave your hand feeling smooth after.</li>
            <li> Great scent, great product! I&#x27;m glad I tried this scent. Like all Dr. Woods soaps I feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I trust this product for health reasons, My elder mother uses it in place of toxic soaps in the nursing facility she is currently in. I see to it that they always use these products when bathing her. I also only use this and other Dr. Woods products in my home. Everyone asked me why my skin is so nice, I tell them Dr. Woods soaps.I even bathe my dogs with it. You should see their coats. Plus their skin is so healthy!</li>
            <li> Really like this soap for showering.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased excellent products!</li>
            <li> Great natural product, my wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I bought this last summer, and fell in love with it. Lavender, by itself, is okay;but adding the shea butter puts it over the top!!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever buy Dr. B&#x27;s again. This stuff is the best. My old brand has gotten like water regardless of where I buy it. It smelled like the essential oil went bad in it too! I&#x27;ll never go back!  Dr. Woods is twice as thick and smells really good. The Shea butter is a great addition without losing the squeaky clean feeling. The label on the old stuff got over the top crazy. It&#x27;s started making me wonder about the product before I opened it. The scent is not too strong so anyone will love it.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for bathing - even occasionally for shampooing - and my skin never felt softer!  No more winter dry skin!!  And, the lavender smell is heavenly.  Love it!!  I&#x27;ll definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Is like a water no soapy I&#x27;m so disppoint it , it so pricey other place sale for $10 😡</li>
            <li> Great price. Great scent. Arrived in a nice clean packaging. Great for laundry, dishes, cleaning. It&#x27;s seems to last a lot longer than my other cleaners! Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I bought this to start making my own shampoo and I LOVED it! It smells great, and my hair feels much healthier without all the harsh chemicals from other shampoos. I&#x27;ve also used this as a bubble bath a couple of times and it&#x27;s very relaxing. I&#x27;ve almost used this up, but I bought a lavender one too and they&#x27;re both wonderful! I&#x27;m never buying shampoo from a store again!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for castille soap with tea tree for a while and when i found it, i saw this one, which i decided also to try, to my surprise it is very pleasant, super smooth, nice smell (I never thought in my life i would like a liquid soap which smelled like lavender but great as you are not left smelling like a wild flower -as a guy that is very important for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did feel the skin was left with a very soft touch and feel,  and then I got it..., that&#x27;s why it has Shea, ahh (i know it was in the label but it did not mean anything to me until I used it since a long time ago I had used some other Shea soaps and did not notice any difference whatsoever and thought that Shea thing was a gimmick until now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of Dr. Bronners because of the shea butter and my skin is a pain in the winter with dryness, I like it ok but I still prefer my Dr. Bronners.  It plus lotion has helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells nicer than the other brand of castile soap that I used to use.  It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t strip the skin and hair of their natural oils.</li>
            <li> I have used the competitors brand for years but found the ingredients in Dr. Wood to be more soothing enriching and better for exfoliation&lt;br /&gt; My whole family agrees that&#x27;s why we bought a half a dozen more thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> I just received product today. I like the scent and the lather very much. I was very disappointed however that it arrived with the top cracked off. None leaked out thanks to the foil film under the cap, but unfortunately I am trying to find a replacement bottle because I am unable to keep close it now.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the real Castile soap.  The scent is nice, but has a fake lavender aspect to it.  Also, the sudsing action is poor.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this soap is it does not get sudsy. I like a foamy lather to feel like I am really getting clean. It is quite runny. I&#x27;m never sure how much I have to use.</li>
            <li> Sorry wanted to love this...couldn&#x27;t use on my colored hair .&lt;br /&gt;Felt ok on skin but didn&#x27;t leave a remarkable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love anything with coconut oil but thus was just so so.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever. It goes fast if you use it for your shower, cloths and floor. My wife loves the fact that its natural and will not harm our animals. We have a kitten that likes to lick the bathtub  after we shower and even likes to get in with us. Also is notice to know that when she mops that when they lick their paws that its natural and will not hurt them.</li>
            <li> OxKom had swift delivery- great sellers. Pleasant light lavender scent with the natural clean-green scent of Castile for the base. I use this primarily to wash my baby and toddler head to toe- and it works wonderfully. Had Dr Bronners lavender Castile soap and honestly don&#x27;t notice much a difference excepting slight scent differences.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this since I love making my own body wash this is one of my preferred products to use</li>
            <li> Makes you feel clean and refreshed.  It appears to open your up you breathing also while you are taking a shower</li>
            <li> Only takes a few drops to offer generous cleaning. Feels amazing on the skin. Fragrance is mild yet has a calming, comforting effect.</li>
            <li> Really nice gentle soap. I was having trouble finding a body cleanser because I have really sensitive skin. This one is very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> The all in one wash leaves my hair and skin feeling fresh and smooth. The scent of Lavender and Shea smells great and isn&#x27;t overpowering. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great low-cost and all purpose wash.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before buying this product (thank you Amazon reviewers)!  The oil soap does the job it&#x27;s meant to do.  However, it is rather thin; although, using it in recipes requires the same amount as any other castile soap, so I have no real complaints there.  It doesn&#x27;t lather well for things like washing hair.  It has a strong lavender smell, though, which is great.  A lot of times I just add it to other soaps that are supposed to smell like lavender so that it will be properly scented.  When I want to wash something that doesn&#x27;t touch my body, though, I use Murphy&#x27;s Oil Soap as it&#x27;s very similar (it&#x27;s an oil soap, after all) and also has a great smell.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells great and leaves skin feeling soft and clean, I have sensitive skin issues and this works amazing.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Smells like carpeting. I have used Dr. Woods for some time, so I know what this is supposed to smell like and always have had good luck. Not this time. Beware.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent and even more amazing on my body! love love love love love this!</li>
            <li> I love the soap but the scent does not smell like lavender to me, it just smells &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;. The scent is fine to me but if you are expecting a true lavender scent this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> This works well, is much less drying than sls-based soap, and smells wonderful! I use it diluted (with boiled &amp; cooled water) in foaming soap bottles.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but I don&#x27;t like the really dry skin feeling after rinsing it off!</li>
            <li> GREAT ALL NATURAL SOAP</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. Leaves your skin very soft and the smell is so great, love this product I recomend it.</li>
            <li> I dont particularly like the smell.  My BF likes it cause he says its masculine.  I find the smell almost clinical, like something you find at a doctors office.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! I will be buying it regularly. The fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong as I like for lavender (I like really strong lavender) but it&#x27;s great for the many uses!</li>
            <li> This one is my favorite to use making mt own bodywash. I use some other mixes in my bodywash but this is my base and it works great. Smell is soft and relaxing. I actually prefer this over the dr bronner lavender! It works great in the foam hand soap pumps too</li>
            <li> Love this product! Has a wonderful fragrance, and the shea butter in the soap leaves skin feeling soft. Also occasional use it for delicate washables - leaves the clothes clean and soft.</li>
            <li> very drying. to my skin.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this because of its natural properties and effects and cost.  My children and I loved it because of the smell and it didn&#x27;t leave our dry skin even dryer.  I would use this all the time, however, my husband who does not have dry but oily skin, did not prefer the feeling it left his skin.  I suppose he is used to feeling &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; after a shower which I read &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  Something to keep in mind if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! As a massage therapist, I wash my hands a lot. It&#x27;s difficult to find a soap that will both remove the massage oil and not leave my hands dry and cracked. The castle soap easily cleans the oil off my hands and the shea butter keeps them from drying out better than any moisturizing soap I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all. It&#x27;s far inferior to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in lather, concentration, smell and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle, fresh cleansing I get from using Dr Woods - Shea Vision Castile Soap with Lavendar.  It is so gentle on my skin unlike bar soaps.  I won&#x27;t ever be without this in my house.</li>
            <li> I like the competition but I really like the mix of lavender and Shea butter. I use it all over and it makes my hair and skin feel soft and moisturized after bathing. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I like the soap. I bought some Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and was surprised by how thin it was. It would just shoot out of our soap dispenser in crazy ways, so I tried this brand. Way thicker and and didn&#x27;t spray me down when I pumped the soap dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent I&#x27;m still not sure if I like it or don&#x27;t like it. But that could be because I&#x27;m on the fence about lavender in general.</li>
            <li> I use this for my shower and face washing needs. Leaves my skin soft and silky, and I love that it&#x27;s biodegradable. Shipping was fast, packaging nicely done. Will definitely be buying this again (this is my second purchase). Much cheaper than Bronners&#x27;!</li>
