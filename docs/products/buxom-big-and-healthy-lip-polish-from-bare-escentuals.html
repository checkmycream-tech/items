    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>my surprise, it was a GREAT color!</li>
            <li>it is awesome!</li>
            <li>This is the best lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The color is a perfect pinky nude...</li>
            <li>I got the Amber color in a kit and while it isn&#x27;t the perfect shade for me, I wear it all of the time because it moisturizes my lips with no drying effect afterwards and it smells so delicious (almost like baked cookies)!</li>
            <li>My best friend had this in \\&quot;Bambi\\</li>
            <li>and I fully understand why it was awarded \\&quot;Best of Sephora.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>but it is the BEST GLOSS I have ever worn ...</li>
            <li>This glides on beautifully and has a wonderful satin-like feel.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very nice, \\&quot;Ginger\\&quot; is a beautiful color and the shine is great.</li>
            <li>would be great for summer.</li>
            <li>but my lips look great with Dolly</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t expect a miracle to happen but the shades are great and it&#x27;s not all goopy.</li>
            <li>These glosses smell wonderful and their texture is nice too.  </li>
            <li>I want to update this to 5 stars just for being a great gloss.</li>
            <li>I got Amber and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>good buy.</li>
            <li>I have been delighted with the staying power of this the way I wear it ...</li>
            <li>Cute packaging!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>&quot; and I tried it one day and fell in love!</li>
            <li>It tingles, and thats kind of a sexy feeling!</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals Buxom lip gloss is truly the best lip gloss out there: the colors are sheer but provide the perfect amount of coverage, the consistency is not sticky and the color goes on perfectly evenly on your lips, and the lip-plumping works magical wonders!</li>
            <li>I have tried every lip plumper on the market (no joke) and this is the best (besides pure cinnamon leaf oil, which burns like hell).  </li>
            <li>I liked the colors.  </li>
            <li>I wanted my own (just the gloss)</li>
            <li>It really is the BEST!</li>
            <li>The color is also nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked this gloss in some ways and not in others.</li>
            <li>The formula does not burn, just gives a nice tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t see this lip gloss plumping my lips, it really gives them great shine, makes them tingle, smells delicious and makes my lips feel all minty and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is the best plumping gloss I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>However, I prefer a more natural look and am also very fair skinned</li>
            <li>That is subjective and some people might love that.</li>
            <li>The tingle on your lips is refreshing, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ve had better ones</li>
            <li>does have a tinted lip gloss palette that I&#x27;ve enjoyed... shiny and moisturizing with a hint of tint...</li>
            <li>I gave most of them away.</li>
            <li>dolly is a nice pinkish mauve color that makes a great nude or slightly natural look on olive or darker skinned complexions .</li>
            <li>However, all in all, I do enjoy these a lot!</li>
            <li>My favorite color is Dolly.</li>
            <li>I bought this gloss for the beautiful color (Brandi), fresh smell, and cool tingly sensation</li>
            <li>and I love the texture.   </li>
            <li>and you notice them more.   </li>
            <li>I think Urban Decay&#x27;s plumper works the best for plumping, out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The gloss went on smooth, wasn&#x27;t sticky, and also had a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and I do wear it more than most of my glosses but</li>
            <li>I wear it with LipFusion&#x27;s LipPlumper Pencil in Buff and love it ...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product ...</li>
            <li>and I love them all.</li>
            <li>I tried this gloss in vain thinking that my already very full lips would somehow magically inflate.  </li>
            <li>The colors are awesome and it stays on for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I got a deluxe sample in Dolly, and will soon purchase the full size.</li>
            <li>have worn it with Bambi, Amber (Gorgeous my very favorite)and Bianca ...</li>
            <li>It makes your lips feel cool, not burning!</li>
            <li>It is beautiful crimson color, with almost no shimmer (I don&#x27;t see any on the lips, just a tiny dots in the container).</li>
            <li>/&gt;they will work fine.  </li>
            <li>&quot; online is all that accurate.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased Buxom Lips in Bambi, and I&#x27;m quite happy with the product&#x27;s look and feel.</li>
            <li>Fantastic colors</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>I love BE products and this is not disappointing.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, I&#x27;m hooked on these now!</li>
            <li>It smells great, not overpoweringly sweet, just a light sweet vanilla scent and it feels really good when you put it on (kind of tingly and chilly).</li>
            <li>I have used Diamonique, ( sparkly clear) , Carmen ( mauvey plum) and Vanessa ( rich red) and am very impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li>For value-to-price, the tube is quite large and elegant looking.</li>
            <li>but if your looking for a subtle gloss that smells great and gives your lips a nice chilled feeling this is the gloss for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had anything make my lips look so good (not only in color</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any true plumping power, but the glossy shine makes lips appear fuller.  </li>
            <li>My lips felt cool and there was no burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>I find it very flattering on me and love how it feels on and the color that results.  </li>
            <li>I feel the mild burn/tingle, but no difference in my lips appearance.  </li>
            <li>Dolly goes on much more sheer where as the Clinique lip gloss is more opaque.  </li>
            <li>Most of my lip glosses are mauve, and more natural (like Clair-nice color but too much glitter for me).  </li>
            <li>I trust the Bare Escentuals line and own a LOT of their products.  </li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s a radical difference other than you have now applied a nice shiny color to your lips</li>
            <li>This gloss leaves your lips feeling cool and fresh for hours.  </li>
            <li>I am new to the world of gloss and haven&#x27;t tried that many brands</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;ve never been into lip gloss before this!</li>
            <li>The applicator is easy to use, and larger than most.</li>
            <li>I love ID, so naturally I wanted to try their lip product.</li>
            <li>I tried three different ones and they were all nice.</li>
            <li>It looks that dark like on the picture only in the tube, on the lips color is very vibrant and lighter (but not neony), great sexy color for day and night look (I have brown hair, sometimes with highlights and light to medium complexion).</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals Buxom gloss lasts for what seems like hours and it gives your lips a beautful fullness and sexy color that lasts through eating, drinking, etc.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t see much more plumpness of my lips but that doesn&#x27;t mean it wont work for you.  </li>
            <li>Almost like drinking very chilled water, but not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>I want to try maybe Cherry or some other bolder color, but so far Betty works great.</li>
            <li>I have bought far too many beauty products over the years, most of which do not live up to the expectations in my head.  </li>
            <li>There are many lip glosses I like for different reasons.</li>
            <li>trixie is a nice pink sparkle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that BE finally came out with this gloss.  </li>
            <li>The colors are all really pretty.</li>
            <li>I have since ordered and waiting for Pretty  to arrive ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white, but had an asian friend try it and she loved it too.</li>
            <li>One thing that is worth noting though is that since the lip glosses are a bit sheer the color variations between one and another are not as significant as one might think as I learned when testing them at sephora.    </li>
            <li>colors seem pretty true on website but if you go to the bare escentuals homepage they give color descriptions.</li>
            <li>would hope though, that Bare Esensuals would develop a more natural version of this gloss, in reading the ingredients I do wonder about all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>but it really does make them plump)I</li>
            <li>The Bambi shade is a bit more coral colored than I&#x27;d expected</li>
            <li>(I thought it&#x27;d be more of a pink), but I like nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve tried that you know it stings like a mother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any plumping just the gentle tingling, The gloss does make you unkissable too, because of the inherent stickiness factor...</li>
            <li>I really could not use.  </li>
            <li>The gloss has NOT been sticky for me because you dont&#x27; need to apply that much.  </li>
            <li>It really does seem to plump up your lips.  </li>
            <li>I just feel like the gloss wears off really, really fast.</li>
            <li>i have been looking for a good lipgloss that was colored, but not too pink or red.</li>
            <li>it was like my natural lip color, only more vibrant.</li>
            <li>The gloss didn&#x27;t look cheap and tacky on and weird as it sounds, the product was almost cool and refreshing to put on.  </li>
            <li>I think my lips look a bit fuller, but it is due more to the shine than anything.   </li>
            <li>I bought \\&quot;Brandi\\&quot; only because it was my name, and even spelled right!</li>
            <li>A good purchase, although the color swatches are slightly off, unless you&#x27;re an ice blonde</li>
            <li>Less tacky than most glosses.  </li>
            <li>My husband has complimented my lips at least a dozen times since I started using this gloss and he loves the fact that the gloss is not sticky-tacky like most lip glosses (nor does it smear on his lips like a lipstick when he kisses me!).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it if you like a gloss.</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel refreshing when you put it on, but it stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of the best brands available on Sephora and been generally unhappy with what was available out there -- even the priciest stuff -- because the gloss was too sticky and/or the color went on unevenly and lasted for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>and the tube is pretty big.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much from a lip gloss, but Clinique&#x27;s Superbalm and regular Carmex seems to have a lot more \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; after a few hours than this one.</li>
            <li>on me... and feels cool, not burning like other lip plumping gloss.</li>
            <li>Whether you like this will largely be a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li>I have this in the clear shade with sparkle, Dominique.  </li>
            <li>and they are soft when I&#x27;m not using this.</li>
            <li>It does, however, give your lips a light tingling feeling that lasts for a few minutes.    </li>
            <li>This companies&#x27; products have worked well for me in our hot, dry climate.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting, shiny, great little applicator brush, scent is sort of vanillaish, and they give a long lasting cooling/tingling sensation to the lips.</li>
            <li>It is rich and long lasting, but very sheer.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it</li>
            <li>it also last pretty long and is not heavy nor too liquidy or dry felling like others.</li>

            <li> Bare Escentuals Buxom gloss lasts for what seems like hours and it gives your lips a beautful fullness and sexy color that lasts through eating, drinking, etc.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see much more plumpness of my lips but that doesn&#x27;t mean it wont work for you.  </li>
            <li> Almost like drinking very chilled water, but not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I want to try maybe Cherry or some other bolder color, but so far Betty works great.</li>
            <li> I have bought far too many beauty products over the years, most of which do not live up to the expectations in my head.  </li>
            <li> There are many lip glosses I like for different reasons.</li>
            <li> trixie is a nice pink sparkle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that BE finally came out with this gloss.  </li>
            <li> The colors are all really pretty.</li>
            <li> I have since ordered and waiting for Pretty  to arrive ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white, but had an asian friend try it and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> One thing that is worth noting though is that since the lip glosses are a bit sheer the color variations between one and another are not as significant as one might think as I learned when testing them at sephora.    </li>
            <li> colors seem pretty true on website but if you go to the bare escentuals homepage they give color descriptions.</li>
            <li> would hope though, that Bare Esensuals would develop a more natural version of this gloss, in reading the ingredients I do wonder about all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> but it really does make them plump)I</li>
            <li> The Bambi shade is a bit more coral colored than I&#x27;d expected</li>
            <li> (I thought it&#x27;d be more of a pink), but I like nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve tried that you know it stings like a mother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any plumping just the gentle tingling, The gloss does make you unkissable too, because of the inherent stickiness factor...</li>
            <li> I really could not use.  </li>
            <li> The gloss has NOT been sticky for me because you dont&#x27; need to apply that much.  </li>
            <li> It really does seem to plump up your lips.  </li>
            <li> I just feel like the gloss wears off really, really fast.</li>
            <li> i have been looking for a good lipgloss that was colored, but not too pink or red.</li>
            <li> it was like my natural lip color, only more vibrant.</li>
            <li> The gloss didn&#x27;t look cheap and tacky on and weird as it sounds, the product was almost cool and refreshing to put on.  </li>
            <li> I think my lips look a bit fuller, but it is due more to the shine than anything.   </li>
            <li> I bought \\&quot;Brandi\\&quot; only because it was my name, and even spelled right!</li>
            <li> A good purchase, although the color swatches are slightly off, unless you&#x27;re an ice blonde</li>
            <li> Less tacky than most glosses.  </li>
            <li> My husband has complimented my lips at least a dozen times since I started using this gloss and he loves the fact that the gloss is not sticky-tacky like most lip glosses (nor does it smear on his lips like a lipstick when he kisses me!).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it if you like a gloss.</li>
            <li> Not only does it feel refreshing when you put it on, but it stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of the best brands available on Sephora and been generally unhappy with what was available out there -- even the priciest stuff -- because the gloss was too sticky and/or the color went on unevenly and lasted for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> and the tube is pretty big.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much from a lip gloss, but Clinique&#x27;s Superbalm and regular Carmex seems to have a lot more \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; after a few hours than this one.</li>
            <li> on me... and feels cool, not burning like other lip plumping gloss.</li>
            <li> Whether you like this will largely be a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li> I have this in the clear shade with sparkle, Dominique.  </li>
            <li> and they are soft when I&#x27;m not using this.</li>
            <li> It does, however, give your lips a light tingling feeling that lasts for a few minutes.    </li>
            <li> This companies&#x27; products have worked well for me in our hot, dry climate.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting, shiny, great little applicator brush, scent is sort of vanillaish, and they give a long lasting cooling/tingling sensation to the lips.</li>
            <li> It is rich and long lasting, but very sheer.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it</li>
            <li> it also last pretty long and is not heavy nor too liquidy or dry felling like others.</li>
            <li> This color makes my not really huge lips stand out, and they appear much fuller.</li>
            <li> , that didn&#x27;t feel gloppy,  though if you like something with a little more moisturizer, a little less glam, this is probably not your cup of tea...</li>
            <li> The caramel-scented gloss is not thick or gloopy - just a little does the trick and</li>
            <li> My other pet peeve is that too many glosses are *too* sheer, with no color at all or such faint color that you have to reapply constantly to get any pigmentation on your lips.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> I will definitely be trying other shades once I run out of the Amber.</li>
            <li> it looks really natural and pretty, not super glossy or a weird off-shade color.</li>
            <li> again because I don&#x27;t put on enough to have a mess.  </li>
            <li> Just a LITTLE darker than they actually appear--</li>
            <li> You only need a little.</li>
            <li> Only problem was that the container cracked a few months after I bought it, but it could just be me, I&#x27;m rought on the products that go everywhere with me.</li>
            <li> they are not too sheer nor too heavy on the color.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, my lips were noticeably fuller and that lasted for several hours.  </li>
            <li> As far as the plumping goes, it is definitely subtle.  </li>
            <li> It is frustrating, and one of the main reasons I tend to stay away from glosses...</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than collagen, and real-looking, not fake!    </li>
            <li> all where lip glosses go, I guess this is probably average..</li>
            <li> brandi is  too dark for my taste as a gloss.</li>
            <li> Even though the color swatches are a bit off, I find they do not look as dark on as I would imagine.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to trying some other shades!</li>
            <li> even though its a little pricey.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really suggest anything at the moment, I&#x27;m balm crazy...</li>
            <li> offen have trouble with picking lip colors.</li>
            <li> The gloss is advertised as a limp plumper</li>
            <li> Very odd and  </li>
            <li> then when I get the hair off my face, my hair is covered with the sticky mess!  </li>
            <li> So I was not suprised when I tried it and noticed that my lips did not magically grow in volume.  </li>
            <li> I usually just used Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and that was it.</li>
            <li> I swear this gloss plumps my lips up to about twice their usual size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plumping lip glosses before and the thing that made this one different is that the plumping wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I notice it.  </li>
            <li> I am sort of hooked on these glosses lately.</li>
            <li> This gloss smells like chocolate, the color is subtle, and it makes your lips tingle.  </li>
            <li> The colors are all really pretty, but if you hate re-applying your gloss all day long, I think you might be disappointed.     </li>
            <li> much less painful then say DuWop&#x27;s venom...</li>
            <li> When I purchased this set, I was trying to save money over the larger Buxom lip polishes, but I was very disappointed in the colors.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> There are many lip glosses I like for different reasons. Although they always have some flaws (smell or consistency etc). Buxom lip gloss has 2 minuses for me-smell and tingly cold feeling. That is subjective and some people might love that. But overall I like this gloss especially in Betty. It is beautiful crimson color, with almost no shimmer (I don&#x27;t see any on the lips, just a tiny dots in the container). This color makes my not really huge lips stand out, and they appear much fuller. Most of my lip glosses are mauve, and more natural (like Clair-nice color but too much glitter for me).  So not every lip gloss will make every lips look bigger (even though the shine helps), but also make the lisp visible with bolder color will do the trick.  I want to try maybe Cherry or some other bolder color, but so far Betty works great. It looks that dark like on the picture only in the tube, on the lips color is very vibrant and lighter (but not neony), great sexy color for day and night look (I have brown hair, sometimes with highlights and light to medium complexion).</li>
            <li> This companies&#x27; products have worked well for me in our hot, dry climate.  They keep shine where it&#x27;s supposed to be and a finished matte look everywhere else.  I had high expectations for this product and was not disappointed. For value-to-price, the tube is quite large and elegant looking. The gloss didn&#x27;t look cheap and tacky on and weird as it sounds, the product was almost cool and refreshing to put on.  Almost like drinking very chilled water, but not unpleasant.  A good purchase, although the color swatches are slightly off, unless you&#x27;re an ice blonde&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they will work fine.  Just a LITTLE darker than they actually appear--</li>
            <li> I love ID, so naturally I wanted to try their lip product. I&#x27;ve never had anything make my lips look so good (not only in color but it really does make them plump)I offen have trouble with picking lip colors. I got Amber and loved it. I&#x27;m white, but had an asian friend try it and she loved it too. Only problem was that the container cracked a few months after I bought it, but it could just be me, I&#x27;m rought on the products that go everywhere with me.</li>
            <li> I bought \\&quot;Brandi\\&quot; only because it was my name, and even spelled right! I have always bought any makeup named brandi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, it was a GREAT color! i have been looking for a good lipgloss that was colored, but not too pink or red. it was like my natural lip color, only more vibrant. it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Buxom Lips in Bambi, and I&#x27;m quite happy with the product&#x27;s look and feel. The Bambi shade is a bit more coral colored than I&#x27;d expected (I thought it&#x27;d be more of a pink), but I like nonetheless.  The caramel-scented gloss is not thick or gloopy - just a little does the trick and my lips feel moisturized after each use.  The tingle on your lips is refreshing, not overpowering.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any true plumping power, but the glossy shine makes lips appear fuller.  Good product.  I look forward to trying some other shades!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally not a big fan of glosses, because they tend to be too shiny and too sticky.  This one is not very different, it goes on gloppy and sticky, if my hair gets blown by the wind, to my face... its sticking to my lips like I&#x27;ve got honey on them... then when I get the hair off my face, my hair is covered with the sticky mess!  It is frustrating, and one of the main reasons I tend to stay away from glosses... It does have a numbing/tingling effect, much less painful then say DuWop&#x27;s venom... if you&#x27;ve tried that you know it stings like a mother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any plumping just the gentle tingling, The gloss does make you unkissable too, because of the inherent stickiness factor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all where lip glosses go, I guess this is probably average.. I know I&#x27;ve had better ones, that didn&#x27;t feel gloppy,  though if you like something with a little more moisturizer, a little less glam, this is probably not your cup of tea... keep looking... so I can&#x27;t really suggest anything at the moment, I&#x27;m balm crazy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though...&lt;br /&gt;Avon does have a tinted lip gloss palette that I&#x27;ve enjoyed... shiny and moisturizing with a hint of tint... no lip plumping though...</li>
            <li> When I purchased this set, I was trying to save money over the larger Buxom lip polishes, but I was very disappointed in the colors.  Very odd and  ones I really could not use.  I gave most of them away.</li>
            <li> I have tried every lip plumper on the market (no joke) and this is the best (besides pure cinnamon leaf oil, which burns like hell).  I use B.E. products and I bought a couple of these bc I liked the colors.  I was not expecting it to work as well as it did.  Now it is all I use on my lips! It makes your lips feel cool, not burning!</li>
            <li> i purchased this lip gloss at the store as well as online. they are not too sheer nor too heavy on the color. colors seem pretty true on website but if you go to the bare escentuals homepage they give color descriptions. dolly is a nice pinkish mauve color that makes a great nude or slightly natural look on olive or darker skinned complexions . would be great for summer. doesnt burn, plumps lips enough to satisfy ones craving , minty-like tingly feeling, no burning. it also last pretty long and is not heavy nor too liquidy or dry felling like others. trixie is a nice pink sparkle. brandi is  too dark for my taste as a gloss. good buy. finally a lip plumper that works. not going to give you cosmetic results though.</li>
            <li> I just received my buxom lips in the mail today. Cute packaging! Generous amount of product, too. I only wish I had picked a different color. I dont think the \\&quot;color swatch\\&quot; online is all that accurate. I&#x27;d buy it again though..even though its a little pricey. I trust the Bare Escentuals line and own a LOT of their products.  It tingles, and thats kind of a sexy feeling! Lisa in CT</li>
            <li> I am sort of hooked on these glosses lately. I have used Diamonique, ( sparkly clear) , Carmen ( mauvey plum) and Vanessa ( rich red) and am very impressed with the quality. Long lasting, shiny, great little applicator brush, scent is sort of vanillaish, and they give a long lasting cooling/tingling sensation to the lips. I dont think they actually plump in any way, but the sparkly shine gives the illusion of fullness. I have always been a lipstick lover, but now I am a fan of these glosses.&lt;br /&gt;I would hope though, that Bare Esensuals would develop a more natural version of this gloss, in reading the ingredients I do wonder about all the chemicals. However, all in all, I do enjoy these a lot!</li>
            <li> I tried this gloss in vain thinking that my already very full lips would somehow magically inflate.  I honestly didn&#x27;t see much more plumpness of my lips but that doesn&#x27;t mean it wont work for you.  I think someone with thinner lips would see a bigger difference.      However, I do have several of these glosses in different colors because I like it as a gloss.  The colors are awesome and it stays on for a long time.  The gloss has NOT been sticky for me because you dont&#x27; need to apply that much.  I&#x27;ve never had my hair stick to it (and my hair is to my mid butt) again because I don&#x27;t put on enough to have a mess.  You only need a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that BE finally came out with this gloss.  My sister got this in a gift set.  I wanted my own (just the gloss) and I got it off of ebay.  This gloss smells like chocolate, the color is subtle, and it makes your lips tingle.  The color doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but my lips look great with Dolly and they are soft when I&#x27;m not using this.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever tried. Not only does it feel refreshing when you put it on, but it stays on for a long time. My favorite color is Dolly. It really is the BEST!</li>
            <li> This gloss leaves your lips feeling cool and fresh for hours.  Even after eating I could still feel the cooling effect.  I bought this gloss for the beautiful color (Brandi), fresh smell, and cool tingly sensation it gives my lips; not for plumping.  So I was not suprised when I tried it and noticed that my lips did not magically grow in volume.  Go figure.    I gave this product four stars because it doesn&#x27;t actually do what it advertises, it doesn&#x27;t plump your lips.</li>
            <li> Fantastic colors and I love the texture.   BE seem to know how to make gloss not so sticky.  Does it plump?  Well I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s a radical difference other than you have now applied a nice shiny color to your lips and you notice them more.   I wouldn&#x27;t expect a miracle to happen but the shades are great and it&#x27;s not all goopy.</li>
            <li> this stuff is just what the title says. I got a deluxe sample in Dolly, and will soon purchase the full size. The color is a perfect pinky nude... on me... and feels cool, not burning like other lip plumping gloss. And the SMELL! oh man. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of gloss and haven&#x27;t tried that many brands but this is definitely on my keeper list. If you want something that plumps I would look elsewhere but if your looking for a subtle gloss that smells great and gives your lips a nice chilled feeling this is the gloss for you.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t see this lip gloss plumping my lips, it really gives them great shine, makes them tingle, smells delicious and makes my lips feel all minty and fresh. I got the Amber color in a kit and while it isn&#x27;t the perfect shade for me, I wear it all of the time because it moisturizes my lips with no drying effect afterwards and it smells so delicious (almost like baked cookies)! I will definitely be trying other shades once I run out of the Amber. It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it and the tube is pretty big.</li>
            <li> I have two of the BE&#x27;s Buxom Lips that I received with kits I purchased.  I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any plumping.  I feel the mild burn/tingle, but no difference in my lips appearance.  These glosses smell wonderful and their texture is nice too.  I think Urban Decay&#x27;s plumper works the best for plumping, out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ve never been into lip gloss before this! I usually just used Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and that was it. My best friend had this in \\&quot;Bambi\\&quot; and I tried it one day and fell in love! It smells great, not overpoweringly sweet, just a light sweet vanilla scent and it feels really good when you put it on (kind of tingly and chilly). Definitely worth the price, I&#x27;m hooked on these now! I&#x27;m Asian and I got it in \\&quot;Bambi\\&quot;...it looks really natural and pretty, not super glossy or a weird off-shade color.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of products that claimed to be lip plumpers (some at double the cost of this product), but this is the only one that actually works for me. You can feel the tingle as soon as you apply it. The applicator is easy to use, and larger than most.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Buxom lip gloss is truly the best lip gloss out there: the colors are sheer but provide the perfect amount of coverage, the consistency is not sticky and the color goes on perfectly evenly on your lips, and the lip-plumping works magical wonders! My husband has complimented my lips at least a dozen times since I started using this gloss and he loves the fact that the gloss is not sticky-tacky like most lip glosses (nor does it smear on his lips like a lipstick when he kisses me!). I swear this gloss plumps my lips up to about twice their usual size. Much less expensive than collagen, and real-looking, not fake!    I have tried a number of the best brands available on Sephora and been generally unhappy with what was available out there -- even the priciest stuff -- because the gloss was too sticky and/or the color went on unevenly and lasted for a few seconds. My other pet peeve is that too many glosses are *too* sheer, with no color at all or such faint color that you have to reapply constantly to get any pigmentation on your lips. Bare Escentuals Buxom gloss lasts for what seems like hours and it gives your lips a beautful fullness and sexy color that lasts through eating, drinking, etc. You will not be dsappointed with this gloss.</li>
            <li> I have this in the clear shade with sparkle, Dominique.  I&#x27;ve used plumping lip glosses before and the thing that made this one different is that the plumping wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  My lips felt cool and there was no burning sensation.  The gloss went on smooth, wasn&#x27;t sticky, and also had a nice scent.  After a few minutes, my lips were noticeably fuller and that lasted for several hours.  This is the best plumping gloss I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to plump up your lips.  Less tacky than most glosses.  It&#x27;s ok and I do wear it more than most of my glosses but the one thing that turns me off is that I feel a \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling when I put it on.  I am still searching for \\&quot;something better\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have bought far too many beauty products over the years, most of which do not live up to the expectations in my head.  In this case, this lip gloss does and I fully understand why it was awarded \\&quot;Best of Sephora.\\&quot;  One of the biggest complaints for me is when lip glosses feel too sticky when on.  This glides on beautifully and has a wonderful satin-like feel.  The color is also nice.  It is rich and long lasting, but very sheer.  Even though the color swatches are a bit off, I find they do not look as dark on as I would imagine.  For example, I have Dolly as well as a Clinique lip gloss that looks like almost the same shade.  Dolly goes on much more sheer where as the Clinique lip gloss is more opaque.  Whether you like this will largely be a matter of personal preference.  However, I prefer a more natural look and am also very fair skinned so this is preferable to me.  One thing that is worth noting though is that since the lip glosses are a bit sheer the color variations between one and another are not as significant as one might think as I learned when testing them at sephora.    As far as the plumping goes, it is definitely subtle.  I&#x27;m not sure I notice it.  However, this was not the reason I bought the lip gloss (the color was) so I don&#x27;t mind.  It does, however, give your lips a light tingling feeling that lasts for a few minutes.    Overall this is a great lip gloss.  I find it very flattering on me and love how it feels on and the color that results.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked this gloss in some ways and not in others. The colors are all really pretty. I tried three different ones and they were all nice. The gloss is advertised as a limp plumper and I feel that it does that, too. The only problem is the staying power. I just feel like the gloss wears off really, really fast. Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much from a lip gloss, but Clinique&#x27;s Superbalm and regular Carmex seems to have a lot more \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; after a few hours than this one. I felt like I had to constantly re-apply, even when I was just drinking something.    So, here&#x27;s the deal. The colors are all really pretty, but if you hate re-applying your gloss all day long, I think you might be disappointed.

            <li> First, I have to say as a plumper I am not sure what benefit I get but it is the BEST GLOSS I have ever worn ... I wear it with LipFusion&#x27;s LipPlumper Pencil in Buff and love it ... have worn it with Bambi, Amber (Gorgeous my very favorite)and Bianca ... I have since ordered and waiting for Pretty  to arrive ... I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product ... I would highly recommend it if you like a gloss. I have been delighted with the staying power of this the way I wear it ... Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> I love BE products and this is not disappointing. The smell is very nice, \\&quot;Ginger\\&quot; is a beautiful color and the shine is great. The formula does not burn, just gives a nice tingly feeling. I think my lips look a bit fuller, but it is due more to the shine than anything.   Update- I bought the pack of mini Buxom lip glosses and I love them all. I want to update this to 5 stars just for being a great gloss.</li>
