            <li>this is fantastic!</li>
            <li>it took my breath away, so many things in the kit, just one problem</li>

            <li>Daughter love its.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased one</li>
            <li>Love this set .</li>
            <li>This was .much more like a Wal-Mart or K-Mart kit at 3-4 Times the price.</li>
            <li>I love this a lot, it makes a beginner take a sigh of relief</li>
            <li>Not expensive, but good quality.</li>
            <li>I love that its so easy to take on the go.</li>
            <li>i love this kit the compartments are nearly neverending lol.</li>
            <li>There was everything you would ever need and  with the exception of a couple of bright eye shadows, the colors were very neutral</li>
            <li>this has all the natural colors you need and great quality.</li>
            <li>This kit is good for a beginner who wants to buy everything in one shot.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, everything was perfect.</li>
            <li>This is sweet!</li>
            <li>The case seems to come apart easily.</li>
            <li>I love unfolding it and having all of the choices right in front of me!</li>
            <li>I really like this handy kit.</li>
            <li>It was a big hit and got me mega brownie points lol.</li>
            <li>geat product very useful thank you</li>
            <li>I was excited for this product to arrive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much fun deciding what to wear that day!</li>
            <li>This kit is DEFINITALLY worth the price!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for any lazy person because you get everything all in 1.</li>
            <li>Was a perfect gift for my daughter.she loves it.she enjoyed the different choices all in one box.instead of several cases.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just cool</li>
            <li>Even though it has a great amount of make up and wonderful colors, the case is so poorly made that if you carry it by the handle you will never get to use it!!!   </li>
            <li>the super All-in-One edition of the makeup</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to my daughter&#x27;s best friend because they would not take it back when my actual daughter did not like it.</li>
            <li>Super pigmented, super blendable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually overwhelming when you first get it, because there is so much slide out compartments</li>
            <li>but after she looked at it later she fell in love with it and keep it!  </li>
            <li>IT COMES WITH SO MUCH!!</li>
            <li>The blushers are my favourite part of this kit, because there such lovely shades!</li>
            <li>after much searching we decided on this, she thought it was fantastic</li>
            <li>It is definately worth the money it costs.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I suggest is a nice set of brushes to go with it.</li>
            <li>just right or</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are very very pigmented</li>
            <li>I was in love with all the different items that came inside of it.</li>
            <li>this is mostly for someone starting to use makeup..</li>
            <li>And always fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>they are small, with tiny brushes and not the best quality.</li>
            <li>Got it for the wife and it was not the one she exactly wanted</li>
            <li>I love this kit, it&#x27;s the only thing I reach for these days!</li>
            <li>and its very convenient for its size!</li>
            <li>The carrying case fell apart the first time I picked it up, causing all the makeup to fall everywhere and shatter.</li>
            <li>Bought this for the misses for valentines day gift.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and was very surprised to receive such a nice set.</li>
            <li>The make up brushes were a little on the cheap side but would work just fine.  </li>
            <li>this little kit gives you the ability to create many looks for many different skin tones.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this to anyone who wants an all in one kit</li>
            <li>Has everything you will ever need, Haven&#x27;t used much yet</li>
            <li>The cost point is reasonable for the quality and quantity you receive.</li>
            <li>This is such a fantastic set, well priced and Fast fast shipping</li>
            <li>and i think they will be breaking very soon.</li>
            <li>I keep it ready to travel.  </li>
            <li>but i really dont mind that i just love every other aspect of it ...</li>
            <li>Everything is very pigmented and high quality.</li>
            <li>The handle gave way and the kit broke in half and when it fell the make-up broke into many pieces.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this palette!!</li>
            <li>I normally would return it</li>
            <li>love it so much, just that I am not sure what is the make up ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li>Something different, but useful.</li>
            <li>The case is really cool, also the eye shadows and the foundations are very pigmented, but the eyeshadows shade very easy and its sucks because if you use one color then that color flakes on the other colors because how close they are, the eyeliner and mascara dont work very well at all...</li>
            <li>Got a new one, it broke.</li>
            <li>Was a Christmas gift to my daughter-in-law, she is still finding new things and new ways to use this gift.</li>
            <li>This set will work for young and older women.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow what a pro make set!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>when open, it&#x27;s quite large and contains EVERYTHING you need.</li>
            <li>Includes a lot of colors, everything you&#x27;ll need for a complete make up kit.</li>
            <li>so over all the only thing you can really use is the lip stuff.</li>
            <li>Case broke after a week of gentle use, and the entire set goes from &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;cumbersome&amp;#34; once it falls apart.</li>
            <li>I didnt even know there was a rouge drawer until 3 days later haha</li>
            <li>Bought this for my girlfriends 13 year old daughter who dances 3 to 4 days a week and is always on the go</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 only because the drawers don&#x27;t slide smoothly and takes a little nudging to get them to open . . .</li>
            <li>It arrived fine, however when I tried to open it after only three times of previous use, the entire kit fell apart in my hands.</li>
            <li>it was actually much nicers than I expected.</li>
            <li>At first it maybe a little hectic because all you see is makeup everywhere..</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only thing you need to be aware of, if you are a latina the liquid make-up will make you look too pale.</li>

            <li> so if you&#x27;re darker you wont be able to use it</li>
            <li> I am so glad this make up kit was a winner.</li>
            <li> Recommended for husbands that aren&#x27;t sure of what to buy for</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Daughter love its.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased one</li>
            <li> Love this set .</li>
            <li> This was .much more like a Wal-Mart or K-Mart kit at 3-4 Times the price.</li>
            <li> I love this a lot, it makes a beginner take a sigh of relief</li>
            <li> Not expensive, but good quality.</li>
            <li> I love that its so easy to take on the go.</li>
            <li> i love this kit the compartments are nearly neverending lol.</li>
            <li> There was everything you would ever need and  with the exception of a couple of bright eye shadows, the colors were very neutral</li>
            <li> this has all the natural colors you need and great quality.</li>
            <li> This kit is good for a beginner who wants to buy everything in one shot.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> This is sweet!</li>
            <li> The case seems to come apart easily.</li>
            <li> I love unfolding it and having all of the choices right in front of me!</li>
            <li> I really like this handy kit.</li>
            <li> It was a big hit and got me mega brownie points lol.</li>
            <li> geat product very useful thank you</li>
            <li> I was excited for this product to arrive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much fun deciding what to wear that day!</li>
            <li> This kit is DEFINITALLY worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for any lazy person because you get everything all in 1.</li>
            <li> Was a perfect gift for my daughter.she loves it.she enjoyed the different choices all in one box.instead of several cases.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just cool</li>
            <li> Even though it has a great amount of make up and wonderful colors, the case is so poorly made that if you carry it by the handle you will never get to use it!!!   </li>
            <li> the super All-in-One edition of the makeup</li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to my daughter&#x27;s best friend because they would not take it back when my actual daughter did not like it.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented, super blendable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually overwhelming when you first get it, because there is so much slide out compartments</li>
            <li> but after she looked at it later she fell in love with it and keep it!  </li>
            <li> IT COMES WITH SO MUCH!!</li>
            <li> The blushers are my favourite part of this kit, because there such lovely shades!</li>
            <li> after much searching we decided on this, she thought it was fantastic</li>
            <li> It is definately worth the money it costs.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I suggest is a nice set of brushes to go with it.</li>
            <li> just right or</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are very very pigmented</li>
            <li> I was in love with all the different items that came inside of it.</li>
            <li> this is mostly for someone starting to use makeup..</li>
            <li> And always fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> they are small, with tiny brushes and not the best quality.</li>
            <li> Got it for the wife and it was not the one she exactly wanted</li>
            <li> I love this kit, it&#x27;s the only thing I reach for these days!</li>
            <li> and its very convenient for its size!</li>
            <li> The carrying case fell apart the first time I picked it up, causing all the makeup to fall everywhere and shatter.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the misses for valentines day gift.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and was very surprised to receive such a nice set.</li>
            <li> The make up brushes were a little on the cheap side but would work just fine.  </li>
            <li> this little kit gives you the ability to create many looks for many different skin tones.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this to anyone who wants an all in one kit</li>
            <li> Has everything you will ever need, Haven&#x27;t used much yet</li>
            <li> The cost point is reasonable for the quality and quantity you receive.</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic set, well priced and Fast fast shipping</li>
            <li> and i think they will be breaking very soon.</li>
            <li> I keep it ready to travel.  </li>
            <li> but i really dont mind that i just love every other aspect of it ...</li>
            <li> Everything is very pigmented and high quality.</li>
            <li> The handle gave way and the kit broke in half and when it fell the make-up broke into many pieces.</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this palette!!</li>
            <li> I normally would return it</li>
            <li> love it so much, just that I am not sure what is the make up ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li> Something different, but useful.</li>
            <li> The case is really cool, also the eye shadows and the foundations are very pigmented, but the eyeshadows shade very easy and its sucks because if you use one color then that color flakes on the other colors because how close they are, the eyeliner and mascara dont work very well at all...</li>
            <li> Got a new one, it broke.</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas gift to my daughter-in-law, she is still finding new things and new ways to use this gift.</li>
            <li> This set will work for young and older women.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow what a pro make set!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> when open, it&#x27;s quite large and contains EVERYTHING you need.</li>
            <li> Includes a lot of colors, everything you&#x27;ll need for a complete make up kit.</li>
            <li> so over all the only thing you can really use is the lip stuff.</li>
            <li> Case broke after a week of gentle use, and the entire set goes from &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;cumbersome&amp;#34; once it falls apart.</li>
            <li> I didnt even know there was a rouge drawer until 3 days later haha</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriends 13 year old daughter who dances 3 to 4 days a week and is always on the go</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 only because the drawers don&#x27;t slide smoothly and takes a little nudging to get them to open . . .</li>
            <li> It arrived fine, however when I tried to open it after only three times of previous use, the entire kit fell apart in my hands.</li>
            <li> it was actually much nicers than I expected.</li>
            <li> At first it maybe a little hectic because all you see is makeup everywhere..</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing you need to be aware of, if you are a latina the liquid make-up will make you look too pale.</li>
            <li> It looks small but all of the pans are quite large.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the only complaint which isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> All of this makeup will last you a very long time!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about makeup but at least that&#x27;s what my cousin told me.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not professional.</li>
            <li> , it will seriously last you forever, as long as you dont get too used to one color of each item!!!!</li>
            <li> When closed, it is compact but</li>
            <li> Other thanthat, this is my treasure chest.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying any other makeup, this kit has all you will ever need.</li>
            <li> I am not going to get any other separate product for some while .</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> The kit was complete but the quality was poor.  </li>
            <li> I had this product for LESS THAN 24 HOURS</li>
            <li> She actually asked me to take back the expensive MAC cosmetics that I had also bought her.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of everything all in one area.</li>
            <li> she did say it was a little sticky on the slide-outs</li>
            <li> a little girls make up set</li>
            <li> My only tiny disappointment would be the nail paints..</li>
            <li> it came broken and looks like an empty nail polish</li>
            <li> The kit got everything you need in a small travel size case.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken and received a phone call at 10:30 pm asking to take my negative feedback down.  </li>
            <li> Look at all your selection to choose from and it is so small and compact in this carrying case!</li>
            <li> It was so bad that Amazon offered me a partial discount, which at least covered my shipping</li>
            <li> Any beauty fanatic would be in heaven with this kit!</li>
            <li> and it broke because of POOR QUALITY OF THE STRUCTURE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this would be</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed and cannot reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> This was one of the worst makeup kits I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> A horrible piece of merchandise.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Everything came perfect except for the powder. It was all over the make-up kit when I got it. But other than that, everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered on time and packaged great, no damages. I bought this for my fiancee and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She loved it.  One of the pull out shelves immediately broke so it will not stay attached to the case.  She brought it with her today and the top is now off and will not reattach.  I normally would return it but my granddaughter does not want to be without the makeup.  I&#x27;m sorry but I can not recommend this product.  It was not mistreated.</li>
            <li> This kit literally has everything you need to do makeup for you and everyone you know (lol). It&#x27;s actually overwhelming when you first get it, because there is so much slide out compartments that you&#x27;re sort of like..when does it stop? Everything is very pigmented and high quality. There are beautiful blushers and bronzers included. The brushes aren&#x27;t the best, but they work in a pinch. This kit folds up pretty small, but when opened, takes up a lot of space. I love it!</li>
            <li> Good variety of make up stuff. This was a xmas gift and the wife love it. Glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> This was one of the worst makeup kits I have ever purchased. It arrived fine, however when I tried to open it after only three times of previous use, the entire kit fell apart in my hands. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This beauty case is amazing. I bought it as a gift for my Cousins marriage and she loved it so did all the guests. This is a nice beauty case containing everything a girl need. I don&#x27;t know much about makeup but at least that&#x27;s what my cousin told me.</li>
            <li> after much searching we decided on this, she thought it was fantastic it was laid out well with everything she needed</li>
            <li> i just receive my make up kit today it wasnt in the best shape like first the thing to hold it close it came broken and looks like an empty nail polish but i really dont mind that i just love every other aspect of it ... i would recommend it as a play around make up set but i do love it</li>
            <li> Includes a lot of colors, everything you&#x27;ll need for a complete make up kit. I purchased for my 10-year-old but was impressed that it could be for any age woman. When closed, it is compact but when open, it&#x27;s quite large and contains EVERYTHING you need. I gave it a 4 only because the drawers don&#x27;t slide smoothly and takes a little nudging to get them to open . . . that&#x27;s the only complaint which isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> I ordered this make up kit for my Daughter. I was very pleased when I received it and my daughter was very delighted too with the quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to a $250 make-up kit that my make-up/special effects artist said we needed. She loved it!</li>
            <li> Bought it, it broke. Got a new one, it broke. The case seems to come apart easily. Make up is nice though.</li>
            <li> I was excited for this product to arrive. I was in love with all the different items that came inside of it. After removing it from the packaging, I carried it BY THE HANDLE and it IMMEDIATELY broke!!!!!!!  The handle gave way and the kit broke in half and when it fell the make-up broke into many pieces. I had this product for LESS THAN 24 HOURS and it broke because of POOR QUALITY OF THE STRUCTURE. Even though it has a great amount of make up and wonderful colors, the case is so poorly made that if you carry it by the handle you will never get to use it!!!   I am really disappointed and cannot reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas gift to my daughter-in-law, she is still finding new things and new ways to use this gift.</li>
            <li> The case is really cool, also the eye shadows and the foundations are very pigmented, but the eyeshadows shade very easy and its sucks because if you use one color then that color flakes on the other colors because how close they are, the eyeliner and mascara dont work very well at all... so over all the only thing you can really use is the lip stuff. i will never buy a makeup case like this again..this is mostly for someone starting to use makeup..</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the make up artist on the go!!!  Great products, wonderful quality!  And always fast shipping!  I will be telling others about this great find.</li>
            <li> i love this kit the compartments are nearly neverending lol. This has everything in it you need to look your best.</li>
            <li> I really like this handy kit. It has a little bit of everything all in one area. I love that its so easy to take on the go. I really recommend this to anyone who wants an all in one kit</li>
            <li> This is sweet! I love unfolding it and having all of the choices right in front of me! It&#x27;s so much fun deciding what to wear that day! perfect size too!</li>
            <li> The kit was complete but the quality was poor.  My wife made me return it. I was a gift for her.</li>
            <li> Everything that I needed for makeup is in it, the super All-in-One edition of the makeup palette.&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much, just that I am not sure what is the make up ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;well, this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this. She actually asked me to take back the expensive MAC cosmetics that I had also bought her. She loves all of the items included. So many compartments. it was actually much nicers than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this make up case.  There was everything you would ever need and  with the exception of a couple of bright eye shadows, the colors were very neutral so just about anyone could wear them.  The make up brushes were a little on the cheap side but would work just fine.  If you are looking for an all in one make up kit, this would be one to consider.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she received it and loved it. It has everything in it and she says she&#x27;s thrilled.</li>
            <li> Case broke after a week of gentle use, and the entire set goes from &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;cumbersome&amp;#34; once it falls apart.</li>
            <li> My daughter and daughter in law are make-up divas! They were so happy to get an All In One carry case they can take with them where ever they go... Good quality make up too!</li>
            <li> Has everything you will ever need, Haven&#x27;t used much yet but I feel like a kid at Christmas!  Very Happy with this product!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend like this product. It has many choices and has good quality. It was a good gift for her.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product, and with a great price tag!!  you save 44% on it, and there is EVERY THING!!! I got it as a gift from my grad mother, best thing she has given me by far. Its really good quality and so well organized.    Get it as a gift, or for your self!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the misses for valentines day gift.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and was very surprised to receive such a nice set.</li>
            <li> this is fantastic! it is just amazing it took my breath away, so many things in the kit, just one problem though is that the cream stuff has only like one color so if you&#x27;re darker you wont be able to use it</li>
            <li> You get everyyyythinnnggg!!!! Look forward tothe eyeshadows they are brilliant..!! I am in love with the foundations.. and rouge.. and lip colors..!! I play around with colors all day!! Lipsticks are nude shades, not the stricking ones. My only tiny disappointment would be the nail paints.. they are small, with tiny brushes and not the best quality. Other thanthat, this is my treasure chest. The case itself is marvelous. I didnt even know there was a rouge drawer until 3 days later haha</li>
            <li> It is great.every thing is in it and quality is so good.</li>
            <li> Got it for the wife and it was not the one she exactly wanted so she said she was going to return it but after she looked at it later she fell in love with it and keep it!  She said it had it all!!!  she did say it was a little sticky on the slide-outs but I think it freed up after she was using it?  I ROCK!!!</li>
            <li> Not very good quality.Not professional.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  Product arrived broken and received a phone call at 10:30 pm asking to take my negative feedback down.  Said they&#x27;d send a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34;.  That was in 2013.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I I ended up giving it to my daughter&#x27;s best friend because they would not take it back when my actual daughter did not like it. Otherwise it was very good quality</li>
            <li> For the money you get a beautiful set of make up.  I&#x27;m not a big make up girl, but when I use it I buy quality.  You get quality, variety and a beautiful easy to store case.  The cost point is reasonable for the quality and quantity you receive.</li>
            <li> I am so glad this make up kit was a winner. I was so happy to see that my wife loved her gift. It was one of her Christmas presents. It came neat in a nice box. The make up box is in the medium range, once opened it has great compartments, when wore it looks great on her. I was afraid this would be a little girls make up set but I was wrong. Recommended for husbands that aren&#x27;t sure of what to buy for they&#x27;re wife&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! All of my eye shadows were perfect! none of them were harmed from shipping! when i received my palette it came with a ton of bubble wrap around it! So there was no possible way of the eye shadows breaking! The eye shadows are very very pigmented which is super good! It comes with a ton of amazing colors! The picture does this palette no justice! The colors are much more richer! I completely recommend this palette!!</li>
            <li> This kit is DEFINITALLY worth the price! it is a beautiful case filled with everything you need and great quality!</li>

            <li> Do not buy this product. Quality is not up to the mark. I won&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Was a perfect gift for my daughter.she loves it.she enjoyed the different choices all in one box.instead of several cases.</li>
            <li> I was so upset about the price of the product versus the quality. This was .much more like a Wal-Mart or K-Mart kit at 3-4 Times the price. It was so bad that Amazon offered me a partial discount, which at least covered my shipping</li>
            <li> this thing is great! I lovve it! the price you can&#x27;t beat for 100 pieces of makeup! lip gloss lipstick eye shadow nail polish blush etc! so perfect!</li>
            <li> this little kit gives you the ability to create many looks for many different skin tones. as the title says, perfect for the beginner freelance make up artist and at a good price.</li>
            <li> this 100 piece makeup collection is perfect for creating a whole face look! and its very convenient for its size!</li>
            <li> Any beauty fanatic would be in heaven with this kit! Look at all your selection to choose from and it is so small and compact in this carrying case! A built in mirror is a plus as well. Wow! Great price and product-great for days of fun!</li>
            <li> This makeup kit has everything you need. I wasn&#x27;t real sure when I ordered it if it would be as nice as it looked.  It is everything it appears to be.  I keep it ready to travel.  It has everything I need while away and that way I&#x27;m not constantly packing and unpacking everything.  I am thinking of ordering another 2-3 for my daughters and a niece all in college. This set will work for young and older women.  It is definately worth the money it costs.  The only thing I suggest is a nice set of brushes to go with it. Linda W.</li>
            <li> You get everything you would need to start doing makeup in this kit, also it comes in a neat shaped carrying case. I love this a lot, it makes a beginner take a sigh of relief so they don&#x27;t have to worry about if they have all the basics or not.</li>
            <li> i like it ,i think it is nice . and  it is convince to carry it where i go to</li>
            <li> The carrying case fell apart the first time I picked it up, causing all the makeup to fall everywhere and shatter. A horrible piece of merchandise. Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> This carry-all is amazing. everything slides together easy.&lt;br /&gt;Also the make-up is very nice, goes on smooth and does not wipe off. (not like cheapy stuff)&lt;br /&gt;Im very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The kit got everything you need in a small travel size case. It got all the colors I need.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you need to be aware of, if you are a latina the liquid make-up will make you look too pale.</li>
