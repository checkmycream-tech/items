            <li>Make sure to evenly distribute around the face. :)</li>
            <li>They get the zinc into the smallest particles they can that are then able to absorb under your skin into your pores and cells.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews and it was suggested that Neutrogena with helioplex is one of the better sunblocks.</li>
            <li>so it shows a bit more) and that gives it room for improvement.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen</li>
            <li>Keeps me safe from sun rays while I enjoy the outdoors!</li>
            <li>Most sunscreen makes me sweat or feels greasy to me.  </li>

            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with the spray version of Neutorgena.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite non-beauty sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a shot and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Be mindful of how it impacts makeup (if you wear it), I used it with drier liquid foundations but didn&#x27;t like it with more watery foundation.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s non-greasy</li>
            <li>all I am satisfied with the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>love the product, upset at how overpriced it is.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is my favorite brand for sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for one that isn&#x27;t quite as greasy feeling, but this stuff sure works.</li>
            <li>The perfect daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal and they work very well.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>i loved it, the price is great, i took my time to find other prices and by far this price is the best</li>
            <li>A pleasure to use, and the absence of scent is very welcome.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but not overpowering, has high SPF and Neutrogena is a good brand.</li>
            <li>Great non-greasy product - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I burn easily and this keeps me safe in the garden.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, but more importantly, I can put it on and forget about it and not feel like I am covered in grease.  </li>
            <li>Great for Babies and people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This does not cause me to have more breakouts, which is something that was really important to me.</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t that great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Does not have the cheap perfume smell which most manufacturers seem to think we need.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and Effective.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight but provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>Goes on very easily and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>PLEASE wear sunscreen, because you are worth it!  :)</li>
            <li>Non scent, non greasy and drys up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>smell  -Easy to rub in    </li>
            <li>The lotion rubs in easily and seems to soak in... until you start sweating.</li>
            <li>but this product makes it easy.  </li>
            <li>I like this one because it&#x27;s easy</li>
            <li>not too dry, which is great; the light smell is nice too</li>
            <li>I love the clean</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and works.  </li>
            <li>speads easy, does not clog pores.</li>
            <li>I like the product - it goes on easily and has a spf 45 rating -&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Also, it is easy to rub into the skin</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and seems to last a good while.</li>
            <li>We went sailing for a week in the Caribbean, and our captain strongly recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>It is strong, I have not burnt when using it (and trust me I burn within 5 minutes without sunscreen)</li>
            <li>It does a great job protecting your skin, since the sunscreens are stabilized and are broad spectrum.  </li>
            <li>the price on these is really good for a decently high quality product.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens, after applying, I feel like I need to wash my hands right away--not with this!</li>
            <li>The amount for the face alone should be a shot glass full, and even more on each area of the body.</li>
            <li>This is the exact sunscreen she uses and the expiration code is 2014 which is also nice.  </li>
            <li>Best sunscreen I have ever used, hand&#x27;s down.</li>
            <li>I think the shelf life of sunscreen is about 3 years, so I&#x27;m fine with this.  </li>
            <li>Yes, SPF 55 is fine;</li>
            <li>Best advice for those with black interior cars, put sunblock on well in advance</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>Light and non-greasy, this easily stand up to any department store brand sunscreen - without the dept, store price.</li>
            <li>The 45 is fine.</li>
            <li>I love it very much!</li>
            <li>Fantastic price considering</li>
            <li>This worked great on both of my daughters (1 and 3 with skin issues) but it broke me out big time!  </li>
            <li>I always looking for something light, because my skin is oily.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s light years away from that tropical-coconut garbage.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is such a great product.  </li>
            <li>The price for this twinpack of sunscreen was fabulous as well.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely worth paying more than the store brand for this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am not opting for break out free sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Very ideal for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Gives me a smooth skin as well as sun protection, all in one step.  </li>
            <li>It is light and not greasy.     </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as the 30.  </li>
            <li>Happy to be back using this product.</li>
            <li>Since it does the job of protecting against the sun light</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and light.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and does not leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>It was so light on the skin.</li>
            <li>And put a light amount on.</li>
            <li>This is actually light weight on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered 45 because that&#x27;s what was available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for having SPF without the grease, white residue and sunblock odor!</li>
            <li>This is a solid product + great price.</li>
            <li>I feel protected and that&#x27;s what is important.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a two pack, now I can finally keep one in my purse for touch-ups when driving in killer sun-glare.</li>
            <li>I experienced an itchy bumpy red rash after using this sunscreen, so I cannot recommend it.  </li>
            <li>As with any sunscreen, it&#x27;s important to reapply if you&#x27;re out in the sun or in the water for a lengthy period of time.</li>
            <li>So far so good.     </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell like a traditional sunscreen, which is good because I didn&#x27;t want that noticeable sunscreen smell that so many have.</li>
            <li>I have been using this sunscreen on my sensitive, fair skin for years.</li>
            <li>I was particularly pleasantly surprised by the non-greasy nature of the sunscreen; for while any sunscreen will make your hands/body a bit greasy, these were surprisingly good on this front.</li>
            <li>Like many other people, I bought this sunscreen because of all the great reviews on this website.</li>
            <li>Goes on quick and easy, blends in, and never have any issues</li>
            <li>This goes on very easily without much need to &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>An excellent product even if you&#x27;re in a wet and hot weather, your skin looks great and dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and this sunscreen consistently receives top recommendations/reviews.</li>
            <li>The small tube size is perfect for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Product that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I originally thought nothing of it and took a benadryl that evening.</li>
            <li>So worth buying!</li>
            <li>Out of most sunscreens this is pretty matte.</li>
            <li>The usual Neutrogena quality, but the best thing is that it&#x27;s not greasy.....  </li>
            <li>Its a great texture, leaves the skin feeling smooth and dry, not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy sheen or feel, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Excellent for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin (especially face) all shiny and greasy looking!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it works very well.</li>
            <li>The dry feeling is great for my face and body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are ready to enjoy a safe summer</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for because I have very fair skin, and I typically despise wearing sunscreen because of the smell, and the shine and how heavy it feels, but this sunscreen is wonderful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable and ungreasy you forget about it, and good thing since it lasts on you so long..</li>
            <li>For years, I was happy with my Ocean Potion SPF 50 sunscreen (pink bottle), which I still use on my lower body</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;A good example of this greenwashing can be seen via Neutrogena, a company owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson, that regularly conducts animal tests.  </li>
            <li>I struggle to find a good sun screen that I can put on my face with out being totally greasy and runs into eyes.  </li>
            <li>Just adds assurance that I have complete SPF Protection and works nicely under foundation.  </li>
            <li>My entire family of fair redheads depended on it for year-round protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast shipping, love the product.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF is a good product.</li>
            <li>I had used this product before for my face and was pleased with it&#x27;s more matte like qualities as compared to most other face products with SPF.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best I have ever found, not only because it is effective in keeping me from getting sunburned (I am a redhead, so that is a big deal for me)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this strength and other SPFs from Neutrogena with great results.  </li>
            <li>Has no eye irritation that have experienced with other sun blocks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not taking any more chances with my skin as I get older.</li>
            <li>(so aren&#x27;t the best only protection), but no one is as likely to reapply lotion every 2 hours (as you&#x27;re supposed to) as you are to just spray your arms, legs, and chest.  </li>
            <li>I adore this lotion, because it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Second best only to home made sunblocks.</li>
            <li>and it soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Purchase another brand, we quickly tossed this out immediately after use.</li>
            <li>It does leave my face a bit shiny, but a quick dusting of mineral powder takes care of that.</li>
            <li>It almost looks as though I&#x27;ve received a mild sunburn.  </li>
            <li>and we got it quickly.</li>
            <li>High SPF, non-greasy, UVA and UVB blocking, what wasn&#x27;t there to love?  </li>
            <li>I am usually very aware of wearing sunscreen, but not with this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying varying strengths of this product for many years and this year noticed that the new ???</li>
            <li>And I live in Latin America, which means we get sunny days most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most sunscreens on my face.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled across this and was pretty excited.  </li>
            <li>This is great sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave greasy or sticky mess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to purchase more and more and more till the sun is no more.</li>
            <li>love this sunscreen, drys quickly and leaves skin soft not sticky.</li>
            <li>I had to use a prescription hydrocortisone cream and another cream to calm my skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and keeps you awake without any side effects or addictive feelings.</li>
            <li>Oh, how happy I was when I found this product a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>The product goes on nice and sheer.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m acne prone, and this is by far my favorite SPF lotion for my face.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh, with a hint of &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally absorbed in minutes.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this line of sunblock is the complete lack of residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I pay it because I like it and think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind I buy</li>
            <li>(fairly) easy to clean off with water and a soft tower or a wash for the more sensitive paint.</li>
            <li>Bought this on the recommendation of my ex-girlfriend and enjoyed it more than I expected.</li>
            <li>However for the tradeoff of not feeling like a greased sausage all day in the sun, its well worth it.</li>
            <li>Pricey, perhaps, but SO worth it.  </li>
            <li>One or more of them no longer jives with my extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have many sunscreen bottles in our house - sport, baby, sensitive skin, spray.</li>
            <li>good coverage, minimal smell, no pasty-white skin after application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this specific sunscreen for over a year due to skin cancer and have been very happy with its protection.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>For such a high SPF, this one smells pretty good, and the scent wears away quickly.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, it&#x27;s light, and Neutrogena is one of my favorite brands of sunscreen, but it&#x27;s WAY too flaky once its dried.</li>
            <li>I bought the twin pack because it had a value size to it as well as it&#x27;s good to fit into our Harley bags for keeping it small and not taking up lots of space.</li>
            <li>sometimes because it works great, it&#x27;s less expensive, and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it goes on pretty clear.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy like the others and my dermatologist who is fantastic highly recommended these.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I live at elevation of almost 8000 feet and good sun protection is absolutely essential.</li>
            <li>Best part is that this is about half the price I pay to purchase the sunblock at a local store!</li>
            <li>I like this sunscreen overall, it&#x27;s fairly light weight and protects my easily sunburned skin from damage.</li>
            <li>Most noticeably on leather car seats, and even more noticeably if its black.</li>
            <li>Being the bottles are quite small, and we fly through them -</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate, smells nice and keeps you protected for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it less stars, but it does do a good job preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li>I am hyper allergic to sun light ( medical term is polymorphic light eruption)</li>
            <li>Thought the price was good too, but then saw it at Costco for less.</li>
            <li>Not oily at all, which I very much appreciate.</li>
            <li>I sunburn easily and put in lots of time in a convertible with the top down.  </li>
            <li>It protects well, only has a slight smell, dries fast, and isn&#x27;t greasy at all (that&#x27;s the best part).</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t absorb everything or that you put too many layers on (Avoid putting a thin layer on the then another one on top -- just do it all in one go, and you should be fine).</li>
            <li>I needed a good sun screen with a little higher SPF and in a packable size for a trip to Greece.  </li>
            <li>Living in a hot tropical environment where the sun is present all the time, I need good broad spectrum sun protection year around.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have a ghostly white about you as you do with so many zinc oxide-based sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I still got sunburnt, but may be because I was at burning man ;)</li>
            <li>After experiencing several incidences of basal cell carcinoma I am now more diligent in applying sun screen.</li>
            <li>Does leave some white streaks, but if you rub it in it will go away. :)</li>
            <li>A consistent product.</li>
            <li>This is the first sunblock I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>There is a law of diminishing returns on higher SPF numbers.</li>
            <li>- I guess the water resistance works pretty well</li>
            <li>In some studies, a much higher concentration of oxybenzone (1,000 to 1 million times higher than that of estradiol) was needed to achieve a comparable result.    </li>
            <li>this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>would buy more definitely.</li>
            <li>I would prefer that it smelled more like a traditional moisturizer</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The sheer quality also holds up to light-moderate sweating and some swimming, though as with all sunblock you will have to reapply as directed to be safe.</li>
            <li>I tried it one more time, hoping it was a fluke, but it happened the next time too.  </li>
            <li>Despite living in the hot sunny South, I have never burned---actually my face never gets any color at all.  </li>
            <li>The actual container leaked through the top.</li>
            <li>This would always burn my sensitive skin and make my eyes water sometimes even with a light application.</li>
            <li>This is my first sunscreen lotion that I am using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid athlete, so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to the cheap slimy stuff again!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I use the SPF45 for the first 1-2 sun exposures and then switch to SPF30.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a devoted customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;(small side note--as with all sunscreen, be aware of the expiration date.</li>
            <li>but I had faith in the claims that anything over SPF 30 was of negligible benefit -- and slathered it on the first time I was in the sun for an extended period.  </li>
            <li>this does exactly that.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it promises to be.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely use Neutrogena from now on.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Ultra Sheer is my favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li>Feel smooth and the sun don&#x27;t burn as it use to...easy to open and have no bad smell.</li>
            <li>It goes on and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and has good protection.  </li>
            <li>The high SPF rating is great, any higher is overkill and no better for screening.</li>
            <li>This is fine for the beach, but I have the rare profession where I need sunscreen and a tie at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>excellent for everyday use, not greasy, spent years using it.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as described and kept us protected from the sun all vacation long :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got white freckled skin like the good Irish descendant I am.</li>
            <li>However, the product itself is the least greasy of all the MANY brands I&#x27;ve tried over many years living in Florida.  </li>
            <li>This is good to use if your only in the sun short periods of time.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but it&#x27;s just some more expensive than buying it, say, in Walgreens, as it might be cheaper</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price from Amazon, especially compared to my local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lasts very well even after hours in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>I love it and will keep using it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li>I figured I would try it given the fact that I&#x27;ve had good luck with Neutrogena sunblocks in the past.  </li>
            <li>When she got skin cancer when I was 18 I realized how important it was that I keep using sunscreen, but everything I tried was either ineffective or incredibly greasy and unpleasant.</li>
            <li>My skin is not even super sensitive but everytime I tried to use it, it broke me out.  </li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin and it works super</li>
            <li>The ultra sheer is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy.  </li>
            <li>I applies easily and feels like regular lotion once rubbed in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soft cream that is dry and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for sensitive very pale skin as mine.</li>
            <li>Very high quality...</li>
            <li>This is mostly a chemical sunscreen (as opposed to a physical sunblock, which are made of finely ground metals such as zinc or titanium), so be careful if you are have more sensitive skin or sunscreen allergies.  </li>
            <li>sometimes the single &amp; other times this double pack is the best value.  </li>
            <li>Definitely works great and saved me a few times from burning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly light and absorbs immediately; I find myself actually wanting/needing to use as much sunscreen as the doc recommends for your face.</li>
            <li>Thicker product than as advertised, so it has to really be rubbed in.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really dislike wearing sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It dries really fast b4</li>
            <li>thanks you 😉</li>
            <li>I rated this product a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because it did not spread very well.</li>
            <li>and you really need to use A LOT of sunscreen to cover yourself.</li>
            <li>so I always wear sunscreen and this one really prevents burns.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and feel very betrayed</li>
            <li>Who wants their face smelling like cocoa butter?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell...</li>
            <li>non -sticky, dries fast and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Hahaha.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is light enough to wear every day under my makeup.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>, you can still tell you have it on, but you really can forget about it after a while.  </li>
            <li>I have always appreciated the quality product that Neutrogena sells</li>
            <li>and I really like the sheerness of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is light enough to wear every day under my makeup.</li>
            <li>We were in Myrtle Beach SC for a whole week</li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical, blocks both UVA (320–400 nm) and UVB (280–320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>That just means that one has used too much</li>
            <li>I also used leather cleaner to help with the seats since rinsing them wasn&#x27;t very practical.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on the skin and really prevents sun burn.</li>
            <li>Third, is the promise of a light, non greasy application.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This simply felt like a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is priced reasonably and this quantity lasted for both of us using it on our arms and faces for the whole trip.</li>
            <li>Dont need to apply much and after a minute, you wouldnt even know you have it on, and it was very protective.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>real bummer.ooks a fright.  </li>
            <li>real bummer.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bob</li>
            <li>but it is very emollient.</li>
            <li>price reasonable</li>
            <li>The creme worked very well</li>
            <li>it is absorbed completely</li>
            <li>also my daughter who doesn&#x27;t have an acne prone skin adores the semll and uses it on her whole body before going swimming..</li>
            <li>Really like this Neutrogena product.</li>
            <li>It is NOT greasy on the skin and protects very well.</li>
            <li>Please make it more clear next time!</li>
            <li>only good thing about this product is that it isn&#x27;t greasy, though this makes it harder to rub in</li>
            <li>Now I can go to the beach in direct sunlight for two or three hours and my skin not only doesn&#x27;t burn but feels better and softer at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Specifically, when oxybenzone was repeatedly applied to the skin of human volunteers, it has been determined that:    No biologically significant alterations in reproductive hormones (testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or estradiol) have been detected;11  </li>
            <li>My wife love&#x27;s it and prefers it over all other brands.</li>
            <li>It feels more greasy which is a bummer, but I still prefer it over other brands.</li>
            <li>A tiny amount spreads very well on the face and offers strong protection.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, spreads well and within minutes is dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>The main issue I have with this product is that it never rubs in fully, which makes it&#x27;s name \\&quot;ultra sheer\\&quot; very misleading.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised Neutrogena would make such claims that are not at all true !</li>
            <li>Its goes on smooth and stays on long.</li>
            <li>Concerns have been raised that oxybenzone may be capable of altering/disrupting normal hormonal (endocrine) balance.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars since I have had better sunscreens from Japan and from other more expensive brands that are  more matte.</li>
            <li>Which completely nullifies the point of sunblock in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Most other sunblocks break my face out, but this one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product and tends to give a little glow to my regular makeup.</li>
            <li>, goes on easily, works well and is not very visible unless you&#x27;re looking for it.  </li>
            <li>Ordering it online costs less than what I can purchase it for in most stores.</li>
            <li>I used to use them mainly because I thought they don&#x27;t test on animals, However, after reading about &amp;#34;greenwashing&amp;#34; - yes they in a way test on animals.</li>
            <li>The sunscreens that I have tried before leave either a white mask or a super greasy face.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my face, neck, and shoulders.</li>
            <li>They came quickly as promised, however one of the items was not properly sealed.  </li>
            <li>The smell was decent.</li>
            <li>Before, even with sunscreen, I would burn even if I just took a quick walk outside.</li>
            <li>The product goes quickly if you use it regularly (2-3 months per bottle), so you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s twin pack.</li>
            <li>I have the money, this is the sunscreen I prefer, both due to the feel when it goes on (none of that dry stickiness) and the lack of that sweet smell most sunscreens have.</li>
            <li>Similar to many topically applied agents, oxybenzone has been shown to be absorbed by human skin10, and can be detected in the blood and urine of sunscreen users and the population at large.13-15</li>
            <li>Highly Recomended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and it was much high than the twin pkg.</li>
            <li>First, is that this is a broad spectrum sunscreen (protects against both uva and uvb rays).</li>
            <li>It really does go on smooth, there is a slightly moist feeling when you first apply it, but as that evaporates or dries out, after a minute or two its soft as your normal skin.</li>
            <li>I can apply the sunscreen, and my the time I get to my foundation, the sunscreen is completely absorbed and doesn&#x27;t hinder makeup application or final look.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but a few days after purchasing it here</li>
            <li>you know, the coconut-y, normal sunscreen smell you smell on beach.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 30 for a long time, and love it.</li>
            <li>If you want a good daily sunblock, I recommend either the Neutrogena Ultimate Sport SPF 30 or Blue Lizard Sensitive (all natural).</li>
            <li>It will sweat right off in white streaks.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I decided to do the right thing and apply sunscreen prior to going out to work in the yard.  </li>
            <li>Importantly, available literature does not support a link between oxybenzone use and estrogen or other hormonal alterations in humans to date.10-12    3.</li>
            <li>It is not as light as the other I am used to</li>
            <li>Zinc formula sunscreens will cost four times more, are not sold in big box stores but it is the same concept as consuming processed food with chemicals since those chemicals are absorbed by the skin where Physical Sunscreen formula stays outside the skin.</li>
            <li>Honestly, after using it a few times, it does the opposite of what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Seems to dry really quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and sheer (requires some rubbing in) but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin turn bright red, which turns back to the normal color after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I used this sun lotion for my grandson who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it COMPLETELY protect my skin, but it is not at all greasy and soaks in right away.</li>
            <li>Used many sunscreens in the past.</li>
            <li>This lotion was the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s hot outside.</li>
            <li>I use lots of Neutrogena products including the exact same one in spf 30.  </li>
            <li>Since the product caused no damage other than cosmeticly, I only took off one star because for most activities at the beach or pool or out in the yard playing with the kids or doing work, it wont be a problem.</li>
            <li>The spf is more then enough (30 spf blocks 97 percent of harmful rays and every extra 10spf only protects you from like another .5 percent) and I find it to be moisturizing even though it doesn&#x27;t claim to do</li>
            <li>Love the small size as you can carry it with ease and reapply when ever you need to.  </li>
            <li>The first time I use this moisturizer my face started to burn me, I used it a second time</li>
            <li>Pretty low grease.</li>
            <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The safety of oxybenzone was originally reviewed and approved by the FDA in 1978, and it is one of the oldest active ingredients in use today.17    </li>
            <li>However, when I first started to use it, a clear oil would come out, then the actual sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I put on a pretty liberal coat in the morning for a full day in a theme park, as I have done in the past.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little much for me sometimes, but I get used to it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 8 year old son who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I work quickly with this product and would purchase it again, if only for my chest and upper arm areas.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, with the caveat that you need to reapply every couple hours as the instructions state, something that wasn&#x27;t really necessary with my older sunblock.</li>
            <li>I applied it (like many other brands in the past that worked fine) and assumed the white color would fade as it soaked in.  </li>
            <li>The user of this sunscreen is very particular on the specific sunscreen she uses.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for the rest of the body, but not sure if it&#x27;s the best choice for face due to sometimes burning and not absorbing fully.</li>
            <li>Clearly this product was the culprit.  </li>
            <li>have tried this, the spray, and the clear face</li>
            <li>As far as a sunscreen goes, you aren&#x27;t going to get burnt with this stuff on.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work as far as keeping them from getting burned, hence the 3 star rating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li>i recommend it to anyone i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And this really keeps me from getting red from the sun.</li>
            <li>My 16 month old baby has eczema.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, it does on dry and has a nice / subtle scent, and really works.</li>
            <li>However, the observed estrogenic effects of oxybenzone often are considerably weaker when compared to the estrogen (estradiol) used in these experiments.</li>
            <li>Also, the safety of oxybenzone for use in cosmetics and personal care products was also reviewed in 1983 and confirmed in 2002 by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) expert panel, which is an independent panel of scientific and medical experts who assess the safety of cosmetic ingredients in the United States.19-20    </li>
            <li>no greasy, oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic deal, and it helps that Amazon offers this lotion as Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li>If you put too much, it doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly on your face so you may get white streaks of sunblock.</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t make her break out so win-win.</li>
            <li>It really does feel sheer.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, greasy, or oily.</li>
            <li>I took this pack to Cancun in earlier June, and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>So far no issues.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have used Neutrogena Ultra sheer for a couple of years now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreens are an absolute must in Florida and Neutrogena is the only one I trust.</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li>Not messy or gooey.</li>
            <li>I am a redhead with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So naturally I thought it was two 6 oz tubes.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I reduced by one star because  if I use it at the end of my face (near hairline) or at the edges of my neck by the shoulders, I break out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful！I will buy it next</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but in my opinion, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is good, but not perfect.</li>
            <li>I was outside in the sun, on and off, for four hours the other day and this worked fine, without reapplying (</li>
            <li>I usually purchase this item in the grocery store, but was buying other items on Amazon anyway and got Free Super Saver Shipping as a result.  </li>
            <li>The biggest difference with Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen SPF 45 is the feel; its non-oily formula goes on and absorbs quickly, leaving both hands and skin feeling dry and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The concentrations of oxybenzone absorbed are not capable of disrupting normal thyroid hormone levels12, and;  The concentration of oxybenzone penetrating the skin is too low to cause epidermal cell damage.10  </li>
            <li>Occasionally it has made my face burn slightly, so probably better suited for the rest of the body for people with sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>It worked really well when I was in the Caribbean and let me tell you: it is HOT and SUNNY down there!</li>
            <li>They have this particular brand in varying strengths but I have only tried the spf 45.</li>
            <li>I also read that Neutrogena had changed its formula and the older \\&quot;blue</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you want to protect your skin and not feel gross and greasy all day.</li>
            <li>A high SPF that absorbs instantly without the grease</li>
            <li>highly recommend Neugrogena Ultra Sheer</li>
            <li>This has no scent, no burning sensation, not on my skin anyhow, and I want to say that the Amazon 1-time purchase price of about $14 is far below what our New York City Duane Reade chain charges, which is $24 for this same packaging.</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t waste it as a tub is about the right size per person for a 6 days beach trip!</li>
            <li>-- it works and since it feels so nice and is so easy to use, I don&#x27;t hate putting it on every day.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t buy things like this, but I decided it was time to stop being a stubborn male when it came to sunscreen.</li>
            <li>After one week I am almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>I kept on top of the reapplications over the course of the next few days, and even in the baking Las Vegas sun and had no further issues.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board looking for a new sunblock that can protect myself and my family without giving us chemical</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board looking for a new sunblock that can protect myself and my family without giving us chemical</li>
            <li>I have purchased more expensive sunscreen, but it was really greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast absorbing and graet for everyday use underneath makeup.</li>
            <li>I used other Neutrogena  products on my face before and this is the first time I have a problem.</li>
            <li>I wish it were a little less greasy, but overall, a fantastic and gentle product!</li>
            <li>I had finally settled on one I didn&#x27;t particularly like when I went back to visit my mom and found this in her medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on slightly white but becomes clear.</li>
            <li>It took a couple of weeks to clear and often resembled a rash, with raised, red bumps that itched like nobody&#x27;s business.  </li>
            <li>you can barely tell it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li>Neutrogena does make a physical sunblock too called Neutrogena Sensitive Skin (look for the words &amp;</li>
            <li>I have such sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and after four hours of using this sunscreen my entire face got swollen, started itching and broke out.</li>
            <li>I used this sunscreen on my face again but kept it WAY far away from my eyes (stayed well above my eyebrows and left the area under my eyes completely uncovered).  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use cleansers on my face; the only moisturizer I use is specifically for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, but once it dries it feels thick and chalky.</li>
            <li>Hambone bought the wrong kind for a tender wife.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs</li>
            <li>sure enough, blue smudges wherever the skin touches the materials (and has a little time to dry</li>
            <li>And im sorry, I like in Buffalo where you dont have nice days without extreme mugginess, the last thing I want to feel when I am hot and sweaty in greasy and sticky.</li>
            <li>So, it is great to find it less expensive without waiting for a sale.</li>
            <li>You feel like you&#x27;re ready to be roasted with those other greasy sunscreens.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, you&#x27;ll need another product for application to the whole body.</li>
            <li>If you hate the feel of sunscreen and you have sensitive skin, this sunscreen is great.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really pricey compared to other (especially store-brand) sunscreens.</li>
            <li>For example, in 2001 and again in 2006, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Union (EU) developed an opinion paper based on a review of current scientific knowledge and stated \\&quot;the organic UV filters used in cosmetic sunscreen products allowed in the EU market today have no estrogenic effects that could potentially affect human health.\\&quot;18    </li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb fully on my face, and will make my sweat run white if I&#x27;m being more active</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does have an odor but not very much and is always clear.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 45 seems very close to our previous sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li>It always work and I can depend on it on days where I&#x27;ve been binge studying all night and a little sleep and also use it for intense workouts.</li>
            <li>It comes in 3 ounce bottles, which is only really a little bit of product, but it is well worth the money, because of the fact that it really isn&#x27;t remotely greasy and only has the slightest, virtually undetectable sunscreen smell, and it does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not normally sensitive to skin products in general.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that occasionally it will sting my eyes a bit if my eyes get watery, but this is pretty minor and my skin is REALLY really sensitive (so it might not be an issue for you).</li>

            <li> They get the zinc into the smallest particles they can that are then able to absorb under your skin into your pores and cells.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews and it was suggested that Neutrogena with helioplex is one of the better sunblocks.</li>

            <li> This is a great non-oily sunscreen &amp; absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> should I say more?</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with the spray version of Neutorgena.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite non-beauty sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a shot and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> Be mindful of how it impacts makeup (if you wear it), I used it with drier liquid foundations but didn&#x27;t like it with more watery foundation.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s non-greasy</li>
            <li> all I am satisfied with the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> love the product, upset at how overpriced it is.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is my favorite brand for sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for one that isn&#x27;t quite as greasy feeling, but this stuff sure works.</li>
            <li> The perfect daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and they work very well.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> i loved it, the price is great, i took my time to find other prices and by far this price is the best</li>
            <li> A pleasure to use, and the absence of scent is very welcome.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but not overpowering, has high SPF and Neutrogena is a good brand.</li>
            <li> Great non-greasy product - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I burn easily and this keeps me safe in the garden.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, but more importantly, I can put it on and forget about it and not feel like I am covered in grease.  </li>
            <li> Great for Babies and people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This does not cause me to have more breakouts, which is something that was really important to me.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t that great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Does not have the cheap perfume smell which most manufacturers seem to think we need.  </li>
            <li> Fresh and Effective.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight but provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> Goes on very easily and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> PLEASE wear sunscreen, because you are worth it!  :)</li>
            <li> Non scent, non greasy and drys up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> smell  -Easy to rub in    </li>
            <li> The lotion rubs in easily and seems to soak in... until you start sweating.</li>
            <li> but this product makes it easy.  </li>
            <li> I like this one because it&#x27;s easy</li>
            <li> not too dry, which is great; the light smell is nice too</li>
            <li> I love the clean</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and works.  </li>
            <li> speads easy, does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> I like the product - it goes on easily and has a spf 45 rating -&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Also, it is easy to rub into the skin</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and seems to last a good while.</li>
            <li> We went sailing for a week in the Caribbean, and our captain strongly recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> It is strong, I have not burnt when using it (and trust me I burn within 5 minutes without sunscreen)</li>
            <li> It does a great job protecting your skin, since the sunscreens are stabilized and are broad spectrum.  </li>
            <li> the price on these is really good for a decently high quality product.</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens, after applying, I feel like I need to wash my hands right away--not with this!</li>
            <li> The amount for the face alone should be a shot glass full, and even more on each area of the body.</li>
            <li> This is the exact sunscreen she uses and the expiration code is 2014 which is also nice.  </li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used, hand&#x27;s down.</li>
            <li> I think the shelf life of sunscreen is about 3 years, so I&#x27;m fine with this.  </li>
            <li> Yes, SPF 55 is fine;</li>
            <li> Best advice for those with black interior cars, put sunblock on well in advance</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so light and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> Light and non-greasy, this easily stand up to any department store brand sunscreen - without the dept, store price.</li>
            <li> The 45 is fine.</li>
            <li> I love it very much!</li>
            <li> Fantastic price considering</li>
            <li> This worked great on both of my daughters (1 and 3 with skin issues) but it broke me out big time!  </li>
            <li> I always looking for something light, because my skin is oily.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s light years away from that tropical-coconut garbage.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is such a great product.  </li>
            <li> The price for this twinpack of sunscreen was fabulous as well.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely worth paying more than the store brand for this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am not opting for break out free sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Very ideal for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth skin as well as sun protection, all in one step.  </li>
            <li> It is light and not greasy.     </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as the 30.  </li>
            <li> Happy to be back using this product.</li>
            <li> Since it does the job of protecting against the sun light</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and light.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and does not leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> It was so light on the skin.</li>
            <li> And put a light amount on.</li>
            <li> This is actually light weight on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered 45 because that&#x27;s what was available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for having SPF without the grease, white residue and sunblock odor!</li>
            <li> This is a solid product + great price.</li>
            <li> I feel protected and that&#x27;s what is important.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a two pack, now I can finally keep one in my purse for touch-ups when driving in killer sun-glare.</li>
            <li> I experienced an itchy bumpy red rash after using this sunscreen, so I cannot recommend it.  </li>
            <li> As with any sunscreen, it&#x27;s important to reapply if you&#x27;re out in the sun or in the water for a lengthy period of time.</li>
            <li> So far so good.     </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell like a traditional sunscreen, which is good because I didn&#x27;t want that noticeable sunscreen smell that so many have.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen on my sensitive, fair skin for years.</li>
            <li> I was particularly pleasantly surprised by the non-greasy nature of the sunscreen; for while any sunscreen will make your hands/body a bit greasy, these were surprisingly good on this front.</li>
            <li> Like many other people, I bought this sunscreen because of all the great reviews on this website.</li>
            <li> Goes on quick and easy, blends in, and never have any issues</li>
            <li> This goes on very easily without much need to &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> An excellent product even if you&#x27;re in a wet and hot weather, your skin looks great and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and this sunscreen consistently receives top recommendations/reviews.</li>
            <li> The small tube size is perfect for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great Product that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I originally thought nothing of it and took a benadryl that evening.</li>
            <li> So worth buying!</li>
            <li> Out of most sunscreens this is pretty matte.</li>
            <li> The usual Neutrogena quality, but the best thing is that it&#x27;s not greasy.....  </li>
            <li> Its a great texture, leaves the skin feeling smooth and dry, not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy sheen or feel, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin (especially face) all shiny and greasy looking!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> And most importantly, it works very well.</li>
            <li> The dry feeling is great for my face and body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are ready to enjoy a safe summer</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for because I have very fair skin, and I typically despise wearing sunscreen because of the smell, and the shine and how heavy it feels, but this sunscreen is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable and ungreasy you forget about it, and good thing since it lasts on you so long..</li>
            <li> For years, I was happy with my Ocean Potion SPF 50 sunscreen (pink bottle), which I still use on my lower body</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;A good example of this greenwashing can be seen via Neutrogena, a company owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson, that regularly conducts animal tests.  </li>
            <li> I struggle to find a good sun screen that I can put on my face with out being totally greasy and runs into eyes.  </li>
            <li> Just adds assurance that I have complete SPF Protection and works nicely under foundation.  </li>
            <li> My entire family of fair redheads depended on it for year-round protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast shipping, love the product.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF is a good product.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before for my face and was pleased with it&#x27;s more matte like qualities as compared to most other face products with SPF.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best I have ever found, not only because it is effective in keeping me from getting sunburned (I am a redhead, so that is a big deal for me)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this strength and other SPFs from Neutrogena with great results.  </li>
            <li> Has no eye irritation that have experienced with other sun blocks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not taking any more chances with my skin as I get older.</li>
            <li> (so aren&#x27;t the best only protection), but no one is as likely to reapply lotion every 2 hours (as you&#x27;re supposed to) as you are to just spray your arms, legs, and chest.  </li>
            <li> I adore this lotion, because it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Second best only to home made sunblocks.</li>
            <li> and it soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li> Purchase another brand, we quickly tossed this out immediately after use.</li>
            <li> It does leave my face a bit shiny, but a quick dusting of mineral powder takes care of that.</li>
            <li> It almost looks as though I&#x27;ve received a mild sunburn.  </li>
            <li> and we got it quickly.</li>
            <li> High SPF, non-greasy, UVA and UVB blocking, what wasn&#x27;t there to love?  </li>
            <li> I am usually very aware of wearing sunscreen, but not with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying varying strengths of this product for many years and this year noticed that the new ???</li>
            <li> And I live in Latin America, which means we get sunny days most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most sunscreens on my face.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled across this and was pretty excited.  </li>
            <li> This is great sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave greasy or sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to purchase more and more and more till the sun is no more.</li>
            <li> love this sunscreen, drys quickly and leaves skin soft not sticky.</li>
            <li> I had to use a prescription hydrocortisone cream and another cream to calm my skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smoothly and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and keeps you awake without any side effects or addictive feelings.</li>
            <li> Oh, how happy I was when I found this product a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> The product goes on nice and sheer.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m acne prone, and this is by far my favorite SPF lotion for my face.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh, with a hint of &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally absorbed in minutes.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this line of sunblock is the complete lack of residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I pay it because I like it and think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind I buy</li>
            <li> (fairly) easy to clean off with water and a soft tower or a wash for the more sensitive paint.</li>
            <li> Bought this on the recommendation of my ex-girlfriend and enjoyed it more than I expected.</li>
            <li> However for the tradeoff of not feeling like a greased sausage all day in the sun, its well worth it.</li>
            <li> Pricey, perhaps, but SO worth it.  </li>
            <li> One or more of them no longer jives with my extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have many sunscreen bottles in our house - sport, baby, sensitive skin, spray.</li>
            <li> good coverage, minimal smell, no pasty-white skin after application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this specific sunscreen for over a year due to skin cancer and have been very happy with its protection.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> For such a high SPF, this one smells pretty good, and the scent wears away quickly.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, it&#x27;s light, and Neutrogena is one of my favorite brands of sunscreen, but it&#x27;s WAY too flaky once its dried.</li>
            <li> I bought the twin pack because it had a value size to it as well as it&#x27;s good to fit into our Harley bags for keeping it small and not taking up lots of space.</li>
            <li> sometimes because it works great, it&#x27;s less expensive, and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it goes on pretty clear.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy like the others and my dermatologist who is fantastic highly recommended these.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I live at elevation of almost 8000 feet and good sun protection is absolutely essential.</li>
            <li> Best part is that this is about half the price I pay to purchase the sunblock at a local store!</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen overall, it&#x27;s fairly light weight and protects my easily sunburned skin from damage.</li>
            <li> Most noticeably on leather car seats, and even more noticeably if its black.</li>
            <li> Being the bottles are quite small, and we fly through them -</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate, smells nice and keeps you protected for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it less stars, but it does do a good job preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li> I am hyper allergic to sun light ( medical term is polymorphic light eruption)</li>
            <li> Thought the price was good too, but then saw it at Costco for less.</li>
            <li> Not oily at all, which I very much appreciate.</li>
            <li> I sunburn easily and put in lots of time in a convertible with the top down.  </li>
            <li> It protects well, only has a slight smell, dries fast, and isn&#x27;t greasy at all (that&#x27;s the best part).</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t absorb everything or that you put too many layers on (Avoid putting a thin layer on the then another one on top -- just do it all in one go, and you should be fine).</li>
            <li> I needed a good sun screen with a little higher SPF and in a packable size for a trip to Greece.  </li>
            <li> Living in a hot tropical environment where the sun is present all the time, I need good broad spectrum sun protection year around.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have a ghostly white about you as you do with so many zinc oxide-based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I still got sunburnt, but may be because I was at burning man ;)</li>
            <li> After experiencing several incidences of basal cell carcinoma I am now more diligent in applying sun screen.</li>
            <li> Does leave some white streaks, but if you rub it in it will go away. :)</li>
            <li> A consistent product.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunblock I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> There is a law of diminishing returns on higher SPF numbers.</li>
            <li> - I guess the water resistance works pretty well</li>
            <li> In some studies, a much higher concentration of oxybenzone (1,000 to 1 million times higher than that of estradiol) was needed to achieve a comparable result.    </li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> would buy more definitely.</li>
            <li> I would prefer that it smelled more like a traditional moisturizer</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The sheer quality also holds up to light-moderate sweating and some swimming, though as with all sunblock you will have to reapply as directed to be safe.</li>
            <li> I tried it one more time, hoping it was a fluke, but it happened the next time too.  </li>
            <li> Despite living in the hot sunny South, I have never burned---actually my face never gets any color at all.  </li>
            <li> The actual container leaked through the top.</li>
            <li> This would always burn my sensitive skin and make my eyes water sometimes even with a light application.</li>
            <li> This is my first sunscreen lotion that I am using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid athlete, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to the cheap slimy stuff again!</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I use the SPF45 for the first 1-2 sun exposures and then switch to SPF30.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a devoted customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;(small side note--as with all sunscreen, be aware of the expiration date.</li>
            <li> but I had faith in the claims that anything over SPF 30 was of negligible benefit -- and slathered it on the first time I was in the sun for an extended period.  </li>
            <li> this does exactly that.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it promises to be.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely use Neutrogena from now on.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Sheer is my favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li> Feel smooth and the sun don&#x27;t burn as it use to...easy to open and have no bad smell.</li>
            <li> It goes on and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and has good protection.  </li>
            <li> The high SPF rating is great, any higher is overkill and no better for screening.</li>
            <li> This is fine for the beach, but I have the rare profession where I need sunscreen and a tie at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> excellent for everyday use, not greasy, spent years using it.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as described and kept us protected from the sun all vacation long :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got white freckled skin like the good Irish descendant I am.</li>
            <li> However, the product itself is the least greasy of all the MANY brands I&#x27;ve tried over many years living in Florida.  </li>
            <li> This is good to use if your only in the sun short periods of time.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but it&#x27;s just some more expensive than buying it, say, in Walgreens, as it might be cheaper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price from Amazon, especially compared to my local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lasts very well even after hours in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> I love it and will keep using it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try it given the fact that I&#x27;ve had good luck with Neutrogena sunblocks in the past.  </li>
            <li> When she got skin cancer when I was 18 I realized how important it was that I keep using sunscreen, but everything I tried was either ineffective or incredibly greasy and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My skin is not even super sensitive but everytime I tried to use it, it broke me out.  </li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin and it works super</li>
            <li> The ultra sheer is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I applies easily and feels like regular lotion once rubbed in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soft cream that is dry and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for sensitive very pale skin as mine.</li>
            <li> Very high quality...</li>
            <li> This is mostly a chemical sunscreen (as opposed to a physical sunblock, which are made of finely ground metals such as zinc or titanium), so be careful if you are have more sensitive skin or sunscreen allergies.  </li>
            <li> sometimes the single &amp; other times this double pack is the best value.  </li>
            <li> Definitely works great and saved me a few times from burning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly light and absorbs immediately; I find myself actually wanting/needing to use as much sunscreen as the doc recommends for your face.</li>
            <li> Thicker product than as advertised, so it has to really be rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really dislike wearing sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It dries really fast b4</li>
            <li> thanks you 😉</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because it did not spread very well.</li>
            <li> and you really need to use A LOT of sunscreen to cover yourself.</li>
            <li> so I always wear sunscreen and this one really prevents burns.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and feel very betrayed</li>
            <li> Who wants their face smelling like cocoa butter?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell...</li>
            <li> non -sticky, dries fast and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Hahaha.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is light enough to wear every day under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> , you can still tell you have it on, but you really can forget about it after a while.  </li>
            <li> I have always appreciated the quality product that Neutrogena sells</li>
            <li> and I really like the sheerness of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is light enough to wear every day under my makeup.</li>
            <li> We were in Myrtle Beach SC for a whole week</li>
            <li> Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical, blocks both UVA (320–400 nm) and UVB (280–320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> That just means that one has used too much</li>
            <li> I also used leather cleaner to help with the seats since rinsing them wasn&#x27;t very practical.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on the skin and really prevents sun burn.</li>
            <li> Third, is the promise of a light, non greasy application.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This simply felt like a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is priced reasonably and this quantity lasted for both of us using it on our arms and faces for the whole trip.</li>
            <li> Dont need to apply much and after a minute, you wouldnt even know you have it on, and it was very protective.  </li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> real bummer.ooks a fright.  </li>
            <li> real bummer.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bob</li>
            <li> but it is very emollient.</li>
            <li> price reasonable</li>
            <li> The creme worked very well</li>
            <li> it is absorbed completely</li>
            <li> also my daughter who doesn&#x27;t have an acne prone skin adores the semll and uses it on her whole body before going swimming..</li>
            <li> Really like this Neutrogena product.</li>
            <li> It is NOT greasy on the skin and protects very well.</li>
            <li> Please make it more clear next time!</li>
            <li> only good thing about this product is that it isn&#x27;t greasy, though this makes it harder to rub in</li>
            <li> Now I can go to the beach in direct sunlight for two or three hours and my skin not only doesn&#x27;t burn but feels better and softer at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Specifically, when oxybenzone was repeatedly applied to the skin of human volunteers, it has been determined that:    No biologically significant alterations in reproductive hormones (testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or estradiol) have been detected;11  </li>
            <li> My wife love&#x27;s it and prefers it over all other brands.</li>
            <li> It feels more greasy which is a bummer, but I still prefer it over other brands.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount spreads very well on the face and offers strong protection.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, spreads well and within minutes is dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with this product is that it never rubs in fully, which makes it&#x27;s name \\&quot;ultra sheer\\&quot; very misleading.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised Neutrogena would make such claims that are not at all true !</li>
            <li> Its goes on smooth and stays on long.</li>
            <li> Concerns have been raised that oxybenzone may be capable of altering/disrupting normal hormonal (endocrine) balance.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars since I have had better sunscreens from Japan and from other more expensive brands that are  more matte.</li>
            <li> Which completely nullifies the point of sunblock in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Most other sunblocks break my face out, but this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product and tends to give a little glow to my regular makeup.</li>
            <li> , goes on easily, works well and is not very visible unless you&#x27;re looking for it.  </li>
            <li> Ordering it online costs less than what I can purchase it for in most stores.</li>
            <li> I used to use them mainly because I thought they don&#x27;t test on animals, However, after reading about &amp;#34;greenwashing&amp;#34; - yes they in a way test on animals.</li>
            <li> The sunscreens that I have tried before leave either a white mask or a super greasy face.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my face, neck, and shoulders.</li>
            <li> They came quickly as promised, however one of the items was not properly sealed.  </li>
            <li> The smell was decent.</li>
            <li> Before, even with sunscreen, I would burn even if I just took a quick walk outside.</li>
            <li> The product goes quickly if you use it regularly (2-3 months per bottle), so you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s twin pack.</li>
            <li> I have the money, this is the sunscreen I prefer, both due to the feel when it goes on (none of that dry stickiness) and the lack of that sweet smell most sunscreens have.</li>
            <li> Similar to many topically applied agents, oxybenzone has been shown to be absorbed by human skin10, and can be detected in the blood and urine of sunscreen users and the population at large.13-15</li>
            <li> Highly Recomended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and it was much high than the twin pkg.</li>
            <li> First, is that this is a broad spectrum sunscreen (protects against both uva and uvb rays).</li>
            <li> It really does go on smooth, there is a slightly moist feeling when you first apply it, but as that evaporates or dries out, after a minute or two its soft as your normal skin.</li>
            <li> I can apply the sunscreen, and my the time I get to my foundation, the sunscreen is completely absorbed and doesn&#x27;t hinder makeup application or final look.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but a few days after purchasing it here</li>
            <li> you know, the coconut-y, normal sunscreen smell you smell on beach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 30 for a long time, and love it.</li>
            <li> If you want a good daily sunblock, I recommend either the Neutrogena Ultimate Sport SPF 30 or Blue Lizard Sensitive (all natural).</li>
            <li> It will sweat right off in white streaks.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I decided to do the right thing and apply sunscreen prior to going out to work in the yard.  </li>
            <li> Importantly, available literature does not support a link between oxybenzone use and estrogen or other hormonal alterations in humans to date.10-12    3.</li>
            <li> It is not as light as the other I am used to</li>
            <li> Zinc formula sunscreens will cost four times more, are not sold in big box stores but it is the same concept as consuming processed food with chemicals since those chemicals are absorbed by the skin where Physical Sunscreen formula stays outside the skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, after using it a few times, it does the opposite of what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seems to dry really quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and sheer (requires some rubbing in) but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin turn bright red, which turns back to the normal color after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I used this sun lotion for my grandson who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it COMPLETELY protect my skin, but it is not at all greasy and soaks in right away.</li>
            <li> Used many sunscreens in the past.</li>
            <li> This lotion was the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s hot outside.</li>
            <li> I use lots of Neutrogena products including the exact same one in spf 30.  </li>
            <li> Since the product caused no damage other than cosmeticly, I only took off one star because for most activities at the beach or pool or out in the yard playing with the kids or doing work, it wont be a problem.</li>
            <li> The spf is more then enough (30 spf blocks 97 percent of harmful rays and every extra 10spf only protects you from like another .5 percent) and I find it to be moisturizing even though it doesn&#x27;t claim to do</li>
            <li> Love the small size as you can carry it with ease and reapply when ever you need to.  </li>
            <li> The first time I use this moisturizer my face started to burn me, I used it a second time</li>
            <li> Pretty low grease.</li>
            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The safety of oxybenzone was originally reviewed and approved by the FDA in 1978, and it is one of the oldest active ingredients in use today.17    </li>
            <li> However, when I first started to use it, a clear oil would come out, then the actual sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I put on a pretty liberal coat in the morning for a full day in a theme park, as I have done in the past.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little much for me sometimes, but I get used to it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 8 year old son who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I work quickly with this product and would purchase it again, if only for my chest and upper arm areas.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, with the caveat that you need to reapply every couple hours as the instructions state, something that wasn&#x27;t really necessary with my older sunblock.</li>
            <li> I applied it (like many other brands in the past that worked fine) and assumed the white color would fade as it soaked in.  </li>
            <li> The user of this sunscreen is very particular on the specific sunscreen she uses.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for the rest of the body, but not sure if it&#x27;s the best choice for face due to sometimes burning and not absorbing fully.</li>
            <li> Clearly this product was the culprit.  </li>
            <li> have tried this, the spray, and the clear face</li>
            <li> As far as a sunscreen goes, you aren&#x27;t going to get burnt with this stuff on.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work as far as keeping them from getting burned, hence the 3 star rating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li> i recommend it to anyone i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And this really keeps me from getting red from the sun.</li>
            <li> My 16 month old baby has eczema.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, it does on dry and has a nice / subtle scent, and really works.</li>
            <li> However, the observed estrogenic effects of oxybenzone often are considerably weaker when compared to the estrogen (estradiol) used in these experiments.</li>
            <li> Also, the safety of oxybenzone for use in cosmetics and personal care products was also reviewed in 1983 and confirmed in 2002 by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) expert panel, which is an independent panel of scientific and medical experts who assess the safety of cosmetic ingredients in the United States.19-20    </li>
            <li> no greasy, oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic deal, and it helps that Amazon offers this lotion as Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> If you put too much, it doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly on your face so you may get white streaks of sunblock.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t make her break out so win-win.</li>
            <li> It really does feel sheer.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, greasy, or oily.</li>
            <li> I took this pack to Cancun in earlier June, and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> So far no issues.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena Ultra sheer for a couple of years now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Sunscreens are an absolute must in Florida and Neutrogena is the only one I trust.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li> Not messy or gooey.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So naturally I thought it was two 6 oz tubes.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I reduced by one star because  if I use it at the end of my face (near hairline) or at the edges of my neck by the shoulders, I break out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful！I will buy it next</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but in my opinion, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is good, but not perfect.</li>
            <li> I was outside in the sun, on and off, for four hours the other day and this worked fine, without reapplying (</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this item in the grocery store, but was buying other items on Amazon anyway and got Free Super Saver Shipping as a result.  </li>
            <li> The biggest difference with Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen SPF 45 is the feel; its non-oily formula goes on and absorbs quickly, leaving both hands and skin feeling dry and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The concentrations of oxybenzone absorbed are not capable of disrupting normal thyroid hormone levels12, and;  The concentration of oxybenzone penetrating the skin is too low to cause epidermal cell damage.10  </li>
            <li> Occasionally it has made my face burn slightly, so probably better suited for the rest of the body for people with sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> It worked really well when I was in the Caribbean and let me tell you: it is HOT and SUNNY down there!</li>
            <li> They have this particular brand in varying strengths but I have only tried the spf 45.</li>
            <li> I also read that Neutrogena had changed its formula and the older \\&quot;blue</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you want to protect your skin and not feel gross and greasy all day.</li>
            <li> A high SPF that absorbs instantly without the grease</li>
            <li> highly recommend Neugrogena Ultra Sheer</li>
            <li> This has no scent, no burning sensation, not on my skin anyhow, and I want to say that the Amazon 1-time purchase price of about $14 is far below what our New York City Duane Reade chain charges, which is $24 for this same packaging.</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t waste it as a tub is about the right size per person for a 6 days beach trip!</li>
            <li> -- it works and since it feels so nice and is so easy to use, I don&#x27;t hate putting it on every day.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t buy things like this, but I decided it was time to stop being a stubborn male when it came to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After one week I am almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> I kept on top of the reapplications over the course of the next few days, and even in the baking Las Vegas sun and had no further issues.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board looking for a new sunblock that can protect myself and my family without giving us chemical</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board looking for a new sunblock that can protect myself and my family without giving us chemical</li>
            <li> I have purchased more expensive sunscreen, but it was really greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast absorbing and graet for everyday use underneath makeup.</li>
            <li> I used other Neutrogena  products on my face before and this is the first time I have a problem.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little less greasy, but overall, a fantastic and gentle product!</li>
            <li> I had finally settled on one I didn&#x27;t particularly like when I went back to visit my mom and found this in her medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on slightly white but becomes clear.</li>
            <li> It took a couple of weeks to clear and often resembled a rash, with raised, red bumps that itched like nobody&#x27;s business.  </li>
            <li> you can barely tell it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li> Neutrogena does make a physical sunblock too called Neutrogena Sensitive Skin (look for the words &amp;</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and after four hours of using this sunscreen my entire face got swollen, started itching and broke out.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen on my face again but kept it WAY far away from my eyes (stayed well above my eyebrows and left the area under my eyes completely uncovered).  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use cleansers on my face; the only moisturizer I use is specifically for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, but once it dries it feels thick and chalky.</li>
            <li> Hambone bought the wrong kind for a tender wife.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs</li>
            <li> sure enough, blue smudges wherever the skin touches the materials (and has a little time to dry</li>
            <li> And im sorry, I like in Buffalo where you dont have nice days without extreme mugginess, the last thing I want to feel when I am hot and sweaty in greasy and sticky.</li>
            <li> So, it is great to find it less expensive without waiting for a sale.</li>
            <li> You feel like you&#x27;re ready to be roasted with those other greasy sunscreens.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, you&#x27;ll need another product for application to the whole body.</li>
            <li> If you hate the feel of sunscreen and you have sensitive skin, this sunscreen is great.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really pricey compared to other (especially store-brand) sunscreens.</li>
            <li> For example, in 2001 and again in 2006, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Union (EU) developed an opinion paper based on a review of current scientific knowledge and stated \\&quot;the organic UV filters used in cosmetic sunscreen products allowed in the EU market today have no estrogenic effects that could potentially affect human health.\\&quot;18    </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb fully on my face, and will make my sweat run white if I&#x27;m being more active</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does have an odor but not very much and is always clear.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 45 seems very close to our previous sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> It always work and I can depend on it on days where I&#x27;ve been binge studying all night and a little sleep and also use it for intense workouts.</li>
            <li> It comes in 3 ounce bottles, which is only really a little bit of product, but it is well worth the money, because of the fact that it really isn&#x27;t remotely greasy and only has the slightest, virtually undetectable sunscreen smell, and it does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally sensitive to skin products in general.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that occasionally it will sting my eyes a bit if my eyes get watery, but this is pretty minor and my skin is REALLY really sensitive (so it might not be an issue for you).</li>
            <li> maybe this is a good sun screen but for dry skins... specially under my make up... it&#x27;s awful!</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a little more expensive than some of the other ones out there, but it&#x27;s worth it.....</li>
            <li> I kept missing the local sales, but Amazon had a decent price and it came to me at my home.  </li>
            <li> While they may seem small at first, they really last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bad if you use moisturizer first to help it smooth in.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen application is usually a battle with my 3 year old with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Always use this generously before going to stay outside for a long time.</li>
            <li> but seems it would be a good product if  hadn&#x27;t reacted :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> label\\&quot; bottles were different than the new \\&quot;black label\\&quot; ones - checking a leftover bottle from last year with the new ones from this year proved that the formula does appear significantly different, with this year&#x27;s sunblock containing a number of new complicated chemical names I can&#x27;t pronounce.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;dry touch\\&quot; sunscreen had been recommended by our dermatologist since it not only provide UVA/UVB broad spectrum coverage, it also does not have a greasy feel and is not clogging to the pores so it can be used on the face without causing blemishes or other skin problems.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is really dry and leaves white streaks on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is only suncreen that is not greasy but not too dry.</li>
            <li> But on dry skin you&#x27;ll have a white film.</li>
            <li> this sunscreen gives me a white sheen which i guess is to be expected by a lot of regular sunscreens</li>
            <li> Recently in Mexico and not one single burn.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed and plan to look for another protecion that is less greasy , more sheer and matte.</li>
            <li> Are there any studies in humans that demonstrate hormone disruption or other potential to affect human health?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Much more expensive than other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> NOT natural though so don&#x27;t use if going in the ocean or any water where animals or plants would be adversly affected.</li>
            <li> I like this product b/c it isn&#x27;t sticky, lasts a long time, and prevents sunburn.</li>
            <li> I spent a day autocrossing using this sunscreen and my car (outside) and seats were covered in blueish smudges.</li>
            <li> Worked well all summer long</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using for a long time with no</li>
            <li> What this really means is that this one iteration of this product has not been tested on animals, but the raw ingredients, combinations therein, and any other products the company makes may have been.&amp;#34; (http://www.getvegucated.com/latests-challenges/beauty-without-the-cruelty-greening-your-routine/)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved onto Asian sunscreens, which are less greasy and leave no white cast.</li>
            <li> Even my daily face cream burns my eyes when I unfortunately sometimes am in too much of a hurry and am not careful.</li>
            <li> Oxybenzone also is used to protect cosmetics and other personal care products from deterioration by UV exposure.    </li>
            <li> Since then, there have been additional reviews of oxybenzone by other regulatory agencies and expert panels with similar conclusions regarding its safety for use in consumer products.</li>
            <li> I never look shiny like you do sometimes with other sunscreens after you&#x27;ve been outside for a while and sweating.</li>
            <li> and they ALL burned my skin, felt extremely greasy (especially on my face)</li>
            <li> I usually apply only on my body but have used it only face without any problem (face gets a different sun screen).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> This lotion advertises itself as a &#x27;dry&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry skin out a bit.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and feels dry to the touch after application.</li>
            <li> Dry application.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;ve spent upwards of a month suffering from red, itchy, oozing, tight, dry, skin, which is now starting to peel and looks a fright.  </li>
            <li> It also left my skin looking white and pale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this sunscreen when doing yard work and other out door tasks, but every time I begin to sweat around my forehead, the sunscreen drips down into my eyes, causing a sharp burning sensation to the point where I can barely keep my eyes open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d take half a tube of this to do the average adult.</li>
            <li> you need to have a dry and not sensitive skin to use this and again this is not matte nor dry!!</li>
            <li> my skin is that sensitive (which usually its not)</li>
            <li> While wearing dark cotton shorts &amp; a shirt, the sunscreen wiped white chalky residue all over my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark skinned fellow (Indian) and this product come up blue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> but no where near as miserably as I usually do.  </li>
            <li> But recently it seems they have changed the formulae and its definitely no more a dry touch as my skin feels greasy with a white film.</li>
            <li> There is sunscreen smudges on the black leather seats in my car, the inside of the car doors, on the OUTSIDE of my car on the paint.  </li>
            <li> It ruined my black leather car seats and my clothes were covered with white stains.</li>
            <li> It caked on my face after only half hour.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me having a white face, but I apply it a little bit amount at time.  </li>
            <li> I like this product as its dry touch, not greasy like some other products.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in the sun for more than 3 hours I apply every hour and still get painful sunburns.</li>
            <li> How lotion can dry on the skin in less than 10 seconds is a mystery  to me, yet it is dry.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s more expensive, at least it&#x27;s useable.</li>
            <li> In the summer it looks weird because the rest of me is tan, but my face looks like I have some kind of weird white makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few complaints where people said it just smeared and balled up or gooped up on the skin (that&#x27;s the extent of my technical terminology).</li>
            <li> Not much to complain about.</li>
            <li> That is what I expected.</li>
            <li> so I need something that is not very greasy but spreads well.</li>
            <li> the next day, I went over to a friend&#x27;s house and spent a few hours sitting out by their pool.  </li>
            <li> and no matter how long I waited after I applied it it immediately streaked down my face/eyes when I sweat or went in the water.</li>
            <li> I sent it back, found for half the price!  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, but leaves a weird film that wipes off all over dark clothing.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on my kids before school, they sit down on my black sofa and there is white smudges all over the seat of the couch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recomended, and remember:  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews of this product I purchased with high hopes and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and oily like other sun screens.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other products</li>
            <li> Other than that I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  </li>
            <li> Other questions answered...</li>
            <li> What do the FDA or other agencies have to say about oxybenzone?  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading other reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Yuck...have to try other brands now.</li>
            <li> Due to sweat, often sunscreen lotion gets in contact with eyes and my eyes burns.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember any other sunscreen causing this reaction before.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m have lupus and am extremely photosensitive and need a sunscreen that protects against UVA &amp; UVB)&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Neutrogena products without any burning results.  </li>
            <li> Usually with sunscreen I have to wait 10-20 minutes before putting clothes back on, and with this stuff I wait two minutes</li>
            <li> Cannot use in winters that it does not fight the dryness due to heating in winters.</li>
            <li> No more second thoughts before putting on sunscreen.</li>
            <li> And this was after applying other brands.  </li>
            <li> It works but you need to let it dry a little before you go into a pool because I once I just put it on and jumped in the pool.  </li>
            <li> but too bad it has a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> too bad it has a strong smell&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> too bad it has a strong smell&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> too bad it has a strong smell</li>
            <li> Product does not sink into skin, rather leaves some white streaks that actually get worse</li>
            <li> Oxybenzone (also known as benzophenone-3 or BP-3) is one of 16 sunscreen active ingredients (compounds that absorb, scatter, or reflect ultraviolet (UV) radiation) regulated as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration</li>
            <li> It was approved by the FDA in 1978 and is one of the oldest active ingredients in use today.    </li>
            <li> I  now use it everyday, and have avoided having red skin everyday.</li>
            <li> I found the same twin-pack at Costco (plus a few trial size extras) for a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I put in on the areas that tend to develop dark spots and then cover entire face and neck with my usual Oil of Olay factor 15.</li>
            <li> But I was looking for something that would be a little less sticky around my face, neck and chest, and friend of my turned me on to Neutrogena Ultrasheer Dry Touch.</li>
            <li> some lotion-y feel on your skin, just less than other lotions.  </li>
            <li> and I have to spread it hard to not having my skin white.</li>
            <li> However hard I tried to rub this sunscreen into my skin - I couldn&#x27;t get rid of white stains..</li>
            <li> When I use this sunscreen on my face, I break out into huge monster sized painful zits.</li>
            <li> have been using the Ultra Sheer for over a decade and have no breakout or complaint.  </li>
            <li> replaced my existing 50 spf sunscreen which was too greasy and made me look dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have oily skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t make it any worse for as long as I keep using my skin creams for oily skin regularly.</li>
            <li> The cream tends to be like a thick white layer.</li>
            <li> I hate the feel of sunscreen, but I love being outdoors at the shore</li>
            <li> If you decide to put this on while you&#x27;re wearing clothing, and in particular dark clothing, note that it&#x27;s almost as difficult as deodorant to get off.</li>
            <li> This works well since sprays give you much less dense skin coverage</li>
            <li> The FDA has approved the use of oxybenzone in sunscreen in concentrations of up to 6 percent, which is less than what is allowed in both Europe and Australia (10 percent).2</li>
            <li> Im black and</li>
            <li> I eagerly stocked up on eight bottles of the SPF 45 before the start of the sunny season -- in previous years we used SPF 85 or 100</li>
            <li> One beach trip and half of it is gone from the tube.</li>
            <li> I like it, less oil.</li>
            <li> Not a good combination unless you are using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 45.  </li>
            <li> I think it got too hot or too cold during shipping.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and has very little odor in comparison to other brands.  </li>
            <li> Little pricy though,</li>
            <li> Plus I think it&#x27;s a little too pricey.</li>
            <li> Still leaves skin feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really no significant protection increase over that.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is a little too greasy, or maybe just for me.</li>
            <li> And it does burn a little.</li>
            <li> To fully understand what my endorsement means, you need to have a little backstory.</li>
            <li> However, I broke out just a little</li>
            <li> So use this and pretend you&#x27;re a tough guy, rocking SPF45 with dreamy white Victorian era skin.</li>
            <li> what looked like skim milk dribbling down!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, leaves a white film.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and never get burned.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t put it on heavily.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to put on, and now I have two of them -_-</li>
            <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL YEAR ROUND AS A HYDRATING CREAM.  </li>
            <li> Harsh on eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this product, its not as heavy as some of the others and I like that.</li>
            <li> I use Cerave, so I have to wait a few minutes to let it soak in, otherwise the Sunscreen feels heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, this did give me a bit of a sheen, in spring.</li>
            <li> This product has noticeably dried my face.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy</li>
            <li> the cream is a little thick, and not compatible with other product like BB</li>
            <li> I made a stupid mistake and tried Livestrong which was twice as expensive and half as effective.  </li>
            <li> Also, the \\&quot;sunscreen smell\\&quot; is not strong at all, and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, because I like the very subtle scent and non-sticky feel.  </li>
            <li> Those were the two things I wanted and they are not easy to find in the same&lt;br /&gt;product.  </li>
            <li> No greasy mess here!  </li>
            <li> a little stuffy for my face, and hard to spread</li>
            <li> It takes very little time in the sun for me to get sunburn.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad if you&#x27;re not doing a whole lot of activity.  </li>
            <li> I needed a sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t greasy and didn&#x27;t shine excessively when applied.</li>
            <li> It is not safe fir skin - http://time.com/3883293/sunscreen-spf/</li>
            <li> I always use on my face &amp; for the reviewer who said it burned their eyes, well, unfortunately, that is the ultimate challenge, but you just have to avoid getting it in your eyes to begin with.  </li>
            <li> not sure I will be using them though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like sun block</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever remember having that issue in the past.  </li>
            <li> This irritates my contacs like crazy if I get it anywhere near my eyes and it makes my face break out</li>
            <li> I relied on this product in the past years.</li>
            <li> Since it is a bit expensive, I use it on my face/neck only.   </li>
            <li> I will stick with the 30 or get the 55 in the small liquid bottle they sell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will order again as it has an oily appearance even though it says it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li> I have had extreem sun exposure in the past.</li>
            <li> Of all the sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, this was the least greasy and heavy feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Usually use run of the mill banana boat.</li>
            <li> After using this for the past two days, I will not be applying it to my face ever again.  </li>
            <li> Sorry my english.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin with some acne, so I wear this every day under my makeup to prevent hyperpigmentation and protect myself from the sun.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these since it&#x27;s hard to find 3oz sunblock&#x27;s to travel with in the winter.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t rubbed really hard to get it to apply like it should.  </li>
            <li> I did not like this product it was so thick and hard to spread on the skin.</li>
            <li> but it is also the least sticky/greasy of any I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t seemed to negatively impact my complexion.</li>
            <li> If you are really oily or hate the lotion-feel, you would probably prefer a gel sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It is quite thick, but I am used to that.  </li>
            <li> What does this mean and are there any data to support this?  </li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of returning, but its frustrating when that happens!</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle so it isn&#x27;t as if you smell like a coconut, etc.</li>
            <li> Even with tax, it is less expensive through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed that it got all over my stuff!</li>
            <li> I was so tired of the greasy feeling you get when wearing sunblock, even the so called &#x27;non greasy&#x27; formulas still felt icky.</li>
            <li> people often forget about it and throw on some sunscreen they found in the back of their medicine cabinet from 1994, to disastrous results)</li>
            <li> This product is separated the oil and water phase separated, batch was made incorrectly, iIam deeply disappointed in Neutrogena as I am a loyal customer and Amazon for selling such a horrible product and not verifying the quality of the product they are selling.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the sheerness and dry touch factor of this sunblock.</li>
            <li> but it started to almost burn my face :( making it red</li>
            <li> Even with wearing long sleeves and a wide-brimmed sun hat I ended up with what (I thought) was a painful burn all over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Just imagine having a bunch of tough guys asking for and using a product.  </li>
            <li> Got tired of the scent on the banana boat sports brand and greasy oily too for my skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave behind the oily skin which is one of the prime reason I selected it.</li>
            <li> This made her break out in the worse case of rash I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Non irritating - neutral smell.</li>
            <li> I felt even two 3oz bottles was cutting it close for having to apply sunscreen everyday (sometimes twice) for a 1 week vacation.</li>
            <li> The worst problem is that it really STAINS your clothes, car seats, everything you touch...</li>
            <li> If anything, it burned worse and again I wasn&#x27;t sweating.  </li>
            <li> While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin’s DNA at a deeper layer.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced pain nor discoloration on my arms or neck.  </li>
            <li> It spreads smoothly, is not greasy, nor does it have an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> By day 3, I had developed an awful, itchy rash on both of my arms.</li>
            <li> This was by far the worst sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed that I can&#x27;t even properly express it.  </li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed that I can&#x27;t even properly express it.  </li>
            <li> -Expensive  </li>
            <li> My husband wouldn&#x27;t use it because he said it was difficult to spread around the body.</li>
            <li> Also it is way expensive.</li>
            <li> My mom uses this and always says how expensive they are.</li>
            <li> I hate greasy sunscreens or ones with heavy fragrance.  </li>
            <li> formula burns my eyes like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it fits with the crazy 3 oz rule that the airport enforces.</li>
            <li> i was wrong!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell - could not use it as oder gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> The BAD:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad or noticeable, but it is there.</li>
            <li> This product works as described but it does have the oxybenzone in it that is bad for mens health.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, like some sunblocks.  </li>
            <li> It does have a hint of sunscreen smell but not too bad</li>
            <li> BAD DECISION.</li>
            <li> And I have nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> It has irritated the skin badly and my face now has a ruddy complexion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of it so will be switching to No-ad after seeing the reviews in Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> And it has tons of parabens in it.  :-(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed since i now have 2 bottles to use up.  </li>
            <li> But after applying it I got really disappointed</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the misleading description of the product(which</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really annoying.  </li>
            <li> and I hate the greasy feeling it leaves on my skin and hands.  </li>
            <li> I hate how sunblock feels, but this is alright.  </li>
            <li> : it smells very unpleasant, like rubber or something.</li>
            <li> Horrifying.  </li>
            <li> Horrifying.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very bad for you.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed ..</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I looked like a monster, went and saw a allergy specialist that informed me the Helloplex is one of the worst products on the market.</li>
            <li> Flakes off nasty if you rub it at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> It also burned my eyes terribly when some lotion-tainted sweat ran into them.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an excellent value.  I use this stuff all the time, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.  Fantastic price considering you&#x27;re getting two tubes.</li>
            <li> Thicker product than as advertised, so it has to really be rubbed in.  But it seems to work well, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re after.</li>
            <li> A good buy because this is one of the best products around. Love my sunscreen from Trader Joes too. Can&#x27;t get through summer without them!</li>
            <li> Use this multiple times per day! Great product!</li>
            <li> The product goes on nice and sheer. It soaks in and feels utterly weightless. It would work well under makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived exactly as described and kept us protected from the sun all vacation long :)</li>
            <li> Nice product with good price</li>
            <li> I like the SPF level.  What I dislike is that after I apply it to myself and kids, there is a white film that gets on anything and everything that I touch or my kids.  As soon as I put it on my kids before school, they sit down on my black sofa and there is white smudges all over the seat of the couch.  There is sunscreen smudges on the black leather seats in my car, the inside of the car doors, on the OUTSIDE of my car on the paint.  It&#x27;s really annoying.  It&#x27;s a good price, the SPF is excellent, but it is too messy for my taste.  And it has tons of parabens in it.  :-(</li>
            <li> Neutrogena, for my tastes, makes the best feeling sunscreen. I just do not like the feeling of sunscreen on my skin, and as such, I dread putting on something that amounts to safety equipment. Neutrogena is the best of the bunch for me in terms of feel.</li>
            <li> Non scent, non greasy and drys up very quickly.  Got tired of the scent on the banana boat sports brand and greasy oily too for my skin this works.  This coming from a dude.</li>
            <li> The GOOD:  -Keeps you from getting sunburns  -Tolerable smell  -Easy to rub in    The BAD:  -Expensive  -Each \\&quot;tube\\&quot; only lasts one or two trips to the pool/beach  -Sunscreen \\&quot;pools\\&quot; in wrinkles, creases, belly button, etc    As far as a sunscreen goes, you aren&#x27;t going to get burnt with this stuff on. Apply once and you&#x27;re good to go. If you sweat a lot or get in the water you will need to reapply. If you can&#x27;t tolerate that \\&quot;sunscreen smell\\&quot;, don&#x27;t get this. It&#x27;s not too bad or noticeable, but it is there. The lotion rubs in easily and seems to soak in... until you start sweating. I ended up with white puddles in all the creases (elbows, neck, belly buttons) and a white mustache where the lotion pooled above my upper lip. Yes it keeps you from getting burnt, but there is no reason to pay a premium for this stuff as it doesn&#x27;t offer any additional benefits. Go with something cheaper that will last longer, or something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.     Recommended: Nah</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It&#x27;s not sticky and oily like other sun screens. The smell is a little much for me sometimes, but I get used to it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this sun block because my doctor told me to do that. And is really good for my face and I always use it, I like proteccion 70 when I go to the beach, and I use 45 every day to protect my face, neck and hands. I try to have always one in my bag.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best sunscreen. You can just slather it on and within minutes, your skin doesn&#x27;t feel like you ever touched it with sunscreen. I keep trying other products but I always come back back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Sheer sunscreen. You can&#x27;t go back after using it. You feel like you&#x27;re ready to be roasted with those other greasy sunscreens. Not with Neutrogena Ultra Sheer. This is like you have no sunscreen on. And, man, it works. I&#x27;ve got white freckled skin like the good Irish descendant I am. I NEVER get burned if I have this on. And I know you&#x27;re supposed to apply and reapply all day. I never reapply (OK, maybe my nose and chest), and I&#x27;ve NEVER gotten burned with it on. It&#x27;s so comfortable and ungreasy you forget about it, and good thing since it lasts on you so long.. Sand doesn&#x27;t stick to it. You can wear makeup with it. You don&#x27;t have a ghostly white about you as you do with so many zinc oxide-based sunscreens. I do tan some through it, but never burn. I&#x27;ve used it for years, but suddenly discovered the cheapest is on Amazon. So I&#x27;ll stick with Amazon for  my Neotrogena Ultra Sheer.</li>
            <li> I really dislike wearing sunscreen.  I don&#x27;t like applying it; I don&#x27;t like the smell and I hate the greasy feeling it leaves on my skin and hands.  This is by far the best sunscreen I have found!  The smell is okay, but more importantly, I can put it on and forget about it and not feel like I am covered in grease.  I even use it on my face when I have to and it feels okay.  It is a couple of dollars cheaper on amazon than at Target.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Ordered these for on subscription, need I say more?</li>
            <li> Neutrogena stuff is my favorite. The sunscreen is great but I&#x27;ll prefer to use a spray next time. The cream tends to be like a thick white layer. I still got sunburnt, but may be because I was at burning man ;)</li>
            <li> Great for Babies and people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I needed a sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t greasy and didn&#x27;t shine excessively when applied. This sunscreen had it all. It is a moisturizer, sunscreen, waterproof and 45 spf. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more. Little pricy though, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is not safe fir skin - http://time.com/3883293/sunscreen-spf/</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel great, not sticky, good for every day use</li>
            <li> GOOD BUY!  USE DAILY!</li>
            <li> The price is great. I like the scent of the product but it&#x27;s so dry. It dries really fast b4 i can apply evenly on my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m acne prone, and this is by far my favorite SPF lotion for my face. I also use it on my chest, which is prone to breakouts. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen!  It is not greasy and has very little odor in comparison to other brands.  I applied it once and was in the sun all day and had no sunburn.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this product which I have been totally satisfied with. After experiencing several incidences of basal cell carcinoma I am now more diligent in applying sun screen. I&#x27;m not taking any more chances with my skin as I get older. I have re-ordered this product numerous times over the years to provide protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.</li>
            <li> I only try to buy on sale because it can often be pricey.  Watch because there are a couple different sellers on amazon and sometimes the single &amp; other times this double pack is the best value.  However, the product itself is the least greasy of all the MANY brands I&#x27;ve tried over many years living in Florida.  I always use on my face &amp; for the reviewer who said it burned their eyes, well, unfortunately, that is the ultimate challenge, but you just have to avoid getting it in your eyes to begin with.  Even my daily face cream burns my eyes when I unfortunately sometimes am in too much of a hurry and am not careful.</li>
            <li> This worked great on both of my daughters (1 and 3 with skin issues) but it broke me out big time!  I&#x27;ll buy it again for my girls but I will keep looking for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this to bring on a trip to Florida.  I used it on my kids, ages 12, 5 and 4.  It did not absorb in to their skin at all.  They walked around with white streaks all day.  It seemed to work as far as keeping them from getting burned, hence the 3 star rating.  Other than that I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  I called customer service and they sent me some coupons for more Nuetrogena suncare products....not sure I will be using them though.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  I have purchased more expensive sunscreen, but it was really greasy.  No greasy mess here!  Does leave some white streaks, but if you rub it in it will go away. :)</li>
            <li> This product is non-greasy, long-lasting.  I don&#x27;t usually like sun block but this product makes it easy.  I recently applied it on an all day rafting trip and did not have any evidence of burning when I returned at 6pm even after falling out of the raft a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I live at elevation of almost 8000 feet and good sun protection is absolutely essential. This product is great for sensitive very pale skin as mine. It doesn&#x27;t irritate, smells nice and keeps you protected for a long time. I would recommend it as the best sunscreen you can get.</li>
            <li> Product does not sink into skin, rather leaves some white streaks that actually get worse the longer you wear it. It looks like you are covered in white paint and doesn&#x27;t rinse off all the way with just water, needs soap as well. Throwing both bottles away.</li>
            <li> It works but you need to let it dry a little before you go into a pool because I once I just put it on and jumped in the pool.  Next thing you a few hours later I felt really burnt.</li>
            <li> very good sunblock, not oily at all and good smelling</li>
            <li> Although my no. 1 sun block has SPF 110, i bought the 45 twin pack knowing the difference in number does not drastically reduce the effectiveness of the sun blocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Ultra Sheer for over a decade and have no breakout or complaint.  I just have to remember to re-apply timely, which i don&#x27;t so as often as i should have....</li>
            <li> A consistent product.</li>
            <li> I received this product today, and thought it was expired, but the lot # on the end is the production date, not an expiration date.  The ones I received today, 3/26/15 were manufactured in April 2014.  I think the shelf life of sunscreen is about 3 years, so I&#x27;m fine with this.  This is very good sunscreen.  I am a Melanoma patient and have used this for 5 years.</li>
            <li> This is good to use if your only in the sun short periods of time. When I&#x27;m in the sun for more than 3 hours I apply every hour and still get painful sunburns. I even had a tan already and still burned with this. I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li> My favorite brand! I love how this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily. The prices is great as well! It&#x27;s about 1/3 cheaper than drugstores.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is effective.  I use it everyday, and never get burned.  The twin pack is a good value, too.</li>
            <li> Planned on vacationing in Australia during their Summer. I bought this to prevent sunburn. I&#x27;m happy to report it worked wonderfully! This is a great product, even better with in this cheaper packaging.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the sheerness and dry touch factor of this sunblock. I never wore sunblock because I couldn&#x27;t stand the greasy feeling of it. This is the first sunblock I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I love it- even on my face! Renewed my faith in sunblock lol, my dermatologist thanks you 😉</li>
            <li> Good price for this sunscreen, which I think is one of the best.  Goes on very easily and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> I sent it back, found for half the price!  Needed for a cruise</li>
            <li> Used many sunscreens in the past. I like this product as its dry touch, not greasy like some other products. It also smells good.</li>
            <li> I used to use them mainly because I thought they don&#x27;t test on animals, However, after reading about &amp;#34;greenwashing&amp;#34; - yes they in a way test on animals. I will never buy neutrogena products ever again. &amp;#34;A good example of this greenwashing can be seen via Neutrogena, a company owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson, that regularly conducts animal tests.  However, their recently-launched Neutrogena Naturals line boasts serene, eco-friendly looking bottles that state: “This product not tested on animals.”  Well, that’s nice.  What this really means is that this one iteration of this product has not been tested on animals, but the raw ingredients, combinations therein, and any other products the company makes may have been.&amp;#34; (http://www.getvegucated.com/latests-challenges/beauty-without-the-cruelty-greening-your-routine/)</li>
            <li> Wanted to buy some protection for my face! YIKES! thought it would be wonderful i was wrong! i know everyone reacts to different products differently but it started to almost burn my face :( making it red so i stopped using it. i don&#x27;t know if they have a shelf life and it was expired or my skin is that sensitive (which usually its not) but seems it would be a good product if  hadn&#x27;t reacted :(</li>
            <li> I actually bought this from wal-mart but it&#x27;s good and non-greasy i recommend it to anyone i have sensitive skin and it work well with it you can barely tell it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen product it is not greasy and great to apply makeup over.</li>
            <li> It always leaves white streaks and starts to flake. I walk around looking like a ghost and if I touch my face or start to sweat it streaks and flakes. It goes on smoothly, but once it dries it feels thick and chalky. And I don&#x27;t put it on heavily. I&#x27;m sick of it so will be switching to No-ad after seeing the reviews in Consumer Reports. I&#x27;d give it less stars, but it does do a good job preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and this sunscreen consistently receives top recommendations/reviews. Goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and seems to last a good while.</li>
            <li> Love the way this cream goes on and great protection from harmful sun rays!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading some reviews and have been very happy with this purchase. I was used to two types of sunscreen, the lotion style and the spray on. Both, although working, always made me feel gross and greasy throughout the day. This lotion was the exact opposite. You put it on and it doesn&#x27;t even seem like it&#x27;s there. I&#x27;ve used it a number of times this summer for outdoor activities like hiking and bicycling and didn&#x27;t get burned one bit.I highly recommend this if you want to protect your skin and not feel gross and greasy all day.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena Sunblock delivers on all the promises. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind the oily skin which is one of the prime reason I selected it.</li>
            <li> This pack is a great deal. The product is good as described, non-greasy at all. I always looking for something light, because my skin is oily. And this really keeps me from getting red from the sun.</li>
            <li> I used this product and I it worked well for me. My husband wouldn&#x27;t use it because he said it was difficult to spread around the body. My 16 month old baby has eczema. This made her break out in the worse case of rash I have ever seen. So, I will keep using it, buy hubby something else and figure out another solution for the baby.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite sunscreens.  It is a creamy consistency, but absorbs to a matte finish (the &amp;#34;dry touch&amp;#34; the bottle says).  There is some lotion-y feel on your skin, just less than other lotions.  If you are really oily or hate the lotion-feel, you would probably prefer a gel sunscreen.  It does a great job protecting your skin, since the sunscreens are stabilized and are broad spectrum.  This is mostly a chemical sunscreen (as opposed to a physical sunblock, which are made of finely ground metals such as zinc or titanium), so be careful if you are have more sensitive skin or sunscreen allergies.  Neutrogena does make a physical sunblock too called Neutrogena Sensitive Skin (look for the words &amp;#34;with PureScreen&amp;#34;, which is Neutrogena&#x27;s code for contains only titanium or zinc) if you need a non-chemical one.  They have a spray version, which is nice too.  We use the lotion for initial application, and then bring the sprays for convenient re-application.  This works well since sprays give you much less dense skin coverage (so aren&#x27;t the best only protection), but no one is as likely to reapply lotion every 2 hours (as you&#x27;re supposed to) as you are to just spray your arms, legs, and chest.  Bring a sunscreen stick for reapplying to the face too.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying varying strengths of this product for many years and this year noticed that the new ??? formula burns my eyes like crazy.  I don&#x27;t ever remember having that issue in the past.  Aside from that, it does on dry and has a nice / subtle scent, and really works.</li>
            <li> There are so many questions here about the expiration date. To put all these questions to rest: On the day I got this in the mail, the expiration date was 28 months out. If you can&#x27;t use up 6 ounces in two years, you&#x27;re not going outside enough.  Overall, this is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I was outside in the sun, on and off, for four hours the other day and this worked fine, without reapplying (but I should have reapplied). There is some sort of scent to this, but it&#x27;s not perfume-y. And it&#x27;s light years away from that tropical-coconut garbage. This is not oil. It&#x27;s a lotion. And it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything once you rub it on.   Other questions answered... Yes, this protects against UVA and UVB rays. Yes, it&#x27;s water resistant. Yes, SPF 55 is fine; overkill, actually. Just buy this and stop worrying.  UPDATE: There are SPF 100&#x27;s marketed to infants. Those take advantage of Parent Paranoia. There is a law of diminishing returns on higher SPF numbers. Do yourself a favor and ask a dermatologist so you can make up your own mind. By the way, stop looking for &amp;#34;sunblock.&amp;#34; According to the FDA, there&#x27;s no such thing, and legit companies will never use the word.</li>
            <li> I have to wear sunscreen every day and this it by far the best that I have tried.   The sunscreens that I have tried before leave either a white mask or a super greasy face. This product makes my skin look smooth and without grease! looove it!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is such a great product.  I use their skin care as well as makeup.  This sunscreen is great and I can reimbursed from my FSA too.  Win, win.  Protect your skin:)</li>
            <li> I love it very much! They&#x27;re very cheap for me,because they are as a gift,so it isn&#x27;t taxed.</li>
            <li> Kept me from getting deep-fried in the Costa Rican sun.  Surfed all day, reapplying every hour or so - I guess the water resistance works pretty well</li>
            <li> Non irritating - neutral smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this strength and other SPFs from Neutrogena with great results.  As for another reviewer&#x27;s caution, this is from the American Academy of Dermatology&#x27; web site:    1. What is oxybenzone and how is it used in sunscreen and personal care products?  Oxybenzone (also known as benzophenone-3 or BP-3) is one of 16 sunscreen active ingredients (compounds that absorb, scatter, or reflect ultraviolet (UV) radiation) regulated as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1 Oxybenzone provides broad-spectrum protection from harmful UVA and UVB rays. It was approved by the FDA in 1978 and is one of the oldest active ingredients in use today.    The FDA has approved the use of oxybenzone in sunscreen in concentrations of up to 6 percent, which is less than what is allowed in both Europe and Australia (10 percent).2 Oxybenzone also is used to protect cosmetics and other personal care products from deterioration by UV exposure.    2. I&#x27;ve heard oxybenzone called a hormone disruptor. What does this mean and are there any data to support this?  Concerns have been raised that oxybenzone may be capable of altering/disrupting normal hormonal (endocrine) balance. Specifically, oxybenzone is suspected of having estrogenic activity, which is the ability to exhibit properties similar to the hormone estrogen.    There have been some published observations using in vitro (test tube) cell lines, as well as studies in rats fed oxybenzone, and in fish, where oxybenzone was added to the water, which have indicated oxybenzone or its byproducts can demonstrate some estrogenic activity.4-9 However, the observed estrogenic effects of oxybenzone often are considerably weaker when compared to the estrogen (estradiol) used in these experiments. In some studies, a much higher concentration of oxybenzone (1,000 to 1 million times higher than that of estradiol) was needed to achieve a comparable result.    Importantly, available literature does not support a link between oxybenzone use and estrogen or other hormonal alterations in humans to date.10-12    3. Are there any studies in humans that demonstrate hormone disruption or other potential to affect human health?  Similar to many topically applied agents, oxybenzone has been shown to be absorbed by human skin10, and can be detected in the blood and urine of sunscreen users and the population at large.13-15 However, results from multiple studies do not support a link between oxybenzone and any short- or long-term health problems, or the increased risk of adverse health effects.    Specifically, when oxybenzone was repeatedly applied to the skin of human volunteers, it has been determined that:    No biologically significant alterations in reproductive hormones (testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or estradiol) have been detected;11  The concentrations of oxybenzone absorbed are not capable of disrupting normal thyroid hormone levels12, and;  The concentration of oxybenzone penetrating the skin is too low to cause epidermal cell damage.10  It should be noted that oxybenzone has been used as sunscreen ingredient since 1978, and aside from allergic or irritant reactions, such as photocontact and contact dermatitis, there has not been any report of systemic side effects of oxybenzone use.    Therefore, the proven benefits of sunscreen to prevent sunburn and reduce the risk of skin cancer outweigh any concerns of oxybenzone toxicity or health hazard.    4. What do the FDA or other agencies have to say about oxybenzone?  The safety of oxybenzone was originally reviewed and approved by the FDA in 1978, and it is one of the oldest active ingredients in use today.17    Since then, there have been additional reviews of oxybenzone by other regulatory agencies and expert panels with similar conclusions regarding its safety for use in consumer products. For example, in 2001 and again in 2006, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Union (EU) developed an opinion paper based on a review of current scientific knowledge and stated \\&quot;the organic UV filters used in cosmetic sunscreen products allowed in the EU market today have no estrogenic effects that could potentially affect human health.\\&quot;18    Also, the safety of oxybenzone for use in cosmetics and personal care products was also reviewed in 1983 and confirmed in 2002 by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) expert panel, which is an independent panel of scientific and medical experts who assess the safety of cosmetic ingredients in the United States.19-20    Read the AAD paper with references: oxybenzone_questions_aad</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this item in the grocery store, but was buying other items on Amazon anyway and got Free Super Saver Shipping as a result.  The price for this twinpack of sunscreen was fabulous as well.  This \\&quot;dry touch\\&quot; sunscreen had been recommended by our dermatologist since it not only provide UVA/UVB broad spectrum coverage, it also does not have a greasy feel and is not clogging to the pores so it can be used on the face without causing blemishes or other skin problems.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most sunscreens on my face.  This one doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and provides the protection I need.  It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy sheen or feel, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is separated the oil and water phase separated, batch was made incorrectly, iIam deeply disappointed in Neutrogena as I am a loyal customer and Amazon for selling such a horrible product and not verifying the quality of the product they are selling.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product it was so thick and hard to spread on the skin. It also left my skin looking white and pale. There was nothing sheer about this  product. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading other reviews on Amazon. This is a great sunscreen for those of us who hate the greasy shininess after application. It worked really well when I was in the Caribbean and let me tell you: it is HOT and SUNNY down there! On touring/shopping days, I applied it only once and did not get burned even after being in and out of the sun for 8 hours. On swimming/beach days, reapplication is a must. Sunscreen just isn&#x27;t waterproof, no matter what the bottles say!    I rated this product a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because it did not spread very well. It&#x27;s pretty thick and you really need to use A LOT of sunscreen to cover yourself. I felt even two 3oz bottles was cutting it close for having to apply sunscreen everyday (sometimes twice) for a 1 week vacation. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ll buy it again next season.</li>
            <li> I have used many types of sunscreens, but Neutrogena is my favorite. It spreads smoothly, is not greasy, nor does it have an unpleasant odor.  I also bought it in the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> This irritates my contacs like crazy if I get it anywhere near my eyes and it makes my face break out so I will have to discontinue use. I also did not like the way it made my face look really white - even over tanned skin. In the summer it looks weird because the rest of me is tan, but my face looks like I have some kind of weird white makeup on my face. Plus I think it&#x27;s a little too pricey. Think I&#x27;ll go back to NO-AD brand.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for. A high SPF that absorbs instantly without the grease</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my dermatologist, this is the best price I can find for it beyond the price club.</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin so I always wear sunscreen and this one really prevents burns. I wear it every day outside etc. It is downright amazing.</li>
            <li> This product works as described but it does have the oxybenzone in it that is bad for mens health. Also it is way expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great product used by the Palm Beach County Sheriff&#x27;s office Marine Unt and day shift Road Patrol.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin (especially face) all shiny and greasy looking! Lasts very well even after hours in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena sunscreen is wonderful, not greasy and lasts several hours. I reapply after about 3 hours and do not get sunburned.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. I have very pale skin with some acne, so I wear this every day under my makeup to prevent hyperpigmentation and protect myself from the sun. It does have the sunscreen smell, but once applied it fades within a couple of minutes. I can apply my foundation instantly after I&#x27;ve rubbed this into my skin with no issues. The only complaint I have is that occasionally it will sting my eyes a bit if my eyes get watery, but this is pretty minor and my skin is REALLY really sensitive (so it might not be an issue for you). This does not cause me to have more breakouts, which is something that was really important to me.</li>
            <li> i like the overall quality... However, when I first started to use it, a clear oil would come out, then the actual sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Totally put white grainy white stuff on my face when I put it on. it was too visiblely white for me. Not comfortable to put on, and now I have two of them -_-</li>
            <li> I like it but, it gets all over my car. So there are streaks of white everywhere I touch. Best advice for those with black interior cars, put sunblock on well in advance</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is really dry and leaves white streaks on your skin. The worst problem is that it really STAINS your clothes, car seats, everything you touch... It ruined my black leather car seats and my clothes were covered with white stains. Terrible product. Will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this! It smells fresh, with a hint of &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34;. :D  I wish it were a little less greasy, but overall, a fantastic and gentle product!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunsafe lotion I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried several.  Not sticky or greasy at all!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used, hand&#x27;s down. The tubes are perfectly sized (3.0 ounces) with a strong cap that will ensure clean, safe travels. The sunscreen is SPF 45, and provides excellent coverage. The lotion goes on creamy and dries matte-- no greasy, oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic deal, and it helps that Amazon offers this lotion as Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and wear sunscreen when I know I will be in the sun for a while. I have been looking for a sunscreen that is \\&quot;invisible.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t want to smell like sunscreen or look greasy from it. This sunscreen does have an odor but not very much and is always clear. I never look shiny like you do sometimes with other sunscreens after you&#x27;ve been outside for a while and sweating. The only thing is that if you don&#x27;t blend well enough you have to watch that it doesn&#x27;t build up so that you can see the white lotion on your skin.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell - could not use it as oder gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> same wal mart price!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very bad for you. See reviews by the Environmental Working Group. I have used this for years and feel very betrayed</li>
            <li> I adore this lotion, because it dries quickly. Good to apply before make-up.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great value pack, make sure you buy this one or a higher protection!</li>
            <li> This has no scent, no burning sensation, not on my skin anyhow, and I want to say that the Amazon 1-time purchase price of about $14 is far below what our New York City Duane Reade chain charges, which is $24 for this same packaging. Please note that this is NOT 2 6oz tubes but 2 3oz tubes, for a TOTAL of 6oz. A tiny amount spreads very well on the face and offers strong protection. A pleasure to use, and the absence of scent is very welcome. Who wants their face smelling like cocoa butter? On the other hand, you&#x27;ll need another product for application to the whole body. It&#x27;d take half a tube of this to do the average adult.</li>
            <li> I struggle to find a good sun screen that I can put on my face with out being totally greasy and runs into eyes.  This one fits the bill, still protects, and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog the pores.  So far so good.     Also, many sun screens burn and itch on my skin - this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This sunblock could make your face complexion seem whiter but once it soaks into your skin, it gives great coverage. I like the fact that it does not leave an oily finish on my face and hands. If you put too much, it doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly on your face so you may get white streaks of sunblock. Make sure to evenly distribute around the face. :)</li>
            <li> Dinged 1 star because of its thickness.  I sunburn easily and put in lots of time in a convertible with the top down.  Not a good combination unless you are using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 45.  When driving season started I couldn&#x27;t find my regular sunscreen so I picked up a tube of this.  Put it on and I am good for 7 hours of driving at altitude.  Just picked up another 2 tubes for next season.  Ultra Sheer is like the energizer bunny - it just keeps on working.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t buy things like this, but I decided it was time to stop being a stubborn male when it came to sunscreen. Definitely works great and saved me a few times from burning. It helped me out after the sunburn that prompted this purchase too!</li>
            <li> We were very satisfied with this sunblock. Its goes on smooth and stays on long. It gives  you a perfect tan without getting burnt.</li>
            <li> Great non-greasy product - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell...&lt;br /&gt;Also the cream is a little thick, and not compatible with other product like BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;The result for the aspect of anti-sunshine is fine, the prize is great too.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t make her break out so win-win.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 45 seems very close to our previous sunscreen. According to the manufacturer&#x27;s claims, it still blocks UVA and UVB rays, still contains Parsol rather than PABA, and is still non-comedogenic, waterproof, and sweat-proof. The biggest difference with Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen SPF 45 is the feel; its non-oily formula goes on and absorbs quickly, leaving both hands and skin feeling dry and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena also boasts that Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen SPF 45 contains anti-oxidant vitamins A, C, and E to help fight environmental skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have the money, this is the sunscreen I prefer, both due to the feel when it goes on (none of that dry stickiness) and the lack of that sweet smell most sunscreens have. But it&#x27;s really pricey compared to other (especially store-brand) sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My skin is not even super sensitive but everytime I tried to use it, it broke me out.  Greasy.  Yuck</li>
            <li> non -sticky, dries fast and lasts longer. Resistant to water as well. serves the purpose perfectly. would buy more definitely.</li>
            <li> The Helloplex was recommended by my dermatologist as being a great sunscreen. WRONG! I have sensitive skin and after four hours of using this sunscreen my entire face got swollen, started itching and broke out. I looked like a monster, went and saw a allergy specialist that informed me the Helloplex is one of the worst products on the market. They get the zinc into the smallest particles they can that are then able to absorb under your skin into your pores and cells. I had to use a prescription hydrocortisone cream and another cream to calm my skin. After one week I am almost back to normal. My daughter that is ten also used it and had a reaction of a rash on her face. I will never use neutrogena again! Beware if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> We went sailing for a week in the Caribbean, and our captain strongly recommended this product.  He said that it wouldn&#x27;t get the boat greasy and wouldn&#x27;t stain the upholstery.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, like some sunblocks.  And it didn&#x27;t seem to stain around the collar of shirts like some sunblock.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and feel of this sunblock. It does not smell like \\&quot;sunblock\\&quot; or perfume. It is not greasy. I read some reviews and it was suggested that Neutrogena with helioplex is one of the better sunblocks.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen after trying multiple retail store options (coppertone, etc.).  I like this one because it&#x27;s easy to pack/travel with (3.0oz), goes on easily, works well and is not very visible unless you&#x27;re looking for it.  I took off one star because it does leave a bit of white-dust on your skin (yes, I know that&#x27;s what makes it work! but still, I&#x27;m brown so it shows a bit more) and that gives it room for improvement.  Overall, I recommend this suncreen and the Amazon price is so much better than retail!</li>
            <li> This works really good. Recently in Mexico and not one single burn. I came back as white as when I left! Hahaha. It goes on nice and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling. NOT natural though so don&#x27;t use if going in the ocean or any water where animals or plants would be adversly affected. Works good in water otherwise though.</li>
            <li> Fresh and Effective. I even got tanned after a week in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad if you&#x27;re not doing a whole lot of activity.  Although it&#x27;s listed as sweat-proof, it&#x27;s not.  It will sweat right off in white streaks.</li>
            <li> This goes on very easily without much need to &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34;. It also feels great; you don&#x27;t get any residual residue or tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> I always trust in Neutrogena products, especially for the sun block lotion. It doesn&#x27;t make me having a white face, but I apply it a little bit amount at time.  It protects my skin well.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, it&#x27;s light, and Neutrogena is one of my favorite brands of sunscreen, but it&#x27;s WAY too flaky once its dried.</li>
            <li> not too dry, which is great; the light smell is nice too</li>
            <li> An excellent product even if you&#x27;re in a wet and hot weather, your skin looks great and dry. I use it in a variety of conditions and works perfect! Highly Recomended.</li>
            <li> This brand burns and stings. Hambone bought the wrong kind for a tender wife.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Hambone</li>
            <li> Only thing that&#x27;s truly sweat-proof in summer</li>
            <li> I work as an airline pilot and have fair skin, which is a recipe for skin cancer disaster. UVA and UVB rays are orders of magnitude stronger at altitude and the windows in my aircraft do not fully block all UV rays. This is my sunscreen of choice when on the job. I put it on every morning I&#x27;ll be flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It really does feel sheer. It feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. Some sunscreens (especially spray on) feel like a second skin. This is fine for the beach, but I have the rare profession where I need sunscreen and a tie at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;- The small tube size is perfect for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It still smells like sunscreen. I would prefer that it smelled more like a traditional moisturizer lotion.&lt;br /&gt;- Not waterproof. This is a day-to-day activity lotion. It&#x27;s not for the beach.&lt;br /&gt;- Much more expensive than other sunscreens. But you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get this sunscreen! I bought it to wear daily under my moisturizer. This double-pack was too good of a deal to pass up. It&#x27;s by far the best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It isn&#x27;t heavy or really even noticeable when I put it on, which is a must-have for me since my skin tends to be a bit oily. It also doesn&#x27;t smell like a traditional sunscreen, which is good because I didn&#x27;t want that noticeable sunscreen smell that so many have. It goes on really smoothly and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but not overpowering, has high SPF and Neutrogena is a good brand. I use it whenever I plan to spend some longer time outside. The scent is nice but still can use a perfume. It goes on slightly white but becomes clear. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunscreen. It is only suncreen that is not greasy but not too dry.</li>
            <li> This lotion advertises itself as a &#x27;dry&#x27; product. How lotion can dry on the skin in less than 10 seconds is a mystery  to me, yet it is dry. I work quickly with this product and would purchase it again, if only for my chest and upper arm areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely worth paying more than the store brand for this stuff. This is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy. I even use it on my face with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is light enough to wear every day under my makeup. It&#x27;s totally absorbed in minutes. My skin feels naked when I have it on. It&#x27;s not noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> Keeps me safe from sun rays while I enjoy the outdoors!</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this line of sunblock is the complete lack of residue on the skin. It actually feels like I have nothing on at all, which is the goal in my opinion. The sheer quality also holds up to light-moderate sweating and some swimming, though as with all sunblock you will have to reapply as directed to be safe. Best part is that this is about half the price I pay to purchase the sunblock at a local store!</li>
            <li> Its a great texture, leaves the skin feeling smooth and dry, not greasy at all! Second best only to home made sunblocks.</li>
            <li> Most sunscreen makes me sweat or feels greasy to me.  They also give off that sun screen aroma that makes people think I&#x27;m always the the beach.  It does have a hint of sunscreen smell but not too bad but it is not greasy or makes me sweat at all... Best one I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I relied on this product in the past years.But recently it seems they have changed the formulae and its definitely no more a dry touch as my skin feels greasy with a white film.Also I can see white creamy flakes coming out from my face if I start rubbing my face....Yuck...have to try other brands now.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL YEAR ROUND AS A HYDRATING CREAM.  IT IS PERFECT FOR ME.  I CAM RECOMMEND IT, BUT ALL PEOPLE ARE NOT THE SAME!</li>
            <li> Stings your eyes when working out...</li>
            <li> Very good protection, easy to apply, Recommended</li>
            <li> Like how it isn&#x27;t greasy but does the trick.</li>
            <li> Great feel to this and good protection after several uses. Stays on well. Not heavy, greasy, or oily. Travels well - tube is a great size for packing or keeping in a bag or in the car. Some ingredients suspect on environmental lists, so if you care about that sort of stuff read up on this one before using.</li>
            <li> This is the only sun tan location I will use because it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I like this product b/c it isn&#x27;t sticky, lasts a long time, and prevents sunburn.</li>
            <li> I took this pack to Cancun in earlier June, and it worked very well.  The area I applied this cream was not burned. And this volume 88g is perfect to take onto the plane.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I go out, sunny or not.  Great UV protection and not greasy at all.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunblock! I buy it from Amazon every year to take to the beach with me. It is very lightweight and has a pleasant smell. And most importantly, it works very well. I can even use it on my face. Most other sunblocks break my face out, but this one! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Like that fact that it&#x27;s not greasy feeling going on or afterwards. So far no issues. I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I dread wearing sunscreen because of the sticky white film that&#x27;s always left over that makes you feel greasy. This is so sheer that I use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t break me out! I use this on my body also and I&#x27;m burn free! They have this particular brand in varying strengths but I have only tried the spf 45. What&#x27;s even great is the affordable price. Definitely my go to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen overall, it&#x27;s fairly light weight and protects my easily sunburned skin from damage. I use it mainly on my face, neck, and shoulders. Occasionally it has made my face burn slightly, so probably better suited for the rest of the body for people with sensitive facial skin. My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb fully on my face, and will make my sweat run white if I&#x27;m being more active or it&#x27;s hot outside. I would definitely recommend it for the rest of the body, but not sure if it&#x27;s the best choice for face due to sometimes burning and not absorbing fully.</li>
            <li> Only sunscreen I will use as not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  Great Product that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use sunscreen often and I love an offer like this. I can&#x27;t speak on the result of it actually protecting my skin, because i didnt notice anything noticeable (maybe yet) but it seems to work enough that I&#x27;m not burnt.</li>
            <li> Product has always worked for myself and my wife. It is a ver We will continue to use ity good product</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It is by far the best I have ever found, not only because it is effective in keeping me from getting sunburned (I am a redhead, so that is a big deal for me) but it is also the least sticky/greasy of any I&#x27;ve tried.  I can&#x27;t say it is perfect, you can still tell you have it on, but you really can forget about it after a while.  I am usually very aware of wearing sunscreen, but not with this one.</li>
            <li> I felt like the item name was a bit misleading.&lt;br /&gt;It is 6 oz total, twin 3 oz packs... not two 6 oz packs.</li>
            <li> Love it! Only use Neutrogena product. Isn&#x27;t oily or anything, does a great job of protecting me from the sun.</li>
            <li> Very good. I am outdoors all day. The Sunscreen works well.  I  now use it everyday, and have avoided having red skin everyday.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice &amp; feels nice.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that I could use on my face and wouldn&#x27;t leave a white haze.  I stumbled across this and was pretty excited.  Welp, tried it one day and everything was great for about twenty minutes...until my eyes started to burn.  I hadn&#x27;t been sweating; I was just lounging around inside my house.  I suffered with it the rest of the day thinking that MAYBE my eyes will get used to it.  They didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the next day, I went over to a friend&#x27;s house and spent a few hours sitting out by their pool.  I used this sunscreen on my face again but kept it WAY far away from my eyes (stayed well above my eyebrows and left the area under my eyes completely uncovered).  If anything, it burned worse and again I wasn&#x27;t sweating.  I ended up having to throw it away.  As far as I know, I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes.  Nothing else has ever bothered them.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.  I have used this product for several years, because I like the very subtle scent and non-sticky feel.  Of course, the very effective sun protection is the best feature.  Provides sun protection for hours.</li>
            <li> delighted with this product</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this sunscreen.  While wearing dark cotton shorts &amp; a shirt, the sunscreen wiped white chalky residue all over my clothes.  I tried it one more time, hoping it was a fluke, but it happened the next time too.  It absorbs quickly, but leaves a weird film that wipes off all over dark clothing.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite sunscreen.  Goes on quick and easy, blends in, and never have any issues</li>
            <li> The product was a great price and arrived quickly. I can&#x27;t complain it&#x27;s one of my favorite brands of sun block.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for our Maintenace members to use while working outside.  Just imagine having a bunch of tough guys asking for and using a product.  They like the fact it does not show and does not leave them with an oily film and the key to protecting your skin is just that the willingness to use a product.</li>
            <li> Harsh on eyes. Due to sweat, often sunscreen lotion gets in contact with eyes and my eyes burns.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen application is usually a battle with my 3 year old with sensitive skin. This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause skin flare ups, tears and I don&#x27;t have to make from scratch. Amazing!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars, I would. Advertised as a product for those with senstive skin, I thought I would give this a try. BAD DECISION. I applied this several times a day on a trip to Disney World. By day 3, I had developed an awful, itchy rash on both of my arms. I originally thought nothing of it and took a benadryl that evening. When I woke up the next morning, I reapplied this the product, stepped out into the sun and could not stop itching. This product is garbage. I immediately discontinued use and thoroughly washed my arms to rid my skin of the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my trip when I returned home, I contacted Neutrogena. They eventually sent me a reimbursement for this product but that does not make any of the pain I endured any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone. Ever.</li>
            <li> I have awesome skin, I get complaints all the time. When I use this sunscreen on my face, I break out into huge monster sized painful zits. Since I bought this in bulk, I felt the need to use it anyway. After my mom started to insult me, I decided I needed to stop using it. My skin cleared up a week later. Instead of skin cancer I am not opting for break out free sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I like this product, its not as heavy as some of the others and I like that.</li>
            <li> Apply facial excitement，only can use for body</li>
            <li> I got an allergic reaction...</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this. Im black and this sunscreen gives me a white sheen which i guess is to be expected by a lot of regular sunscreens but i was told this wouldn&#x27;t have it. I look like a corpse if i put this product on without covering it up with makeup. It even leaves white spots if you don&#x27;t blend it properly. Yikes.</li>
            <li> Being a recent melanoma survivor, I have been tasked with wearing sufficient SPF sunscreen and also must have UVA/UVB protection.  I have always appreciated the quality product that Neutrogena sells and I really like the sheerness of this lotion.  Goes on smooth, great protection from the damaging sun rays.  PLEASE wear sunscreen, because you are worth it!  :)</li>
            <li> Yesterday I decided to do the right thing and apply sunscreen prior to going out to work in the yard.  This morning I awoke to numerous zits on my face.  Clearly this product was the culprit.  I will not use it on my face again.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy like the others and my dermatologist who is fantastic highly recommended these.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t praise these enough.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but it&#x27;s just some more expensive than buying it, say, in Walgreens, as it might be cheaper</li>
            <li> Still leaves skin feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li> 4 mum&lt;br /&gt;She love it</li>
            <li> I am dark-skinned so this sunscreen makes my skin look ashy-gray. When I sweat it drips white.</li>
            <li> Love this spf, but do not use it when you go in the water because it stings your eyes. Wish they had waterproof, but I&#x27;ll use a different one for that.</li>
            <li> The product has great quality and price. I recomnedo the seller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  I have used it snorkeling and it amazingly stays on my skin most of the day.  The only downside is that if you don&#x27;t rub i in well, you can see the whiteness of the sunscreen on your skin and in the folds inside your elbows, for example.  It is quite thick, but I am used to that.  All in all, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and so does my dermatologist. It is not greasy and attract dirt and protects from sun well.</li>
            <li> Good thing this one doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel. It does its job well under the sun. Gotta get used to the smell but it&#x27;s quite alright and that&#x27;s something that I can deal with. Very ideal for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I use this daily ever season. So, it is great to find it less expensive without waiting for a sale. The dry feeling is great for my face and body. I do not like to feel sticky or look shiny. The scent is subtle so it isn&#x27;t as if you smell like a coconut, etc.</li>
            <li> It goes on oily, unlike the Neutrogena Ultra Shear Sunblock SPF85 I have been using up to the time of this purchase.  I intend to go back to the SPF85.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for years now ... I stopped using aftershave, and put this on instead.  Gives me a smooth skin as well as sun protection, all in one step.  We lived in San Francisco, so daily sun protection was a must.</li>
            <li> Good texture, nice smell, no greasy. Love it.</li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky. The &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; lotions I&#x27;ve never heard of. If you decide to put this on while you&#x27;re wearing clothing, and in particular dark clothing, note that it&#x27;s almost as difficult as deodorant to get off.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.  Easy choice to make!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery! Good!!!!</li>
            <li> One of the best sunscreens I have tried.</li>
            <li> i loved it, the price is great, i took my time to find other prices and by far this price is the best</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is light enough to wear every day under my makeup. My skin feels naked when I have it on. It&#x27;s not noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. I love the clean feel it leaves on my skin. We got a great deal 2 for the price of 1 in drugstores.  We will be purchasing this thru Amazon again</li>
            <li> I like this product and I have been using it for years. It has a protective sunscreen agent. It is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen, it is not slimy or greasy. It is easy to apply and works.  I actually will use this product.</li>
            <li> I always get it from here. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena Ultra sheer for a couple of years now and really like it.  It is light and not greasy.     Since it is a bit expensive, I use it on my face/neck only.   It does sometimes get white in the creases, but not if you rub it in well.     Despite living in the hot sunny South, I have never burned---actually my face never gets any color at all.  Which is what I want since I do not want wrinkles and age spots.        Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I use lots of Neutrogena products including the exact same one in spf 30.  For some reason the 45 leaves white marks whereas the 30 doesn&#x27;t. It also doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as the 30.  I am disappointed since i now have 2 bottles to use up.  I will stick with the 30 or get the 55 in the small liquid bottle they sell.</li>
            <li> Use this all of the time , it was not any cheaper buying it on line, it is good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these since it&#x27;s hard to find 3oz sunblock&#x27;s to travel with in the winter. They came quickly as promised, however one of the items was not properly sealed.  The actual container leaked through the top. My husband even tried to hold a lighter under it to reseal it. That worked for a bit but once we got to our destination it started leaking again. Pretty disappointed that it got all over my stuff!</li>
            <li> Way cheaper at costco! I thought I was getting 2 6oz bottles but it turned out the description was deceiving. Please make it more clear next time!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to sunscreen for wearing under my makeup.  Its not greasy and it soaks in quickly.  I can apply the sunscreen, and my the time I get to my foundation, the sunscreen is completely absorbed and doesn&#x27;t hinder makeup application or final look.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is an excellent company.  I used this sun lotion for my grandson who has very sensitive skin.  We were in Myrtle Beach SC for a whole week and nobody got sunburn.</li>
            <li> This would always burn my sensitive skin and make my eyes water sometimes even with a light application.</li>
            <li> Sunscreens are an absolute must in Florida and Neutrogena is the only one I trust. No grease and great coverage.</li>
            <li> This was by far the worst sunscreen I have ever used. It left white residue everywhere and I had to continually reapply continuing to built on residue. Purchase another brand, we quickly tossed this out immediately after use. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Screens the sun just as described. Not oily at all, which I very much appreciate.Great travel size -- fits right in a pocket.</li>
            <li> I apply this after my moisturizer. I use Cerave, so I have to wait a few minutes to let it soak in, otherwise the Sunscreen feels heavy and greasy. It does leave my face a bit shiny, but a quick dusting of mineral powder takes care of that. Over-all great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s great for my skin</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever. Goes on well, lasts and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Remember, no matter your skin type, once you hit SPF45 there&#x27;s really no significant protection increase over that. So use this and pretend you&#x27;re a tough guy, rocking SPF45 with dreamy white Victorian era skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first sunscreen lotion that I am using.  I liked this product.  This product makes my skin look smooth and without grease! . I love this product.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Neutrogena and most sunscreens tested by Consumer Report are called **Chemical Sunscreens** not **Physical Sunscreens**. Consumer Report does their tests on Chemical formulas not Physical formulas since those are inexpensive products. I refer to Consumer Report when I am purchasing a table saw or a battery but never for anything related to my health since for that I refer to EWG. Zinc formula sunscreens will cost four times more, are not sold in big box stores but it is the same concept as consuming processed food with chemicals since those chemicals are absorbed by the skin where Physical Sunscreen formula stays outside the skin. Read Ingredients of anything that you apply to your skin just like you would be consuming inside the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical, blocks both UVA (320–400 nm) and UVB (280–320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer – 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin’s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.</li>
            <li> This is the product that has worked best for me over the years.  I made a stupid mistake and tried Livestrong which was twice as expensive and half as effective.  Happy to be back using this product.</li>
            <li> I use it but I don&#x27;t like it. It makes my skin turn bright red, which turns back to the normal color after a few minutes. I don&#x27;t remember any other sunscreen causing this reaction before. Because of this, I will not repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> It is good, but not perfect. It is not as light as the other I am used to and I have to spread it hard to not having my skin white. Also, if it gets in contact with the eyes, it burns. Since it does the job of protecting against the sun light and it is not greasy, I can give 4 stars. It is the best I can buy for this price.</li>
            <li> Like many other people, I bought this sunscreen because of all the great reviews on this website. Honestly, after using it a few times, it does the opposite of what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this, the spray, and the clear face and they ALL burned my skin, felt extremely greasy (especially on my face) and no matter how long I waited after I applied it it immediately streaked down my face/eyes when I sweat or went in the water. It is strong, I have not burnt when using it (and trust me I burn within 5 minutes without sunscreen) but I feel like people who have these problems dont apply the proper amount. The amount for the face alone should be a shot glass full, and even more on each area of the body. And im sorry, I like in Buffalo where you dont have nice days without extreme mugginess, the last thing I want to feel when I am hot and sweaty in greasy and sticky. Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> For years, I was happy with my Ocean Potion SPF 50 sunscreen (pink bottle), which I still use on my lower body sometimes because it works great, it&#x27;s less expensive, and it smells wonderful (hint of orange). But I was looking for something that would be a little less sticky around my face, neck and chest, and friend of my turned me on to Neutrogena Ultrasheer Dry Touch. I love this stuff. It goes on easily, spreads well and within minutes is dry to the touch. Really. I use quite a bit of sunscreen (technically, you are supposed to slop it on, not use it sparingly), so I needed one that would not \\&quot;ball up\\&quot; even when I used a lot on my face. I&#x27;ve read a few complaints where people said it just smeared and balled up or gooped up on the skin (that&#x27;s the extent of my technical terminology). That just means that one has used too much and it didn&#x27;t absorb everything or that you put too many layers on (Avoid putting a thin layer on the then another one on top -- just do it all in one go, and you should be fine). For such a high SPF, this one smells pretty good, and the scent wears away quickly. The only negative is that it is fairly expensive. I pay it because I like it and think it&#x27;s worth it. I haven&#x27;t found one better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day for years and it works great. I have never had a sunburn and everyone says that I look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I burn easily and this keeps me safe in the garden.</li>
            <li> excellent for everyday use, not greasy, spent years using it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Goes on smooth and light. This is the only kind I buy</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year.  I&#x27;m not sure I will order again as it has an oily appearance even though it says it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li> Great Sunscreen for most activities and situations. If I spend an entire day outside (8am-5pm) with no shade, this protects me with a morning application and another at lunchtime. Feels great on the skin and face, no irritation. No smell either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I have with it is this: It leaves a blue tint on stuff you touch. Most noticeably on leather car seats, and even more noticeably if its black. I spent a day autocrossing using this sunscreen and my car (outside) and seats were covered in blueish smudges. It took a while to figure out but once I suspected the sunscreen, I tested it and sure enough, blue smudges wherever the skin touches the materials (and has a little time to dry on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its (fairly) easy to clean off with water and a soft tower or a wash for the more sensitive paint. I also used leather cleaner to help with the seats since rinsing them wasn&#x27;t very practical. Since the product caused no damage other than cosmeticly, I only took off one star because for most activities at the beach or pool or out in the yard playing with the kids or doing work, it wont be a problem. I will be looking for a different sunscreen for motor activities but will keep this for beach and outside use otherwise.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted at a great price!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on the skin and really prevents sun burn. I think it&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Package well.  Arrived on time.  This is a great sunscreen.  Goes on smooth and does not leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Although I try to be consistent in remembering to apply sunscreen, it usually happened that when I did, someone would inevitably say something about how they could *tell* I was wearing sunscreen.  Which is kind of discouraging.  After a fair bit of research, I decided to give this product a chance.  I&#x27;m really happy that I did!  This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used - it&#x27;s so light and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is a little too greasy, or maybe just for me. I think not as dry-touch as the description. The scent is ok</li>
            <li> Very high quality...I have ultra sensitive skin and it works super.....I love the scent and it goes on pretty clear.</li>
            <li> Neutregena&#x27;s product is as it describes able to provide excellent sunscreen protection while you are sunbathing and swimming.  It&#x27;s a nice soft cream that is dry and not greasy.  I enjoyed using it &#x27;cause it&#x27;s very light and not greasy.  Plus it&#x27;s just very effective at what it does.  I did not get burned while using it on a recent trip to the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sunscreen. Not much to complain about.</li>
            <li> Works well enough but never fully rubs in and leaves a white powdery layer on your skin, your clothes, and anything you sit on.</li>
            <li> love this sunscreen, drys quickly and leaves skin soft not sticky.</li>
            <li> Stains all of our clothes. I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark skinned fellow (Indian) and this product come up blue on my skin.  Even when I rub it in vigorously, you can still see it.  I&#x27;m an avid athlete, so when I start to sweat, powder shows up all over my skin.  I gave it to my girlfriend who is fair skinned, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Great to keep a sunburn off your junk</li>
            <li> Very good and portable sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, which is great. Works well.</li>
            <li> I consider Neutrogena among the best sunscreens one can use.  Ordering it online costs less than what I can purchase it for in most stores.</li>
            <li> I have had extreem sun exposure in the past. I completed a chemo peel ordered by my dermatologist. I always use a sun screen and Neutrogena is nice not the skin and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> It was so light on the skin. The smell was decent. I feel more confident going out in the sun now.</li>
            <li> The product matches the description.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Non-greasy, after a minute or two doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;ve got sunscreen on. It is very lightweight but provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> I trust Neutrogena and I have used this Sheer cream before and it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a white face. It worked for me in PNG no sign of sun on my arms and face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all the great reviews on this stuff. I bought the 2 pack 45spf. It&#x27;s very thick, leaves a white film. Flakes off nasty if you rub it at all. Settles in neck creases. It&#x27;s not as bad if you use moisturizer first to help it smooth in. And put a light amount on. But if you put alot on to get good coverage, yikes. But on dry skin you&#x27;ll have a white film. Absorbs better into to hands and arms, just not face &amp; neck. And it does burn a little. But so do alot of suncreens on face.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my husband who has a propensity for pre-cancerous lesions.  He has had 2 different dermatologists recommend this product.  It blends in well, non greasy and not too aromatic.  Great product!  Even with tax, it is less expensive through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly effective -- both against UVA and UVB. (I&#x27;m have lupus and am extremely photosensitive and need a sunscreen that protects against UVA &amp; UVB)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy -- a big bonus when using it on my hands. It&#x27;s a good price from Amazon, especially compared to my local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Neugrogena Ultra Sheer -- it works and since it feels so nice and is so easy to use, I don&#x27;t hate putting it on every day.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.  Not messy or gooey. Smell great and works well.</li>
            <li> Bought this on the recommendation of my ex-girlfriend and enjoyed it more than I expected. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to the cheap slimy stuff again!</li>
            <li> I should have read more reviews before purchasing.  This product burned my arms as soon as I applied it.  I had to wash it off.  I&#x27;ve used other Neutrogena products without any burning results.  I am a redhead with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not sticky even though you can feel it on your skin. Great protection</li>
            <li> Seems to dry really quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to it. Seems to dry skin out a bit.</li>
            <li> I really like it! replaced my existing 50 spf sunscreen which was too greasy and made me look dark. This is actually light weight on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The tubes were bigger than I expected...was looking for something travel size.</li>
            <li> I hate the feel of sunscreen, but I love being outdoors at the shore so I use it.  Of all the sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, this was the least greasy and heavy feeling on my skin.  The high SPF rating is great, any higher is overkill and no better for screening.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of the greasy feeling you get when wearing sunblock, even the so called &#x27;non greasy&#x27; formulas still felt icky. After reading the positive reviews of this product I purchased with high hopes and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It really does go on smooth, there is a slightly moist feeling when you first apply it, but as that evaporates or dries out, after a minute or two its soft as your normal skin. I didn&#x27;t even feel the need to wash my hands after applying it. I put on a pretty liberal coat in the morning for a full day in a theme park, as I have done in the past. The instructions noted a need to re-appyly every 80 min or so, but I didn&#x27;t heed the warning and returned to my hotel to find my exposed area quite red. Lesson learned, follow the instructions. I kept on top of the reapplications over the course of the next few days, and even in the baking Las Vegas sun and had no further issues. I highly recommend this product, with the caveat that you need to reapply every couple hours as the instructions state, something that wasn&#x27;t really necessary with my older sunblock. However for the tradeoff of not feeling like a greased sausage all day in the sun, its well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but a few days after purchasing it here I found the same twin-pack at Costco (plus a few trial size extras) for a few dollars cheaper. Not worth the hassle of returning, but its frustrating when that happens!</li>
            <li> Used it on my face and experienced drying and mild irritation. Never had any allergy before. Usually use run of the mill banana boat. I&#x27;m not normally sensitive to skin products in general.</li>
            <li> SPF30 smells much better. you know, the coconut-y, normal sunscreen smell you smell on beach. but this one smells like plastic. ew.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Just adds assurance that I have complete SPF Protection and works nicely under foundation.  I plan to continue using it on face and throat and back of neck.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist! Used by make up artists! Great product!</li>
            <li> Great item as described.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and feels dry to the touch after application. No sticky sunblock feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible. My eyes and face is burn  after use this.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my friend recommended it for my mum. The discount sweetens things. No complaints yet.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors. I am a triathlete and boater. I have tried numerous types of sunscreen. There were many things that prompted me to purchase this sunscreen. First, is that this is a broad spectrum sunscreen (protects against both uva and uvb rays). Second, is the endorsement from dermatologist. Third, is the promise of a light, non greasy application.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen truly delivers on all fronts. While wearing this as directed on a cruise, I was never once burnt despite being out in the sun for hours. I was especially impressed that once I applied the sunscreen I could not tell I had it on. Most sunscreens leave a sticky, greasy feeling. This simply felt like a light moisturizer. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but in my opinion, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is only the best sunblock ever! Not oily at all! And the same product could sell for twice the price at my local store. So worth buying!</li>
            <li> but too bad it has a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;but too bad it has a strong smell&lt;br /&gt;but too bad it has a strong smell&lt;br /&gt;but too bad it has a strong smell</li>
            <li> I only trust this sunscreen</li>
            <li> This is great sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave greasy or sticky mess.  My wife love&#x27;s it and prefers it over all other brands.</li>
            <li> That is what I expected. Just in time&lt;br /&gt;I apreciatte too a very good price . I can recomend in the future</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. And I have nothing bad to say. Doesn&#x27;t melt, isn&#x27;t greasy, protects your skin. What else could you possibly want?</li>
            <li> I love lightweight feeling~dry-touch almost like body lotion</li>
            <li> This is a great non-oily sunscreen &amp; absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I needed a good sun screen with a little higher SPF and in a packable size for a trip to Greece.  I had used this product before for my face and was pleased with it&#x27;s more matte like qualities as compared to most other face products with SPF. This worked well for my needs.  It is priced reasonably and this quantity lasted for both of us using it on our arms and faces for the whole trip.</li>
            <li> My mom uses this and always says how expensive they are. This was a great deal. Especially for two! Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the twin pack because it had a value size to it as well as it&#x27;s good to fit into our Harley bags for keeping it small and not taking up lots of space.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with another Neutrogena product spf15, that I didn&#x27;t hesitate at all when decided to buy this one with higher spf. But after applying it I got really disappointed: it smells very unpleasant, like rubber or something. And if you don&#x27;t spread it evenly - you will soon notice white stains on your face. However hard I tried to rub this sunscreen into my skin - I couldn&#x27;t get rid of white stains..&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this product is that it isn&#x27;t greasy, though this makes it harder to rub in</li>
            <li> Works well and not greasy.  Worked well all summer long</li>
            <li> great protection from the suns rays</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen on my sensitive, fair skin for years. I love it and will keep using it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> The spf is more then enough (30 spf blocks 97 percent of harmful rays and every extra 10spf only protects you from like another .5 percent) and I find it to be moisturizing even though it doesn&#x27;t claim to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have oily skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t make it any worse for as long as I keep using my skin creams for oily skin regularly.</li>
            <li> Dont need to apply much and after a minute, you wouldnt even know you have it on, and it was very protective.  Love the small size as you can carry it with ease and reapply when ever you need to.  And you don&#x27;t waste it as a tub is about the right size per person for a 6 days beach trip!</li>
            <li> I am hyper allergic to sun light ( medical term is polymorphic light eruption) and my dermatologist recommended this (spf 45 or up).&lt;br /&gt;What should I say more? ;)</li>
            <li> If you hate the feel of sunscreen and you have sensitive skin, this sunscreen is great.  It feels drier and not oily and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.  My oldest child has eczema and this is perfect for him.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  It actually feels like a power after you rub it in.</li>
            <li> This product is what you would expect. I would recommend it to a friend and I will buy it again if needed. I&#x27;ve put it on before going into water and it still worked!</li>
            <li> While they may seem small at first, they really last quite a long time. I was particularly pleasantly surprised by the non-greasy nature of the sunscreen; for while any sunscreen will make your hands/body a bit greasy, these were surprisingly good on this front. With a family history of Melanoma, I&#x27;ll come back to this brand for that never-ending fight against the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> Out of most sunscreens this is pretty matte. I have really oily skin so I was happy to have found this. I gave it four stars since I have had better sunscreens from Japan and from other more expensive brands that are  more matte. After a few hours, this did give me a bit of a sheen, in spring.</li>
            <li> I only buy this brand! Their sun lotions give me magnificent protection and long-lasting tan. They are also really easy to apply and smell nice without being too beachy/coconutty.  I use the SPF45 for the first 1-2 sun exposures and then switch to SPF30. I have relatively fair skin and it still protects me wonderfully!</li>
            <li> It always work and I can depend on it on days where I&#x27;ve been binge studying all night and a little sleep and also use it for intense workouts. It&#x27;s amazing and keeps you awake without any side effects or addictive feelings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 30 for a long time, and love it. I ordered 45 because that&#x27;s what was available. It feels more greasy which is a bummer, but I still prefer it over other brands. The bottles I received are as described and they arrived on time.</li>
            <li> To fully understand what my endorsement means, you need to have a little backstory. My mom DOUSED herself,  me and my sister in sunscreen throughout our childhoods, and she tried everything--Banana Boat, store brands, you name it, trying to protect our incredibly fair skin from the sun. When she got skin cancer when I was 18 I realized how important it was that I keep using sunscreen, but everything I tried was either ineffective or incredibly greasy and unpleasant. Believe me when I say I tried EVERYTHING--sprays, countless brands, sticks, creams, everything imaginable. I had finally settled on one I didn&#x27;t particularly like when I went back to visit my mom and found this in her medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is gold. Not only does it COMPLETELY protect my skin, but it is not at all greasy and soaks in right away. Before, even with sunscreen, I would burn even if I just took a quick walk outside. Now I can go to the beach in direct sunlight for two or three hours and my skin not only doesn&#x27;t burn but feels better and softer at the end of the day. Most sunscreens, after applying, I feel like I need to wash my hands right away--not with this! Usually with sunscreen I have to wait 10-20 minutes before putting clothes back on, and with this stuff I wait two minutes and I&#x27;m ready to go. Also, the \\&quot;sunscreen smell\\&quot; is not strong at all, and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS. Most people I know are skeptical about sunscreen simply because of the greasy feeling they have all day, and I always recommend they try this. I&#x27;m a devoted customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;(small side note--as with all sunscreen, be aware of the expiration date. people often forget about it and throw on some sunscreen they found in the back of their medicine cabinet from 1994, to disastrous results)</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen product available for skin that tends to break out!</li>
            <li> Oh, how happy I was when I found this product a few years ago.  Pricey, perhaps, but SO worth it.  High SPF, non-greasy, UVA and UVB blocking, what wasn&#x27;t there to love?  My entire family of fair redheads depended on it for year-round protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, though, things were different.  I eagerly stocked up on eight bottles of the SPF 45 before the start of the sunny season -- in previous years we used SPF 85 or 100 but I had faith in the claims that anything over SPF 30 was of negligible benefit -- and slathered it on the first time I was in the sun for an extended period.  Even with wearing long sleeves and a wide-brimmed sun hat I ended up with what (I thought) was a painful burn all over my face and neck.  It took a couple of weeks to clear and often resembled a rash, with raised, red bumps that itched like nobody&#x27;s business.  I didn&#x27;t make the connection until the next time I used it and had the same result within hours.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup and I don&#x27;t use cleansers on my face; the only moisturizer I use is specifically for sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been using for a long time with no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research I discovered that what I have is a photoallergic reaction to this sunblock, which means the sunblock itself doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction, but once it comes into exposure with sunlight it does.  Which completely nullifies the point of sunblock in the first place.  I also read that Neutrogena had changed its formula and the older \\&quot;blue label\\&quot; bottles were different than the new \\&quot;black label\\&quot; ones - checking a leftover bottle from last year with the new ones from this year proved that the formula does appear significantly different, with this year&#x27;s sunblock containing a number of new complicated chemical names I can&#x27;t pronounce.  One or more of them no longer jives with my extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;ve spent upwards of a month suffering from red, itchy, oozing, tight, dry, skin, which is now starting to peel and looks a fright.  I haven&#x27;t wanted to leave my house and I can&#x27;t even count the number of times I&#x27;ve been asked if I&#x27;m all right/too hot/contagious.  Horrifying.  I am so very disappointed that I can&#x27;t even properly express it.  I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board looking for a new sunblock that can protect myself and my family without giving us chemical burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A real bummer.ooks a fright.

            <li> speads easy, does not clog pores. I have a sensitive skin so I need something that is not very greasy but spreads well. this does exactly that. It does not clog pores but gives good coverage against the sun. Cannot use in winters that it does not fight the dryness due to heating in winters.</li>
            <li> On time .- I like to use Neutorgena ...- tks ...-</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 45 Twin Pack 3.0 Ounce good quality and fair price.&lt;br /&gt;We are ready to enjoy a safe summer</li>
            <li> lo mejor, protege y mantiene el rostro hidratado y el acabado en sedoso y matte todo el dia, un HIT!</li>
            <li> Great product the leaves no residue. Living in a hot tropical environment where the sun is present all the time, I need good broad spectrum sun protection year around.  I go through a tube every 3 to 4 weeks so this twin pack is a good deal inmy opinion. I usually apply only on my body but have used it only face without any problem (face gets a different sun screen).  It goes on everyone in my family including the littlest person.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. The usual Neutrogena quality, but the best thing is that it&#x27;s not greasy.....  Yes it&#x27;s a little more expensive than some of the other ones out there, but it&#x27;s worth it.....</li>
            <li> Beware-- they say it&#x27;s a twin pack, 6 oz. So naturally I thought it was two 6 oz tubes. It&#x27;s not, there are two 3 oz tubes. Disappointed in the misleading description of the product(which it only says the ounces in the headline, no where else in the description).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  The ultra sheer is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy.  I fly gliders and we get a lot of sun exposure.  I need to feel confident that my skin is protected from all the harmful rays and sunburns just hurt! :)  Again, very happy with this sun cream.</li>
            <li> good price, good quality!!!</li>
            <li> Received in good shape. Thanks Bob</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen a lot and it fits with the crazy 3 oz rule that the airport enforces. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores, isn&#x27;t overly greasy, and works great for me.</li>
            <li> It comes in 3 ounce bottles, which is only really a little bit of product, but it is well worth the money, because of the fact that it really isn&#x27;t remotely greasy and only has the slightest, virtually undetectable sunscreen smell, and it does what it is supposed to. This is exactly what I was looking for because I have very fair skin, and I typically despise wearing sunscreen because of the smell, and the shine and how heavy it feels, but this sunscreen is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 8 year old son who has very sensitive skin.  The main issue I have with this product is that it never rubs in fully, which makes it&#x27;s name \\&quot;ultra sheer\\&quot; very misleading.  It leaves you white for the entire day.  It also isn&#x27;t that great for sensitive skin and my son said it stung when I rubbed it on.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with the spray version of Neutorgena.</li>
            <li> I saw this two pack for a bargain price at a local retail store.  I figured I would try it given the fact that I&#x27;ve had good luck with Neutrogena sunblocks in the past.  After using this for the past two days, I will not be applying it to my face ever again.  It has irritated the skin badly and my face now has a ruddy complexion.  It almost looks as though I&#x27;ve received a mild sunburn.  This product has noticeably dried my face.  I have not experienced pain nor discoloration on my arms or neck.  I do not recommend this for people with sensitive skin.  If you want a good daily sunblock, I recommend either the Neutrogena Ultimate Sport SPF 30 or Blue Lizard Sensitive (all natural).</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It goes on nice and sheer (requires some rubbing in) but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this product. It&#x27;s great for having SPF without the grease, white residue and sunblock odor! This is a solid product + great price.</li>
            <li> The user of this sunscreen is very particular on the specific sunscreen she uses.  This is the exact sunscreen she uses and the expiration code is 2014 which is also nice.  It would behoove vendors to note the expiration date to alleviate fear of getting expired product.  I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite non-beauty sunscreen. It&#x27;s incredibly light and absorbs immediately; I find myself actually wanting/needing to use as much sunscreen as the doc recommends for your face. In your hand, it feels a lot like moisturizer - but a tad thicker. Once it&#x27;s on your face, you can&#x27;t tell the difference. There&#x27;s no scent that I can perceive, which I like. The product goes quickly if you use it regularly (2-3 months per bottle), so you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s twin pack.</li>
            <li> this is repurchase, it&#x27;s a great value to purchase in a pack.</li>
            <li> Light and non-greasy, this easily stand up to any department store brand sunscreen - without the dept, store price.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a shot and fell in love.  It&#x27;s affordable and it goes on without grease.  I feel protected and that&#x27;s what is important.  I use it daily on my arms and hands.</li>
            <li> I like the product - it goes on easily and has a spf 45 rating -&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have offensive smell.  Good value.</li>
            <li> a little stuffy for my face, and hard to spread</li>
            <li> I like this as a body sunscreen. For face? I&#x27;ve moved onto Asian sunscreens, which are less greasy and leave no white cast. This is still one of the best America sunscreens on the market but it is very emollient. I could forego face lotion when I had this. Be mindful of how it impacts makeup (if you wear it), I used it with drier liquid foundations but didn&#x27;t like it with more watery foundation.</li>
            <li> I wear this under makeup in California heat, it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;sweat&#x27; or become oily. I use it sparingly, I don&#x27;t slap it on.  It&#x27;s a really good product and tends to give a little glow to my regular makeup. Great price for a two pack, now I can finally keep one in my purse for touch-ups when driving in killer sun-glare.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I have ever come across. It is exactly what it promises to be. I love that it&#x27;s non-greasy and it&#x27;s wonderful as a makeup primer too! It also doesn&#x27;t turn white...  No more second thoughts before putting on sunscreen. I love everything about it! I&#x27;ll continue to purchase more and more and more till the sun is no more. Everyone should give this a try.</li>
            <li> Always use this generously before going to stay outside for a long time. Actually happy with SPF 30. The 45 is fine. Reapply every two hours so prevent sunburning.</li>
            <li> So nice and good service</li>
            <li> It caked on my face after only half hour.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy, i have sensitive skin and i wear this on my face and body.  Never had a burn with it</li>
            <li> if I buy this product in Korea, I have to pay about 25 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Above all I am satisfied with the price.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it&#x27;s good, not glossy and do good performance to screen sun rays.</li>
            <li> I experienced an itchy bumpy red rash after using this sunscreen, so I cannot recommend it.  It also burned my eyes terribly when some lotion-tainted sweat ran into them.  I have never had any such issues with Banana Boat or NoAd sunscreens.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, love the product. price reasonable</li>
            <li> I break out in a red itchy rash every summer when I use sunscreen.  I figured I&#x27;d give the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer a try and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  It is not greasy and I was out in the sun alot and I never burned one time.  It is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  However, I broke out just a little but no where near as miserably as I usually do.  I will most definitely use Neutrogena from now on.</li>
            <li> The first time I use this moisturizer my face started to burn me, I used it a second time and I felt my face burning me again, so I discounted using it.  I used other Neutrogena  products on my face before and this is the first time I have a problem.</li>
            <li> love this product. this is oen of the best sunscreens for the price!</li>
            <li> We have many sunscreen bottles in our house - sport, baby, sensitive skin, spray. Neutrogena Ultra Sheer is my favorite out of all of them. I use it on my body and face. I applies easily and feels like regular lotion once rubbed in. I will always have this on hand.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen and we got it quickly. I definitely would get a larger size if you have a big family. One beach trip and half of it is gone from the tube.</li>
            <li> Great sunblock that goes on really smooth. Use these for myself and the family all the time.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite sunscreen.  It goes on and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and has good protection.  I kept missing the local sales, but Amazon had a decent price and it came to me at my home.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this Neutrogena sunscreen twin pack at Amazon. I&#x27;ve used this specific sunscreen for over a year due to skin cancer and have been very happy with its protection. I put it on after a moisturizer and before makeup. It hasn&#x27;t seemed to negatively impact my complexion. As with any sunscreen, it&#x27;s important to reapply if you&#x27;re out in the sun or in the water for a lengthy period of time.</li>
            <li> The creme worked very well and i did not get burned but still got tanned. I liked it as it did not leave an oily skin after being applied.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen for outdoor activities...  hiking and backpacking... I hate greasy sunscreens or ones with heavy fragrance.  It&#x27;ll get everywhere - on your clothes, sleeping bag, tent, hands, food...  this is the only brand and model I&#x27;ll buy.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It came on time and fast, and everything work perfectly. Sorry my english.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.  It takes very little time in the sun for me to get sunburn. And I live in Latin America, which means we get sunny days most of the time.  Neutrogena ultra sheer will get the job done, and it doesn&#x27;t feel (or look)greasy, so I can use it every day without my skin acting up, or looking like i just soaked my face with baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomended, and remember:  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Feels great - not greasy at all.  I reduced by one star because  if I use it at the end of my face (near hairline) or at the edges of my neck by the shoulders, I break out.  Therefore, I put in on the areas that tend to develop dark spots and then cover entire face and neck with my usual Oil of Olay factor 15.</li>
            <li> Feel smooth and the sun don&#x27;t burn as it use to...easy to open and have no bad smell.</li>
            <li> ...but it left a white reside where my arms brushed up against the front and sides of my shirt. I don&#x27;t remember that being a problem with the last tube of this that I bought.</li>
            <li> do not buy this sun cream to protect your face! you will feel pain. Has lot of alcohol on it. I would only recommend only for body lotion.</li>
            <li> Nautrogena doesn&#x27;t advertise this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Spray sunscreens can be inhaled, and they don’t cover skin completely.&lt;br /&gt;-SPF values above 50+ try to trick you into believing they’ll prevent sun damage. Don’t trust them. SPF protection tops out at 30 to 50.&lt;br /&gt;-Oxybenzone can disrupt the hormone system.&lt;br /&gt;-Retinyl palmitate may trigger damage, possibly cancer.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  I just had a skin cancer removed so I now use this ALL THE TIME.  Thought the price was good too, but then saw it at Costco for less.</li>
            <li> Having always used neutrogena products for my skin, this sun protecting lotion has a lightweight feel that does not leave my skin oily. It&#x27;s fast absorbing and graet for everyday use underneath makeup.</li>
            <li> Does not have the cheap perfume smell which most manufacturers seem to think we need.  Also, it is easy to rub into the skin&lt;br /&gt;and does not show as a white mask on your face.  Those were the two things I wanted and they are not easy to find in the same&lt;br /&gt;product.  Way to go, Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> love the product, upset at how overpriced it is. I understand im paying for convenience but i didnt expect 50% markup. Buy this from costco or even walgreens</li>
            <li> This is our family&#x27;s favorite sunscreen! It protects well, only has a slight smell, dries fast, and isn&#x27;t greasy at all (that&#x27;s the best part). Being the bottles are quite small, and we fly through them - it was great to find them in multipacks at a good price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is my favorite brand for sunscreen.  I&#x27;m still looking for one that isn&#x27;t quite as greasy feeling, but this stuff sure works.</li>
            <li> maybe this is a good sun screen but for dry skins... specially under my make up... it&#x27;s awful! when it dries it becomes like powdery and imagine how does a foundation work on it... It&#x27;s not gonna work actually.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! The perfect daily sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been wearing it under my makeup every day for months.</li>
            <li> If you like looking like you are covered in white body makeup, use this stuff.  Remember how lifeguards used to have a pile of white paste on their noses that stayed there all day?  That&#x27;s how this stuff works.  You put it on and it stays white.  I applied it (like many other brands in the past that worked fine) and assumed the white color would fade as it soaked in.  It didn&#x27;t.  Over an hour later it was still showing in spots I hadn&#x27;t rubbed really hard to get it to apply like it should.  After another hour, I went in the water, and as I got out I saw on my chest and stomach what looked like skim milk dribbling down!  The stuff was actually visibly washing off in the salt water.  Another hour later and I could still see white in the folds of my skin on my arm and elsewhere.  And this was after applying other brands.  I have 2 tubes I threw in the trash.</li>
            <li> Great value for a great product.</li>
            <li> Fine product, works well, nice package for our emergency kits, will be buying lots more</li>
            <li> i like this sunscreen because it doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue on skin. it is absorbed completely</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF is a good product. I bought a tube at&lt;br /&gt;cvs and it was much high than the twin pkg. The best part  about  on line  buying, it comes right to your door.</li>
            <li> I like it, less oil. It&#x27;s very useful！I will buy it next time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend others to use it.</li>
            <li> When I opened product, it was all separated and goopey.  I think it got too hot or too cold during shipping.  I went out and bought some at the grocery store.  Even though it&#x27;s more expensive, at least it&#x27;s useable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this sunscreen when doing yard work and other out door tasks, but every time I begin to sweat around my forehead, the sunscreen drips down into my eyes, causing a sharp burning sensation to the point where I can barely keep my eyes open. I would not recommend using this sunscreen when doing any type of physical activity or if you are doing something that may cause you to sweat.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for the face that I have ever found.</li>
            <li> I just keep buying this.  Feels the best on my face and head (I&#x27;m bald!) compared to everything else.  I hate how sunblock feels, but this is alright.  I put it on, I sweat a bunch, and I don&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> not greasy and great for your face. I always grab for this one forst</li>
            <li> good coverage, minimal smell, no pasty-white skin after application.  I put this on my acne-prone skin and don&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> recommended by the doctor. Has no eye irritation that have experienced with other sun blocks</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and they work very well. I find if I set it with a powder after letting it sit on my skin for 10-20 minutes, it causes no difference to the performance of my face makeup. I haven&#x27;t gotten burnt wearing it yet so five stars for doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Thought this would be matt and not greasy well it isn&#x27;t. I am not impressed and plan to look for another protecion that is less greasy , more sheer and matte. Edit : now i stopped using it all together even when I need it cause it gave me pimples /acne .. you need to have a dry and not sensitive skin to use this and again this is not matte nor dry!! I am surprised Neutrogena would make such claims that are not at all true ! very disappointed .. the smell is divine though like sambac jasmine so my way out not to through it is use it as a hand and feet protection...also my daughter who doesn&#x27;t have an acne prone skin adores the semll and uses it on her whole body before going swimming..</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  goes oneasily without a greasy feel.  works well.</li>
            <li> Pretty low grease. Dry application. Good for the face, GREAT for sunny SoCal. Didn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me break out. And I avoided sunburn through an entire drought-ridden summer in San Diego.&lt;br /&gt;There are dryer/healthier options but the price on these is really good for a decently high quality product.</li>
            <li> Best lightweight sunscreen on the market</li>
            <li> Really like this Neutrogena product. It is NOT greasy on the skin and protects very well.</li>
