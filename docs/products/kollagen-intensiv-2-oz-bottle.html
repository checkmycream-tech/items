            <li>, I called Rejuvalskin and asked for a refund referencing the free two week trial.</li>

            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>so unless your willing to pay this do not enroll...and the number one reason not to get hooked... it does not work which is even more reason to stop........</li>
            <li>It is a nice face cream it goes on well for under makeup use and alone it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product through a free trial program and if you do not cancel after 30 of signing up for the product they automatically send you \\&quot;2\\&quot; months worth of their product for basically $100....</li>
            <li>This product caused me to break out in a mild rash.</li>
            <li>The cream absorb quickly disappear into my skin.</li>
            <li>just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li>Out of the features it said, the only b one ive experienced so far are th r return of moisture to my face without causing my skin to be greasy or.oily.</li>
            <li>i missed the special offer they got this one really work</li>

            <li>You will receive the next shipment and have your account debited more than $100 and there is no return policy if you have decided the trial sample isn&#x27;t something you want to purchase again.  </li>
            <li>he stated that it was in the first shipment</li>
            <li>I love the product as it helps moisturize the facial skin.</li>
            <li>I informed them it took 3 days to receive the first product 5 days and mail.</li>
            <li>Make my face feel smooth and soft</li>
            <li>a was using it for more than one year and now that I order from Amazon is not the same product !</li>
            <li>It also seems to last longer than advertised; I have used ir more than 2 months and still have plenty in the jar.</li>
            <li>I still have wrinkles, but they are not as evident.</li>
            <li>I have seen no discernible difference, particularly for the $100 investment I have apparently made that it is that much better than Regenerist.  </li>
            <li>the product is good but the jar I received was only half filled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of treatments, specially the ones to be used around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;No way, because it irritates my eyes a lot, even far from my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like to put it on my face when my skin is still warm and slightly damp.</li>
            <li>And still now my skin looks dry and my wrinkles are more visible than before I started using the kollagen intensiv</li>
            <li>My skin  looks better, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>It is not so much for the product, which I did not care for, but the Company itself.  </li>
            <li>I was very upset when my product arrived today.  </li>
            <li>I USE THE WHOLE</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li>After faithfully using it every day for about a month, I have seen am improvement in my complexion and the wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes are not as prominent.</li>
            <li>Be aware the 30 days start when you order and not when you receive the product, so you have to cancel early.  </li>
            <li>while this is a basically decent product, beware getting started on the trial version of their opportunity to try it at a reduced price.  </li>
            <li>was a little hesistant, but am satisfied with Kollagn Intensiv.  </li>
            <li>After using this product a month, my skin is brighter and even, a little firmer, but the wrinkles are more visible .</li>
            <li>I saw this product on the internet and filled out the contact information but changed my mind and closed the window.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer but not effective with minimizing the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>there was a very large air pocket in the middle.</li>
            <li>I received 2 new jars and I guess I will finish them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re not going to be depend on it.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I use it only 1 time a week or 2 or 3 times a month.&lt;br /&gt;So, because it works very well, no dependency on it, you can use it over the skin that protects your eyes (just over your eyes; no skin irritation), and on your whole face...</li>
            <li>have only to close your eyes and rub with a certain strenght the cream</li>
            <li>They made the interior of the jar smaller by making it out of a much thicker plastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Beware and do as I did, submit a complaint to the Federal Trade Commision and Better Business Bureau</li>
            <li>people have to know is that you have to use it at least 4 months to be sure it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;After using the cream 1 time a day (no need to use it at night) for 4 months, just use it 3 times a week or less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the product; it gives my skin soft, smooth, and firm.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this was too much for me, but it works for my husband, he has dry, mature skin.</li>
            <li>However, the email failed to mention that we would be charged the full product amount for the free trial after the two week period.&lt;br /&gt;Rejuvalskin is ripping off the consumer with these deceptive, unscrupulous, and fraudulent  product marketing practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was later contacted by someone offering a 30 day free trial for even less money for shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li>I love the cream but the jar came half empty.  </li>
            <li>If they send you a new order your cost will be $99.00 be prepared to pay this every month because they will not let you send the product back...</li>
            <li>/&gt;After taking a shower, before going to work, I use that cream very well, using some strenght, wait 10 minutes to get dry, and I use some cosmetic powder over my face to hide any redness and to protect my skin from the Sun</li>
            <li>consumers beware of this or at least make sure to cancel prior to your trial period.  </li>
            <li>As far as the product is concerned I haven&#x27;t used enough of it to know...</li>
            <li>am trying now to go back to where my skin was before, and is coming back using natural moisturizers masks</li>
            <li>you can substitute it with one of their other products but beware you will start a new subscription with them. .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought it for my wife who loves it and I agree it is effective. Recommended by a friend who also believes it is&lt;br /&gt;effective.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and my third bottle. I do love the product. I have been using it for about two years. I am 69 so I&#x27;m coming to this product late. I have many wrinkles before I got the product. I&#x27;m not going to say my wrinkles are gone, that&#x27;s not possible without surgery, but I will say the wrinkles are softer and not as deep. Some of the smaller line are gone and that&#x27;s why I keep using and ordering Kollagen. It feels wonderful to use and I love the look and feel of my skin after I apply it. I like to put it on my face when my skin is still warm and slightly damp. Kollagen absorbs right in and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Was contacted by a rep, well I ordered it could not resist. My skin  looks better, but not what I expected. I received 2 new jars and I guess I will finish them.  I have to say I used LifeCell,a little pricey, But let me tell you my skin looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0011XWPNK Lifecell (Life Cell)</li>
            <li> Worst Crooks Ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> while this is a basically decent product, beware getting started on the trial version of their opportunity to try it at a reduced price.  You will receive the next shipment and have your account debited more than $100 and there is no return policy if you have decided the trial sample isn&#x27;t something you want to purchase again.  I have seen no discernible difference, particularly for the $100 investment I have apparently made that it is that much better than Regenerist.  This is a very bad group to get involved with.  Tryer/Buyer Beware!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on date expected.  It is a great product., not greasy and I think it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks and I see an improvement.</li>
            <li> It is not so much for the product, which I did not care for, but the Company itself.  I signed up for the 30 day trial, only charged for the cost of the shipping.  Even though it states in a paragraph, I did not realize I signed up for a continuous shipping program costing me 99.00 every two months.  My fault for not reading carefully.  I ordered my product, received it and used for two weeks.  It did nothing for my skin.  I did not realize that the 30 days STARTS on the day of order, not on the delivery date.  At the 33 day mark, I received  a package with a two month supply.  I promptly opened the package to find a phone number to have this returned.  No paperwork, no address, no phone #.  The only way I knew who to call was looking up the website on the return postage.  When I found out who to call, they told me, no returns, no refunds!  Basically tough luck.  I am livid.  Most companies would take the return and refund to help with their business reputation.  Not these guys.  I finally got a supervisor, who was extremely rude (I wasn&#x27;t very happy myself), but finally agreed to refund me 47.50.  This is a big scam.  His response to me was  if we refunded everyone&#x27;s money, we wouldn&#x27;t make any money.  With that answer, it seems to me, they have been asked for a lot of refunds. When I told him about the lack of invoice, phone, address, etc.  he stated that it was in the first shipment and they don&#x27;t send it again.  I told him I was going to write a bad review, he didn&#x27;t seem to care.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY</li>
            <li> the product is good but the jar I received was only half filled. It looked OK but after a couple of days, I could see a &#x27;space&#x27; about 1&#x27; across and 1/2&#x27; deep.  I stirred the contents which receded to about 50% of a jar.... have not had time to contact the supplier yet but consider this pretty poor.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the softness of my skin within 4-5 days; the appearance of skin has an improvement, as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Kollagen Untensiv for over 2 years now. I love the product as it helps moisturize the facial skin. And makes my face smoother and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> I FOUND THIS ON THE INTERNET AT 99.OO.  AMAZON HAS IT FOR 45./  THIS IS TH BEST FACIAL CREAM I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. i AM 56AND GOT SO MANY NICE RESULTS AND COMMENTS AND IT IS SO WORTH IT. 354% DIFFERENCE IN YOUR FACIAL STRUCTURE AND  SMOOTHNESS AND WRINKLES ETC.....SO WORTH IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I originally used the Revivagenix Serum with it and it worked beautifully! I ordered both products again. Great, great product!</li>
            <li> I will order this product again. After faithfully using it every day for about a month, I have seen am improvement in my complexion and the wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes are not as prominent.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the internet and filled out the contact information but changed my mind and closed the window.  I was later contacted by someone offering a 30 day free trial for even less money for shipping and handling.  I was astounded they could even get the information but they did.  I ordered and was then sent the product  which made my face break out and turn red and get bumpy.  Be aware the 30 days start when you order and not when you receive the product, so you have to cancel early.  As for me the product was horrible.  It didn&#x27;t even do a good job of moisturizing.. much less reduce wrinkles..so I say beware!</li>
            <li> I used Kollagen Intensiv and it works and has smoothes out my wrinkles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by a friend.she said it worked well for her so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I was very upset when my product arrived today.  The last time I ordered it, [not from Amazon] it came in a 4 oz. jar and there were 4 ounces of the product in the jar.  Today, when I opened the product, it was still in the 4oz. jar, as they advertised, but there were only 2 ounces of the product in the jar, and the price was just about the same as before.  What kind of a scam is this, that&#x27;s what I want to know. They made the interior of the jar smaller by making it out of a much thicker plastic.  I would say this is false advertising if they state it&#x27;s a 4 ounce bottle.  I find this very disturbing.</li>
            <li> My wife researched skin products on the web. The products she chose offered a two week free trial , the products ordered were Rejuvalskin and Kollagen Intensive Cream 2oz. In accordance with the products direction these products were to be used simultaneously, although purchase of the products came from two different sources from the websites. We ordered skin care products “Rejuvalskin” (order confirmation Sunday, 16 Feb 2014, 8:04PM) and Kollagen Intensive Cream 2oz. (No email Confirmation).&lt;br /&gt;Rejuvalskin produce was received Wednesday 19 Feb 2014, Kollagen Intensive Cream was received 21 Feb 2014. She was unable to start the product trail until evening of 21 Feb 2014. After using the products for several days her skin became irritated and she cancelled the trial on 4 March2014. Rejuvalskin on 5 March 2014 my credit card over $97.00, I called Rejuvalskin and asked for a refund referencing the free two week trial. Rejuvalskin stated the free trail begins the date the order was placed and my request exceed the two week period.  I informed them it took 3 days to receive the first product 5 days and mail. There was no way a two week trial period can be achieved, I informed Rejuvalskin. Rejuvalskin further stated that on the confirmation email it is written that the trial period begin on the date the order was placed. However, the email failed to mention that we would be charged the full product amount for the free trial after the two week period.&lt;br /&gt;Rejuvalskin is ripping off the consumer with these deceptive, unscrupulous, and fraudulent  product marketing practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware and do as I did, submit a complaint to the Federal Trade Commision and Better Business Bureau</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with product. was a little hesistant, but am satisfied with Kollagn Intensiv.  would defintly order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is great stuff and feels super nice on my skin.  It seem to return elasticity and moister to skin and I would say over time I feel my skin did look better having used it.  It is pricey though.</li>
            <li> A wonderful surprise. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and I can&#x27;t say enough. I watch my wrinkles disappear as I&#x27;m putting it on. I&#x27;ve also been told to use it with Skin Logic Firming Face Moisturizer for best results. What can I say...it works wonders. I&#x27;ve tried so many things in past and have been so disappointed but not with this. I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve finally found something I can count on :)</li>
            <li> kolagen intensiv wife like&#x27;s this and planning to get more of it too bad i missed the special offer they got this one really work</li>
            <li> It is a nice face cream it goes on well for under makeup use and alone it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product caused me to break out in a mild rash. I discontinued its use. Please just try a little to see.</li>
            <li> Out of the features it said, the only b one ive experienced so far are th r return of moisture to my face without causing my skin to be greasy or.oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted something to reduce pores on my face. I does that. also when you rub it in it absorbs into the skin very nicely. It&#x27;s really good for your skin. I bought the second jar, and it is almost all. I would recommend it to anyone to help their skin.</li>
            <li> This product did not meed my expectations. It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer but not effective with minimizing the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t moisturizer or hydrate or soften the line which they claime.  leave the skin dry and there is no benefit to use this product!</li>
            <li> I love the cream but the jar came half empty.  I use that cream for a while. it does work.</li>
            <li> outstanding service great product and love the easyness of use and information just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth. Stays all day, but there is no noticeable reduction of fine lines. Still, it is a good moisturizer for the money. It isn&#x27;t thick and heavy like some I&#x27;ve tried. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I like the product; it gives my skin soft, smooth, and firm. The cream absorb quickly disappear into my skin. I used to buy from the product website; they forced me to subscribe so they can automatically send me the product every two months automatically bill and I hate these up sell so I cancelled and sent the product back and now I found it from Amazon the price is cheaper and I can order when I want.</li>
            <li> Make my face feel smooth and soft</li>
            <li> This is a great product and not greasy.</li>
            <li> If you request a sample and then they send you a second one beware. This is a trick to make you think you have another 30 days to cancel  your order.  If they send you a new order your cost will be $99.00 be prepared to pay this every month because they will not let you send the product back...you can substitute it with one of their other products but beware you will start a new subscription with them. . so unless your willing to pay this do not enroll...and the number one reason not to get hooked... it does not work which is even more reason to stop........</li>
            <li> I have used this product every night and every morning with no results.  I do not recommend this product and will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Is not  The same product or something is different , the cream is Piling of my skin a was using it for more than one year and now that I order from Amazon is not the same product !</li>
            <li> I have just been using it for a couple of weeks.  I am still looking forward to changes.  Could be soon.</li>
            <li> I started using Kollagen Intesnsiv, and in about 3 days I had a severe allergic reaction with hives, and severe inflammation in face and neck. Could not open my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My Doctor gave me a treatment with oral steroids and took about 8 days to subside. And still now my skin looks dry and my wrinkles are more visible than before I started using the kollagen intensiv cream.&lt;br /&gt;I am not allergic and never had a reaction to any cream I use before in my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying now to go back to where my skin was before, and is coming back using natural moisturizers masks (cucumber).&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to read the ingredients carefully and if you want to try it, do it in a small area of your skin for a few days before using it in face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and has worked with the dark spots on my face.  Also it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like this cream, absorbs very quickly and keeps my face moisturized all day. After a week I could see improvement in my skin elasticity. Good under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Order didn&#x27;t come on time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this was too much for me, but it works for my husband, he has dry, mature skin. He happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product work amazingly since the first time you use it you can see the difference, your face feels amazing and it glows!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Wrinkles reduced and some disappear.</li>
            <li> i havent seen any difference and i have been using it for 12 days  not a good product in my  opinion waste of my money</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through a free trial program and if you do not cancel after 30 of signing up for the product they automatically send you \\&quot;2\\&quot; months worth of their product for basically $100....consumers beware of this or at least make sure to cancel prior to your trial period.  I called their customer service b/c I wanted to send the unopened product back and receive a refund for the charges and the 2 different ladies that I spoke with said I couldn&#x27;t send the items back and they will not issue a refund.  I was very nice on the phone and accepted that I just had to keep the products but when I asked the one customer service why she was so angry and that I should be the one upset...she hung up on me!!!  I am sure they get a lot of complaints...although they are not BBB accredited they have lots of complaints on there so make sure to check the company out before purchasing.  As far as the product is concerned I haven&#x27;t used enough of it to know...this is about the company and to let other consumers know what they are getting themselves into.</li>
            <li> I USE THE WHOLE THINK HATE IT AFTER ABOUT A WEEK I HAD TO ADD ANOTHER LOTION TO MY FACE......RIP OFF</li>
            <li> probably just average crème...can&#x27;t say that it was anything out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;But it may take a while to notice an improvement.</li>
            <li> The creamy substance quickly disappears into the skin, leaving a remarkable softness. I truly am impressed. It also seems to last longer than advertised; I have used ir more than 2 months and still have plenty in the jar.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two years. My skin is much smoother. I still have wrinkles, but they are not as evident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for over a year and it works great with my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried everything and aside from making me break out, other products dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t help with wrinkles. This has greatly improved the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> After using this product a month, my skin is brighter and even, a little firmer, but the wrinkles are more visible . My skin is always dry, the product made my skin dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this product, BUT was very disappointed when the container was only half full....there was a very large air pocket in the middle.</li>
            <li> Arranged next day delivery as was staying at a hotel - product received on time!  It&#x27;s only been a couple of days but my skin feels noticeably softer and smoother</li>
            <li> I chose kollagen intensive because of all the good reviews and it was inexspensive...I had no problem with the ordering process and had the product within two days...I will order this product  again.</li>
            <li> The best antiaging cream I know.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried very expensive creams (even 150 dollars a small jar) for more than 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of treatments, specially the ones to be used around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;No way, because it irritates my eyes a lot, even far from my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I use Kollagen Intensiv cream since April of 2011, and I can use it very hard on my eyes, on all my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Only Kollagen Intensiv cream is the best, and unique, to be used around or over your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;You have only to close your eyes and rub with a certain strenght the cream wherever you want.&lt;br /&gt;No way to go wrong with it. And it works.&lt;br /&gt;My Medical Doctors (all 4) are always giving compliments to me about my skin face (very less wrinkles, youth age, beautiful skin etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I read someone here saying &amp;#34;Noticed some minor redness in cheeks after using the product&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It happens when the cream is working.&lt;br /&gt;What I do?&lt;br /&gt;After taking a shower, before going to work, I use that cream very well, using some strenght, wait 10 minutes to get dry, and I use some cosmetic powder over my face to hide any redness and to protect my skin from the Sun damages.&lt;br /&gt;It works very, very well.&lt;br /&gt;At night, after another shower (to clean my face), without using the cream, I can go out to a restaurant very beautiful and to collect lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;What people have to know is that you have to use it at least 4 months to be sure it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;After using the cream 1 time a day (no need to use it at night) for 4 months, just use it 3 times a week or less.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re not going to be depend on it.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I use it only 1 time a week or 2 or 3 times a month.&lt;br /&gt;So, because it works very well, no dependency on it, you can use it over the skin that protects your eyes (just over your eyes; no skin irritation), and on your whole face... it&#x27;s the best cream I know.</li>
