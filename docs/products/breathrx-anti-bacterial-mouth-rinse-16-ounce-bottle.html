            <li>tasty, effective (and now well packaged) - this is the very best of the non alcoholic mouthwashes.</li>

            <li> This stuff is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I never felt like my mouth was super clean in between cleanings and not to mention that terrible burning sensation the other products bring.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist years ago and cannot use any other type of mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO OTHER PEOPLE</li>
            <li> I got lazy and didn&#x27;t order it for a while and just picked up what was at the store</li>
            <li> It works  for between two and six hours, but it does not prevent, for example, having a bad taste in the mouth in the morning, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have had my share of dental work, root canals and even a bridge.  </li>
            <li> I forgot how terrible the generic stuff is.  </li>
            <li> It will kill the bacteria that causes the bad breath instead of just covering it up with minty flavor.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to stop a bad taste in the mouth.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this every day.  Works great.</li>
            <li> the best mwash sold without a prescription.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash we&#x27;ve ever used. It will kill the bacteria that causes the bad breath instead of just covering it up with minty flavor. My spouse can come home after eating garlic and I can smell it across the room. This is the first one we&#x27;ve tried that will CURE it, not cover it up. This is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist years ago and cannot use any other type of mouth rinse.  It is safe and effective.</li>
            <li> Great product (no cavities since using!!).  Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> BreathRx is the only anti-bacterial mouthwash that does not burn my tongue or mouth. All of the other popular anti -bacterial products are so harsh I can not use them.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I love BreathRx.  My dentist does too as my quarterly dental checkups are always good. My one fear is that it will be discontinued as so many other of my favorites have been.  Please Amazon Prime, continue to keep this product available.  I can not find it in any of my neighborhood pharmacies.</li>
            <li> If you have to spend a lot, try Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health at 30% lower price.  If you want to save 50%, try the generics ... be sure you reach the ingredients&#x27; label to be sure, as there are a multitude of products crowing the space.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended BreathRX and it has really helped my dental health.  Each visit, the dentist remarks how good my gums are looking and I&#x27;ve had no issues with my teeth either.  This is an excellent product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to stop a bad taste in the mouth. It works  for between two and six hours, but it does not prevent, for example, having a bad taste in the mouth in the morning, at least for me.</li>
            <li> An excellent product. We used to get it at the pharmacy but they quit carrying it. It is worth the money you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! my son loves it!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on products because honestly I never really feel excited enough about a product to do so; therefore this is an exception for me.  Unfortunately I have had my share of dental work, root canals and even a bridge.  The standard mouthwashes just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  I never felt like my mouth was super clean in between cleanings and not to mention that terrible burning sensation the other products bring.  So I searched the internet for mouthwash and came upon BreathRx.  I love this stuff! I ordered it for several months and my mouth felt great, even my gums felt better! I got lazy and didn&#x27;t order it for a while and just picked up what was at the store and that was a huge mistake.  I forgot how terrible the generic stuff is.  I&#x27;m back to using my BreathRx twice a day and I love it! I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO OTHER PEOPLE</li>
            <li> Couple with Oral B power toothbrush and you dental visits will be quick with minimal of issues. Also helps whiten teeth</li>
            <li> It works fine, but is too expensive. I bought probably six times as much listerine from Costco for the same price and I think it actually works a little better.</li>
            <li> tasty, effective (and now well packaged) - this is the very best of the non alcoholic mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better moth washes.</li>
            <li> It is some good stuff. Healthy for your mouth!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
