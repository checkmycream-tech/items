            <li>This guard worked good for me.</li>

            <li>it is a good value.</li>
            <li>but I got a very good  fit.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
            <li>sure you wash it after ever use!</li>
            <li>SURE YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!  </li>
            <li>or you may not be happy with the fit.</li>
            <li>Honestly its a god send</li>
            <li>&quot; this to your own mouth.</li>
            <li>but it sure felt like a money grab from good ol&#x27; doc xxxx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my friends liked the information this book provided.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the kind of guard that helps stop the habit of clenching the jaw.</li>
            <li>They molded perfectly to my teeth and fit comfortably through the night.</li>
            <li>You can spend a lot more in a drugstore, but this is as good as the pricier brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be really effective.</li>
            <li>It was warm, but it didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good material and easy to use.</li>
            <li>my dentist had professionally molded to my mouth and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>and I have to say its the best one I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li>However, the case that comes with the mouthguard is nice :)</li>
            <li>Much more effective than item found at the dollar store.  </li>
            <li>Good material and would be good for someone with a large mouth.</li>
            <li>Works great, comfortable, and the price is fantastic compared to a custom device sold by your dentist.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Like so many others my dentist recommended a night guard for my bruxism</li>
            <li>Fortunately I did get a good fit around my teeth and it seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>bottom line is that if you can get it to fit-up properly, it&#x27;s a great product and very helpful...</li>
            <li>It fit my teeth perfectly, and I like the fact that it is a bit thicker than my old ones, because it doesn&#x27;t squish up when you grind your teeth.</li>
            <li>, my teeth feel so much better in the morning..</li>
            <li>, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to use it while I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>A million times better.</li>
            <li>I have had a grinding problem for many years.  </li>
            <li>I am surprisingly pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Better to order the custom one online.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>OK, give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer than my dentist&#x27;s model which is  better for all my grinding.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried many store-bought and online brands).  </li>
            <li>This feels much better at night than the fitted one I got from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Product does its job, Will defiantly order more when it comes time for me to replace the guard</li>
            <li>I bought this from Cute Gift Store - fulfilled by Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Top my dismay, this one will not for no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>I tried smoothing it with scissors to no avail, so I think a razor blade will work better.</li>
            <li>Make sure to cut off the tab AS CLOSE as you can.</li>
            <li>I would surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love my teeth grind guard.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a better fitting one.</li>
            <li>I found this one to be the thinnest, most unobtrusive I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase a couple more.</li>
            <li>The fitting procedure is tricky.  </li>
            <li>I still will use it until I can find something better.</li>
            <li>Not just while I sleep, though it seems that when I do it most often.</li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t able to use it at all</li>
            <li>a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>All went well with the boil and wait, and fitting .  </li>
            <li>The price is great and does not mean it is any lower quality.</li>
            <li>After a couple days I re-molded it and simply used my tongue to lightly press it against my teeth, and it turned out great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to have 3 more teeth filled so</li>
            <li>of course the night guard that was made won&#x27;t fit any better now than it did when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After wearing this one for about 3 days it was remarkably more comfortable</li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s stopping teeth-on-teeth action, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Grind Guard is the most comfortable guard I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It fit much better.</li>
            <li>You really have nothing to lose and you may just get a good night sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to wear, easy to mold, and makes me sleep better.</li>
            <li>I have also been shopping around for other DIY guards, and this one is the best deal that I have found.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow, and despite being a petite person it seems like the size of the plastic was fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Almost too easy it seems.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, with that tab in the front</li>
            <li>Easy to use and form.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to boil the piece</li>
            <li>The shaping process was easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to shape, I had to trim some jagged edges after the shaping.</li>
            <li>The cut-away handle made it easy to submerge and retract the guard from the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to use and fit-just thoroughly read directions.  </li>
            <li>She strongly dislikes them, but understands people can&#x27;t always afford the guards made in office.</li>
            <li>Has a strong plastic taste to it.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit, maybe too easy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
            <li>Got another one from Boxing.com where they have sturdier ones, but this one is just fine.</li>
            <li>It was easy to prepare the guard to fit my teeth just so.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wear and comfortable too.</li>
            <li>Guard works fine.</li>
            <li>and it would have been fine</li>
            <li>It softened up quickly and more than I was prepared for but it was fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, and they hold up just fine.</li>
            <li>The Grind Guard did a fine job for about a week.  </li>
            <li>Easy to customize the fit, easy to clean every day.</li>
            <li>It took two tries, then I got a very good fit and it stays on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its huge.</li>
            <li>This one still works, albeit with a looser fit.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable  to wear - probably as comfortable as any of them.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, when I expressed concern with the pricing, he suggested I go online and find a \\&quot;boil and fit\\&quot; guard to try out.  </li>
            <li>I did trim and boil it to fit my mouth, and i must admit it does fit nice...for a while.</li>
            <li>Even if it wears out in 6 months I am still light years ahead in the cost department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>All I can say is it&#x27;s fairly cheap and does the job</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great product.</li>
            <li>DOES IT FIT</li>
            <li>It even shrinks over time and doesn&#x27;t fit anymore, and never was comfortable.</li>
            <li>After boiling the mouthpiece it was too slippery to fit around my teeth.</li>
            <li>I found this cheap one online and figured it was a bargain</li>
            <li>I have only used it one day, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>for a custom fit one,</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>This fits quite comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear while sleeping</li>
            <li>The plastic is thicker than the ones available from my dentist, but not to the degree that it is bothersome.</li>
            <li>The guard is comfortable and has helped my symptoms decrease.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a comfortable fit,</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to try to get this to fit.</li>
            <li>We followed the instructions, precisely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-This guard is awesome for simply using it as a chew toy when you might have drunken too much coffee</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the shaping, it fit perfectly, and after a few minutes don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li>The tab is very useful for dipping the guard into the boiling water.  </li>
            <li>and it was super easy to fit to my mouth and so on...</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a good deal, boy was I worng , worked on it many times and couldn&#x27;t fit it, more wasted $$$</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it now for 3 nights and it&#x27;s really great - immediate positive impact to the pain level in my jaw and molars and as an unexpected bonus, to the quality of my sleep.  </li>
            <li>I preferred the original design.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;helping with significantly reducing my teeth/jaw pain from having a hard-bite and tjm.</li>
            <li>This has been working great for me, I like it more than the last one I had that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what exactly to look for.</li>
            <li>I consistently wake up feeling more rested when I use the Grind</li>
            <li>I did not have any problems with the hot water method of fitting the guard.  </li>
            <li>It molded very well and was comfortable after I realized that I needed to cut out most of the portion that molds to the roof of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a smooth surface at the cut spot yet, but it&#x27;s good enough, and it beat having to maneuver it with tongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product works well, good quality, reasonable price, and it really seems to do the job for which it was purchased.</li>
            <li>good product and fast delivery, very well manufactured and build.</li>
            <li>After softening the guard and placing on your teeth, draw in your lungs to create a  vacuum in your mouth to get a good fit.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use, easy to adjust (although it is too large even for my not-too-small mouth).</li>
            <li>these are good, I cant tell if they are working or not only time will.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it, is I like their idea to have the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; in the front that you cut off after you mold it.</li>
            <li>(actually I molded it twice to get a good</li>
            <li>how much I grind, or if the guard is causing me to grind more.</li>
            <li>These are easy to fit your mouth and to trim and are very affordable.</li>
            <li>I paid $400 for the night guard I got from my dentist and it never did fit exactly right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bulky in my mouth and I can&#x27;t seem to get it to fit right.  </li>
            <li>:) You will most likely need a pair of tongs or a fork or something to keep it \\&quot;open\\&quot; so to speak and then put it in your mouth.</li>
            <li>After 3 attempts at shaping it the material felt mildly molded to my mouth shape (you can&#x27;t see any teeth impressions</li>
            <li>I needed a quick solution to ease the problem, and this guard was it.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and did the quick boil.  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty huge.</li>
            <li>Well, I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to spend that much money out of pocket (virtually highway robbery in my book), regardless of whether I needed it or not, so I researched the Web for a suitable replacement that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>Other than my own dissatisfaction the product would work and is easy to mold to mouth.</li>
            <li>Grind Guards arrived in the mail very promptly and were child&#x27;s play to prepare and fit to my mouth.</li>
            <li>The case is nice, but not really necessary.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $15.</li>
            <li>Not really about the Archtek product but more about Cute Gift store</li>
            <li>guard seemed worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, even with that, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Came in faster than expected, and was very easy to fit to my mouth.</li>
            <li>i rather have it done right..</li>
            <li>I put it into my mouth right away and used my tongue to form it to my teeth.</li>
            <li>(I was scared of burning myself, but they&#x27;re right: it won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is it works just fine and is easy enough to sleep with (my biggest concern).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through the boil-and-shape process 3 times, felt like it fit my teeth decently, but when i cut the front peice of plastic off the residual plastic cuts the front of my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instruction is very clear and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were easy enough to follow and managed to mold the guard to fit my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit big at first, but after trimming it down it fits great!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it takes more tries to get the fit right.  </li>
            <li>I may have actually lucked into the fit, but it fit well</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>The hardest part is that the first time you put it in the water is softens very fast and then when you pull it out of the water it is very sticky and it sticks to itself!</li>
            <li>This was my first attempt at a night guard; I&#x27;ll be trying again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than buying it at the local walmart or grocery store.</li>
            <li>night guard is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>IT WILL NOT BURN YOUR MOUTH, trust me, I wasn&#x27;t keen on boiling water and sticking a hot item in my mouth and using my tongue to push on it and form it</li>
            <li>I had to do it two times because the first time it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>&quot; one first).  </li>
            <li>You hold it by the tab to dunk it in the hot water for shaping, and then lift it out (and the hot water runs off -- it&#x27;s the water, not the guard, that can burn you at this stage).  </li>
            <li>and it was no too hot when we put it in her mouth to form it.</li>
            <li>I can see if people don&#x27;t follow the directions exactly, they may have trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>(and I grind pretty hard)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell exactly if having the guard is bringing to my attention</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a night guard.  </li>
            <li>On subsequent uses, the guard seemed to tighten up--perhaps the body heat allows it to better conform to the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I did have to cut off the back and the top and bottom</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package I thought there was no way that this would work</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects.</li>
            <li>I have a medium sized mouth so the guard fits me pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is my first &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li>My first one was from the dentist</li>
            <li>I clench and have been doing more so at night recently</li>
            <li>bought this for my 7 year old daughter and was too large to fit her mouth.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get it to fit right on the upper.  </li>
            <li>I still have my first one though, and it seems to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li>In the long run that is better than wasting money on this one.</li>
            <li>I have been grinding my teeth at night pretty much forever.  </li>
            <li>but this one fits really well; I have a pretty large mouth, for reference.</li>
            <li>Why we were not advised of this option I will never know for certain</li>
            <li>If you have a large mouth, it might not do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now I even wear it sometimes when I&#x27;m at home doing certain things that require my concentration (primal time for me to clench my teeth when my mind is occupied on something else).</li>
            <li>The grind guard certainly does stop grinding teeth.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use if you follow the simple directions and works really, really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several and this works fine.  </li>
            <li>in a nice little circular carrying case, just big enough to fit it.&lt;br /&gt;-Very easy to shape with boiling and a knife.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are worse guards out there, but I certainly hope there are better ones too.</li>
            <li>The seller either needs to be explicit that the picture does not represent the product accurately, or use a picture that only includes what&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li>the only difference between that one and this one is the huge price difference and the thickness of the guard.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the handle when I was boiling the guard</li>
            <li>is because the initial boil and fit process is a bit hit or miss -</li>
            <li>I tried following the instructions to get this thing to fit.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;re really into what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes</li>
            <li>I went straight home and ordered this one for 12 bucks.  </li>
            <li>I bought one that cost over 4 times as much and it ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li>This has really helped my sleep, as well as reduced jaw pain and headaches.  </li>
            <li>so I think it is reasonable to expect sealed manufacturers packaging like the one in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>It has really really helped me with my teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>price is reasonable and the guard can do the job well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>It was a solid molded piece that absolutely fit well and did the job-</li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how comfortable this thing is.</li>
            <li>The 1st night I tried the guard, it didn&#x27;t feel secure, but never actually came out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a guard that would fit a smaller mouth.  </li>
            <li>It went straight into the garbage.  </li>
            <li>For those who are wondering, this guard is made to fit on the upper teeth, not the lower.</li>
            <li>I finally tried it in the microwave thinking that maybe then it can fit</li>
            <li>, it was much bulkier than the dentist-office made one.</li>
            <li>Really helped keep me from grinding my teeth while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks, the guard needed remolding, which worked OK, and then after a few weeks more needed remolding again - the last time it didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well if you follow directions (ruined one I bought at store).  </li>
            <li>the preparation of the guard was simple and easy to follow, after doing the initial fit the first few nights were ok</li>
            <li>I used my first guard for over a year before buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>Now, back to my original review...</li>
            <li>The fitting process was easy, and the thin plastic fits very snugly around my teeth.</li>
            <li>The guard is nice and thick, and doesn&#x27;t wear down very easily.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s long term, ask your orthodontist for suggestions (*Do not be cheap and invest into something that can and will benefit you)</li>
            <li>Not so with the fancy new one!</li>
            <li>I finally decided on this set of grind guards, because they looked like they would do the job for a very reasonable price, and you get two in the package so there is a spare for when the first one wears out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason I thought I needed one for upper and lower, so I have an extra, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>It was super bulky and big.</li>
            <li>The older ones I got always fell apart in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It took 4 tries to get a reasonable fit.  </li>
            <li>I am able to close my mouth around it which I couldn&#x27;t with another guard that I bought that was much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s performed much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this guard if and only if you need a quick fix.</li>
            <li>instead of spending the 50 bucks on another one..while its cheap... The quality is perfect..and I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it yet..</li>
            <li>i had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>This is my first time wearing a mouth guard at night, the fit is tight</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little tab on this one is an interesting feature.  </li>
            <li>Bought another one from Rite-Aid and it was a little better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for the first few weeks, but starts &#x27;giving&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them as they are MUCH cheaper than getting a mouth guard from the dentist and works exactly the same!</li>
            <li>I ground my teeth for years, but in my old age, not so much.</li>
            <li>In my case I had to do it twice because the first time, I must not have heated it enough, and the guard didn&#x27;t form much of a shape at all.  </li>
            <li>I told Dr. D I thought that was normal.</li>
            <li>Only about $50-60 but worth it</li>
            <li>Before that I have had over twenty years of the custom kind from the dentist, but they just got too expensive and my most recent one wore out too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not exactly comfortable and takes a while to get used to.</li>
            <li>NOT HARD TO DO</li>
            <li>The device stays soft so it seems like it will give good protection without causing the aching jaw one gets from  clenching very hard.</li>
            <li>However, due to the thickness of the material on the molars, I can&#x27;t close my mouth or fit my lips over the product in the front.</li>
            <li>In little more than fifteen minutes after opening the package, I had a replacement for my old guard.</li>
            <li>I trash about every 4-5 months and just use a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No labels, packaging, or anything at all that would suggest that I received a new product.</li>
            <li>My new dentist informed me I grind my teeth</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this for $11 before spending $$ at the dentist on a new guard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, for the price and the suitability of the product I would purchase another and be even more careful when forming it next time.</li>
            <li>The instructions are very clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very soft and soothing to the gums and</li>
            <li>You have to do the hot water process several times to work away some of the excess material.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it permanently, you definitely want your dentist to fit something professional if you grind regular and need an appliance.</li>
            <li>a favor - order this first before shelling out big bucks for the \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; job.  </li>
            <li>The first time, it was very simple to mold to my teeth.</li>
            <li>do prefer the retainer style, that I got from my first dentist way back when,</li>
            <li>only fault is when I first put it in, and when I have to get up an night to go to the bathroom, a lot of saliva seems to form.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a second one, as I mis-formed the first one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but once I trimmed it and boiled it I was surprised!</li>
            <li>I think I wasn&#x27;t letting them heat up long enough, then reheating them too long because I could never get that nice tight fit and eventually they got too out of shape.</li>
            <li>I could have easily choked myself on the dang thing so after a few restless hours I gave up trying to use it.  </li>
            <li>It was hard to let it cool enough not to burn and get it to fit her mouth.</li>
            <li>Once I was able to make the fit work well enough, I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep through the night because it&#x27;s way too bulky and makes it hard to sleep with your mouth closed, which I usually do.</li>
            <li>After many years of migraines with little relief, I have finally found some!</li>
            <li>so far it isn&#x27;t showing any signs of wear.  </li>
            <li>I nearly fell out of the dentist&#x27;s chair when he told me the price, but the kicker was that my dental insurance would no longer pay for it.</li>
            <li>This is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Much appreciated since I used to pay around eighteen for just one in the local store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought 3 of thses so far.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a replacement for my old night guard.</li>
            <li>My old night guard was too bulky, which is why I purchased this.</li>
            <li>It was too soft and too flimsy when I placed it in my mouth and when I sucked the air out</li>
            <li>My 8 year old wanted to try a mouth guard since she grinds her teeth while she sleeps.</li>
            <li>This is soft all the way through.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 7 year old.</li>
            <li>felt so soft from day one, can sleep all night without discomfort.</li>
            <li>it shrunk and completely folded in on itself</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34; and sticky it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to pony up the $$ for a professional grade one.</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re an adult and you work out, lift weights, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad too big for my mouth, but not by much.</li>
            <li>It failed to assume a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>And when would it be shipped by  and does it work good because im not trying to buy an expensive mouth guard from my dentist.</li>
            <li>Got the shape/mold right in 2 tries.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long this will last without that hard plastic, but I would gladly buy more due to its comfort level.</li>
            <li>I have a small adult jaw and just could not get this to fit.  </li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product to anyone, particularly at the price point.  </li>
            <li>I  used to wake up with super tight jaw</li>
            <li>Most of the over the counter mouth guards have a soft upper and hard bottom where your teeth would grind against.</li>
            <li>I really have to laugh, because the dentist was trying to tell me that I would spend loads more money on generic grind guards, so the really expensive one would save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li>The second time i got a tight fit.</li>
            <li>The new version is slightly different in that it doen&#x27;t mold to the roof of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>4 weeks later he came home with his new guard and all was well except I was still in sticker shock</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to form the fitting to my top teeth; however, it fits a little rough, feels too thin in places.</li>
            <li>No sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it is too soft and too flexible to be used for a long time - I have been using it for two months and it is completely disintegrated, and has holes that I have chewn into it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am not able to make it fit properly</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I would vigorously grind my teeth at night, it was loud enough to hear from across the room.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are clearly marked indentations showing you where to cut this guard if it&#x27;s too big.</li>
            <li>First was the material, if you have just as sharp teeth as I do this won&#x27;t last you too</li>
            <li>I tried several lower cost models before this one with little success.  </li>
            <li>Wish I didn&#x27;t need to have one of these (hard to get used to), but need to prevent further teeth grinding in my sleep...easy to fit...</li>
            <li>The 2nd &amp; 3rd time did not go nearly as well.</li>
            <li>Personally, the grind tray is too thick to sleep with comfortably.</li>
            <li>There is no need to cool this in cold water before fitting it (like with other guards I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li>It was soft enough on the inside to protect my teeth, rugged enough on the outside to withstand my grinding and</li>
            <li>These are very uncomfortable because you cannot shape them to the contours of your mouth; I never wore them for more than an hour because they hurt my teeth so much.</li>
            <li>Also, when I used it over the following days, it felt very hard and it didn&#x27;t really fit me that well.  </li>
            <li>It took less than half a minute for it to mold and cool off.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good and bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I got a very good  fit.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
            <li> sure you wash it after ever use!</li>
            <li> SURE YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!  </li>
            <li> or you may not be happy with the fit.</li>
            <li> Honestly its a god send</li>
            <li> &quot; this to your own mouth.</li>
            <li> but it sure felt like a money grab from good ol&#x27; doc xxxx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my friends liked the information this book provided.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the kind of guard that helps stop the habit of clenching the jaw.</li>
            <li> They molded perfectly to my teeth and fit comfortably through the night.</li>
            <li> You can spend a lot more in a drugstore, but this is as good as the pricier brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be really effective.</li>
            <li> It was warm, but it didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good material and easy to use.</li>
            <li> my dentist had professionally molded to my mouth and it was awesome.</li>
            <li> and I have to say its the best one I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li> However, the case that comes with the mouthguard is nice :)</li>
            <li> Much more effective than item found at the dollar store.  </li>
            <li> Good material and would be good for someone with a large mouth.</li>
            <li> Works great, comfortable, and the price is fantastic compared to a custom device sold by your dentist.  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Like so many others my dentist recommended a night guard for my bruxism</li>
            <li> Fortunately I did get a good fit around my teeth and it seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> bottom line is that if you can get it to fit-up properly, it&#x27;s a great product and very helpful...</li>
            <li> It fit my teeth perfectly, and I like the fact that it is a bit thicker than my old ones, because it doesn&#x27;t squish up when you grind your teeth.</li>
            <li> , my teeth feel so much better in the morning..</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to use it while I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> A million times better.</li>
            <li> I have had a grinding problem for many years.  </li>
            <li> I am surprisingly pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Better to order the custom one online.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> OK, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer than my dentist&#x27;s model which is  better for all my grinding.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried many store-bought and online brands).  </li>
            <li> This feels much better at night than the fitted one I got from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Product does its job, Will defiantly order more when it comes time for me to replace the guard</li>
            <li> I bought this from Cute Gift Store - fulfilled by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Top my dismay, this one will not for no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> I tried smoothing it with scissors to no avail, so I think a razor blade will work better.</li>
            <li> Make sure to cut off the tab AS CLOSE as you can.</li>
            <li> I would surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love my teeth grind guard.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a better fitting one.</li>
            <li> I found this one to be the thinnest, most unobtrusive I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase a couple more.</li>
            <li> The fitting procedure is tricky.  </li>
            <li> I still will use it until I can find something better.</li>
            <li> Not just while I sleep, though it seems that when I do it most often.</li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t able to use it at all</li>
            <li> a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> All went well with the boil and wait, and fitting .  </li>
            <li> The price is great and does not mean it is any lower quality.</li>
            <li> After a couple days I re-molded it and simply used my tongue to lightly press it against my teeth, and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to have 3 more teeth filled so</li>
            <li> of course the night guard that was made won&#x27;t fit any better now than it did when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After wearing this one for about 3 days it was remarkably more comfortable</li>
            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s stopping teeth-on-teeth action, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Grind Guard is the most comfortable guard I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It fit much better.</li>
            <li> You really have nothing to lose and you may just get a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to wear, easy to mold, and makes me sleep better.</li>
            <li> I have also been shopping around for other DIY guards, and this one is the best deal that I have found.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow, and despite being a petite person it seems like the size of the plastic was fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almost too easy it seems.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, with that tab in the front</li>
            <li> Easy to use and form.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to boil the piece</li>
            <li> The shaping process was easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to shape, I had to trim some jagged edges after the shaping.</li>
            <li> The cut-away handle made it easy to submerge and retract the guard from the boiling water.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to use and fit-just thoroughly read directions.  </li>
            <li> She strongly dislikes them, but understands people can&#x27;t always afford the guards made in office.</li>
            <li> Has a strong plastic taste to it.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit, maybe too easy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
            <li> Got another one from Boxing.com where they have sturdier ones, but this one is just fine.</li>
            <li> It was easy to prepare the guard to fit my teeth just so.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wear and comfortable too.</li>
            <li> Guard works fine.</li>
            <li> and it would have been fine</li>
            <li> It softened up quickly and more than I was prepared for but it was fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, and they hold up just fine.</li>
            <li> The Grind Guard did a fine job for about a week.  </li>
            <li> Easy to customize the fit, easy to clean every day.</li>
            <li> It took two tries, then I got a very good fit and it stays on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its huge.</li>
            <li> This one still works, albeit with a looser fit.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable  to wear - probably as comfortable as any of them.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, when I expressed concern with the pricing, he suggested I go online and find a \\&quot;boil and fit\\&quot; guard to try out.  </li>
            <li> I did trim and boil it to fit my mouth, and i must admit it does fit nice...for a while.</li>
            <li> Even if it wears out in 6 months I am still light years ahead in the cost department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> All I can say is it&#x27;s fairly cheap and does the job</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great product.</li>
            <li> DOES IT FIT</li>
            <li> It even shrinks over time and doesn&#x27;t fit anymore, and never was comfortable.</li>
            <li> After boiling the mouthpiece it was too slippery to fit around my teeth.</li>
            <li> I found this cheap one online and figured it was a bargain</li>
            <li> I have only used it one day, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> for a custom fit one,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> This fits quite comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to wear while sleeping</li>
            <li> The plastic is thicker than the ones available from my dentist, but not to the degree that it is bothersome.</li>
            <li> The guard is comfortable and has helped my symptoms decrease.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a comfortable fit,</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to try to get this to fit.</li>
            <li> We followed the instructions, precisely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-This guard is awesome for simply using it as a chew toy when you might have drunken too much coffee</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the shaping, it fit perfectly, and after a few minutes don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> The tab is very useful for dipping the guard into the boiling water.  </li>
            <li> and it was super easy to fit to my mouth and so on...</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good deal, boy was I worng , worked on it many times and couldn&#x27;t fit it, more wasted $$$</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it now for 3 nights and it&#x27;s really great - immediate positive impact to the pain level in my jaw and molars and as an unexpected bonus, to the quality of my sleep.  </li>
            <li> I preferred the original design.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;helping with significantly reducing my teeth/jaw pain from having a hard-bite and tjm.</li>
            <li> This has been working great for me, I like it more than the last one I had that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what exactly to look for.</li>
            <li> I consistently wake up feeling more rested when I use the Grind</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems with the hot water method of fitting the guard.  </li>
            <li> It molded very well and was comfortable after I realized that I needed to cut out most of the portion that molds to the roof of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a smooth surface at the cut spot yet, but it&#x27;s good enough, and it beat having to maneuver it with tongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product works well, good quality, reasonable price, and it really seems to do the job for which it was purchased.</li>
            <li> good product and fast delivery, very well manufactured and build.</li>
            <li> After softening the guard and placing on your teeth, draw in your lungs to create a  vacuum in your mouth to get a good fit.</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use, easy to adjust (although it is too large even for my not-too-small mouth).</li>
            <li> these are good, I cant tell if they are working or not only time will.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about it, is I like their idea to have the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; in the front that you cut off after you mold it.</li>
            <li> (actually I molded it twice to get a good</li>
            <li> how much I grind, or if the guard is causing me to grind more.</li>
            <li> These are easy to fit your mouth and to trim and are very affordable.</li>
            <li> I paid $400 for the night guard I got from my dentist and it never did fit exactly right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulky in my mouth and I can&#x27;t seem to get it to fit right.  </li>
            <li> :) You will most likely need a pair of tongs or a fork or something to keep it \\&quot;open\\&quot; so to speak and then put it in your mouth.</li>
            <li> After 3 attempts at shaping it the material felt mildly molded to my mouth shape (you can&#x27;t see any teeth impressions</li>
            <li> I needed a quick solution to ease the problem, and this guard was it.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and did the quick boil.  </li>
            <li> arrived quickly...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty huge.</li>
            <li> Well, I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to spend that much money out of pocket (virtually highway robbery in my book), regardless of whether I needed it or not, so I researched the Web for a suitable replacement that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Other than my own dissatisfaction the product would work and is easy to mold to mouth.</li>
            <li> Grind Guards arrived in the mail very promptly and were child&#x27;s play to prepare and fit to my mouth.</li>
            <li> The case is nice, but not really necessary.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $15.</li>
            <li> Not really about the Archtek product but more about Cute Gift store</li>
            <li> guard seemed worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, even with that, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Came in faster than expected, and was very easy to fit to my mouth.</li>
            <li> i rather have it done right..</li>
            <li> I put it into my mouth right away and used my tongue to form it to my teeth.</li>
            <li> (I was scared of burning myself, but they&#x27;re right: it won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is it works just fine and is easy enough to sleep with (my biggest concern).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through the boil-and-shape process 3 times, felt like it fit my teeth decently, but when i cut the front peice of plastic off the residual plastic cuts the front of my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instruction is very clear and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were easy enough to follow and managed to mold the guard to fit my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit big at first, but after trimming it down it fits great!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes more tries to get the fit right.  </li>
            <li> I may have actually lucked into the fit, but it fit well</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> The hardest part is that the first time you put it in the water is softens very fast and then when you pull it out of the water it is very sticky and it sticks to itself!</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at a night guard; I&#x27;ll be trying again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than buying it at the local walmart or grocery store.</li>
            <li> night guard is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> IT WILL NOT BURN YOUR MOUTH, trust me, I wasn&#x27;t keen on boiling water and sticking a hot item in my mouth and using my tongue to push on it and form it</li>
            <li> I had to do it two times because the first time it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> &quot; one first).  </li>
            <li> You hold it by the tab to dunk it in the hot water for shaping, and then lift it out (and the hot water runs off -- it&#x27;s the water, not the guard, that can burn you at this stage).  </li>
            <li> and it was no too hot when we put it in her mouth to form it.</li>
            <li> I can see if people don&#x27;t follow the directions exactly, they may have trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> (and I grind pretty hard)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell exactly if having the guard is bringing to my attention</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a night guard.  </li>
            <li> On subsequent uses, the guard seemed to tighten up--perhaps the body heat allows it to better conform to the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I did have to cut off the back and the top and bottom</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I thought there was no way that this would work</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> I have a medium sized mouth so the guard fits me pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li> My first one was from the dentist</li>
            <li> I clench and have been doing more so at night recently</li>
            <li> bought this for my 7 year old daughter and was too large to fit her mouth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to fit right on the upper.  </li>
            <li> I still have my first one though, and it seems to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li> In the long run that is better than wasting money on this one.</li>
            <li> I have been grinding my teeth at night pretty much forever.  </li>
            <li> but this one fits really well; I have a pretty large mouth, for reference.</li>
            <li> Why we were not advised of this option I will never know for certain</li>
            <li> If you have a large mouth, it might not do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now I even wear it sometimes when I&#x27;m at home doing certain things that require my concentration (primal time for me to clench my teeth when my mind is occupied on something else).</li>
            <li> The grind guard certainly does stop grinding teeth.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use if you follow the simple directions and works really, really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several and this works fine.  </li>
            <li> in a nice little circular carrying case, just big enough to fit it.&lt;br /&gt;-Very easy to shape with boiling and a knife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are worse guards out there, but I certainly hope there are better ones too.</li>
            <li> The seller either needs to be explicit that the picture does not represent the product accurately, or use a picture that only includes what&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li> the only difference between that one and this one is the huge price difference and the thickness of the guard.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the handle when I was boiling the guard</li>
            <li> is because the initial boil and fit process is a bit hit or miss -</li>
            <li> I tried following the instructions to get this thing to fit.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;re really into what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes</li>
            <li> I went straight home and ordered this one for 12 bucks.  </li>
            <li> I bought one that cost over 4 times as much and it ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my sleep, as well as reduced jaw pain and headaches.  </li>
            <li> so I think it is reasonable to expect sealed manufacturers packaging like the one in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> It has really really helped me with my teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> price is reasonable and the guard can do the job well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> It was a solid molded piece that absolutely fit well and did the job-</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how comfortable this thing is.</li>
            <li> The 1st night I tried the guard, it didn&#x27;t feel secure, but never actually came out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a guard that would fit a smaller mouth.  </li>
            <li> It went straight into the garbage.  </li>
            <li> For those who are wondering, this guard is made to fit on the upper teeth, not the lower.</li>
            <li> I finally tried it in the microwave thinking that maybe then it can fit</li>
            <li> , it was much bulkier than the dentist-office made one.</li>
            <li> Really helped keep me from grinding my teeth while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks, the guard needed remolding, which worked OK, and then after a few weeks more needed remolding again - the last time it didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well if you follow directions (ruined one I bought at store).  </li>
            <li> the preparation of the guard was simple and easy to follow, after doing the initial fit the first few nights were ok</li>
            <li> I used my first guard for over a year before buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> Now, back to my original review...</li>
            <li> The fitting process was easy, and the thin plastic fits very snugly around my teeth.</li>
            <li> The guard is nice and thick, and doesn&#x27;t wear down very easily.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s long term, ask your orthodontist for suggestions (*Do not be cheap and invest into something that can and will benefit you)</li>
            <li> Not so with the fancy new one!</li>
            <li> I finally decided on this set of grind guards, because they looked like they would do the job for a very reasonable price, and you get two in the package so there is a spare for when the first one wears out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought I needed one for upper and lower, so I have an extra, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> It was super bulky and big.</li>
            <li> The older ones I got always fell apart in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It took 4 tries to get a reasonable fit.  </li>
            <li> I am able to close my mouth around it which I couldn&#x27;t with another guard that I bought that was much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s performed much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this guard if and only if you need a quick fix.</li>
            <li> instead of spending the 50 bucks on another one..while its cheap... The quality is perfect..and I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it yet..</li>
            <li> i had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> This is my first time wearing a mouth guard at night, the fit is tight</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little tab on this one is an interesting feature.  </li>
            <li> Bought another one from Rite-Aid and it was a little better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for the first few weeks, but starts &#x27;giving&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them as they are MUCH cheaper than getting a mouth guard from the dentist and works exactly the same!</li>
            <li> I ground my teeth for years, but in my old age, not so much.</li>
            <li> In my case I had to do it twice because the first time, I must not have heated it enough, and the guard didn&#x27;t form much of a shape at all.  </li>
            <li> I told Dr. D I thought that was normal.</li>
            <li> Only about $50-60 but worth it</li>
            <li> Before that I have had over twenty years of the custom kind from the dentist, but they just got too expensive and my most recent one wore out too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not exactly comfortable and takes a while to get used to.</li>
            <li> NOT HARD TO DO</li>
            <li> The device stays soft so it seems like it will give good protection without causing the aching jaw one gets from  clenching very hard.</li>
            <li> However, due to the thickness of the material on the molars, I can&#x27;t close my mouth or fit my lips over the product in the front.</li>
            <li> In little more than fifteen minutes after opening the package, I had a replacement for my old guard.</li>
            <li> I trash about every 4-5 months and just use a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No labels, packaging, or anything at all that would suggest that I received a new product.</li>
            <li> My new dentist informed me I grind my teeth</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this for $11 before spending $$ at the dentist on a new guard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, for the price and the suitability of the product I would purchase another and be even more careful when forming it next time.</li>
            <li> The instructions are very clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very soft and soothing to the gums and</li>
            <li> You have to do the hot water process several times to work away some of the excess material.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it permanently, you definitely want your dentist to fit something professional if you grind regular and need an appliance.</li>
            <li> a favor - order this first before shelling out big bucks for the \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; job.  </li>
            <li> The first time, it was very simple to mold to my teeth.</li>
            <li> do prefer the retainer style, that I got from my first dentist way back when,</li>
            <li> only fault is when I first put it in, and when I have to get up an night to go to the bathroom, a lot of saliva seems to form.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a second one, as I mis-formed the first one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once I trimmed it and boiled it I was surprised!</li>
            <li> I think I wasn&#x27;t letting them heat up long enough, then reheating them too long because I could never get that nice tight fit and eventually they got too out of shape.</li>
            <li> I could have easily choked myself on the dang thing so after a few restless hours I gave up trying to use it.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to let it cool enough not to burn and get it to fit her mouth.</li>
            <li> Once I was able to make the fit work well enough, I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep through the night because it&#x27;s way too bulky and makes it hard to sleep with your mouth closed, which I usually do.</li>
            <li> After many years of migraines with little relief, I have finally found some!</li>
            <li> so far it isn&#x27;t showing any signs of wear.  </li>
            <li> I nearly fell out of the dentist&#x27;s chair when he told me the price, but the kicker was that my dental insurance would no longer pay for it.</li>
            <li> This is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Much appreciated since I used to pay around eighteen for just one in the local store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought 3 of thses so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my old night guard.</li>
            <li> My old night guard was too bulky, which is why I purchased this.</li>
            <li> It was too soft and too flimsy when I placed it in my mouth and when I sucked the air out</li>
            <li> My 8 year old wanted to try a mouth guard since she grinds her teeth while she sleeps.</li>
            <li> This is soft all the way through.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old.</li>
            <li> felt so soft from day one, can sleep all night without discomfort.</li>
            <li> it shrunk and completely folded in on itself</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34; and sticky it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to pony up the $$ for a professional grade one.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re an adult and you work out, lift weights, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad too big for my mouth, but not by much.</li>
            <li> It failed to assume a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> And when would it be shipped by  and does it work good because im not trying to buy an expensive mouth guard from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Got the shape/mold right in 2 tries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this will last without that hard plastic, but I would gladly buy more due to its comfort level.</li>
            <li> I have a small adult jaw and just could not get this to fit.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product to anyone, particularly at the price point.  </li>
            <li> I  used to wake up with super tight jaw</li>
            <li> Most of the over the counter mouth guards have a soft upper and hard bottom where your teeth would grind against.</li>
            <li> I really have to laugh, because the dentist was trying to tell me that I would spend loads more money on generic grind guards, so the really expensive one would save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> The second time i got a tight fit.</li>
            <li> The new version is slightly different in that it doen&#x27;t mold to the roof of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> 4 weeks later he came home with his new guard and all was well except I was still in sticker shock</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to form the fitting to my top teeth; however, it fits a little rough, feels too thin in places.</li>
            <li> No sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it is too soft and too flexible to be used for a long time - I have been using it for two months and it is completely disintegrated, and has holes that I have chewn into it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not able to make it fit properly</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I would vigorously grind my teeth at night, it was loud enough to hear from across the room.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are clearly marked indentations showing you where to cut this guard if it&#x27;s too big.</li>
            <li> First was the material, if you have just as sharp teeth as I do this won&#x27;t last you too</li>
            <li> I tried several lower cost models before this one with little success.  </li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t need to have one of these (hard to get used to), but need to prevent further teeth grinding in my sleep...easy to fit...</li>
            <li> The 2nd &amp; 3rd time did not go nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Personally, the grind tray is too thick to sleep with comfortably.</li>
            <li> There is no need to cool this in cold water before fitting it (like with other guards I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> It was soft enough on the inside to protect my teeth, rugged enough on the outside to withstand my grinding and</li>
            <li> These are very uncomfortable because you cannot shape them to the contours of your mouth; I never wore them for more than an hour because they hurt my teeth so much.</li>
            <li> Also, when I used it over the following days, it felt very hard and it didn&#x27;t really fit me that well.  </li>
            <li> It took less than half a minute for it to mold and cool off.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good and bad.  </li>
            <li> Then, I rinsed it in warm (NOT HOT) water, and it lost its shape and became useless.</li>
            <li> Kept in hot water too long and not able to use.</li>
            <li> -- It wasn&#x27;t quite long enough to get my back molars.</li>
            <li> I imagine people with very small mouths or very large mouths might have problems with this item and would require a custom fitted guard.</li>
            <li> I failed to get a proper fit the first time and, despite what it says on the package, it&#x27;s hard to re-do because in my case one of the sides actually molded inward and got stuck that way.</li>
            <li> and  it looks brand new everyday.</li>
            <li> A few months ago my wife took my 15 year old to the dentist and came back with a $350 charge for a custom molded guard for teeth grinding.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, because it&#x27;s a nice piece...)</li>
            <li> Even including shipping, I&#x27;d have to buy 30 or so packages of grind guards before I&#x27;d spend as one of the expensive guards costs--not to mention paying the dentist to fit it.</li>
            <li> I love that it came with a case to store it and keep it from getting dirty.</li>
            <li> and I do eventually bite through them, but the material should not be kept for a long period anyways.</li>
            <li> so I was not surprised that his Dr recommended a guard.  </li>
            <li> I had to sleep with my mouth wide open.</li>
            <li> Still have it; if I use it again, it won&#x27;t be for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Also, the place where the front tab tears off is rough, scratching my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these a long time.</li>
            <li> I had to order another one because I boiled it too long and warped it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are some minor things that I didn&#x27;t quite like about it.</li>
            <li> I tried a spoon to fish it out and it stuck to the pan and stayed in the water way too long and ended up in a blob.</li>
            <li> I found it more difficult to get the updated version to mold tightly</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve only got one hand to hold the flaps and the other to put the tape on.</li>
            <li> guard seems to be a firmer \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; than the other one I tried, and I have hope that perhaps it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Bruxism is so strange!</li>
            <li> Those guards that only contact a few of your teeth can actually cause them to move during the night.  </li>
            <li> What a waste to purchase a more expensive mouth guard with a case when it came like that.</li>
            <li> When you first start using the guard it will feel uncomfortable for a few nights, mainly because its a bit unnatural to sleep with.</li>
            <li> At first it was a little uncomfortable since I normally don&#x27;t sleep with it</li>
            <li> It has been 3 months and so far the guard shows very little wear.</li>
            <li> I tend to grind my teeth quite frequently and sometimes wake up with sore jaws due too heavy grinding.</li>
            <li> The second time I think I may have over-heated it some, because it shrunk down quite a bit and became quite a bit thicker.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and had to get a mouth guard for my grinding.</li>
            <li> IT WAS ACTUALLY JUST A MESS TO FIGURE OUT AND TRY TO USE.  </li>
            <li> Not cool since the 2 pack is almost the same price</li>
            <li> It never fit right and got misshapen worse each time I put it in hot water until after the third time it was totally useless.  </li>
            <li> I only wore it two nights since it&#x27;s so large and uncomfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> It was a little bigger than expected.</li>
            <li> Not only does it stop the grinding but it is comfortable AND l have a painful habit of chewing on my tongue.</li>
            <li> It may be a bit thinner, but if it is it&#x27;s not much.</li>
            <li> Total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Grinding is really never a problem, its the clenching at nite</li>
            <li> I only used a few nights and discontinued use.  </li>
            <li> For the last few years I&#x27;ve had an issue with clenching and grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> After about 8 tries I gave up.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did just what the directions said for molding this, and the 1st time it was too stiff, the 2nd time it melted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I molded it, I used my finger to press the guard into my upper teeth, but it ended up too tight and my teeth/gums would feel weird in the morning.</li>
            <li> I did have to trim a little and it is a little bigger than my previous one, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> And second would be hard to sleep with, this is because wearing the guard force you to either fall sleep with your mouth open or clamping your mouth down on the guard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say is that it&#x27;s kind of thick, and it throws my jaw/bite off for half a day after wearing it, so I can&#x27;t wear it every night.</li>
            <li> - Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard actually lasts for months, whereas this Grind Guard disintegrated after very little use.</li>
            <li> it 3 times due to the fillings in my teeth and</li>
            <li> get the dr. something or other one at target or CVS.</li>
            <li> The only drawback I would say is that it doesn&#x27;t allow ventilation, like some of the other mouth guards I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> it turned and I was not aware of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grind Guard, unlike other guards, didn&#x27;t leave me with the sensation that my bite was out of alinement after removing it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this quality and comfort for such a small price.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that they fit a little weird forcing the mandible (lower jaw) to protrude a little bit causing discomfort</li>
            <li> For a mouth guard, this is about as comfortable as it gets, which isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> So far it does not ache too much, but a few times I awoke at night with bad pain as had been grinding on that side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you mouth should be something close to average</li>
            <li> have only one complaint and the recommendation to go with it</li>
            <li> Not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> did not like this item, was not worth the money ..</li>
            <li> When you put the guard in hot water, which the directions tell you, it shrinks up and gets small plus real thick.</li>
            <li> My dentist began urging me to replace my old custom-fitted grind guards with a new, and very expensive one a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> , I accidentally deformed the edge on one side of the guard by biting down on it.  </li>
            <li> The onlt thing I did not like was the tab that you need to remove, it left a little tab that has been hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> i will probably wear this one down sooner than i did the dentist one, but even if i end up going through 5 or 6 of these in the amount of time i did my dentist one it will be less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can imagine, however, that if I had left it in the boiling water for just another second or two, it would end up useless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But maybe i&#x27;m spoiled because previously i had one</li>
            <li> I tried this based on previous reviews and not wanting to shell out $400 at the dentist.</li>
            <li> However, I recently had a difficult filling in my upper molar, and the dentist said I might have to have a root canal.</li>
            <li> hope this lasts a while, but if not, I will definitely get another, as can&#x27;t go wrong on the price for such an device that works so well.</li>
            <li> It feels less bulky than the others.</li>
            <li> overheat the guard and it will collapse into a mess of jelly.  </li>
            <li> only negative is that it&#x27;s hard to cut the handle off without leaving a little rough patch.  </li>
            <li> Well, hate is a strong word.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to look at myself in a little mirror to put in a mouth</li>
            <li> The guard came in a resealable plastic bag, no original packaging, no instructions.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little bulky on my teeth</li>
            <li> product a little stiffer than I thought it would be so</li>
            <li> but it does seem a little less stiff).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other guards, and they are usually too thin, or fit awkwardly in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and</li>
            <li> After just a few nights of wearing this, my jaw pain was gone.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few months using Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard http://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Dental-Protector-Grinding-Medium/dp/tech-data/B004PX39TM  </li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago</li>
            <li> and I tend to grind me teeth heavily at night</li>
            <li> but I do have a fault with the guard my bottom teeth pierced through after a few weeks</li>
            <li> It will not fit as well as one from the dentist&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I just swallow a few times, and when I go to bed, breath through my mouth for a few minutes, and all is well</li>
            <li> waste of money, did not fit</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It will not fit at all even with boiling.</li>
            <li> This constitutes false advertising; in which the seller is showing 2 guards but only selling one; and should be considered unacceptable by all of Amazon&#x27;s customers.</li>
            <li> The night after using this I had less jaw pain, and two weeks after using it my doctor noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> In addition, the the front in very bulky and forces my lips to protrude outwards, which is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but it is a little thick for my small mouth.  </li>
            <li> but after a few nights I hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> by the way, as someone else pointed out, the case is just a tad too small.  </li>
            <li> i had to cut out some of the center and, because it&#x27;s so big in my mouth, it is very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in Amazon for not handling this problem in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I broke the acrylic night guard I was using for bruxism for the past two years.</li>
            <li> A slight imperfection can cause serious problems in the joint balance.</li>
            <li> For a lot of things I buy the cheaper option (usually off amazon or on-line), but this thing does not work at all.</li>
            <li> No more grinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, so I trimmed 1/4 off the length off of the end with household scissors.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and this product works for me.  </li>
            <li> and it was a solid mass of useless plastic before it even made it to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> did I choose the wrong one?&amp;#34; But later that night, before going to bed, I boiled the water</li>
            <li> I believe that&#x27;s because it lacks that strip of very hard plastic strip that prevails in other mouth guards.</li>
            <li> Considering that it costs approximately $575 less than the one offered by my dentist</li>
            <li> MIGHT AS WELL BUY A THIN MOUTH GUARD FOR HALF THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a no brainer to at least try it.</li>
            <li> Use for at least 1 month or 2 before seeing results.</li>
            <li> we tried cutting several times to no avail.</li>
            <li> way too thick.</li>
            <li> Ever so often she will start up again and she puts these in and no more grinding!</li>
            <li> No more grinding!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and big and impossible to sleep in without gagging and drooling all over.</li>
            <li> whether it was the stress of work getting worse and grinding with it on or the guard alone, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> thats the serious issue.</li>
            <li> I could not keep it in for even a few minutes without being extremely uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely hard plastic that was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and I tried to trim it, but things just got worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> Yea... they are a bit thin</li>
            <li> it was the worse product i ever used.</li>
            <li> It is thick and it is very tough and durable.</li>
            <li> This product is very uncomfortable to wear at night because you feel like you are choking a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since getting my EXPENSIVE night guard from my dentist</li>
            <li> It would be too uncomfortable for me to sleep like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have that habit, it&#x27;s useless to me.</li>
            <li> but I was unable.</li>
            <li> I did nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have an issue with teeth grinding, but found the mouth guard to be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> That same night, after wearing the guard while I slept, I woke up noticing that I didn&#x27;t have that horrible pain in my jaw caused by the clenching and grinding.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable for him to mold, after attempting twice.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the thing would fall off my teeth (it did) and end up in my throat.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My dentist wanted to make them for me, for some crazy price.</li>
            <li> I think after you put the imprint of your teeth in then rinse it with cold water it shrinks the guard a bit making it smallish when wearing it at night.</li>
            <li> had I not decided to dunk it again in the boiling water after cutting.  </li>
            <li> It was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> but it is VERY uncomfortable and hurt my jaw a lot.  </li>
            <li> Eventually we succeeded, but she said that it was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Impossible to work with and mold to your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to make it stay in place after you mold it to your mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried to overlook the bad reviews when ordering this guard, but it really is so bad.</li>
            <li> It sometimes irritates one side of my gums, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the price and our insurance did not cover this so it came out of our pocket.  </li>
            <li> The container it came with was dirty and seemed already used and scuffed up!</li>
            <li> I just wish I had tried it before I paid the $450 out of pocket for that stupid NTI device.  </li>
            <li> Basically, I bought a tray case that came with a crap tray.</li>
            <li> In addition, the price wasn&#x27;t outrageous.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst mouth guard I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Disgusting!</li>
            <li> This is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t tried every mouth guard on the market, this is the best of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.  It molded very well and was comfortable after I realized that I needed to cut out most of the portion that molds to the roof of your mouth.  I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s too big.  I like the fact that it covers all of my molars.  Those guards that only contact a few of your teeth can actually cause them to move during the night.  This one doesn&#x27;t do that.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and so far it isn&#x27;t showing any signs of wear.  The case is nice, but not really necessary.  I don&#x27;t need to look at myself in a little mirror to put in a mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it&#x27;s hard to cut the handle off without leaving a little rough patch.  I appreciated the handle when I was boiling the guard but it needs to snap off cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/1/14:  I used my first guard for over a year before buying a new one.  The new version is slightly different in that it doen&#x27;t mold to the roof of your mouth.  That&#x27;s good and bad.  I found it more difficult to get the updated version to mold tightly but I didn&#x27;t have to trim away any plastic.  I preferred the original design.  This one still works, albeit with a looser fit.</li>
            <li> Kept in hot water too long and not able to use. Reordered and will try again.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve found for the price.  They are comfortable  to wear - probably as comfortable as any of them.  It&#x27;s one size fits all so you mouth should be something close to average or you may not be happy with the fit.</li>
            <li> My dentist was going to rip me off and charge me $500 for a mouth guard. Listened to a friend&#x27;s recommendation and got this grind guard. Works like a charm. Got the shape/mold right in 2 tries. Got another one from Boxing.com where they have sturdier ones, but this one is just fine.</li>
            <li> Like so many others my dentist recommended a night guard for my bruxism but it was going to be $470 with no insurance coverage.  Fortunately for me, when I expressed concern with the pricing, he suggested I go online and find a \\&quot;boil and fit\\&quot; guard to try out.  So that&#x27;s what led me to this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it now for 3 nights and it&#x27;s really great - immediate positive impact to the pain level in my jaw and molars and as an unexpected bonus, to the quality of my sleep.  Hopefully the benefits continue and don&#x27;t taper off or go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason it&#x27;s a 4-star and not 5-star is because the initial boil and fit process is a bit hit or miss - I realize, of course, that this may be a feature of any of these products and not this one alone.  In my case I had to do it twice because the first time, I must not have heated it enough, and the guard didn&#x27;t form much of a shape at all.  The second time I think I may have over-heated it some, because it shrunk down quite a bit and became quite a bit thicker.  Fortunately I did get a good fit around my teeth and it seems to work well.  I can imagine, however, that if I had left it in the boiling water for just another second or two, it would end up useless.  I think this sensitivity to initial fit-up is what causes quite a spread in the user ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that if you can get it to fit-up properly, it&#x27;s a great product and very helpful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh by the way, as someone else pointed out, the case is just a tad too small.  Too bad, because it&#x27;s a nice piece...)</li>
            <li> My jaw had been killing me; I had no dental problems.  I realized that I&#x27;d been under a lot of stress and I grind my teeth at night when I&#x27;m stressed.  So I ordered a mouth guard to help. After just a few nights of wearing this, my jaw pain was gone.  It was easy to prepare the guard to fit my teeth just so.  In addition, the price wasn&#x27;t outrageous.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The night after using this I had less jaw pain, and two weeks after using it my doctor noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> I tried following the instructions to get this thing to fit.  It never fit right and got misshapen worse each time I put it in hot water until after the third time it was totally useless.  Still I tried to sleep with it and it kept falling off my teeth and making me gag!  It had a big glob of plastic on the ends and I tried to trim it, but things just got worse and worse.  I could have easily choked myself on the dang thing so after a few restless hours I gave up trying to use it.  I was afraid the thing would fall off my teeth (it did) and end up in my throat.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this one. I think it&#x27;s actually unsafe.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ve been griding my teeth for years but I&#x27;ve never had a dentist tell me he/she saw a problem. Until we found Dr. D in Highland, CA. After his analysis I found your product and gave it a try. Well...I no longer wake up with &#x27;aching&#x27; teeth. I told Dr. D I thought that was normal. I would recommened your Grind Guard to everyone. It&#x27;s easy to wear and comfortable too.</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at a night guard; I&#x27;ll be trying again. I failed to get a proper fit the first time and, despite what it says on the package, it&#x27;s hard to re-do because in my case one of the sides actually molded inward and got stuck that way. Once I was able to make the fit work well enough, I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep through the night because it&#x27;s way too bulky and makes it hard to sleep with your mouth closed, which I usually do. I&#x27;m sure there are worse guards out there, but I certainly hope there are better ones too.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this mouth guard for a couple nights now and i don&#x27;t get what all the hype is about. I did trim and boil it to fit my mouth, and i must admit it does fit nice...for a while. To me it feels just like the $2 one i bought at Walmart in the sports section. It may be a bit thinner, but if it is it&#x27;s not much. Mine continues to fall out every night and is bulky just like the football ones. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $15. It is not a different material like some people said, its rubber that&#x27;s it. If i were you i would just buy one at Walmart if you want one like this. It&#x27;s the same. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> When you put the guard in hot water, which the directions tell you, it shrinks up and gets small plus real thick. Impossible to work with and mold to your teeth. Total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> It was a little bigger than expected.</li>
            <li> My dentist began urging me to replace my old custom-fitted grind guards with a new, and very expensive one a little over a year ago. The old ones (I had two) were uncomfortable, because they no longer fit me. They were relatively inexpensive when I bought them (even though they were custom-fitted) and had lasted me for years, plus my dental insurance had paid for them back then. Not so with the fancy new one! The price quoted was a whopping $450! I nearly fell out of the dentist&#x27;s chair when he told me the price, but the kicker was that my dental insurance would no longer pay for it. Well, I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to spend that much money out of pocket (virtually highway robbery in my book), regardless of whether I needed it or not, so I researched the Web for a suitable replacement that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. I finally decided on this set of grind guards, because they looked like they would do the job for a very reasonable price, and you get two in the package so there is a spare for when the first one wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grind Guards arrived in the mail very promptly and were child&#x27;s play to prepare and fit to my mouth. In little more than fifteen minutes after opening the package, I had a replacement for my old guard. It fit my teeth perfectly, and I like the fact that it is a bit thicker than my old ones, because it doesn&#x27;t squish up when you grind your teeth. It is very comfortable to wear. I really have to laugh, because the dentist was trying to tell me that I would spend loads more money on generic grind guards, so the really expensive one would save me money in the long run. I don&#x27;t see how, given the price of these! Even including shipping, I&#x27;d have to buy 30 or so packages of grind guards before I&#x27;d spend as one of the expensive guards costs--not to mention paying the dentist to fit it. Believe me, I will definitely buy these again when the ones I just purchased wear out, so take that Mr. Dentist! I am VERY happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The picture of the grind guard depicts 2 grind guards, and is the extremely similar to the image used by Discount Infomercial Products for this product; in which they are selling 2 of these guards. This constitutes false advertising; in which the seller is showing 2 guards but only selling one; and should be considered unacceptable by all of Amazon&#x27;s customers. The seller either needs to be explicit that the picture does not represent the product accurately, or use a picture that only includes what&#x27;s being sold. I have left a seller review and also filed an investigation with Amazon&#x27;s rule-violation team, as well as returned my used product for a refund. This is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> For months I have been grinding my teeth, snoring and so on.. My girlfriend couldn&#x27;t stand it..and Personally I couldn&#x27;t stand waking up to my mouth being ..well..gross...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I BOUGHT THIS thing and let me say... it HELPED ALOT!!... I don&#x27;t snore, my teeth feel so much better in the morning..and it was super easy to fit to my mouth and so on... Honestly its a god send and I AM REALLY HAPPY I used this one..instead of spending the 50 bucks on another one..while its cheap... The quality is perfect..and I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it yet..</li>
            <li> Very good mouth guard. Easy to use. Works great. Fast shipping. You get a great mouth guard for a great price. It&#x27;s way better than buying it at the local walmart or grocery store. Better quality and way cheaper!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I paid $400 for the night guard I got from my dentist and it never did fit exactly right. My brother told me to look on Amazon for a cheaper night guard and there are several options but this was the cheapest and the easiest actually to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since getting my EXPENSIVE night guard from my dentist I&#x27;ve had to have 3 more teeth filled so of course the night guard that was made won&#x27;t fit any better now than it did when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS night guard is exactly as advertised. I&#x27;ve had to \\&quot;reform\\&quot; it 3 times due to the fillings in my teeth and it is a snap to do. IT WILL NOT BURN YOUR MOUTH, trust me, I wasn&#x27;t keen on boiling water and sticking a hot item in my mouth and using my tongue to push on it and form it but like the ad says it won&#x27;t burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one complaint and the recommendation to go with it -- It wasn&#x27;t quite long enough to get my back molars. Everybody&#x27;s mouth is different. Keep that in mind when \\&quot;forming\\&quot; this to your own mouth. The hardest part is that the first time you put it in the water is softens very fast and then when you pull it out of the water it is very sticky and it sticks to itself! It&#x27;s like trying to use packing tape on a box and you&#x27;ve only got one hand to hold the flaps and the other to put the tape on. :) You will most likely need a pair of tongs or a fork or something to keep it \\&quot;open\\&quot; so to speak and then put it in your mouth. If you have to reform it and do it again BOIL THE WATER AGAIN or it won&#x27;t reset as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-This guard is awesome for simply using it as a chew toy when you might have drunken too much coffee or you&#x27;re really into what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes in a nice little circular carrying case, just big enough to fit it.&lt;br /&gt;-Very easy to shape with boiling and a knife. Took 10 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly too big for my mouth, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to use it while I&#x27;m trying to sleep. Either that or it&#x27;d take a while to get used to, since I&#x27;ve never had a night guard before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you wash it after ever use!</li>
            <li> have had a night mouth guard made by the orthodontist when i was younger (couple hundred dollars) and the only difference between that one and this one is the huge price difference and the thickness of the guard. the dentist one was probably 2-3 times thicker than this grind guard. i will probably wear this one down sooner than i did the dentist one, but even if i end up going through 5 or 6 of these in the amount of time i did my dentist one it will be less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;helping with significantly reducing my teeth/jaw pain from having a hard-bite and tjm. definitely recommend this item if you have either condition.</li>
            <li> Wife had a problem with grinding her teeth while she was asleep at night. I bought this and after her wearing for a week she stopped! Ever so often she will start up again and she puts these in and no more grinding!</li>
            <li> but it is a little thick for my small mouth.  i had to cut out some of the center and, because it&#x27;s so big in my mouth, it is very uncomfortable.  i had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty huge. You have to do the hot water process several times to work away some of the excess material. I wouldn&#x27;t use it permanently, you definitely want your dentist to fit something professional if you grind regular and need an appliance.</li>
            <li> did not like this at all. its in the trash or something. get the dr. something or other one at target or CVS. A million times better.</li>
            <li> This is a great product a price for night grinders. Yea... they are a bit thin and I do eventually bite through them, but the material should not be kept for a long period anyways. Once they discolor, you need to throw away. I trash about every 4-5 months and just use a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is great for that. Much appreciated since I used to pay around eighteen for just one in the local store.</li>
            <li> A few months ago my wife took my 15 year old to the dentist and came back with a $350 charge for a custom molded guard for teeth grinding.  Now, my son does grind his teeth while he sleeps so I was not surprised that his Dr recommended a guard.  I was shocked by the price and our insurance did not cover this so it came out of our pocket.  3 visits and 4 weeks later he came home with his new guard and all was well except I was still in sticker shock so I looked on line and found this mouth guard for $12.50.  Why we were not advised of this option I will never know for certain but it sure felt like a money grab from good ol&#x27; doc xxxx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months later I go in for my check up and wouldn&#x27;t you know it but he&#x27;s also worried about my teeth.  I never knew I grind my teeth but \\&quot;oh well\\&quot;.  I went straight home and ordered this one for 12 bucks.  Bottom line is it works just fine and is easy enough to sleep with (my biggest concern).  Even if it wears out in 6 months I am still light years ahead in the cost department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor - order this first before shelling out big bucks for the \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; job.  If you don&#x27;t like it you are only out $12.50. If it works you just saved over $300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a no brainer to at least try it.</li>
            <li> This guard has two fatal defects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It failed to assume a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It imparts a foul chemical taste in the mouth.  Read: One could remove the word \\&quot;taste\\&quot; from that sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw it in the trash, the result of an Internet purchase made without benefit of a warning.  This is your warning.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly on me.  I don&#x27;t have any problem sleeping with this product. The instruction is very clear and easy to follow.  Also the customer rep, Kathy, provided me an excellent service.  I am planning to purchase this product for my husband.</li>
            <li> I have done this once and never received any communication from Amazon ot the seller. I never received this product and never received a credit to my Visa. I am disappointed in Amazon for not handling this problem in the first place.  Thank you, Mary Tuley</li>
            <li> I bought this because I broke the acrylic night guard I was using for bruxism for the past two years. This one is easy to use, easy to adjust (although it is too large even for my not-too-small mouth). However, it is too soft and too flexible to be used for a long time - I have been using it for two months and it is completely disintegrated, and has holes that I have chewn into it.&lt;br /&gt;I have scheduled an appointment and will have a proper acrylic night guard made for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months using Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard http://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Dental-Protector-Grinding-Medium/dp/tech-data/B004PX39TM  - Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard actually lasts for months, whereas this Grind Guard disintegrated after very little use. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I started having my teeth chipped and I cant afford the 200 dollar dentist provided ones. these are good, I cant tell if they are working or not only time will. my only complaint is that they fit a little weird forcing the mandible (lower jaw) to protrude a little bit causing discomfort</li>
            <li> I have had a grinding problem for many years.  My dentist made a grind guard for me 8 years ago.  It was very expensive.  When it finally broke, I thought I would try one online.  I am surprisingly pleased with it.  I thought I was wasting money.  It accomplishes the job--keeping your teeth from bashing together.  I did have to trim a little and it is a little bigger than my previous one, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> my friends liked the information this book provided. I don&#x27;t know what else to say but read it or skim it when you have a moment</li>
            <li> Good material and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have a small adult jaw and just could not get this to fit.  Good material and would be good for someone with a large mouth.</li>
            <li> it was the worse product i ever used. way too thick. It wasn&#x27;t comfortable at all. I had to sleep with my mouth wide open. Better to order the custom one online. Only about $50-60 but worth it</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow, and despite being a petite person it seems like the size of the plastic was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through the boil-and-shape process 3 times, felt like it fit my teeth decently, but when i cut the front peice of plastic off the residual plastic cuts the front of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even after shaping 3 times i still felt like the upper front part did not conform that well to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe i&#x27;m spoiled because previously i had one my dentist had professionally molded to my mouth and it was awesome.</li>
            <li> This guard worked good for me. I bought one that cost over 4 times as much and it ended up in the trash. You will like this one. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> My dentist hates all over the counter guards. Well, hate is a strong word. She strongly dislikes them, but understands people can&#x27;t always afford the guards made in office. When I asked her to look this one over after I had molded it to my teeth she was fairly impressed with the quality. It was soft enough on the inside to protect my teeth, rugged enough on the outside to withstand my grinding and clenching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought 3 of thses so far. The first time, it was very simple to mold to my teeth. Almost too easy it seems. I may have actually lucked into the fit, but it fit well and I feel naked at night without it. The 2nd &amp; 3rd time did not go nearly as well. I think I wasn&#x27;t letting them heat up long enough, then reheating them too long because I could never get that nice tight fit and eventually they got too out of shape. I still have my first one though, and it seems to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li> Headaches - gone!  Teeth grinding - gone!  This has really helped my sleep, as well as reduced jaw pain and headaches.  Yes!</li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago and i love it. The instructions are very clear. I had to do it two times because the first time it didn&#x27;t work. The second time i got a tight fit. It feels almost like braces or something.</li>
            <li> I wake up without a headache/jaw ache every morning!  Easy to customize the fit, easy to clean every day. It took a night to adjust to having something in my mouth, but after that I never notice it, and I sleep well. For some reason I thought I needed one for upper and lower, so I have an extra, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> THIS DID NOT WORK AS I WANTED.  IT WAS ACTUALLY JUST A MESS TO FIGURE OUT AND TRY TO USE.  I WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN</li>
            <li> I found the molding method didn&#x27;t work that great.  Also, when I used it over the following days, it felt very hard and it didn&#x27;t really fit me that well.  All I can say is it&#x27;s fairly cheap and does the job OK, give it a try.</li>
            <li> My $500. night guard from my dentist just gave out so I bought this grind guard. I love it. it fits perfectly. It&#x27;s softer than my dentist&#x27;s model which is  better for all my grinding.</li>
            <li> Updated review:  I will shortly be purchasing my third one of these guards.  It is still cheaper than paying hundreds at the dentist and having the custom guard only last a couple of months longer than these.  I have also been shopping around for other DIY guards, and this one is the best deal that I have found.  Your experience, of course, may vary -- if you don&#x27;t like this style or the material, perhaps.  Sometimes it takes more tries to get the fit right.  But in my opinion, it&#x27;s still a good deal, and it beats grinding.  Now, back to my original review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second do-it-yourself grind guard (I tried the \\&quot;Dental Hygiene\\&quot; one first).  Before that I have had over twenty years of the custom kind from the dentist, but they just got too expensive and my most recent one wore out too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little tab on this one is an interesting feature.  You hold it by the tab to dunk it in the hot water for shaping, and then lift it out (and the hot water runs off -- it&#x27;s the water, not the guard, that can burn you at this stage).  After you have molded it to your satisfaction, you cut off the tab.  I didn&#x27;t get a smooth surface at the cut spot yet, but it&#x27;s good enough, and it beat having to maneuver it with tongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guard seems to be a firmer \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; than the other one I tried, and I have hope that perhaps it will last longer. It took two tries, then I got a very good fit and it stays on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do prefer the retainer style, that I got from my first dentist way back when, but I haven&#x27;t had another opportunity to get one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mouthguard for about two weeks now and I have to say its the best one I&#x27;ve used so far (I&#x27;ve tried many store-bought and online brands).  It was easy to use, with that tab in the front and I tend to grind me teeth heavily at night so this has been a good product. The only drawback I would say is that it doesn&#x27;t allow ventilation, like some of the other mouth guards I&#x27;ve used in the past. So sometimes, I feel stifled but thats just a preference.  Overall it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Guard is softer than I had hoped.  Forming is very critical ... overheat the guard and it will collapse into a mess of jelly.  Destroyed one of two guards before I learned this fact.</li>
            <li> These came in a Ziploc baggie!! No labels, packaging, or anything at all that would suggest that I received a new product. I got about 4 of the guards in a Ziploc bag, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> The product works well, good quality, reasonable price, and it really seems to do the job for which it was purchased.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS HELPED ME SO MUCH/NOT ONLY DOES IT FIT WELL YOU FIX IT WHERE IT ISYOU SIZE  NOT HARD TO DO</li>
            <li> Personally, the grind tray is too thick to sleep with comfortably. Basically, I bought a tray case that came with a crap tray. I think I broke even.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product for the price, i won&#x27;t use any thing else.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and form.  This feels much better at night than the fitted one I got from the dentist.</li>
            <li> the preparation of the guard was simple and easy to follow, after doing the initial fit the first few nights were ok the guard did not cause me to salivate like others but I do have a fault with the guard my bottom teeth pierced through after a few weeks</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
            <li> I did just what the directions said for molding this, and the 1st time it was too stiff, the 2nd time it melted.</li>
            <li> Product does its job, Will defiantly order more when it comes time for me to replace the guard but it doesn&#x27;t look like I will be needing to doing that soon.</li>
            <li> Good deal. .. works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Cute Gift Store - fulfilled by Amazon.  The guard came in a resealable plastic bag, no original packaging, no instructions.  This is a personal care item so I think it is reasonable to expect sealed manufacturers packaging like the one in the picture.  I returned and Amazon has refunded my money so no problems there.  Not really about the Archtek product but more about Cute Gift store and I don&#x27;t get to rate them.  I would try the Archtek product from another vendor.</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t need to have one of these (hard to get used to), but need to prevent further teeth grinding in my sleep...easy to fit...</li>
            <li> This does just what it claims, great affordable product.</li>
            <li> Works like it says. Love it.</li>
            <li> I thought there was 2 in the pack, but I only received one....other than that, it&#x27;s great. Used them before too.</li>
            <li> I suppose this product would work to keep from grinding at night. After 3 attempts at shaping it the material felt mildly molded to my mouth shape (you can&#x27;t see any teeth impressions but it does seem a little less stiff). However, due to the thickness of the material on the molars, I can&#x27;t close my mouth or fit my lips over the product in the front. It would be too uncomfortable for me to sleep like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never use it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the kind of guard that helps stop the habit of clenching the jaw. I didn&#x27;t realize there were two kinds. This guard only helps stop teeth grinding. Since I don&#x27;t have that habit, it&#x27;s useless to me.</li>
            <li> These grind guards are awesome. They molded perfectly to my teeth and fit comfortably through the night. My dentist wanted to make them for me, for some crazy price. I&#x27;m so happy I found these on Amazon. They do the trick, and my teeth are very happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my old night guard. I tend to grind my teeth quite frequently and sometimes wake up with sore jaws due too heavy grinding. My old night guard was too bulky, which is why I purchased this. Top my dismay, this one will not for no matter what I do. I attempted to re-fit this several times to no luck. It will simply not stay in place. In addition, the the front in very bulky and forces my lips to protrude outwards, which is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions several times before forming the guard to my teeth. It was too soft and too flimsy when I placed it in my mouth and when I sucked the air out it turned and I was not aware of it. I tried to correct the shape it formed but I was unable. I did nothing wrong. I followed the instructions to a T and yet I had a problem. However, for the price and the suitability of the product I would purchase another and be even more careful when forming it next time.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery.  Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried this based on previous reviews and not wanting to shell out $400 at the dentist. It&#x27;s okay but not exactly comfortable and takes a while to get used to.</li>
            <li> l  have used this washable,  durable guard for months now. Not only does it stop the grinding but it is comfortable AND l have a painful habit of chewing on my tongue. When l&#x27;m home and that habit begins to interrupt, l pop in the Grind Guard and it relieves that as well!</li>
            <li> greatly help my child from grinding teeth at night.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of reviews I&#x27;ve read, this is easier to wear on your lower jaw.  Can&#x27;t get it to fit right on the upper.  Found it next to me a lot the next morning.  I haven&#x27;t worn it in a while because it started to make my jaw ache - whether it was the stress of work getting worse and grinding with it on or the guard alone, I&#x27;m not sure.  Still have it; if I use it again, it won&#x27;t be for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to form the fitting to my top teeth; however, it fits a little rough, feels too thin in places. So I plan to reheat and form it. Also, the place where the front tab tears off is rough, scratching my upper lip. I tried smoothing it with scissors to no avail, so I think a razor blade will work better.</li>
            <li> Easy to use if you follow the simple directions and works really, really well. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li> You can spend a lot more in a drugstore, but this is as good as the pricier brands.  Great for night grinding!  I just wish I had tried it before I paid the $450 out of pocket for that stupid NTI device.  Don&#x27;t bother with that device!  It even shrinks over time and doesn&#x27;t fit anymore, and never was comfortable.</li>
            <li> Since I grind my teeth at night, this has helped protect my gums.  I lost all my upper teeth, earlier this year, and with out the guard my gums were getting sore from the grinding.</li>
            <li> It was super bulky and big. It was extremely hard plastic that was uncomfortable. I&#x27;d much rather use the DenTex one and pay a few extra dollars for it. Not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old wanted to try a mouth guard since she grinds her teeth while she sleeps. It was easy to boil the piece and it was no too hot when we put it in her mouth to form it. Good value.</li>
            <li> this works great,better than i was told ,try it yourself.it is good for the price,easy to mold for your mouth</li>
            <li> My daughter says this hurts and leaves sores in her mouth</li>
            <li> After boiling the mouthpiece it was too slippery to fit around my teeth. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a mouthguard that I can&#x27;t use. However, the case that comes with the mouthguard is nice :)</li>
            <li> Your all fooling your self if you think these appliances work...Grinding is really never a problem, its the clenching at nite thats the serious issue. Grinding is only a para-functional modality that we all have to one degree or another. These fabricated toys can never duplicate the joint balance that is physically required. A slight imperfection can cause serious problems in the joint balance. Besides, the grinding never stops, your back teeth are still hitting, this time on the added material you&#x27;ve stuffed in your mouth. Clenching on the back teeth is the issue. This is the issue, the back teeth must be in a position where they don&#x27;t touch while sleeping....be smart...see your dentist</li>
            <li> My dentist told me I needed a night guard for teeth grinding that costs about $500.  I found this cheap one online and figured it was a bargain but it is VERY uncomfortable and hurt my jaw a lot.  I could not keep it in for even a few minutes without being extremely uncomfortable.  Save your money and get the one from your dentist that is molded to your mouth.  In the long run that is better than wasting money on this one.</li>
            <li> I wear this when I have migraines to prevent me from grinding my teeth from the pain. I&#x27;ve found it to be really effective. The guard is nice and thick, and doesn&#x27;t wear down very easily. I&#x27;ve tried other guards, and they are usually too thin, or fit awkwardly in my mouth.  Make sure to cut off the tab AS CLOSE as you can. Otherwise, the plastic will rub your lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these a long time. It has really really helped me with my teeth grinding. I would suggest anyone with a teeth grinding problem to give this a try.</li>
            <li> This product is very uncomfortable to wear at night because you feel like you are choking a little.</li>
            <li> I am not able to make it fit properly</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a reasonable price. I used it and it worked. My jaws do not hurt anymore. Use for at least 1 month or 2 before seeing results.</li>
            <li> If you cannot afford a guard made by the dentist then this would be the product to buy.  You can mold the guard according the shape of your mouth and teeth.  It will not fit as well as one from the dentist&#x27;s and that is why I rated it 4 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable and the guard can do the job well.  I have a small mouth and therefore, it fits pretty well.  If you have a large mouth, it might not do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, all in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> I really like this one. The older ones I got always fell apart in 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve had this for quite sometime now and it&#x27;s as good as new. It is slightly big for my mouth but I got used to it and it doesn&#x27;t cause me any discomfort. I would surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love my teeth grind guard. It is thick and it is very tough and durable. It handles the stress if all that I do with my teeth. Before bed, I pout it in my mouth and sometimes I unconsciously play with it and roll it around in my mouth, chew it, and bend it with my teeth and  it looks brand new everyday. I love that it came with a case to store it and keep it from getting dirty.</li>
            <li> This is a good mouth guard.  I&#x27;ve used several and this works fine.  The price is great and does not mean it is any lower quality.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mouth guard I&#x27;ve ever tried. You get what you pay for. For a lot of things I buy the cheaper option (usually off amazon or on-line), but this thing does not work at all. It&#x27;s impossible to make it stay in place after you mold it to your mouth. Most of the over the counter mouth guards have a soft upper and hard bottom where your teeth would grind against. This is soft all the way through. It&#x27;s just like a sports mouth guard. The only good thing about it, is I like their idea to have the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; in the front that you cut off after you mold it. If only it would mold...  Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I ground my teeth for years, but in my old age, not so much. However, I recently had a difficult filling in my upper molar, and the dentist said I might have to have a root canal. So far it does not ache too much, but a few times I awoke at night with bad pain as had been grinding on that side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guard seemed worth a try. The shaping process was easy. I can see if people don&#x27;t follow the directions exactly, they may have trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the shaping, it fit perfectly, and after a few minutes don&#x27;t even notice it. It works! No more grinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only fault is when I first put it in, and when I have to get up an night to go to the bathroom, a lot of saliva seems to form. I just swallow a few times, and when I go to bed, breath through my mouth for a few minutes, and all is well again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this lasts a while, but if not, I will definitely get another, as can&#x27;t go wrong on the price for such an device that works so well.</li>
            <li> I lost my $500 mouth guard in a hotel room while traveling for business. I decided to order this as a stop gap while trying to figure out the insurance on the lost one. After wearing this one for about 3 days it was remarkably more comfortable then the one from the dentist. After checking with my dentist he said I could use this one all the time so I saved my self $480 and have a great product.</li>
            <li> Came in faster than expected, and was very easy to fit to my mouth.</li>
            <li> Guard works fine. I only wore it two nights since it&#x27;s so large and uncomfortable to sleep with. The container it came with was dirty and seemed already used and scuffed up! Disgusting! What a waste to purchase a more expensive mouth guard with a case when it came like that.</li>
            <li> waste of money, did not fit</li>
            <li> For a mouth guard, this is about as comfortable as it gets, which isn&#x27;t too bad.  JUST MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!  I had to order another one because I boiled it too long and warped it.  I&#x27;m not deducting stars for that, since it was my fault.  The only bad thing I have to say is that it&#x27;s kind of thick, and it throws my jaw/bite off for half a day after wearing it, so I can&#x27;t wear it every night.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is my first time wearing a mouth guard at night, the fit is tight I think after you put the imprint of your teeth in then rinse it with cold water it shrinks the guard a bit making it smallish when wearing it at night.</li>
            <li> These are easy to fit your mouth and to trim and are very affordable. I highly recommend them as they are MUCH cheaper than getting a mouth guard from the dentist and works exactly the same!</li>
            <li> I have only used it one day, but it works great.  No more grinding!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have an issue with teeth grinding, but found the mouth guard to be uncomfortable.  I only used a few nights and discontinued use.  Other than my own dissatisfaction the product would work and is easy to mold to mouth.</li>
            <li> This is not a grind guard it&#x27;s a tray from a teeth whitening kit.  It&#x27;s thick and big and impossible to sleep in without gagging and drooling all over.</li>
            <li> I have been grinding my teeth at night pretty much forever.  About 3 years ago I switched dentists and he suggested that I have a mouth guard made.  It was a solid molded piece that absolutely fit well and did the job-It also cost over $600.  It took 2 years but I did finally wear this guard out and I could not bring myself to pay another $600.  I tried several lower cost models before this one with little success.  I found this product, molded it (actually I molded it twice to get a good fit)and have been using it every night since.  It has been 3 months and so far the guard shows very little wear. (and I grind pretty hard)&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, particularly at the price point.  You really have nothing to lose and you may just get a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> Even though you customize this by boiling them and then fitting them to the shape of your teeth, but they&#x27;re still big and uncomfortable. I can&#x27;t sleep with them on. It&#x27;s like wearing a boxer&#x27;s mouth guard while trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> Prevents teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a second one, as I mis-formed the first one.&lt;br /&gt;However, even with that, it&#x27;s totally worth it. Dentist wanted &amp;#62;$500 for a custom fit one, but this one fits really well; I have a pretty large mouth, for reference. I actually can feel the rubber between my teeth when I&#x27;m grinding--so I can&#x27;t tell exactly if having the guard is bringing to my attention how much I grind, or if the guard is causing me to grind more. Either way, it&#x27;s stopping teeth-on-teeth action, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I would vigorously grind my teeth at night, it was loud enough to hear from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;So I needed a quick solution to ease the problem, and this guard was it. When you first start using the guard it will feel uncomfortable for a few nights, mainly because its a bit unnatural to sleep with. But I assure you that you will get used to it as I did. Fortunately I do not grind my teeth as much and would only use the guard on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some minor things that I didn&#x27;t quite like about it. First was the material, if you have just as sharp teeth as I do this won&#x27;t last you too (**I recommend seeing your orthodontist for suggestions on guards). And second would be hard to sleep with, this is because wearing the guard force you to either fall sleep with your mouth open or clamping your mouth down on the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this guard if and only if you need a quick fix. If it&#x27;s long term, ask your orthodontist for suggestions (*Do not be cheap and invest into something that can and will benefit you)</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good deal, boy was I worng , worked on it many times and couldn&#x27;t fit it, more wasted $$$</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old. It was a bit big at first, but after trimming it down it fits great! Now the hassle is getting him to keep it in his mouth!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit so I returned it and got my money back.  Bought another one from Rite-Aid and it was a little better.  Still looking for a better fitting one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of anti-grinding mouth guards over the years. I found this one to be the thinnest, most unobtrusive I&#x27;ve found. The fitting process was easy, and the thin plastic fits very snugly around my teeth. I have a small mouth, so I trimmed 1/4 off the length off of the end with household scissors. The plastic feels flexible yet sturdy.</li>
            <li> felt so soft from day one, can sleep all night without discomfort.</li>
            <li> Easy to shape, I had to trim some jagged edges after the shaping. It seems a little bulky on my teeth but after a few nights I hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> Grind Guard is the most comfortable guard I&#x27;ve tried. It feels less bulky than the others. It&#x27;s also very soft and soothing to the gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to reheat and remold it three times before it would cling to my teeth properly. The cut-away handle made it easy to submerge and retract the guard from the boiling water. I like that it only needs to be placed in the boiling water for ten seconds. There is no need to cool this in cold water before fitting it (like with other guards I&#x27;ve tried). It went from the boiling water to my month. It was warm, but it didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are clearly marked indentations showing you where to cut this guard if it&#x27;s too big. I had to cut mine before boiling. After I molded and cooled it I cut off the handle and re-dipped that jagged section. I smoothed it out with a press of my finger. Perfect! No sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grind Guard, unlike other guards, didn&#x27;t leave me with the sensation that my bite was out of alinement after removing it. I believe that&#x27;s because it lacks that strip of very hard plastic strip that prevails in other mouth guards. I don&#x27;t know how long this will last without that hard plastic, but I would gladly buy more due to its comfort level. I cannot stress enough how comfortable this thing is. I&#x27;m going to purchase a couple more.</li>
            <li> did not like this item, was not worth the money .. i will be getting actual one done by my dentist.. i rather have it done right..</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a night guard.  My dentist tried to sell me one for $600, so I looked for alternate solutions.  The fitting procedure is tricky.  It took 4 tries to get a reasonable fit.  My 2nd try, I accidentally deformed the edge on one side of the guard by biting down on it.  The tab is very useful for dipping the guard into the boiling water.  The 1st night I tried the guard, it didn&#x27;t feel secure, but never actually came out of my mouth.  On subsequent uses, the guard seemed to tighten up--perhaps the body heat allows it to better conform to the teeth.  In any case, I&#x27;m happy to continue use and will probably get another one when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a guard that would fit a smaller mouth.  I did have to cut off the back and the top and bottom and it would have been fine had I not decided to dunk it again in the boiling water after cutting.  USE THE TAB!  I tried a spoon to fish it out and it stuck to the pan and stayed in the water way too long and ended up in a blob.</li>
            <li> Look at the picture and think i&#x27;m getting 2, look and the description details and realise it&#x27;s only one! Not cool since the 2 pack is almost the same price and you get 2 they both use the same picture as well?</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and this product works for me.  When I first opened the package I thought there was no way that this would work but once I trimmed it and boiled it I was surprised! This fits quite comfortably.  I am able to close my mouth around it which I couldn&#x27;t with another guard that I bought that was much more expensive.  I like the rounded edges - nothing boxey in my mouth.  I can&#x27;t believe this quality and comfort for such a small price.</li>
            <li> I got this grind guard and fitted it to my mouth.  I have tried to trim it and it still makes me gag.  It&#x27;s bulky in my mouth and I can&#x27;t seem to get it to fit right.  I tried to save some money but this is not working for me at all.  I still will use it until I can find something better.</li>
            <li> What ages can use this product? And when would it be shipped by  and does it work good because im not trying to buy an expensive mouth guard from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Attempted to use for night grinding with child. It was hard to let it cool enough not to burn and get it to fit her mouth. Eventually we succeeded, but she said that it was very uncomfortable. Found a different (cheaper) one designed for kids in the store and tried that. It fit much better.</li>
            <li> This has been working great for me, I like it more than the last one I had that cost twice as much. I did the forming procedure twice when I got and it fits my mouth perfectly. It never moves at night and protects my teeth. Definitely will get this one again whenever it wears out.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and did the quick boil.  Before I could even get it to my mouth it shrunk and completely folded in on itself and it was a solid mass of useless plastic before it even made it to my mouth.  It went straight into the garbage.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I would have given it zero stars but it wouldn&#x27;t let me.</li>
            <li> I waited a couple of months before submitting my review because I wanted to see how well this product would perform over time. So far it&#x27;s performed much better than I expected. It is comfortable to wear while sleeping and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects. The guard is odorless and leaves no aftertaste in your mouth. The plastic is thicker than the ones available from my dentist, but not to the degree that it is bothersome. Considering that it costs approximately $575 less than the one offered by my dentist it is a good value. For those who are wondering, this guard is made to fit on the upper teeth, not the lower. I have a medium sized mouth so the guard fits me pretty well. I imagine people with very small mouths or very large mouths might have problems with this item and would require a custom fitted guard.</li>
            <li> good product and fast delivery, very well manufactured and build. i recommend it for every body, and i will order it again if i need another one.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. In the store you can find a product like this for almost $40 which to me is a rip off.</li>
            <li> The guard is comfortable and has helped my symptoms decrease. The onlt thing I did not like was the tab that you need to remove, it left a little tab that has been hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> bought this for my 7 year old daughter and was too large to fit her mouth. we tried cutting several times to no avail. i wish they made them for smaller mouths, kids suffer from bruxism too</li>
            <li> For the last few years I&#x27;ve had an issue with clenching and grinding my teeth. Not just while I sleep, though it seems that when I do it most often. I&#x27;ve gone to 3 different dentists and mentioned this to them and not one of them advised me to get a guard to wear while I sleep so I wasn&#x27;t sure what exactly to look for. But I came on Amazon to look for something that could be beneficial to me (and my teeth) and came upon this one. After I received it in the mail, I stuck in my mouth before going through the routine of placing it in boiling water and molding it to my teeth. It was bulky and stored a lot of my spit in it. I thought to myself, &amp;#34;Oh man... did I choose the wrong one?&amp;#34; But later that night, before going to bed, I boiled the water, I placed the guard in and then did as the instructions told me to when it came time to mold them to my upper teeth. It took less than half a minute for it to mold and cool off. That same night, after wearing the guard while I slept, I woke up noticing that I didn&#x27;t have that horrible pain in my jaw caused by the clenching and grinding. I was so happy! Not only that, but it&#x27;s a comfortable fit, didn&#x27;t gag me like some reviewers claimed it did, and now I even wear it sometimes when I&#x27;m at home doing certain things that require my concentration (primal time for me to clench my teeth when my mind is occupied on something else).</li>
            <li> Easy to fit, maybe too easy. It&#x27;s fine for the first few weeks, but starts &#x27;giving&#x27;. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to try to get this to fit. After about 8 tries I gave up. It will not fit at all even with boiling. I finally tried it in the microwave thinking that maybe then it can fit but it wont. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are very uncomfortable because you cannot shape them to the contours of your mouth; I never wore them for more than an hour because they hurt my teeth so much.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly... product a little stiffer than I thought it would be so I cant  wear all night or even all day...</li>
            <li> After many years of migraines with little relief, I have finally found some! My new dentist informed me I grind my teeth (I had no idea!) and encouraged me to try one of these. What a saint! I wear this every night and I can totally tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Fiance. We followed the instructions, precisely. It was uncomfortable for him to mold, after attempting twice. We weren&#x27;t able to use it at all</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;do it at home&amp;#34; mouth guard. My first one was from the dentist so that is all I have to compare this to.  I clench and have been doing more so at night recently so I know I need to start wearing a guard again. I wanted to try this for $11 before spending $$ at the dentist on a new guard.&lt;br /&gt;I boiled water in a coffee cup in the microwave and dropped these in for about 10 seconds. It softened up quickly and more than I was prepared for but it was fine. I was surprised by how &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34; and sticky it was. I put it into my mouth right away and used my tongue to form it to my teeth. My teenage son uses these for sports and he suggested &amp;#34;sucking air in&amp;#34; and when I did that I felt it get even tighter and a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;Once in bed for the night and I put this in, it was much bulkier than the dentist-office made one. I bet I only left it in 10 minutes and took it out and haven&#x27;t put it back in. It&#x27;s too large/uncomfortable for me. I&#x27;m going to pony up the $$ for a professional grade one.</li>
            <li> I had to try several times but I got a very good  fit. (I was scared of burning myself, but they&#x27;re right: it won&#x27;t happen. The device stays soft so it seems like it will give good protection without causing the aching jaw one gets from  clenching very hard. Why do we do this? Bruxism is so strange!</li>
            <li> This did not work.  I tried it five times and it would not mold.</li>
            <li> This is awful. I tried to overlook the bad reviews when ordering this guard, but it really is so bad. Its huge. If you think you can sleep with your mouth open drooling everywhere than give it a try, but I could never even fall asleep.</li>
            <li> BULKY BUT DOES ITS JOB... MIGHT AS WELL BUY A THIN MOUTH GUARD FOR HALF THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for your kids, espeically if they grind their teeth while sleeping.  Also, if you&#x27;re an adult and you work out, lift weights, etc. etc., this grind guard works well, so that YOU don&#x27;t grind your teeth.....</li>
            <li> Really helped keep me from grinding my teeth while sleeping.  No taste nor odor.  Much more effective than item found at the dollar store.  Very fast delivery.  Thank you for listing this item.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and had to get a mouth guard for my grinding. At first it was a little uncomfortable since I normally don&#x27;t sleep with it but eventually you don&#x27;t feel a think. My neck pain has reduced dramatically. I  used to wake up with super tight jaw but now I wake up without feeling the pain post grinding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to wear, easy to mold, and makes me sleep better. I consistently wake up feeling more rested when I use the Grind Guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I molded it, I used my finger to press the guard into my upper teeth, but it ended up too tight and my teeth/gums would feel weird in the morning. After a couple days I re-molded it and simply used my tongue to lightly press it against my teeth, and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> Has a strong plastic taste to it.</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy enough to follow and managed to mold the guard to fit my mouth.  The grind guard certainly does stop grinding teeth.  After a couple of weeks, the guard needed remolding, which worked OK, and then after a few weeks more needed remolding again - the last time it didn&#x27;t work very well.  So although it worked, it didn&#x27;t last, and I&#x27;ll be looking for another product.</li>
            <li> Works great, comfortable, and the price is fantastic compared to a custom device sold by your dentist.  I did not have any problems with the hot water method of fitting the guard.  After softening the guard and placing on your teeth, draw in your lungs to create a  vacuum in your mouth to get a good fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, and they hold up just fine. I have to replace one every 6 months or so, which is acceptable. It&#x27;s a tad too big for my mouth, but not by much. It sometimes irritates one side of my gums, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works very well if you follow directions (ruined one I bought at store).  Fairly easy to use and fit-just thoroughly read directions.  2 in package.&lt;br /&gt;Use one for home and one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price.  Cheaper than local Drug stores.  Packaging is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought 2 boxes too have a back up set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for your grinding issues.</li>
            <li> All went well with the boil and wait, and fitting .  The Grind Guard did a fine job for about a week.  Then, I rinsed it in warm (NOT HOT) water, and it lost its shape and became useless.</li>
