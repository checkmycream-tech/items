            <li> Too Thick to pump. Possibly old stock.</li>
            <li> The product I ordered few weeks ago arrived but the content was not good. I ordered 2 Barielle AM Puffy Eye Relief Cream that came from Cosmetic Solutions, this cream is very dry cannot be pump out and I cannot use it I guess its old. I have use this same product for several years and never never seen something like this before also there were no instruction or information sheet inside in either of the boxes and these boxes arrived out of shape.&lt;br /&gt;I am very very dissatisfied and unhappy with my order.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Janet</li>
            <li> I bought this at Marshall&#x27;s for the fraction of the price listed here.  It&#x27;s okay.  It did help some of the puffiness I experience with allergies, but the dark cirles are still there.  It also has a funky odor.</li>
            <li> Definitely seems to work for under eye puffiness! Because of allergies, I wake up daily with this problem. Not any more!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works quite quickly. Recommend you give it a try, especially since the price is so reasonable !</li>
            <li> I used it morning and evening and found that I had no puffy eyes to use it on as the cream prevented my eyes becoming puffy overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply creamy consistency not to thick and not to thin.&lt;br /&gt;One criticism was the pump action of bottle dispenses twice as much cream as you need and was unable to adjust amount dispensed .so lot of wastage</li>

            <li> Bought this many moons ago at a discount store. So happy I found it here on amazon. Really does take the puffiness down. I use it in the AM and PM.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve reordered it several times</li>
            <li> I used this product several times. It not only irritates my skin, but it also migrates into my eyes, making them red and even more puffy.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not work as it says, and it&#x27;s not worth a penny.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is irritating as well.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it does the job reducing puffy eyes quickly and gives results quickly.</li>
            <li> I am now trying Barielle and it seems to be doing a good job.  It is still too early to tell  completely since I have only used  it three times. Each time it has helped to remove some of the puffiness.  The price for this item is very good and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this product, altho I am not sure it does all it clams to.  The product came with a defective pump, but I had an old one so I replaced it; but the cream was so thick would not  go in the pump, so not sure what that was all about.  They offered to replace, but never came.  In  corresponding with them, said they would check into it, but never heard back.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 5 months ago and it works better than any other similar product.  I had to search online for it because I couldn&#x27;t find it again in any stores and Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> It really work for me. I have puffy and dark circle eyes and this cream disappeares the problem 70%. I recomend it so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for over a year now and am just hitting the bottom of the first bottle.  You only need a small amount.  It really seems to help with puffy eyes and you can&#x27;t beat the price from amazon.  I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it.</li>
            <li> works great, same item but so much cheaper if ordered from the US, they charge $60.00 each bottle in Canada.</li>
            <li> I tried it and the pump did not work plus the cream did not have green tea in it as it should .  Used it before and had great results this was my third bottle and this one was not the same. Tried to return it but they do not do returns.</li>
            <li> The plunger does not work well.  The solution is probably too thick for this device.  So far I have not noticed any improvement with the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
