            <li> I really enjoy the Chamomile Roman Essential Oil. I use it daily mixed with Lavender and Jojoba oils. I use it topically on my neck, lower back, and feet in the mornings and sometimes in the evening before bed. It relaxes body before playing tennis and tends to keep my anxieties at bay.</li>

            <li> Very nice oil. Love the smell of chamomille, its calming and healing.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Like the neroli thus scent smells different than I imagined and can overpower other scents. But again, certain skin care recipes call for it. Smells like dirt or must to me- very earthy.</li>
            <li> I love PT&#x27;s products but I didn&#x27;t get this one. I&#x27;ve used this same botanical species from different suppliers with amazing results in relaxing blends and body lotions. Although the scent of this one is nice, I didn&#x27;t get the same results.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Roman Chamomile from plant Life, after doTerra&#x27;s price went up not twice, but four times. I have been using it for various remedies and has proven efficient. It has healed wounds, scrapes and bruises, and most importantly, in a diluted mix with lavender has completely healed my dog&#x27;s dermatitis and hot spots. I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This is now my third order of this oil from this company. I see some refer to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; scent - this has a pure herbal scent of chamomile flower. It is heaven sent. I have been purchasing, diluting it and sending it to my mother, who uses it for her pet&#x27;s minor abrasions as well. Do not think lower price means less quality - this is not the case. Works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Packaged good and arrived on time good product.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is my favorite supplier for essential oils. My research told me they are a good company, and their products and prices are great!</li>

It provides soothing and cleansing benefits useful for burns, acne, blisters, inflamed wounds, dermatitis, eczema, rashes and wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chamomile Roman has long been used in herbal medicines by aromatherpists and physicians. The flowers are used in herbal teas to promote relaxation and treat insomnia. The essential oil is useful in the treatment of aches and pains in muscles and joints. Treatment of symptoms of PMS with Chamomile is also beneficial especially when the symptoms are related to stress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Botanical Name: Chamaemelum nobile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Origin: United Kingdom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extraction Method: Steam Distilled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Part: Flowers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength of Aroma: Strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatic Scent: Chamomile Roman has a sweet, green, herbaceous apple scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blends well with:  Bergamot, Chamomile German, Clary Sage, Geranium, Jasmine, Lavender, Lemon, Neroli, Patchouli, Tea Tree and Ylang Ylang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Uses: Chamomile Roman essential oil is greatly known to help with insomnia. It also can be used to ease aches and pains in muscles and joints. It is a relaxing oil and is great to help with stress. Diffuse Chamomile Roman essential oil into the air to help with stress, migraines and depression. Add 1-3 drops each of Chamomile Roman and Chamomile German and 1 drop of Peppermint into a bath or favorite carrier oil to assist muscle aches or arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cautions: None known.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read their GC/MS report here on this website&lt;br /&gt;http://www.planttherapy.com/index.php?main_page&#x3D;product_info&amp;amp;cPath&#x3D;220&amp;amp;products_id&#x3D;896#.VLbc-ivF9yQ&lt;br /&gt;I use a dilution calculator i found here&lt;br /&gt;http://www.aromaindex.com/dilution-calculator/</li>

It works wonderfully! :)  I enjoy the smell of Roman Chamomile as well; very sweet but not overpowering.  I believe Plant Therapy Essential Oils are of good quality at a great price.</li>

            <li> Exactly as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great scent. I add it to my shampoo because I have a very sensitive scalp that is prone to itchy dandruff. This works great. Also great for defusing.</li>
            <li> I love plant therapy products!! Will buy again and again!!!</li>
            <li> Better than those MLMs!</li>
