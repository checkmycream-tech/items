            <li>This diffuser is great.  </li>
            <li>She is happy with it also.  </li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; looks like it gets great reviews.</li>
            <li>Great design -</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This diffuser works great.</li>
            <li>Anyways - the company is amazing, and very good to their word.     </li>
            <li>HOWEVER - though the product gets two stars (because the mist output truly is amazing), the company itself gets FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li>The mist-output is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product seems to work good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Love this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser!    </li>
            <li>I use this in the living room and it works amazing.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the ease of use and design.</li>
            <li>(I own four others).</li>
            <li>And I like that it has its own button, for turning it on and off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>So far this has proven to be an excellent value</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and once I read the instructions to find out what the beep meant it is now running in my massage therapy room!</li>
            <li>I use my diffusers continuously, but I like having this as an option, just in case I leave the house - it&#x27;s more suitable than for when I&#x27;m here and want it going all of the time.    </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and produced a nice stream of aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>I love them both.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the Tranquil Synergy.  </li>
            <li>When it does work, I love the sound (like a quiet water stream) and it diffuses great; the intermittent setting is also a great feature.</li>
            <li>Better than all of my diffusers</li>
            <li>I love the automatic shut off feature.</li>
            <li>I understand that water+electricity&#x3D; risky combination, but I would have hoped that I would have gotten more than a year of service from my investment.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of filling and the ease of use.  </li>
            <li>It had a great amount of mist, loved the 30 sec.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 diffusers and this one last a full 8 hours and produces a wonderful stream of scented air!</li>
            <li>But surprise, a full sized bottle of Germ Fighter oil blend by Plant Therapy was included in my order!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to push a button to turn it off if I don&#x27;t want to leave it on.  </li>
            <li>It was the greatest thing ever for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li>on/off timer, easy to fill and clean, light can be turned on/off, and auto shut off.  </li>
            <li>I can turn the night light off, it bothers me when I am trying to go to sleep, and that I can change the continuous setting to intermediate flow.  </li>
            <li>I liked this diffuser so much I purchased one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>But on the replacement, the light button did not work at all - I couldn&#x27;t turn the light off.</li>
            <li>It looks like it&#x27;ll be easy to clean -</li>
            <li>Took some time for delivery..but otherwise quick to assemble and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Great diffuser, fills the whole house with the scent, and I live in a 2 story home.  </li>
            <li>I clean it every time I refill it</li>
            <li>I am a super light sleeper &amp; this does not bother me at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light option is simple and not too bright.</li>
            <li>This diffuser has a really unique shape, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li>I like that it came with a free bottle of Germ Fighter essential oil and the shape, where the mist comes out of the top spire - much better - it doesn&#x27;t spit on furniture at all this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have to give full credit to Plant Therapy who agreed to replace it on return of the defective unit.</li>
            <li>I am rewriting my review of this product based upon the owner&#x27;s quick reply in mailing me another unit because the one I bought went out.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet, nice light, and diffuses the oils quite well.  </li>
            <li>I since have purchased Essential Oils from Plant Therapy and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked to return them, because it would be nice to have them fixed, but they currently don&#x27;t have anyone to do repairs.   </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a problem for me - I just leave it on full time mode, but have to add water and oil more frequently.</li>
            <li>I think it should work for at least 2 years to justify it being rated very good.</li>
            <li>it was easy to clean and use, but be careful you do not fill water to the top, this can cause damage.  </li>
            <li>Have gifted one and recommended it to my chiropractors&#x27;s office, since their old one died.  </li>
            <li>the pieces all fit well together and the plastics seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li>They are VERY helpful and they refunded me the full cost of the product - and did not request a return of the product.</li>
            <li>: It puts out a consistent VISIBLE vapor, but nothing that soaks your table or anything around it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t love something that doesn&#x27;t work as properly.   </li>
            <li>I purchased this diffuser almost exactly a year ago.</li>
            <li>However, I am Very disatisfied in the life of the fan.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Plus, I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.</li>
            <li>I purchased a more expensive ultrasonic cool mist diffuser through another website because it was recommended for use with the essential oils that I use and because it was recommended that diffusers with timers were better.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s better than nothing, takes up little space, and humidifies the area around it.  </li>
            <li>But, they&#x27;re doing right by sending me a different one.</li>
            <li>: It makes an ever so slight muffled water sound.</li>
            <li>My daughter will inherit the replacement for her daughters room which is small enough for this unit to be effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised.</li>
            <li>Not only can you SMELL how well it works, but you can SEE the mist very well.    </li>
            <li>We opened the unit and cleaned the connections with a soft brush too.</li>
            <li>The instruction manual is written better than the other manuals for my other diffusers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size - not too big (if the run-time is too long, you lose the scent of the oils before the water runs out, so it&#x27;s a waste) and not too small</li>
            <li>only problem I have is the &amp;#34;intermittent&amp;#34; setting, where the button on the left is supposed to change mode and light should change to green color - mine doesn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fine for a small room (except mine broke after a few weeks) but really doesn&#x27;t kick out enough essential oil to fill a modest size room.</li>
            <li>It is so disappointing, because I really want to love this product.</li>
            <li>I have had one of these for nearly 2 years now and finally got around to ordering a second one.</li>
            <li>I ran it straight for 8 hours overnight &amp; it used only half the water.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that much mist escapes into the room, considering that it uses only a cup of water.  </li>
            <li> Now it is useless and only makes a beeping sound when I try to turn it on.</li>
            <li> It also stays on a really long time and then turns off when the water runs out.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to my other friends who use essential oils.</li>
            <li> And it turned off automatically after diffusing only half of the water/oil.   </li>
            <li> It is a little big compared to a lot of diffusers on the market.  </li>
            <li> That only helped a little.</li>
            <li> I do like that it can be on a 30 sec.</li>
            <li> I only used plant therapy oils and purified/distilled water and never filled it up to the &amp;#34;fill line&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> About the height of a ruler &amp; base is about the size of a tea plate, so fits nicely on my nightstand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOISE</li>
            <li> But I wanted additional diffusers for other rooms in the house and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money again.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for the money it is not a good purchase if it doesn&#x27;t function properly within the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I had this unit for about a month and a half</li>
            <li> It stopped working in less than a year.</li>
            <li> And it had automatically turned off, with half of the water still remaining inside.</li>
            <li> I decided to test how well this baby works by using a very thick essential oil - vetiver.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and looking to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it has completely died.</li>
            <li> It started getting &amp;#34;fritzy&amp;#34; a few months ago</li>
            <li> I have bought three diffusers (see my other reviews) and of the three this is my least favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was considering buying a much more expensive diffuser, but it had bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Also, the unit seems to be hot at the base.</li>
            <li> no lights anywhere unless you turn the soft lit base to on.</li>
            <li> It runs for approximately 14 hours on the intermittent setting.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that I received TWO products that don&#x27;t function properly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it quit working after 9 months.  </li>
            <li> So, unfortunately, the replacement I received did not work.</li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> So, after a couple hours of running it in continuous mode, I found water all around the base of the diffuser, on my table.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and customer service.  I have had one of these for nearly 2 years now and finally got around to ordering a second one.</li>
            <li> This diffuser starts sending up steam immediately, is silent, and lasts about 4 hours before running out of water and shutting itself off.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that much mist escapes into the room, considering that it uses only a cup of water.  But it&#x27;s better than nothing, takes up little space, and humidifies the area around it.  I don&#x27;t like the aroma of the essential oils so don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Short life expectancy! Mine and my sisters stopped working after only about 6 months of use. I give this product two stars only because it worked well for the time that it actually worked. However, I am Very disatisfied in the life of the fan. The fan stopped working only 6 months into using it. Now it is useless and only makes a beeping sound when I try to turn it on.</li>
            <li> Took some time for delivery..but otherwise quick to assemble and easy to use.  Love this diffuser!  Use it everyday and looking to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work good. It is easy to use and once I read the instructions to find out what the beep meant it is now running in my massage therapy room!</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser to replace one that was not working.  This diffuser is great.  I have used it every night since I received it.  I  like that I can turn the night light off, it bothers me when I am trying to go to sleep, and that I can change the continuous setting to intermediate flow.  I liked this diffuser so much I purchased one for my daughter.  She is happy with it also.  This purchase arrived ahead of schedule, both times.  I since have purchased Essential Oils from Plant Therapy and am very pleased.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I am rewriting my review of this product based upon the owner&#x27;s quick reply in mailing me another unit because the one I bought went out.  I had this unit for about a month and a half and it worked as described.  you could smell the oils and it lasted throughout the night as we slept.  it was easy to clean and use, but be careful you do not fill water to the top, this can cause damage.  I already knew that beforehand and don&#x27;t know why my unit stopped working, but I am in the process of mailing this one back and the owners have agreed to replace it with no problems.  linda</li>
            <li> Purchased two Pureness Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers as gifts. Both people are very happy with product. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Diffuses the scent all through the bottom floor of my house, which is about 800 square feet. I clean it every time I refill it and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li> SIZE: Sleek. About the height of a ruler &amp; base is about the size of a tea plate, so fits nicely on my nightstand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOISE: It makes an ever so slight muffled water sound. That&#x27;s it though- no machine noise at all &amp; no lights anywhere unless you turn the soft lit base to on. I am a super light sleeper &amp; this does not bother me at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUTPUT: It puts out a consistent VISIBLE vapor, but nothing that soaks your table or anything around it. I&#x27;m actually surprised. I ran it straight for 8 hours overnight &amp; it used only half the water. The reservoir holds about 1 cup of water. Directions say 2-3 drops of oil per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SURPRISE: I didn&#x27;t actually think the oil sample in the picture was included bc it wasn&#x27;t in the product description. But surprise, a full sized bottle of Germ Fighter oil blend by Plant Therapy was included in my order! Smells great &amp; looks like it gets great reviews.</li>
            <li> A friend recently got into essential oils, and I thought I would give them a shot.  I couldn&#x27;t decide on a diffuser, but after tons of research I went with this one and another one.  I love them both.  I use this in the living room and it works amazing.  I have been buying the Plant Therapy oils to go with this....LOVE the Tranquil Synergy.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser.  Very quiet, nice light, and diffuses the oils quite well.  It is a little big compared to a lot of diffusers on the market.  I do like that it can be on a 30 sec. on/off mode.</li>
            <li> I really liked the ease of use and design. It was the greatest thing ever for about a week and a half. Then it stopped working properly. It either would not diffuse or it would leak everywhere. Also, the unit seems to be hot at the base. It still works, but sporadically and I worry it is going to short out when it leaks. I only used plant therapy oils and purified/distilled water and never filled it up to the &amp;#34;fill line&amp;#34;. When it does work, I love the sound (like a quiet water stream) and it diffuses great; the intermittent setting is also a great feature. Unfortunately, for the money it is not a good purchase if it doesn&#x27;t function properly within the first two weeks of use. Very sad.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser while it was working!  It had a great amount of mist, loved the 30 sec. on/off timer, easy to fill and clean, light can be turned on/off, and auto shut off.  Unfortunately, it quit working after 9 months.  It just wouldn&#x27;t turn on yesterday.  For the price, I think it should last longer than 9 months.</li>
            <li> It stopped working in less than a year. Bought it Dec 2013 and stopped working Oct 2014. I think it should work for at least 2 years to justify it being rated very good.</li>
            <li> This diffuser has a really unique shape, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  I appreciate that you can turn the &amp;#34;night light&amp;#34; off, and there is also a button you can push so it will run, stop, and run again on a cycle (instead of being continuous).  The Germ Fighter blend smells great and works fantastically, so it&#x27;s a great bonus to this purchase!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  So, unfortunately, the replacement I received did not work. It is so disappointing, because I really want to love this product. I can&#x27;t love something that doesn&#x27;t work as properly.   The mist output is awesome - when it works. But on the replacement, the light button did not work at all - I couldn&#x27;t turn the light off. And it turned off automatically after diffusing only half of the water/oil.   Very disappointed that I received TWO products that don&#x27;t function properly. And I won&#x27;t be trying for a third. Just don&#x27;t trust the product at this point.  HOWEVER - though the product gets two stars (because the mist output truly is amazing), the company itself gets FIVE STARS! They are VERY helpful and they refunded me the full cost of the product - and did not request a return of the product. I would have liked to return them, because it would be nice to have them fixed, but they currently don&#x27;t have anyone to do repairs.   Anyways - the company is amazing, and very good to their word.     ------------------------      UPDATE:  So, after a couple hours of running it in continuous mode, I found water all around the base of the diffuser, on my table. And it had automatically turned off, with half of the water still remaining inside. Something malfunctioned I&#x27;m guessing. And being that this is the same day that I received the product, I decided to contact Plant Therapy.  Customer service was excellent. They&#x27;re sending me a replacement. I&#x27;m hoping this next one doesn&#x27;t malfunction like this one did. It&#x27;s such a shame. But, they&#x27;re doing right by sending me a different one. Looking forward to using it!!    ------------------------    I love this diffuser!    It&#x27;s a great size - not too big (if the run-time is too long, you lose the scent of the oils before the water runs out, so it&#x27;s a waste) and not too small (my smaller diffusers only run for 3-4 hours and this one runs for 6 hours).    Great design - the pieces all fit well together and the plastics seem to be high quality. I like the way it&#x27;s shaped and how it looks in my room.    I decided to test how well this baby works by using a very thick essential oil - vetiver. It&#x27;s the thickest oil I&#x27;ve ever used. I wanted to see how the mist-output was. And it exceeded my expectations! The mist-output is amazing! Better than all of my diffusers (I own four others). Not only can you SMELL how well it works, but you can SEE the mist very well.    It&#x27;s very easy to use. It looks like it&#x27;ll be easy to clean - though I haven&#x27;t had to yet.    The instruction manual is written better than the other manuals for my other diffusers. Descriptive and yet simple - to the point.    The light option is simple and not too bright. And I like that it has its own button, for turning it on and off. I also like that it has two options for misting - continuously and 30secs on / 30secs off. I use my diffusers continuously, but I like having this as an option, just in case I leave the house - it&#x27;s more suitable than for when I&#x27;m here and want it going all of the time.    Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was considering buying a much more expensive diffuser, but it had bad reviews. Plus, I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money. This diffuser works great. It uses only one or two drops of essential oil and dispurses it throughout the room. It also stays on a really long time and then turns off when the water runs out. I have recommended this to my other friends who use essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this diffuser.  It works beautifully - I like that it came with a free bottle of Germ Fighter essential oil and the shape, where the mist comes out of the top spire - much better - it doesn&#x27;t spit on furniture at all this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is the &amp;#34;intermittent&amp;#34; setting, where the button on the left is supposed to change mode and light should change to green color - mine doesn&#x27;t do anything.  It isn&#x27;t a problem for me - I just leave it on full time mode, but have to add water and oil more frequently.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully! I love the automatic shut off feature.</li>
            <li> I have bought three diffusers (see my other reviews) and of the three this is my least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fine for a small room (except mine broke after a few weeks) but really doesn&#x27;t kick out enough essential oil to fill a modest size room. I have to give full credit to Plant Therapy who agreed to replace it on return of the defective unit. My daughter will inherit the replacement for her daughters room which is small enough for this unit to be effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser almost exactly a year ago. I loved it! It was easy to use and produced a nice stream of aromatherapy. Sadly, it has completely died. It started getting &amp;#34;fritzy&amp;#34; a few months ago and I&#x27;d have to fiddle with the cord and buttons to get it started. For example, toward the end, I would have to hold the start button and then plug the unit into the wall; a jump start of sorts. We opened the unit and cleaned the connections with a soft brush too. That only helped a little. Now, nothing I do can make it start. I understand that water+electricity&#x3D; risky combination, but I would have hoped that I would have gotten more than a year of service from my investment.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser, fills the whole house with the scent, and I live in a 2 story home.  Have gifted one and recommended it to my chiropractors&#x27;s office, since their old one died.  They immediately bought it and use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 diffusers and this one last a full 8 hours and produces a wonderful stream of scented air!</li>
            <li> I purchased a more expensive ultrasonic cool mist diffuser through another website because it was recommended for use with the essential oils that I use and because it was recommended that diffusers with timers were better.  But I wanted additional diffusers for other rooms in the house and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money again.  In my search, I found this one and decided to take a chance.  I have used it daily since I received it a couple of weeks ago and have already recommended it to several friends.  I love the ease of filling and the ease of use.  The lack of timer is not an issue.  I like the freedom of knowing it will turn itself off when the water runs out and I can leave it on all day if desired.  It runs for approximately 14 hours on the intermittent setting.  And it&#x27;s easy to push a button to turn it off if I don&#x27;t want to leave it on.  So far this has proven to be an excellent value and I will very likely purchase another.</li>
