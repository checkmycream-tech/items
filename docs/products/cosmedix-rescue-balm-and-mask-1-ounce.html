            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>CosMedix Rescue works well to calm irritated skin, hydrate dry skin and reduce redness after extractions, waxing or chemical peels.</li>

            <li> Your skin is wet all day long.</li>
            <li> When I use it during the day I put skinceuticals physical fusion SPF 50 over it and that tones down the greasy appearance.</li>
            <li> I leave it on as a balm hydrator immediately following a chemical peel for 48 hours post treat and then spot treat in dry areas the remaining few days I am healing.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m careful what I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> have used the product in the past on a facial scar, and I knew that it would work well.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>

            <li> This is a heavy duty moisturizing mask.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be used after you have some type of harsh chemical peel, laser..</li>
            <li> and this is the only remedy for the two times I got a bad facial.  </li>

            <li> I am satisfied with this product. Your skin is wet all day long.</li>
            <li> Great to leave on during winter</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have very sensitive skin and this is the only remedy for the two times I got a bad facial.  After the facial my skin turned so dry and red it looked like I had a bad sunburn.  I lather this cream on before bed and in 2 days my skin looked amazing.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend of a friend. It is the best beauty cream I&#x27;ve purchased and affordable! It is thick, smells delicious and doesn&#x27;t keep my skin greasy. It really has made a difference. I&#x27;m 39, suffer from adult acne so I&#x27;m careful what I use on my skin. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in the last month and my skin is soft and moisturized. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product after a laser treatment for severe scarring. I fell in love with it then! It is intensely moisturizing, and truly accelerates healing. It smells amazing, almost a light creamy, citrus smell. It does feel very heavy going on and a little bit goes a long way. But, it has a variety of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful to use post laser or chemical peel treatments. It is soothing, healing, and of course very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to do light peels, adding an aha peel like lactic acid to is and applying to my face. Then following the directions of the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also often use it for just an intense moisturizing treatment when I feel my skin needs hydration, or during the drying winter months. Or if I&#x27;ve had to use anything to treat a random breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product, I feel with it&#x27;s variety of uses, and high quality - it should be a&lt;br /&gt;In every woman&#x27;s arsenal of skin care.</li>
            <li> CosMedix Rescue works well to calm irritated skin, hydrate dry skin and reduce redness after extractions, waxing or chemical peels.</li>
            <li> worked great on super dry and chapped lips. It&#x27;s too heavy for daily use, but it&#x27;s not a daily moisturizer anyways.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have a tendancy towards dry skin. I put this on as a moisturizer everyday. My skin looks radiant and flawless.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want the DEWEY look.... than this product is not for you. My medical esthetician recommended it as  evening care. I apply for both day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to look hydrated. this is the product for me.</li>
            <li> I have rarely ever written reviews for stuff I buy on Amazon, but I just HAD to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in NYC and winters can be quite punishing on the skin. I was working in Los Angeles a year ago (I work on camera and I LOVE the dewy look it gives me!), and forgot to pack my VERY EXPENSIVE face moisturizer. A girlfriend gave me what was left of her jar of Cosmedix rescue balm and my whole routine has now changed!!! It is VERY thick, as other reviews state, but it is FANTASTIC. I have turned so many girlfriends onto it now, I wear it all year round, morning, bedtime, ALWAYS. Sometimes last summer I would wear it when I woke up and washed my face and leave it on as long as I could and then I just lightly blotted it before I put on my makeup. It is so moisturizing and oatmeal-y and hydrating. BIG THUMBS UP!!!</li>
            <li> Great, great product.  Have been using for a few years.  Love the way it makes my skin look and feel after one treatment.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every night and love the smell and the overall feel that it gives my skin. It is a staple in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to like this product, but it&#x27;s becoming one of those products that just sitting there &amp; collecting dusk. I total hate it. It&#x27;s greasy feeling after applying &amp; even after wash! I don&#x27;t know why the other reviewers give a good review, must be related to the product owner. I don&#x27;t like the smell. I don&#x27;t like the feel. I like NOTING about this product! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! If I can, I would give no star for this product!</li>
            <li> OMG!!!!! This is Amazing...my skin loves this balm.</li>
            <li> Soothes the skin &amp; smells great!</li>
            <li> Very nice balm. After I cleanse my face in morning, I put on balm and get into shower. The steam helps to moisturize  even more. I then rub off excess. Great for winter or anytime you need extra smoothness on face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is heavy, but great post peel or for occasional use if you use retinoids that dry the surface of your skin. It smells of cherries, that is nice. I have maturing, breakout prone skin, and I can use this without any problems.</li>
            <li> It is an SOS mask ! Love it !</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product, it is just the best thing to have in the winter for dry skin and I use it in the summer also at night after I wash my face, the climate is hot and dry here, I put it on an hour before bed time and the results are great my face does not feel dryed out and it helps keep fine lines moisturized and more plumped on my face. I use it over other products and get good results. It is just a great balm to have when ever you need a little more moisture and it does not break out my face. When I use a retinol product I put a small amount of the balm under my eyes to keep them from peeling. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel better and helps flare ups calm down faster. It is thick and shiny and I mostly use it at night but will use a small amount on bad days too. When I use it during the day I put skinceuticals physical fusion SPF 50 over it and that tones down the greasy appearance. Most importantly it feels good when nothing else does.</li>
            <li> Love to have it soak into my skin all night long , leaving a smooth feeling when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Product will quickly heal the most severely sensitized and post treatment skin. I leave it on as a balm hydrator immediately following a chemical peel for 48 hours post treat and then spot treat in dry areas the remaining few days I am healing. It has a numbing agent as well which is dynamite!</li>
            <li> I use this after a chemical peel and my son uses it because his face is dry from certain medicines and topicals for acne.&lt;br /&gt;He swears by it. So do I.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty moisturizing mask. I use it at night time. It is heavy and a little sticky. But if your skin is thirsty you will love it. Apply at night and wake up with refreshed soft skin. I never had dry skin until I turned 30 and now I can&#x27;t moisturize enough. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be used after you have some type of harsh chemical peel, laser..etc... I use it as a moisturizing mask or as a lip balm...can only use at night as if you wear makeup .. makeup will look greasy...overall great product and love the Cosmedix line in general.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at night for several years and I love it! It is a must for dry irritated skin and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever used for the elimination of a scar from surgery.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel good, it smells like cherries and in six weeks, my scar from shoulder joint replacement surgery is significantly improved.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product in the past on a facial scar, and I knew that it would work well.&lt;br /&gt;If was shipped timely and the price was a great value.</li>
            <li> Came with a cracked lid and leaked some but otherwise I love this masque</li>
            <li> I do not usually write review unless I really LOVE a product, I have only used this for two days and I have already seen my acne clearing and my skin is moist and supple.  If this product continues to live up to my claims it will be a staple in my daily skin routine and I will never be with out it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by esthetician for dry skin and I love it. Been using it for 2 yrs now. I use it at night ..once or twice a week and its great.</li>
