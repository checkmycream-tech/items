            <li>I get my best shave with these!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like DE shaving, and 2) if I decided that continuing with DE shaving would be in my best interest</li>
            <li>/&gt;You should still try  a sampler pack to figure out what works best for you, and if Feather blades are to your liking, go for it.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly impressed with these blades.</li>
            <li>DE blades are awesome if you want a close shave.  </li>
            <li>In my Merkur 38C razor, this blade is the perfect choice.  </li>
            <li>It gives me the best shave of any of the 20-some blades</li>
            <li>I disagree with them being the best ever though.</li>
            <li>These are the best blades on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These razor blades are the best shave I&#x27;ve had with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, and</li>
            <li>Best shave you will ever ever ever have.</li>
            <li>The blades themselves give me an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>Awesome blades.  </li>
            <li>But these are perfect every time.</li>
            <li>Best Razors EVER!</li>
            <li>some of the best blades around.  </li>
            <li>Feather  De Razors are some of the best.</li>
            <li>These Blades are the best.</li>
            <li>These are the best blades I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started DE shaving with a sampler pack of razors, which the Feathers were not apart of, and found Derby&#x27;s to be the best of the that bunch.</li>
            <li>Great blades!</li>
            <li>If you have never tried Feather blades, you are in for a very pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>And that is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Still a very good value.</li>
            <li>If you already use a D/E razor and are looking for a great blade, I think Feather makes the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>They are very good and for the price for quantity I received I think that is a great value.</li>
            <li>But when the blade is good, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great product, but not up to all the hype.  </li>
            <li>That being said, they produce a great shave and I am always happy buying them in bulk.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the $2-3 blades from the monopoly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am quite happy with these blades.</li>
            <li>Great experience</li>
            <li>As there is a blade on both sides, the longevity is great.  </li>
            <li>These blades are great.  </li>
            <li>But these blades are great.</li>
            <li>and I get a great shave.</li>
            <li>Supplier was great exceeded my expectations and will buy from them again...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if I have not shaved for a week or a day, these do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Work great, close shave.</li>
            <li>a great value also.  </li>
            <li>Been using this brand for years great product.</li>
            <li>Great blades</li>
            <li>Great results with my Merkur Vision.</li>
            <li>These blades are great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great choice when it comes to blades.</li>
            <li>These blades works great.</li>
            <li>A great deal ....</li>
            <li>The  product is great.</li>
            <li>However, when you take the time tho, Feathers give a GREAT shave.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s joy in the road to finding this stuff out, but I&#x27;d like to save you time</li>
            <li>I had ordered (both great products).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>great shave</li>
            <li>I am astounded at what a great shave</li>
            <li>A great value, too.</li>
            <li>I found a great deal on the Derby&#x27;s and have been using those ever since.  </li>
            <li>I learned exactly how to use the safety razor I bought and what was the best procedure for me to shave, the blades are actually very impressive.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, not the best.</li>
            <li>great thing about these blades in a good Safety Razor is the feedback you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li>Truefitt &amp; Hill make excellent shave creams, much better than Art of Shaving in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and you are rewarded with smooth, flawless skin.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on-line and made my purchase based on the good feedback about Feather.</li>
            <li>But now I spend a FRACTION of that, and I get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Astra Superior Premium Platinum</li>
            <li>We have tried others, but always return to Feather blades for their superior quality.</li>
            <li>Anyway it is a good blade</li>
            <li>so I will give it a good rating.</li>
            <li>, they are good blades.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>So good it even effects they grip on my razor making it slippery)  </li>
            <li>Platinum coated, good to go.</li>
            <li>I suggest just even a good rinse and pat</li>
            <li>Feather did a good job marketing, but nothing</li>
            <li>am using Astra Platinum and loved them.</li>
            <li>These blades are absolutely superior in every way.</li>
            <li>Good price, too.</li>
            <li>best, sharpest DE razor blades available.</li>
            <li>The good thing about their sharpness is that they won&#x27;t lag when moving across your face.</li>
            <li>Combine these with a good brush and either soap or cream.  </li>
            <li>As good as it gets.</li>
            <li>and I got a fairly good shave from them.</li>
            <li>I thought the Astra&#x27;s were good blades.</li>
            <li>Wilkinson Sword blades are good for 1 -2 shaves.</li>
            <li>really great shaves out of each blade, and can stretch it for 1 or 2 more after that which are still acceptable, but not quite as good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with these blades and will continue to buy them for my safety razor.</li>
            <li>Feathers seem to be sharper than most blades on the market and work great for me.</li>
            <li>Let me say from the start that I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>However, these Feather Blades are considerably better!.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll wonder why they don&#x27;t cost more!</li>
            <li>The packaging helps keep you safe!  </li>
            <li>Just be respectful, and buy sceptic gel for your shave kit as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sample packs and many types but the Feather is the best it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>After buying a large combo pack of blades I used each blade for 2 shaves and decided that these Feather blades gave the best shave of all.  </li>
            <li>Feather&#x27;s blades are absolutely amazing, and at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>Amazing what a quality blade will do.  </li>
            <li>After shaving one time with the Feather Blades these are absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>These things are amazing.  </li>
            <li>your technique is to use pressure and &#x27;help&#x27; the blade do its work, you&#x27;ll upset the blade and it will let you know it.&lt;br /&gt;However - if you just let the blade glide and do its work for you, the blade will be happy and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a fantastic shave that takes almost no effort.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Great shave and a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>I just saw a pack of 8 fusion cartridges at a popular discount retail chain for about $28.  </li>
            <li>I think that speaks for itself, I have never had any blade that was good for more than a week, and pushing it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have gotten good shaves with most of them</li>
            <li>Use a quality cream, and preferably after a nice warm shower.</li>
            <li>He said it worked nicely.</li>
            <li>the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li>If I do use them &amp;#34;properly&amp;#34; with excellent shaving cream(s), I will admit that it is much easier.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality for a very competitive price.</li>
            <li>but I need to warm up my face or these blades</li>
            <li>Once I get lathered up with warm water and the soap</li>
            <li>, even though this is the sharpest blade I&#x27;ve ever own, i don get any bumps or cuts.</li>
            <li>Arrived nicely.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, received in a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li>Writing a review for razor blades is kind of like reviewing a movie.</li>
            <li>(2) Create the warm lather in a bowl using a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>I have switched over to DE shaving after catching the \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; bug.  </li>
            <li>the first shave was brilliant.  </li>
            <li>, these last shaves with the FEATHER blades have been a real honest treat and joy.  </li>
            <li>These blades are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Feathers are by far the best blades you can get.</li>
            <li>I replaced my blade a bit more often than I would have liked, but I kept telling myself it was because I was using entry level</li>
            <li>Got a safety razor with Shark blades - they were ok but these rock with a really nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Best blade I have found so far.</li>
            <li>The feather is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I started with merkur, then switched to these ones for a smooth shaving, i recommend them, cheap and great quality</li>
            <li>Great Price, great product got it next day.</li>
            <li>Well my first time shaving was with no issues, and I have nothing but great things to say about it.</li>
            <li>Sharpest blades out there and consistently give me a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Both brands are excellent (way better than the drugstore blades I started on) but from all the stories and stellar reviews I was expecting an extraordinary difference between the Feather and Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a very comfortable and close shave, with no nicks or cuts whats</li>
            <li>The shave was very smooth, no nicks...</li>
            <li>It goes very smooth over my skin</li>
            <li>These razor blades are among the sharpest made and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I ordered came with 5 Shark Super Chrome blades that I actually loved.</li>
            <li>I received these blades in good time and in good condition, all were sealed and new.</li>
            <li>Those were ok, but these are worlds better.</li>
            <li>The Feathers are nice and extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>Get a weishi- older Gillette super speed or aristocrat, and these blades are the best there can be.  </li>
            <li>Simply stated, these are the best blades I have used for a DE razor.</li>
            <li>Of course everyone&#x27;s best blade may be different</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the best shave possible, this may be the blade for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the quality of the shave is perhaps marginally better than the Merkurs I was using before these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Ninja assassin sharp&amp;#34;, maybe, but most high-quality blades are.</li>
            <li>Feather blades are the best for me and my double edge.</li>
            <li>Others may have better outcomes.  </li>
            <li>IMO it shaves more aggressively than the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll never order another blade, even if they are more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never need another razor:).</li>
            <li>I love these blades.  </li>
            <li>there were many of them and</li>
            <li>This last one I have tried is the best I have found- Cremo Creme.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Both are leagues better.</li>
            <li>Thicker blades are more blunt, but can withstand more use before needing sharpening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  think they just have better marketing.  </li>
            <li>I like them better than the Merkur blades that I used for a while with my Merkur razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I hear shaving with DE safety razors are better for the skin.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll find out after it stops bleeding :)</li>
            <li>and I have yet to find a better razor blade</li>
            <li>In combination with Proraso cream this is the best double edge shave you can get.  </li>
            <li>The shave is nice, close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I love feather blades.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my coarse, wire-like face hairs.</li>
            <li>I have the following brands for many years:&lt;br /&gt;Gillette, wilkinson, Merkur, and many others but these three I consider to be the best until I discover the  Feather brand and believed to be just a tad better but don&#x27;t forget that sometimes you might get a badge that might of been finished 5 minutes before quitting time on a Friday afternoon</li>
            <li>Allow more time for delivery since they&#x27;re shipped from Asia.</li>
            <li>After buying a sample pack that included seven different blades, I found the Feather blades to be the best.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s safe to switch to these.</li>
            <li>and I love the shave I get from these blades</li>
            <li>These have made my DE shaving experience much better.  </li>
            <li>my canvas of handsome as I like to call my face).</li>
            <li>I took longer to shave to make sure I mastered it.</li>
            <li>I was getting better results with the Astras in that realm but the Feathers help</li>
            <li>OK with my EJ.</li>
            <li>But they simply don&#x27;t work the best for me, personally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted, it could be technique-related, but I feel as if the blades from Derby seem to work better on my face.  </li>
            <li>I could probably get more uses out of them</li>
            <li>Afterwards I promptly ordered some more Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has told me that these are the best blades so this review is not from personal experience.</li>
            <li>love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, lesson learned.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love these razors.</li>
            <li>My husband loves these razors and I love the value package.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews and hoped that the Feathers would be better, and I took a gamble and bought a pack of 30 blades.</li>
            <li>I have the Edwin Jagger DE razor which is a more milder design</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>But that said, if you use the Feather blade in a more aggressive or adjustable razor, take care with your technique and/or setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, as to longevity:  Just for kicks I decided to see how many shaves</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, as to smoothness:  Better prep also has meant my impression of the Feather&#x27;s smoothness has increased.  </li>
            <li>The Bleues also seem better than the Gillette \\&quot;Sweedes\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The Bleues also seem better than the Gillette \\&quot;Sweedes\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>A nice blade and a smooth cut</li>
            <li>If i do this with care, most days I don&#x27;t even need after shave balm, would like to try Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s skin food tho.</li>
            <li>I will purchase these again since I get more mileage out of them.</li>
            <li>They are better than what came with  the razor, It will be a while before I try something else.</li>
            <li>I love these blades.  </li>
            <li>I never had a problem with those either, I just like the feather ones more.  </li>
            <li>This razor provides me with nice, smooth shaves time after time.</li>
            <li>I have never felt a better cut in my life</li>
            <li>Love the feather blades.</li>
            <li>The Derby blades were ok for just getting started, because they are not the sharpest blades and are forgiving of mistakes.</li>
            <li>I still however felt I would do better with a sharper blade, I had read many reviews of Feather, and from the reviews I could tell that the sharpness of the blades intimidated some shavers, but decided to order them anyway.</li>
            <li>You spend WAY more for the 30 pack than you do for the 100ct.  </li>
            <li>Feather blades are simply the best.</li>
            <li>I love them but they were not my starter blade.  </li>
            <li>just be sure to take your time and not cut yourself.  </li>
            <li>It took more than a month to arrive.  </li>
            <li>So many things coming from china is counterfeit.</li>
            <li>Its a meditative man tradition, the blade is top notch.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better now</li>
            <li>These are sharp..make sure you pay attention...</li>
            <li>All in all, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask.</li>
            <li>Tried all the big brands and feather always gives the best and closest shave.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend Feather and this seller has great prices.</li>
            <li>and these are just a shade better.</li>
            <li>I get more shaves out of the Feather than the Merkur, and they are not so costly.</li>
            <li>Definitely better with the Feather blades</li>
            <li>I may try another brand, still searching for my favorite</li>
            <li>If you are still learning technique DE shaving and have a light beard, hold off!</li>
            <li>The blades are high quality and give a great, close shave.  </li>
            <li>3 shaves and I was ripping my neck up pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I got 5 good shaves with the first one.  </li>
            <li>I believe that I have pretty good shaving technique</li>
            <li>also use bigelow shave cream and baxter of california alcohol free after shave balm, and all of those products have been top notch and create a most enjoyable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best razor - lasts a long time and provides the cleanest shave.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a safety razor for a long time now and have tried a lot of blades, and the Feather blades are still the best that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I can routinely get 3 great shaves out of a Feather, and the 4th shave is at least very good, if not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend these blades to new and experienced shavers alike.</li>
            <li>These blades seem to catch more and don&#x27;t glide as easily over my stubble.  </li>
            <li>My face has never felt smoother and they are easy to shave with on top of it all.</li>
            <li>I use them for a cheap double edge safety and they work great!</li>
            <li>The key to a good shave seems to be to pick a good blade, then stay with it to learn how to use that brand of blade.</li>
            <li>These are much better than the cheap ones in drug store.  </li>
            <li>you are sampling blades to find the one that gives the most comfortable shave, I do believe you need to try these.\\</li>
            <li>Most importantly, they provide a suprbly close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, after using them for a couple of weeks, they are slowly becoming my go-to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These work great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find them to be that much sharper than an Astra but a good deal sharper than a Derby.</li>
            <li>blades hold up really well, get a good shave,.</li>
            <li>Sharp and do their work flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the LORD brand razor because it received glowing reviews from most users.</li>
            <li>I found this to be true!  </li>
            <li>An old barber once told me that most people think a brand new razor will give them the best shave</li>
            <li>the order was sent and recieved very quickly.</li>
            <li>So effortless, but you can so easily slice your face.  </li>
            <li>But the Feathers are the best... worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>Stopped washing my face and presto! clean shave and healthy skin.</li>
            <li>This is easily a years supply.</li>
            <li>But then again, do not be sacred of these blades; they are easy to use once adjusted to DE shaving.</li>
            <li>Use a fairly aggressive razor- say an older Gillette Fatboy on the number 7-9 setting</li>
            <li>Shave preparation is also very important in getting a clean, close comfortable shave</li>
            <li>This is a top of the line blade right here!</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more since they are so cheap and give a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Just great cane on time and the blade is nice and sharp iys</li>
            <li>Hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Hands down, best blades on the market.</li>
            <li>As long as you do shafts, light pressure, the badges are very good.  </li>
            <li>Fine blades.</li>
            <li>They were fine.</li>
            <li>(I do it with the wrapper still on, works fine, just don&#x27;t press on the edges).</li>
            <li>I say this because I started with the Merkur blades that came with my model 180, and they were fine starter blades; being a beginner DE shaver.</li>
            <li>These blades aren&#x27;t too hardcore for the beginner, but a beginner should most certainly take more time and perhaps use a longer prep period to get ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Considering the order originates in Thailand, this is a huge inconvenience.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much, used the product and it works great.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>I started out wetshaving with Feather blades and a cheap, non-adjustable razor, and it almost made me give it up.  </li>

            <li>I lightly pass them through 1/8\\</li>
            <li>After trying a few sampler packs, these Feather blades have stood out as the best blade for me.</li>
            <li>It saves me from having to constantly order and they are priced great.</li>

            <li>It is much more rare that I cut myself with these blades than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great blades that only require the lightest touch.</li>
            <li>I use a Merkur double bladed razor, which with its heft makes a great combination with the Feather  blade.</li>
            <li>I bought a couple of  sampler packs over time (great way to try a bunch of different blades) and then found my way to these.  </li>
            <li>These do cost more..but shave your face smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also hooked three friends onto DE shaving and all four of us have reached the consensus that these blades are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I went to this style once the I saw the price of fusions cost more than they were worth.  </li>
            <li>I started wtih Merkur blades for my razor but the shaveing wasn&#x27;t that comfortable.  </li>
            <li>If you have a light touch</li>

            <li>I cannot say they are better than other blades, but they sure are good blades.</li>

            <li>, They were pretty good, much sharper than the Derby&#x27;s</li>

            <li>I get more use out of one of these blades than I do out of three our four of the mach 3 or higher stuff.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I cant tell to much of a difference, the shave feels the same, albeit good.</li>
            <li>I first switched to safety razors, I wasn&#x27;t convinced that there was a significant difference between blades, but these provide a significantly better shave than the Merkurs I started with.</li>
            <li>the blades are very sharp and do a very good job.</li>
            <li>My very first month of DE shaving was with Feather blades, and my face survived just fine.</li>
            <li>And having them come in little plastic boxes is a great convenience as your used blade slides into a slot and are safely stored in the box.</li>
            <li>Recommend for experienced shavers as these are ultra sharp and will cut you easily.</li>
            <li>If I am taking the time to whip up a great lather with a nice badger brush and do all the prep stuff required, why ruin the experience with a dull blade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.</li>
            <li>people say this blade, while extremely sharp, is not as smooth as some others and doesn&#x27;t provide as many good shaves as it might.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cheap.  </li>
            <li>Utilizing almost zero pressure with the EJ and letting the weight do the work, the Feathers cleanly slice the whiskers....</li>
            <li>If you want to be clean as a whistle, whether your face, head or both, then buy these blades.  </li>
            <li>The quality is clearly there, the price is great, and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I then switched to Feather based upon many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man</li>
            <li>Very close shave and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>have tried most of the other major brands and find that these lades work the best for my face and razor.</li>
            <li>Even though the slant bar is a very aggressive razor, the blade and handle seemed to be matched to each other perfectly.  </li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t use the blade too many times I get a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li>My original order was lost, and after I contacted them, they quickly sent out replacement blades.</li>
            <li>My face feels great, minimal to no burn</li>
            <li>I switched to my Gillette Red Tip which seemed to be more suitable for this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very aggressive at all, even with these Feather blades, but give a great shave.</li>
            <li>Just joking, these work great, you just have to be slower and careful with them.</li>
            <li>However, I stocked up on Feathers because they&#x27;re the best for shaving thick scruffy 2+ day growth.</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s cheaper than using the cartridges that only give me about 3 good shaves.  </li>
            <li>The Feather brand also includes a razor bank (place to put used ones) which is cool cause some of the cheaper brands do not provide this, making me wonder what they&#x27;d expect us to do with a used razor.</li>
            <li>I love these blades, thanks again</li>
            <li>also love not spending tons of $ on blades from Shick with 17 blades that don&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I just couldnt&#x27; get the hang of using a safety razor, but the big difference is using really good  blades.  </li>
            <li>trains good technique, low pressure use, etc.</li>
            <li>Still much cheaper than cartridge shaving, and once you get the hang of it, much better of a shave.</li>
            <li>Close, clean, quick, and bump-free.</li>
            <li>shave is only as good as your prep.</li>
            <li>I was ignorant enough to think the Dorco&#x27;s I bought were superior blades for my face because they didn&#x27;t nick me.</li>
            <li>All the promises made by Charles Roberts have come true for me.  </li>
            <li>; on a good portion of my pate (my head NOT my brain) I have chosen to scrap off the remaining follicles as close to the scalp as possible.</li>
            <li>Just tried my first Feather blade, and it is FAR superior to the others.  </li>
            <li>I get about 10-12 very good shaves per blade and, with the low cost, my Scottish background does not object to going to a new blade at that point.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s damned smooth if I remember correctly:)&lt;br /&gt;Really, better product, better result, cost less, better for the environment...</li>
            <li>The flip side of that is ... if you are brand new to DE shaving or have not yet been able to achieve a smooth, nick-free and super-close shave, then beware.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but am willing to bet that these are pretty awesome in comparison to other well reviewed blades.</li>
            <li>read a lot of reviews that said how great and sharp the Feather blades are, so I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li>These razors are great and sharp.</li>
            <li>As far as double-edged razor blades go, they aren&#x27;t cheap, but they are tons cheaper than new razor cartridges and will give you a better shave when coupled with a good razor in a steady hand.</li>
            <li>you wish to quickly become a shaving master, let the Feather be your teacher.</li>
            <li>No plastic to throw away, no razor to replace every 2 - 4 years (I still have my 1971 Gillette Super Speed, 1967 Schick Krona</li>
            <li>suggest anyone starting to use a DE razor do the same to get the best, most comfortable shave for their type of beard and sensitive face.</li>
            <li>These razor blades are super sharp--some of the sharpest you can buy.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mild shave.</li>
            <li>They always some quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>I guess I was just used to getting mild irritation from using a multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li>However, I quickly, within two months, moved to the Feather; and have kept using them.</li>
            <li>Some say that they are too sharp, but for me they are perfect as they easily glide through my coarse beard.</li>
            <li>They have lasted a good long time.</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp, and even as an experienced user, I cut myself from time to time.</li>
            <li>These blades are not forgiving to a new DE user, but I love them.</li>
            <li>I have not been using the double edge safety razor long but am very happy with the switch.</li>
            <li>quality construction, excellent edge, long lasting.  </li>
            <li>you first try one be sure to look very closely in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I have only shaved once but these blades are pretty good.</li>
            <li>I honestly wish they were a bit duller out of the box, but I won&#x27;t fault the company for producing the sharpest edge possible which is why I decided it was worthy of a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>Buy these blades for the best single edge shave possible..  </li>
            <li>Looking for fine blades at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>He really gets a smooth, close shave using these.</li>
            <li>You may not yet be ready for the Mighty Feather.  </li>
            <li>Past seven years i was using Merkur Rost free platinum coated blades, but went for a change and was pretty happy.  </li>
            <li>(where you rarely nick yourself).  </li>
            <li>Razors are a very personal preference that being said if you like feathers then these will be a great deal pricewise, but they are coming from far away</li>
            <li>For now, the Personna wins over the Feather.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy d/e shaving this is definitely one of the top shaving blades you should use.</li>
            <li>Worth getting</li>
            <li>Sharpest blade in town, worth the price and wait from Asia.</li>
            <li>My favorite razors to use by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using these blades in Feather&#x27;s own second generation</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this razor blade most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Compared to the price of cartridge razors, definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>I started using an old school Gillette razor and wasn&#x27;t sure what blade brand to use.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth learning how to use these blades.</li>
            <li>The cost savings alone was worth the price of the razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, my own personal experience.</li>
            <li>Pretty new to DE shaving and need to try more brands,</li>
            <li>The Feather provided a noticeably better and closer shave than all of the other brands in the variety pack, and slightly better than the Personna I had been using.</li>
            <li>Yes, these blades are really sharp, but used with care and patience they will reward you with an amazingly close comfortable shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li>They are still superior to the other blades that I have tried.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and were fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are just superior to all the other blades I have tried.</li>
            <li>Best blades hands down and worth the extra cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>No nicks, and they just glide right over my skin.  </li>
            <li>It just went right through the hair.</li>
            <li>Also, you are steaming your face with a towel before you shave, and then using a pre-shave oil, shaving soap and a brush, right?  </li>
            <li>in fact im going to go shave right now</li>
            <li>right out</li>
            <li>I used to see a cupboard full of sample packs, eventually, feathers plus the occasional bargain blade when the price was appealing.</li>
            <li>I can say that if you want an easy DE shave experience, and have tough skin, these Feathers are a great buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing I could probably wash with a more mild facial soap...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them a whole lot since I only need to shave once every couple weeks, but so far these blades are great.  </li>
            <li>After many years of shaving with the newest types of multi blade razors that most everyone has been using, I decided to go back to old fashioned DE shaving.</li>
            <li>I now have a Gillette Slim adjustable razor, and with the razor dialed back a little the Feathers are just perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using them with a Weishi 9306CL and get a nice smooth shave with little irritation every time.</li>
            <li>Other blades seem to glide more easily than the Feather DE blades.</li>
            <li>Very sharp blades and a good value.</li>
            <li>Using these blades lets me whack right through the brush without having to trim with an electric razor first.</li>
            <li>Excellent  very sharp, edge will stay for quite a few shaves,  great package too covered for blades for 6 months,  careful if beginner</li>
            <li>I lost a little bit of confidence that day, even running into my old high school sweetheart at the wedding and beautiful bridal party that I defiantly had a chance with it, because my face wasnt as smooth as it wouldve been with the Feather blades.</li>
            <li>This is my first time with a double edge edge razor and so far so good</li>
            <li>However, Feather has a solid reputation amongst wet-shavers for being just right for many.</li>
            <li>Use the proper stroke method, with a natural lather, and youve got an irritation free, bump free, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>a Double Edge Razor one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do most of the work.</li>
            <li>but I do not feel the need to change the blade more often than every second week or so.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, some of the reviewers who discuss the price of the blade will often brag how they can get another brand blade to last 3 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>First of all let me say that I have shaved with Derby&#x27;s, Merkur, Gillettes and Shark DE blades</li>
            <li>Make sure to not apply pressure, this is not necessary let the blade do all the work for you.</li>
            <li>The boxes also have a neat razor blade disposal - though many other do so this isn&#x27;t a unique feature.</li>
            <li>slowly, expect to toss a blade after three to four shaves and be happy.</li>
            <li>Feather blades are most likely the sharpest de blades you can buy, period.</li>
            <li>cut my self the first time</li>
            <li>(Most of the time, I replace a blade after every 3rd shave.)</li>
            <li>me, I&#x27;m still on my first order.  </li>
            <li>When I first bought a safety razor, I had heard that it could produce a closer shave, and for a cheaper price than a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li>With these my cost is about $5.00 a month, and they give me a better shave than anything else I have used since I started shaving regular in 1963.</li>
            <li>You could possibly get more than a week out of them, but changing every week has become my habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently sporting a seasonally appropriate beard, but during the summer, these are the blades I gravitated towards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a better idea to start with a standard brand and wait to move to Feather once your face has adjusted to this type of shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall: After trying BIC, Derby, and Personna DE blades these have become my favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice Wet</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>I have also been \\&quot;corking\\&quot; my blades before first use.</li>
            <li>will probly go back to the Dorco blades till I get more</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if there was a blade that worked better on my face and beard than the brand I was currently using (Personna).</li>
            <li>I first came on the DE scene about a year ago.</li>
            <li>This blade butchered me the first time, and the shave wasn&#x27;t as close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I tried these blades the first time and reviewed them, I&#x27;ve lost 45 lbs.</li>
            <li>These were the first I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I have nothing to compare them too.</li>
            <li>My face and neck bleed a lot when I first started using these</li>
            <li>2/13/08:  As my prep has improved, I have discovered that the Feather is even better than my initial comments indicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to first shaves with some blades</li>
            <li>Since writing this review I have been able to use the French Gillette Bleue blades, which a friend obtains for me whenever she is in France.  </li>
            <li>Since writing this review I have been able to use the French Gillette Bleue blades, which a friend obtains for me whenever she is in France.  </li>
            <li>Far sharper than the Shark blades also available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>first off I never even got the chance to see the product tracking said deliver date 1 month after I placed order then got a message that they attempted the delivery</li>
            <li>I am a prime member and this is the first time this has happened to me I have been a prime member for 3 years.</li>
            <li>Spend that extra blade money on the shave cream frontier or a book on Esperanto or something :)</li>
            <li>Once I return to Double Edged blade shaving, I love the cost effectiveness and closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more blades from feather when I need replacements.</li>
            <li>Today marked my 7th shave with my first blade (2 passes a day for 7 days), and my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>these are NOT for the first time user...</li>
            <li>These were the first blades I ever tried when I got into DE.</li>
            <li>First time I used them, I thought...</li>
            <li>I have to admit my first shave</li>
            <li>I would buy more and will now only use Feather.</li>
            <li>Only ones better than these are the Feather Platinums</li>
            <li>It does take a little more time and patience, but once you get the hang of it, quite easy.  </li>
            <li>Just because these Feather blades worked great for me doesn&#x27;t mean they will for you.</li>
            <li>If you really want to do it right, put the end of the razor in rubbing alcohol to store it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll have to use a deft hand, however, because being this sharp means you can also cut yourself even easier.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick as many of the other blades were shipped from overseas and these were in stock in the US.</li>
            <li>And in no time you will be shaving as fast as before only deeper and more</li>
            <li>The learning curve with these lovely Japanese blades is, fortunately, very steep.  </li>
            <li>I spent hundreds of dollars in my young life on Mach 3 blades and got a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most reviewers on here, I don&#x27;t think the Feather blades are really any sharper than your standard</li>
            <li>After trying numerous brands, I found the feather blades to work best with the least, if any, razor burn.  </li>
            <li>The Feather blades also last much longer for me, a week or more.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just starting out with Straight Razors or Safety Razors then you would benefit from changing out blades more often.</li>
            <li>I also found that those razors with multiple blades actually don&#x27;t do any good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely not a negative review on the blades as they are fantastic, but simply worth noting that you will probably want to try a few different blades before settling on your favorite as \\&quot;sharpest\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean \\&quot;the best for your face\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Positive reviews led me to try the Feather.    </li>
            <li>these razors are amazing, they stay sharp for a bout 2 weeks and they individually rapped &amp; dispense easily.</li>
            <li>If you investigate the reviews for different types of blades, I think the general message is usually a very good approximation to the truth: this particular blade is no different.</li>
            <li>That first shave sounds like you have a straight edge gliding across your face.  </li>
            <li>I used to shave with Merkurs, but those dulled way too fast and the blade quality wasn&#x27;t consistent.  </li>
            <li>After trying each of the brands included in a sampler pack of blades I purchased, the Feathers come in on top by a long way.</li>
            <li>With the price to value ratio, they&#x27;re pretty much a no brainer.</li>
            <li>These work great for me, and are sharp enough to do the job with no pulling or scraping.</li>
            <li>Disclaimer: my whiskers are pretty think, so if you have thin/fine whiskers it may be too much.  </li>
            <li>2nd best blade I&#x27;ve tried, but still a distant 2nd.  </li>
            <li>I shaved with it, every week only once is enough for me,,, my wife comes around touching all over the face and asking HOW do you shave that smoothly :</li>
            <li>Anyways, probably I won&#x27;t change from this brand for some long time, or when a better alternative comes.</li>
            <li>Mostly, it saves me money in the long run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a full box of 5 blades, so far, and I like the way they feel and the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good, but not significantly better than the Sharks (also ordered from Amazon).  </li>
            <li>I decided to go for the full monty despite people telling me to tread softly.</li>
            <li>So far I have found this to not be true for me.  </li>
            <li>But, these things a sharp and did a good job of getting rid of my week old growth.</li>
            <li>I grant that the last few shaves were not as smooth and comfortable as the first several, BUT there were no nicks or cuts, and virtually all the shaves were superior</li>
            <li>the blades are so good, that by the 2nd round, you can stroke against the grain, and really get that micro stubble, and still irritation free.</li>
            <li>they are kind to my skin and are very sharp without causing nicks.</li>
            <li>Very efficient and last a decent amount of time (4 to 5 shaves WTG and ATG, probably more if you just went WTG).</li>
            <li>but I have super sensitive</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have an adjustment curve (especially when one comes from those supermarket multi-bladed contraptions) and it will require both a good shaving soap such as the [[ASIN:B000Q33CRE Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Sienna]] and a top Double Blade safety razor such as the [[ASIN:B004LDCJV0 Feather]]; however, the end result is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Any other blade could never give me a clean irritation free shave on my neck.</li>
            <li>These have become my favorite blades for over a year now after trying a variety of different brands, which I recommend anyone new to safety razors to do.</li>
            <li>A new razor will cut you and he couldn&#x27;t have been more correct especially with these blades.</li>
            <li>I got about seven good shaves out of one blade by simply patting it dry.</li>
            <li>Now, these might not be the right blades for a new DE shaver to start off with.</li>
            <li>favorite blades, sharp and crisp</li>
            <li>Personally, I think they&#x27;re fine</li>
            <li>The Merkur blades are nice and sharp and so are these, but somehow just a tad sharper because I was not paying attention and just going through the motions as per normal and some skin was exfoliated without me even noticing.  </li>
            <li>They are extremly sharp and long lasting and work wonderfully with my Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of single blade razors and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The first brand I tried was Bic and they were good as starter blades, but seemed to be not sharp enough for me at times, especially around the tougher areas of my face.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have much of a nicking problem.  </li>
            <li>Also using this razor to break into eventually using a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Sounds crazy I know, but it does the best job, period.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s prime and ready to be tossed.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>blood!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told that all DE blades are not created equal - some are sharper than others, and some beards do not require the sharpest blade available.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why people care about this blade so much.</li>
            <li>I use it in my straight razor.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for beginners, but if you are a wet-shaving veteran and you want a close, smooth shave, buy these blades.</li>
            <li>These were for my son, he says they are much nicer in his skin than the shark blades .</li>
            <li>I know the whole ritual surrounding shaving with a safety razor (I have two Merkurs)</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference in the Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much so that you can hear them give way to the edge.</li>
            <li>It really does make all the difference.</li>
            <li>My face is much thinner now, and since I kept the Feather blades, I tried them out again with a thinner face.</li>
            <li>They work very well. s</li>
            <li>They really are a lot sharper and give me a much easier shave.</li>
            <li>or too much pressure</li>
            <li>Since going to a DE razor and feather blades, I&#x27;ve noticed that they really minimize irritation/burn.  </li>
            <li>The Feather Portable is a lot more aggressive than the 38C, so my first shave with a Feather/Feather combination was not nearly as good or comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Really digging the results now, tho... hope this helps.</li>
            <li>I use it with Parker SR1 stainless steel and it is a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks like I am sharing too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how Feather can make a blade that&#x27;s so much sharper than all the modern razor blades but believe me, they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a much closer shave than the derby blades I was using before.</li>
            <li>maybe that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t get a much closer shave over the Derby blades.</li>
            <li>How much difference can there be between blades?  </li>
            <li>They work real well.</li>
            <li>DE shavers, as in those who take this up as a hobby, are very knowledgeable about this type of thing (hence the consistency of the reviews,) and we should expect this, as these people tempt lady fortune and &#x27;study&#x27; the blades for around 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li>Be gentle with them if your switching from a blade with a duller edge.</li>
            <li>So after 4 shaves and 1 blade I tried Wilkinson&#x27;s which were easily available at my local pharmacy</li>
            <li>Capable of the finest shaves out there.</li>
            <li>And who really knows if this is a copy or the real thing.</li>
            <li>and thought I would try the Feathers as everything I read indicates these were very</li>
            <li>They are a really treat to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No tracking, no way to know if they really are legit.</li>
            <li>But I finally gave them a shot, and WOW -- love em.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying more of the Feather&#x27;s as they really do give me a much closer shave with no pulling and minimal nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>knowing this made me much more careful and forced me to use good shaving techniques.  </li>
            <li>As a regular DE shaver, I watched the inside my bathroom cabinet&#x27;s contents evolve as I developed a better idea of what I wanted out of a shave.</li>
            <li>Sharp as can be and  VERY comfortable.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and very smooth</li>
            <li>The package also has a little opening to slide the used razors into, very nice extra feature.</li>
            <li>These are extremely sharp and provide a very smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li>If you are a seasoned safety razor shaver and want to feel a whole new level of smoothness, then these are for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Derby and Astra (the other two most popular brands for double-edged razors) and the sharpness that is standard on Feathers is leaps and bounds above the competition.</li>
            <li>After hearing how sharp Feathers are and wondering if the horror stories were true, I finally built up the nerve to order a small sample of these legendary blades.</li>
            <li>even against the grain on my second pass it was incredibly gentle and clean</li>
            <li>The seem thinner and more flexible than any other of the blades I used</li>
            <li>You can find many reviews warning that they are so sharp that if you don&#x27;t respect them then you will shred your face.  </li>
            <li>I felt no pulling, and more hair was removed in one stoke than other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I listened to other reviews and got these and can&#x27;t imagine others being much better.  </li>
            <li>You can probably find some other blades for cheaper depending on how many you buy at a time.</li>
            <li>I like these better than the handful of other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>They are just as sharp as most people claim.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that going with the grain, this misses a lot more then other blades.</li>
            <li>Not only do you get a close shave with no drag on the skin but the blades are good for several shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other blade brands, but this is my keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The steel is extremely high quality Japanese stainless, which allows the blade to be significantly thinner than lower quality blades.</li>
            <li>At this point since finding the FEATHER blades, I don&#x27;t particularly care if I ever graduate to the straight razor.    </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really sharp, and give a close shave with an experienced hand&lt;br /&gt;+ Since they are sharp, they don&#x27;t cause irritation during a shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can barely feel Feather blades cut the same swath much more closely.</li>
            <li>the negatives made me hesitate for a bit before trying them, it was actually the overwhelming number of positive reviews that finally got me to make the attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for anyone&lt;br /&gt;who wants a close shave.</li>
            <li>A great lesson for me since it forced me to be much more careful and pay attention to my technique and my second shave was one of</li>
            <li>He highly recommends the Feather stainless blades and so do I.  </li>
            <li>Very very sharp and will cut you if you&#x27;re inexperienced, but once you learn what you&#x27;re doing, it makes a great shave and glides through all hair like it wasn&#x27;t even there.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sharp out of the box, and it leaves a very smooth impression.</li>
            <li>So far all I have read on both the Merkur and the FEATHER have been consistent, for me.      </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had the first cut or weeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Edwin Jagger came with Derby blades, so naturally those were the first I used.</li>
            <li>When the individual blade is a good one, I can get nice close shaves without cutting myself.  </li>
            <li>I get a better shave using these blades than anything else i have used hands down.</li>
            <li>It shaves very well leaving little to no \\&quot;wounds\\&quot; like previously experienced with other razor blades.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use them if you are new to safety razors!  </li>
            <li>and I am able to get a few more shaves than other blades I have tried.</li>
            <li>Once that&#x27;s done, they shave great and are more than scary sharp -- think surgical.</li>
            <li>It is both flexible and able to keep a very sharp edge.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these still shave my face amazingly well and smooth.</li>
            <li>these blades are still less than 60cents in most places.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d guess I get half as many shaves.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a traditional Double Edge safety razor is an art neglected by most.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the same price as the same number of Merkurs and these are much better blades.</li>
            <li>Shaving doesn&#x27;t get easier as you get older, and for me it became a choice between an itchy beard or finding something to shave with than</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that the shave is much better, I&#x27;ll keep the star rating the same for the following reasons</li>
            <li>So, even though I don&#x27;t particularly like these Feather blades</li>
            <li>(5) Repeat lather and shave for second pass (mostly with the grain, some days its against the grain on the second pass).</li>
            <li>I have tried many blades and these were the only ones that could maintain sharpness during an entire shaving.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more as needed, but I expect these 30 will last me quite some time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of razors and think ive settled on feather brand razors as my favorite.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t recommend them to novice users because of their sharpness which could cut and nick your face quite easily if you are not careful, for novice users, try the merkurs or the wilkinson swords first, and then when comfortable with them, go ahead and try the Feather&#x27;s, you won&#x27;t go back to any other brand!</li>
            <li>/&gt;there is no drag, gripping, or uncomfortable catching from a feather blade.  </li>
            <li>I snap them in half and use them in a cheap disposable-blade straight razor (also from Amazon!).</li>
            <li>I think that they&#x27;ve just gone down in popularity since the double edge was introduced, but the shave with a safety razor is far superior.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend both the blade and the seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the blades, just look at the shipping options.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these, and do not be scared off by some people saying that these will butcher your face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The price is also a bargain - highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these and will be buying them again..</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend these blades to all you guys thinking about trying this type of shaving.</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried Feather blades then I would highly recommend you do.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>then decided to splurge on these as the reviews are high and everyone claims they&#x27;re godsend.</li>
            <li>After checking  yellow or black same great razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp and last for about two weeks for me.</li>
            <li>the little boxes are nifty and provide a safe place to stick the used blades when disposing of them vs tossing in the garbage</li>
            <li>I seem to get a more comfortable shave with these blades on the second or third day when they aren&#x27;t quite so sharp.  </li>
            <li>They give you a fantastic shave when used carefully.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra buck or two.</li>
            <li>had forgotten that I had a few more Feathers in my sample pack and decided to try again with the blade in my Merkur Slant Bar.  </li>
            <li>no going over the same spot a dozen times and not &#x27;cutting it&#x27; like my cartridge razor days.</li>
            <li>So I treat myself with a fresh blade on a semi daily basis.</li>
            <li>I get multiple uses from each one, and each shave is soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t really aren&#x27;t that much more expensive and they are still cheap compared to the Gillete Mach 5 or whatever they are up to these days.  </li>
            <li>Shaving has become fun, and I actually look forward to shaving every day.</li>
            <li>Good but not great.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly Gillette 7&#x27;O&#x27;clocks and Bics were close behind; cheapies.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them, but not for new users of manual razors.</li>
            <li>They also last, I can easily use a blade 5 or 6 times, if I shaved daily</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re like me and got a coarse beard, these go right through it.</li>
            <li>These razors glide right through with no problem, and I get several uses out of each blade.  </li>
            <li>I have read many of the reviews on these blades both positive and negative,</li>
            <li>As for the commentary about them being too sharp, I find them to be great and had to use no more caution than I did with inferior brands.</li>
            <li>Now to these razor blades, I first learned using the &amp;#34;Stainless Steel Platinum Coated Double Edge Safety Razor Blades A.K.A Israeli Personnas.&amp;#34; They weren&#x27;t super sharp, but they gave me a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>For my pretty tough beard, these work quite a bit better and aren&#x27;t so prone to nicks &amp;#62; &amp;#62; &amp;#62; Crystal &amp;#34;SUPER +&amp;#34; Stainless Steel Platinum</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;touch\\&quot; now is extremely light with no pressure exerted other than that which the razor&#x27;s weight against the skin exerts.</li>
            <li>These blades are so sharp and cut so smoothly</li>
            <li>Those blades are sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Also very reasonably priced especially compared to normal cartridge blade.</li>
            <li>My new blade of choice.</li>
            <li>These razor blades really do live up to their reputation.</li>
            <li>Popping in a new Feather into your safety razor is like a treat.  </li>
            <li>Feather blades live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Got these as replacements for a new handle</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every Monday I start a new blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the safety razor scene.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new at DE shaving.</li>
            <li>as a new shaver i went shark and no nono</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new user of these type of razors and I have not cut myself</li>
            <li>I purchased a new Merkur Futur and a variety sample pack of blades.</li>
            <li>I do caution new DE shavers though...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t miss the new razors of today at all.  </li>
            <li>Light rinse to feel where I need to give extra attention, re-lather, adjust to #1.5 and give a final against the grain pass.      </li>
            <li>The second time, I was a bit more careful.</li>
            <li>Good blades, can get over ten shaves out of a blade if I don&#x27;t let my beard get to thick between shaves.</li>
            <li>Like I said earlier, I love these blades and get a great close shave (I usually shave every 2-3 days and these blades handle my tough beard</li>
            <li>However, after my first couple of shaves with them, I noticed little difference between them and the Super Shark Chrome blades, yet they cost more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are really sharp, but the first shave is not as smooth as the 2nd+ shave with them for some reason.</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin that is prone to razor burn and cuts, but these razors don&#x27;t leave my face and neck looking like I rubbed sandpaper on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using these razors and have compared them to several other brands and have used them in the Feather Razor with the plastic handle, a 1972 Schick Krona, 1949 Gillette Super Speed and a Wilkinson Sword D/E and can honestly say there is no better D/E razor blade on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 59 and started shaving with a D/E razor and blades, after a five year stint using the &#x27;modern cartridge razor&#x27;</li>
            <li>As someone who only a year ago switched to wet shaving, I&#x27;m glad to have found these early.</li>
            <li>I do either a 2 - or - three way shave depending on if I shave every day and end up with a face like an 18 year old girls butt!</li>
            <li>I have been using Merkurs for the last two years, and was interested in seeing what else was out there.  </li>
            <li>I had read up and knew the warnings about Feather blades being mercilessly sharp and to be sure if you are a newbie (me), develop your technique and above all, respect these blades!</li>
            <li>My method for the best shave: (1) steam my face over a skillet of boiling water for 5 min (easier than a hot towel, and seems to do the trick, BIG improvement over just lathering up).</li>
            <li>have a pretty coarse beard, so</li>
            <li>As long as I am aware of how sharp these are things are fine -</li>
            <li>Yes, they are sharp, a little aggressive, and most certainly worth the dough for a 30ct.</li>
            <li>They last me about 5 comfortable shaves and cut me a lot less than most other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li>Just remember that Feathers are super sharp, take your time shaving, and enjoy how sharp they are.</li>
            <li>you have a lot of experience with traditional shaving and you want to experience a real high performance blade, the Feathers are for you.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp so they produce a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>With a lot of growth, the blade dulls faster, so shaving off your beard can take down a razor in less than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from some inconveniences from a travel perspective, Feather Double Edged Razor Blades are almost perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty tough beard and sensitive skin and these blades have helped me get a better shave.  </li>
            <li>every couple of shaves just to treat myself but figure I could get four or five days worth out of a single blade.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, but after many shaves later I have yet to cut my skin with these blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t last as long, but at the overall shave experience is better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They last longer and stay comfortable longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to dry the blades after every shave and have not had any rusting issues,  even the blades in my can of used blades don&#x27;t show rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only caveat is that I would not recommend these for a (very) new shaver; even though these are not &#x27;more unsafe,&#x27; as a product, they will magnify the mistakes you are sure to make as a new shaver, and potentially scare you away from what should be a cost-saving, relaxing, and nostalgic experience your grandpa would have been proud you&#x27;re taking an interest in.</li>
            <li>Commercial shaving creams like Edge and Barbasol dry out too fast causing more drag along the face.</li>
            <li>After the third shave, they start to have a little &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;, which is OK for me because that level of dullness is where the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; is for me when shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feather razor blades have a reputation for being super sharp.  </li>
            <li>He said they are super SHARP.</li>
            <li>Because of that, they can have a super sharp edge.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super sharp and maintain their sharpness well.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp as other reviews have stated, so you really need to make sure your blade angle is spot on and you&#x27;re not applying any pressure.</li>
            <li>Feather saves me time in the number of passes, it is absolutely not as expensive as others when you consider how frequently it dulls (re: blade longevity,) and the death of a feather blade is very gradual, allowing me to adapt my shaving accordingly without any major mishap or hiccup along the way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but in a nutshell, a single-blade razor offers a smoother shave, with a better feel, than a cartridge blade shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you clean and dry off your blades (same as with disposable cartridge razors)</li>
            <li>By far.</li>
            <li>I completely concur and will be buying these from now on.</li>

            <li>Do at least a two pass shave, 1st with the grain, (rinse, apply more cream) then against the grain if you want an even closer shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(using these with an old Gillette slim adjustable.)</li>
            <li>(now this only leads me to imagine the shave I can achieve with a straight razor...)</li>
            <li>they will last much longer.</li>
            <li>A far cry from the old blades</li>
            <li>The second shave and on is when these blades really shine.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used a couple dozen of these.</li>
            <li>I suggest the Old Post Road Oil company brand...</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a dated reference to lead with, but you gotta go old school if you use a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I know safety razors came out post-Twain, but I gotta give the old guy credit.</li>
            <li>but I have somewhat sensitive skin (</li>
            <li>Old razor burn from (what I guess)</li>
            <li>My facial hair has become much darker and thicker since then.</li>
            <li>but i thought i was ready being a derby extra blade</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at the sharpness.</li>
            <li>And the 5-blade package is really convenient for traveling with extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I use them in an Edwin Jagger DE89L and have no problems at all as far as being &amp;</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think its necessary.</li>
            <li>We all know the feather brand is by far the sharpest blade around.</li>
            <li>This is written by a man btw on a female account haha</li>
            <li>Ordered them from a company whose fulfillment was done by Amazon, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait the weeks that some who order the blades wait, they arrived in 5 days along with the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving crème, and I brush and razor stand</li>
            <li>I have had a shaving revelation thanks to these blades and will never go back to the overpriced, razor burn inducing, multi-blade razors that I had been using.</li>
            <li>If these were substantially more expensive, I&#x27;d say they aren&#x27;t worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Context: I&#x27;m 20 years old, with a light beard that must be shaven every few days for my job</li>
            <li>thought all blades where the same was proven wrong with these blades super high quality and you will have an enjoyable shave</li>
            <li>So, the moral of the story is, if you have a proper technique, and, by this I mean a consistent blade angle of attack and a consistent light touch (letting the blade and razor do the work)</li>
            <li>but then I also found several other brands like Astra to be fine.</li>
            <li>While there are plenty of double edge (DE) blades I have yet to try, I have been able to try several other blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old black silver tipped super speed gillette just works wonders with these blades.</li>
            <li>I can frequently get up to two weeks out of each blade, if not a bit more, before it becomes too irritating under normal conditions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>had a few cuts during the first few shaves, but was soon able to have the smoothest shave ever with just two passes.</li>
            <li>Glad i bought them, they do the job, they&#x27;re sharp, and stay sharp for about 3 uses each blade.</li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is making such a big deal about the \\&quot;danger\\&quot; of these blades.</li>
            <li>My hubby uses this brand religiously for shaving and has had only stellar experiences with it.</li>
            <li>These blades last many times as long as the swords, and are so sharp that it feels like the razor has the texture of an ice-cube as it goes across your face.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend him and not hesitate to use his company in the future.</li>
            <li>If you use or want to use a DE razor, I would highly suggest to ONLY use Feather blades.</li>
            <li>I like these razors, although I don&#x27;t like them any better than the Personnas and they&#x27;re a little more expensive.</li>
            <li>I want, probably, most of what you do: less time spent, longevity of the blade, cost-effectiveness, consistency, and safety.</li>
            <li>So after a long weekend, I reach for a Feather, and pay very close attention to what I&#x27;m doing with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being a long time straight edge shaver and safety blade user: There are two ways to cut yourself shaving.</li>
            <li>No more razor burn or irritation and a baby smooth face.</li>
            <li>I had just made the switch to wet shaving and my first shaves with the Derbys</li>
            <li>I almost like the less sharp brands better just because I&#x27;m waking up</li>
            <li>So if you find the shave unbearable try again later with a new blade and see if it is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still somewhat new to double edge shaving, and I had heard that Feather is an &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Feather New Hi-Stainless is currently my preferred, \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; blade.  </li>
            <li>I finally regained my common sense and returned to what works so much better.</li>
            <li>They last a long time, the quality is consistent and they are some of the sharpest blades around.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made the right decision early to buy a sampler pack of different blades because I will say different blades work differently for different people.</li>
            <li>The blades are extremely sharp and NOT for someone trying a safety razor for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that I was hesitant to try these at first because of their reputation for being so sharp.</li>
            <li>He kicked major ass.</li>
            <li>SHARP and ready to go!</li>
            <li>I cannot feel the blade pulling at my whiskers, unlike every other blade, so at first I thought I needed to adjust my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would wait however (if you are new to DE shaving) until you have practiced with a few others first</li>
            <li>When I shaved with them for the first time, I wasn&#x27;t being very careful</li>
            <li>B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor</li>
            <li>Sharp enough to cut through 4 or 5 days worth of beard growth.</li>
            <li>Let me tell ya, if I cracked a book on a foreign language as often as I shaved, I&#x27;d be able to tell you by now to buy these things in a whole mess of languages; but, since the human condition forces me to deal with facial hair, I&#x27;m going to have to use English</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend them to my brother (with a caveat that he needs to be careful), so I&#x27;d certainly recommend them to you.</li>
            <li>you press the blade hard against your whiskers or lightly?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know WHAT technical mistakes someone is making that led them to &amp;#34;bleed everywhere&amp;#34;, but you can&#x27;t complain about a razor being too sharp if you are not doing it right.</li>
            <li>If you want to try different blades I highly recommend buying one of the variety packs that provide you with a multitude of different brand blades.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ready for them but wound up cutting myself up pretty badly--about six or seven good nicks at least and</li>
            <li>provide a very close shave, but I am not sure that I am ready for them yet.</li>
            <li>and you really must be careful.  </li>
            <li>also feel it is necessary to say that many of the negative reviews address different issues</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and can only shave once to twice per week.  </li>
            <li>So far Feathers are the sharpest double edged safety blades I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>But you need to be careful since it doesn&#x27;t take too much pressure to give yourself a gash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then Feather blades are the ultimate as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>I recently started shaving with DE blades and have only tried two different brands, so I don&#x27;t have much for comparison.</li>
            <li>These arrived much quicker that I expected.  </li>
            <li>I was washing washing my face with regular bar soap twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, and my skin was really drying out and making it difficult to make more than one pass a day.</li>
            <li>: this is your likely destination as far as blade is concerned.</li>
            <li>My husband uses these approximately 8-10 times each, which is astounding considering his coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li>blade was more irritating than the Personna and that may be because I&#x27;m so used to the Personna.  </li>
            <li>Honestly; you can&#x27;t go wrong with Feather products.</li>
            <li>like kitchen knives, if you have a thinner knife, you can get a sharper edge, but because the edge is so thin, it will need to be sharpened more often.  </li>
            <li>and I found that the Sharks are a bit of false economy as these are a better value.</li>
            <li>If you are careful and treat them with the same respect as any other blade, then you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Consistent quality and very sharp.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close and leaves your face baby smooth but go slow and be very very careful.</li>
            <li>Well, it would be except they don&#x27;t seem to give the same quality of shave as my old double edge razor blades.  </li>
            <li>In my mind, the simple fact of lathering (shave creams are basically mild soaps with hair softeners and lubricants) and shaving should be enough to cleanse and remove any dead skin.</li>
            <li>My beard is coarse and thick and multi-directional, so I need to do a 2-3 pass shave against the grain to get that smooth finish.</li>
            <li>He does not have a thick facial hail, mild to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned when I started my first shave with one of these loaded because I didn&#x27;t hear the blade singing as it cut.</li>
            <li>They were NOT sharp enough.</li>
            <li>There is nothing like my first shave with a new blade; it cuts through even my thick (sometimes overgrown) beard like butter.</li>
            <li>have not experienced any irritation with these, but if you are not careful and rush, it is easy to nick yourself with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are definitely sharper than the other blades I have tried, but I find that I cut myself less often with this sharper blade because of how smoothly it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a chunk of sharpened metal, same general shape, just the label is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are really leagues above any other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving with the world&#x27;s sharpest blades isn&#x27;t so fun when the one you&#x27;re using is 2 shaves past</li>
            <li>Not sure they&#x27;re worth the hassle of ordering and then waiting.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t very forgiving and probably could hurt if you don&#x27;t have your technique down.</li>
            <li>Very sharp blades give very close shave.  </li>
            <li>They are very sharp and give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Just be careful with these when they are new.</li>
            <li>I was using mercer blades (not sure thats spelled right and don&#x27;t have them in front of me)</li>
            <li>and I usually have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow right after I shave, so</li>
            <li>Feather are simply high quality, extremely sharp razor blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Put a half of one in my straight razor and shaved.  </li>
            <li>Definitely practice your technique before trying them, because you can definitely slice yourself if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>The first few shaves is freaky, actually.  </li>
            <li>it has a pleasant scent and it&#x27;s way less expensive than your standard commercial brands.</li>
            <li>The Derbys weren&#x27;t sharp enough and required multiple passes to get a decent shave, which caused a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li>These cut very well with the grain...but go against the grain and they will make you cry like a little girly</li>
            <li>They really tore up my face with little nicks, and I am by no means a novice safety razor shaver.</li>
            <li>No cuts, but a little burn (something I did not experience with the LORDs), and not nearly as close as the first time.</li>
            <li>What used to be a dull routine is now almost fun.</li>
            <li>However, these ones didn&#x27;t seem as sharp to me as the one that came with my razor, or the new ones I just got from a local shop</li>
            <li>This brand of razor is a little lighter than your standard double edge blade so take your time and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have a very thick, coarse beard and have recently found the pleasure and better results of DE wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, these are very sharp blades that also last for many shaves.  </li>
            <li>I am not going to get into whether or not these are the sharpest blades around that is sort of a given, nobody seems to contest that, the good and bad reviews alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin reviewing this item by saying,  </li>

            <li> These are some of the best blades that money can buy.</li>
            <li> Best shave ever my husband claims</li>

            <li> I achieved the best shave to date without a nick or burn!</li>
            <li> I have now used them for four or five shaves and every one has been perfect with no irritation or cuts!</li>
            <li> I get my best shave with these!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like DE shaving, and 2) if I decided that continuing with DE shaving would be in my best interest</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should still try  a sampler pack to figure out what works best for you, and if Feather blades are to your liking, go for it.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly impressed with these blades.</li>
            <li> DE blades are awesome if you want a close shave.  </li>
            <li> In my Merkur 38C razor, this blade is the perfect choice.  </li>
            <li> It gives me the best shave of any of the 20-some blades</li>
            <li> I disagree with them being the best ever though.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These razor blades are the best shave I&#x27;ve had with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, and</li>
            <li> Best shave you will ever ever ever have.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves give me an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades.  </li>
            <li> But these are perfect every time.</li>
            <li> Best Razors EVER!</li>
            <li> some of the best blades around.  </li>
            <li> Feather  De Razors are some of the best.</li>
            <li> These Blades are the best.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started DE shaving with a sampler pack of razors, which the Feathers were not apart of, and found Derby&#x27;s to be the best of the that bunch.</li>
            <li> Great blades!</li>
            <li> If you have never tried Feather blades, you are in for a very pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> And that is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Still a very good value.</li>
            <li> If you already use a D/E razor and are looking for a great blade, I think Feather makes the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> They are very good and for the price for quantity I received I think that is a great value.</li>
            <li> But when the blade is good, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product, but not up to all the hype.  </li>
            <li> That being said, they produce a great shave and I am always happy buying them in bulk.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the $2-3 blades from the monopoly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am quite happy with these blades.</li>
            <li> Great experience</li>
            <li> As there is a blade on both sides, the longevity is great.  </li>
            <li> These blades are great.  </li>
            <li> But these blades are great.</li>
            <li> and I get a great shave.</li>
            <li> Supplier was great exceeded my expectations and will buy from them again...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if I have not shaved for a week or a day, these do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Work great, close shave.</li>
            <li> a great value also.  </li>
            <li> Been using this brand for years great product.</li>
            <li> Great blades</li>
            <li> Great results with my Merkur Vision.</li>
            <li> These blades are great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great choice when it comes to blades.</li>
            <li> These blades works great.</li>
            <li> A great deal ....</li>
            <li> The  product is great.</li>
            <li> However, when you take the time tho, Feathers give a GREAT shave.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s joy in the road to finding this stuff out, but I&#x27;d like to save you time</li>
            <li> I had ordered (both great products).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> great shave</li>
            <li> I am astounded at what a great shave</li>
            <li> A great value, too.</li>
            <li> I found a great deal on the Derby&#x27;s and have been using those ever since.  </li>
            <li> I learned exactly how to use the safety razor I bought and what was the best procedure for me to shave, the blades are actually very impressive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, not the best.</li>
            <li> great thing about these blades in a good Safety Razor is the feedback you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li> Truefitt &amp; Hill make excellent shave creams, much better than Art of Shaving in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and you are rewarded with smooth, flawless skin.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on-line and made my purchase based on the good feedback about Feather.</li>
            <li> But now I spend a FRACTION of that, and I get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Astra Superior Premium Platinum</li>
            <li> We have tried others, but always return to Feather blades for their superior quality.</li>
            <li> Anyway it is a good blade</li>
            <li> so I will give it a good rating.</li>
            <li> , they are good blades.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> So good it even effects they grip on my razor making it slippery)  </li>
            <li> Platinum coated, good to go.</li>
            <li> I suggest just even a good rinse and pat</li>
            <li> Feather did a good job marketing, but nothing</li>
            <li> am using Astra Platinum and loved them.</li>
            <li> These blades are absolutely superior in every way.</li>
            <li> Good price, too.</li>
            <li> best, sharpest DE razor blades available.</li>
            <li> The good thing about their sharpness is that they won&#x27;t lag when moving across your face.</li>
            <li> Combine these with a good brush and either soap or cream.  </li>
            <li> As good as it gets.</li>
            <li> and I got a fairly good shave from them.</li>
            <li> I thought the Astra&#x27;s were good blades.</li>
            <li> Wilkinson Sword blades are good for 1 -2 shaves.</li>
            <li> really great shaves out of each blade, and can stretch it for 1 or 2 more after that which are still acceptable, but not quite as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with these blades and will continue to buy them for my safety razor.</li>
            <li> Feathers seem to be sharper than most blades on the market and work great for me.</li>
            <li> Let me say from the start that I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> However, these Feather Blades are considerably better!.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll wonder why they don&#x27;t cost more!</li>
            <li> The packaging helps keep you safe!  </li>
            <li> Just be respectful, and buy sceptic gel for your shave kit as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sample packs and many types but the Feather is the best it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> After buying a large combo pack of blades I used each blade for 2 shaves and decided that these Feather blades gave the best shave of all.  </li>
            <li> Feather&#x27;s blades are absolutely amazing, and at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> Amazing what a quality blade will do.  </li>
            <li> After shaving one time with the Feather Blades these are absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> These things are amazing.  </li>
            <li> your technique is to use pressure and &#x27;help&#x27; the blade do its work, you&#x27;ll upset the blade and it will let you know it.&lt;br /&gt;However - if you just let the blade glide and do its work for you, the blade will be happy and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a fantastic shave that takes almost no effort.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Great shave and a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> I just saw a pack of 8 fusion cartridges at a popular discount retail chain for about $28.  </li>
            <li> I think that speaks for itself, I have never had any blade that was good for more than a week, and pushing it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have gotten good shaves with most of them</li>
            <li> Use a quality cream, and preferably after a nice warm shower.</li>
            <li> He said it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li> If I do use them &amp;#34;properly&amp;#34; with excellent shaving cream(s), I will admit that it is much easier.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> but I need to warm up my face or these blades</li>
            <li> Once I get lathered up with warm water and the soap</li>
            <li> , even though this is the sharpest blade I&#x27;ve ever own, i don get any bumps or cuts.</li>
            <li> Arrived nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, received in a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li> Writing a review for razor blades is kind of like reviewing a movie.</li>
            <li> (2) Create the warm lather in a bowl using a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> I have switched over to DE shaving after catching the \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; bug.  </li>
            <li> the first shave was brilliant.  </li>
            <li> , these last shaves with the FEATHER blades have been a real honest treat and joy.  </li>
            <li> These blades are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Feathers are by far the best blades you can get.</li>
            <li> I replaced my blade a bit more often than I would have liked, but I kept telling myself it was because I was using entry level</li>
            <li> Got a safety razor with Shark blades - they were ok but these rock with a really nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Best blade I have found so far.</li>
            <li> The feather is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I started with merkur, then switched to these ones for a smooth shaving, i recommend them, cheap and great quality</li>
            <li> Great Price, great product got it next day.</li>
            <li> Well my first time shaving was with no issues, and I have nothing but great things to say about it.</li>
            <li> Sharpest blades out there and consistently give me a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Both brands are excellent (way better than the drugstore blades I started on) but from all the stories and stellar reviews I was expecting an extraordinary difference between the Feather and Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a very comfortable and close shave, with no nicks or cuts whats</li>
            <li> The shave was very smooth, no nicks...</li>
            <li> It goes very smooth over my skin</li>
            <li> These razor blades are among the sharpest made and very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I ordered came with 5 Shark Super Chrome blades that I actually loved.</li>
            <li> I received these blades in good time and in good condition, all were sealed and new.</li>
            <li> Those were ok, but these are worlds better.</li>
            <li> The Feathers are nice and extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> Get a weishi- older Gillette super speed or aristocrat, and these blades are the best there can be.  </li>
            <li> Simply stated, these are the best blades I have used for a DE razor.</li>
            <li> Of course everyone&#x27;s best blade may be different</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the best shave possible, this may be the blade for you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the quality of the shave is perhaps marginally better than the Merkurs I was using before these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Ninja assassin sharp&amp;#34;, maybe, but most high-quality blades are.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are the best for me and my double edge.</li>
            <li> Others may have better outcomes.  </li>
            <li> IMO it shaves more aggressively than the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll never order another blade, even if they are more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never need another razor:).</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  </li>
            <li> there were many of them and</li>
            <li> This last one I have tried is the best I have found- Cremo Creme.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Both are leagues better.</li>
            <li> Thicker blades are more blunt, but can withstand more use before needing sharpening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  think they just have better marketing.  </li>
            <li> I like them better than the Merkur blades that I used for a while with my Merkur razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hear shaving with DE safety razors are better for the skin.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll find out after it stops bleeding :)</li>
            <li> and I have yet to find a better razor blade</li>
            <li> In combination with Proraso cream this is the best double edge shave you can get.  </li>
            <li> The shave is nice, close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I love feather blades.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my coarse, wire-like face hairs.</li>
            <li> I have the following brands for many years:&lt;br /&gt;Gillette, wilkinson, Merkur, and many others but these three I consider to be the best until I discover the  Feather brand and believed to be just a tad better but don&#x27;t forget that sometimes you might get a badge that might of been finished 5 minutes before quitting time on a Friday afternoon</li>
            <li> Allow more time for delivery since they&#x27;re shipped from Asia.</li>
            <li> After buying a sample pack that included seven different blades, I found the Feather blades to be the best.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s safe to switch to these.</li>
            <li> and I love the shave I get from these blades</li>
            <li> These have made my DE shaving experience much better.  </li>
            <li> my canvas of handsome as I like to call my face).</li>
            <li> I took longer to shave to make sure I mastered it.</li>
            <li> I was getting better results with the Astras in that realm but the Feathers help</li>
            <li> OK with my EJ.</li>
            <li> But they simply don&#x27;t work the best for me, personally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, it could be technique-related, but I feel as if the blades from Derby seem to work better on my face.  </li>
            <li> I could probably get more uses out of them</li>
            <li> Afterwards I promptly ordered some more Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has told me that these are the best blades so this review is not from personal experience.</li>
            <li> love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love these razors.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these razors and I love the value package.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews and hoped that the Feathers would be better, and I took a gamble and bought a pack of 30 blades.</li>
            <li> I have the Edwin Jagger DE razor which is a more milder design</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> But that said, if you use the Feather blade in a more aggressive or adjustable razor, take care with your technique and/or setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, as to longevity:  Just for kicks I decided to see how many shaves</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, as to smoothness:  Better prep also has meant my impression of the Feather&#x27;s smoothness has increased.  </li>
            <li> The Bleues also seem better than the Gillette \\&quot;Sweedes\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The Bleues also seem better than the Gillette \\&quot;Sweedes\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> A nice blade and a smooth cut</li>
            <li> If i do this with care, most days I don&#x27;t even need after shave balm, would like to try Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s skin food tho.</li>
            <li> I will purchase these again since I get more mileage out of them.</li>
            <li> They are better than what came with  the razor, It will be a while before I try something else.</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  </li>
            <li> I never had a problem with those either, I just like the feather ones more.  </li>
            <li> This razor provides me with nice, smooth shaves time after time.</li>
            <li> I have never felt a better cut in my life</li>
            <li> Love the feather blades.</li>
            <li> The Derby blades were ok for just getting started, because they are not the sharpest blades and are forgiving of mistakes.</li>
            <li> I still however felt I would do better with a sharper blade, I had read many reviews of Feather, and from the reviews I could tell that the sharpness of the blades intimidated some shavers, but decided to order them anyway.</li>
            <li> You spend WAY more for the 30 pack than you do for the 100ct.  </li>
            <li> Feather blades are simply the best.</li>
            <li> I love them but they were not my starter blade.  </li>
            <li> just be sure to take your time and not cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> It took more than a month to arrive.  </li>
            <li> So many things coming from china is counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Its a meditative man tradition, the blade is top notch.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better now</li>
            <li> These are sharp..make sure you pay attention...</li>
            <li> All in all, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask.</li>
            <li> Tried all the big brands and feather always gives the best and closest shave.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend Feather and this seller has great prices.</li>
            <li> and these are just a shade better.</li>
            <li> I get more shaves out of the Feather than the Merkur, and they are not so costly.</li>
            <li> Definitely better with the Feather blades</li>
            <li> I may try another brand, still searching for my favorite</li>
            <li> If you are still learning technique DE shaving and have a light beard, hold off!</li>
            <li> The blades are high quality and give a great, close shave.  </li>
            <li> 3 shaves and I was ripping my neck up pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I got 5 good shaves with the first one.  </li>
            <li> I believe that I have pretty good shaving technique</li>
            <li> also use bigelow shave cream and baxter of california alcohol free after shave balm, and all of those products have been top notch and create a most enjoyable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best razor - lasts a long time and provides the cleanest shave.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a safety razor for a long time now and have tried a lot of blades, and the Feather blades are still the best that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I can routinely get 3 great shaves out of a Feather, and the 4th shave is at least very good, if not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend these blades to new and experienced shavers alike.</li>
            <li> These blades seem to catch more and don&#x27;t glide as easily over my stubble.  </li>
            <li> My face has never felt smoother and they are easy to shave with on top of it all.</li>
            <li> I use them for a cheap double edge safety and they work great!</li>
            <li> The key to a good shave seems to be to pick a good blade, then stay with it to learn how to use that brand of blade.</li>
            <li> These are much better than the cheap ones in drug store.  </li>
            <li> you are sampling blades to find the one that gives the most comfortable shave, I do believe you need to try these.\\</li>
            <li> Most importantly, they provide a suprbly close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, after using them for a couple of weeks, they are slowly becoming my go-to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These work great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find them to be that much sharper than an Astra but a good deal sharper than a Derby.</li>
            <li> blades hold up really well, get a good shave,.</li>
            <li> Sharp and do their work flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the LORD brand razor because it received glowing reviews from most users.</li>
            <li> I found this to be true!  </li>
            <li> An old barber once told me that most people think a brand new razor will give them the best shave</li>
            <li> the order was sent and recieved very quickly.</li>
            <li> So effortless, but you can so easily slice your face.  </li>
            <li> But the Feathers are the best... worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> Stopped washing my face and presto! clean shave and healthy skin.</li>
            <li> This is easily a years supply.</li>
            <li> But then again, do not be sacred of these blades; they are easy to use once adjusted to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Use a fairly aggressive razor- say an older Gillette Fatboy on the number 7-9 setting</li>
            <li> Shave preparation is also very important in getting a clean, close comfortable shave</li>
            <li> This is a top of the line blade right here!</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more since they are so cheap and give a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Just great cane on time and the blade is nice and sharp iys</li>
            <li> Hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Hands down, best blades on the market.</li>
            <li> As long as you do shafts, light pressure, the badges are very good.  </li>
            <li> Fine blades.</li>
            <li> They were fine.</li>
            <li> (I do it with the wrapper still on, works fine, just don&#x27;t press on the edges).</li>
            <li> I say this because I started with the Merkur blades that came with my model 180, and they were fine starter blades; being a beginner DE shaver.</li>
            <li> These blades aren&#x27;t too hardcore for the beginner, but a beginner should most certainly take more time and perhaps use a longer prep period to get ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Considering the order originates in Thailand, this is a huge inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much, used the product and it works great.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I started out wetshaving with Feather blades and a cheap, non-adjustable razor, and it almost made me give it up.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and works well.</li>

            <li> I was just hoping that the difference in price between the Sharks and the Feather blades was justified.  </li>

            <li> I lightly pass them through 1/8\\</li>
            <li> After trying a few sampler packs, these Feather blades have stood out as the best blade for me.</li>
            <li> It saves me from having to constantly order and they are priced great.</li>
            <li> Oh, almost forgot an important detail...</li>
            <li> Smooth and precise.</li>
            <li> These fit the requirement.  </li>
            <li> It is much more rare that I cut myself with these blades than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great blades that only require the lightest touch.</li>
            <li> I use a Merkur double bladed razor, which with its heft makes a great combination with the Feather  blade.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of  sampler packs over time (great way to try a bunch of different blades) and then found my way to these.  </li>
            <li> These do cost more..but shave your face smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also hooked three friends onto DE shaving and all four of us have reached the consensus that these blades are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I went to this style once the I saw the price of fusions cost more than they were worth.  </li>
            <li> I started wtih Merkur blades for my razor but the shaveing wasn&#x27;t that comfortable.  </li>
            <li> If you have a light touch</li>
            <li> I have tried the cheap blades, 12 for 2 bucks, the murker blade that came with my razor, and the wilkinson swords.</li>
            <li> I cannot say they are better than other blades, but they sure are good blades.</li>
            <li> Very close, no nicks, no cuts, just a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> While in relation to other DE blades feathers are indeed costlier, in relation to Cartridges, they are incredibly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Clean smooth shave, every time.</li>
            <li> , They were pretty good, much sharper than the Derby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about how good these blades were, but put off trying them since they cost more than the Sharks I normally use -- which give me perfectly decent shaves.  </li>

            <li> I get more use out of one of these blades than I do out of three our four of the mach 3 or higher stuff.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I cant tell to much of a difference, the shave feels the same, albeit good.</li>
            <li> I first switched to safety razors, I wasn&#x27;t convinced that there was a significant difference between blades, but these provide a significantly better shave than the Merkurs I started with.</li>
            <li> the blades are very sharp and do a very good job.</li>
            <li> My very first month of DE shaving was with Feather blades, and my face survived just fine.</li>
            <li> And having them come in little plastic boxes is a great convenience as your used blade slides into a slot and are safely stored in the box.</li>
            <li> Recommend for experienced shavers as these are ultra sharp and will cut you easily.</li>
            <li> If I am taking the time to whip up a great lather with a nice badger brush and do all the prep stuff required, why ruin the experience with a dull blade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.</li>
            <li> people say this blade, while extremely sharp, is not as smooth as some others and doesn&#x27;t provide as many good shaves as it might.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cheap.  </li>
            <li> Utilizing almost zero pressure with the EJ and letting the weight do the work, the Feathers cleanly slice the whiskers....</li>
            <li> If you want to be clean as a whistle, whether your face, head or both, then buy these blades.  </li>
            <li> The quality is clearly there, the price is great, and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I then switched to Feather based upon many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man</li>
            <li> Very close shave and very smooth.  </li>
            <li> have tried most of the other major brands and find that these lades work the best for my face and razor.</li>
            <li> Even though the slant bar is a very aggressive razor, the blade and handle seemed to be matched to each other perfectly.  </li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t use the blade too many times I get a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li> My original order was lost, and after I contacted them, they quickly sent out replacement blades.</li>
            <li> My face feels great, minimal to no burn</li>
            <li> I switched to my Gillette Red Tip which seemed to be more suitable for this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very aggressive at all, even with these Feather blades, but give a great shave.</li>
            <li> Just joking, these work great, you just have to be slower and careful with them.</li>
            <li> However, I stocked up on Feathers because they&#x27;re the best for shaving thick scruffy 2+ day growth.</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s cheaper than using the cartridges that only give me about 3 good shaves.  </li>
            <li> The Feather brand also includes a razor bank (place to put used ones) which is cool cause some of the cheaper brands do not provide this, making me wonder what they&#x27;d expect us to do with a used razor.</li>
            <li> I love these blades, thanks again</li>
            <li> also love not spending tons of $ on blades from Shick with 17 blades that don&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I just couldnt&#x27; get the hang of using a safety razor, but the big difference is using really good  blades.  </li>
            <li> trains good technique, low pressure use, etc.</li>
            <li> Still much cheaper than cartridge shaving, and once you get the hang of it, much better of a shave.</li>
            <li> Close, clean, quick, and bump-free.</li>
            <li> shave is only as good as your prep.</li>
            <li> I was ignorant enough to think the Dorco&#x27;s I bought were superior blades for my face because they didn&#x27;t nick me.</li>
            <li> All the promises made by Charles Roberts have come true for me.  </li>
            <li> ; on a good portion of my pate (my head NOT my brain) I have chosen to scrap off the remaining follicles as close to the scalp as possible.</li>
            <li> Just tried my first Feather blade, and it is FAR superior to the others.  </li>
            <li> I get about 10-12 very good shaves per blade and, with the low cost, my Scottish background does not object to going to a new blade at that point.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s damned smooth if I remember correctly:)&lt;br /&gt;Really, better product, better result, cost less, better for the environment...</li>
            <li> The flip side of that is ... if you are brand new to DE shaving or have not yet been able to achieve a smooth, nick-free and super-close shave, then beware.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but am willing to bet that these are pretty awesome in comparison to other well reviewed blades.</li>
            <li> read a lot of reviews that said how great and sharp the Feather blades are, so I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li> These razors are great and sharp.</li>
            <li> As far as double-edged razor blades go, they aren&#x27;t cheap, but they are tons cheaper than new razor cartridges and will give you a better shave when coupled with a good razor in a steady hand.</li>
            <li> you wish to quickly become a shaving master, let the Feather be your teacher.</li>
            <li> No plastic to throw away, no razor to replace every 2 - 4 years (I still have my 1971 Gillette Super Speed, 1967 Schick Krona</li>
            <li> suggest anyone starting to use a DE razor do the same to get the best, most comfortable shave for their type of beard and sensitive face.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are super sharp--some of the sharpest you can buy.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mild shave.</li>
            <li> They always some quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I guess I was just used to getting mild irritation from using a multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li> However, I quickly, within two months, moved to the Feather; and have kept using them.</li>
            <li> Some say that they are too sharp, but for me they are perfect as they easily glide through my coarse beard.</li>
            <li> They have lasted a good long time.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp, and even as an experienced user, I cut myself from time to time.</li>
            <li> These blades are not forgiving to a new DE user, but I love them.</li>
            <li> I have not been using the double edge safety razor long but am very happy with the switch.</li>
            <li> quality construction, excellent edge, long lasting.  </li>
            <li> you first try one be sure to look very closely in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I have only shaved once but these blades are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I honestly wish they were a bit duller out of the box, but I won&#x27;t fault the company for producing the sharpest edge possible which is why I decided it was worthy of a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Buy these blades for the best single edge shave possible..  </li>
            <li> Looking for fine blades at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> He really gets a smooth, close shave using these.</li>
            <li> You may not yet be ready for the Mighty Feather.  </li>
            <li> Past seven years i was using Merkur Rost free platinum coated blades, but went for a change and was pretty happy.  </li>
            <li> (where you rarely nick yourself).  </li>
            <li> Razors are a very personal preference that being said if you like feathers then these will be a great deal pricewise, but they are coming from far away</li>
            <li> For now, the Personna wins over the Feather.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy d/e shaving this is definitely one of the top shaving blades you should use.</li>
            <li> Worth getting</li>
            <li> Sharpest blade in town, worth the price and wait from Asia.</li>
            <li> My favorite razors to use by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using these blades in Feather&#x27;s own second generation</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this razor blade most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Compared to the price of cartridge razors, definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I started using an old school Gillette razor and wasn&#x27;t sure what blade brand to use.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth learning how to use these blades.</li>
            <li> The cost savings alone was worth the price of the razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, my own personal experience.</li>
            <li> Pretty new to DE shaving and need to try more brands,</li>
            <li> The Feather provided a noticeably better and closer shave than all of the other brands in the variety pack, and slightly better than the Personna I had been using.</li>
            <li> Yes, these blades are really sharp, but used with care and patience they will reward you with an amazingly close comfortable shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> They are still superior to the other blades that I have tried.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and were fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are just superior to all the other blades I have tried.</li>
            <li> Best blades hands down and worth the extra cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> No nicks, and they just glide right over my skin.  </li>
            <li> It just went right through the hair.</li>
            <li> Also, you are steaming your face with a towel before you shave, and then using a pre-shave oil, shaving soap and a brush, right?  </li>
            <li> in fact im going to go shave right now</li>
            <li> right out</li>
            <li> I used to see a cupboard full of sample packs, eventually, feathers plus the occasional bargain blade when the price was appealing.</li>
            <li> I can say that if you want an easy DE shave experience, and have tough skin, these Feathers are a great buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I could probably wash with a more mild facial soap...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them a whole lot since I only need to shave once every couple weeks, but so far these blades are great.  </li>
            <li> After many years of shaving with the newest types of multi blade razors that most everyone has been using, I decided to go back to old fashioned DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I now have a Gillette Slim adjustable razor, and with the razor dialed back a little the Feathers are just perfect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them with a Weishi 9306CL and get a nice smooth shave with little irritation every time.</li>
            <li> Other blades seem to glide more easily than the Feather DE blades.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades and a good value.</li>
            <li> Using these blades lets me whack right through the brush without having to trim with an electric razor first.</li>
            <li> Excellent  very sharp, edge will stay for quite a few shaves,  great package too covered for blades for 6 months,  careful if beginner</li>
            <li> I lost a little bit of confidence that day, even running into my old high school sweetheart at the wedding and beautiful bridal party that I defiantly had a chance with it, because my face wasnt as smooth as it wouldve been with the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> This is my first time with a double edge edge razor and so far so good</li>
            <li> However, Feather has a solid reputation amongst wet-shavers for being just right for many.</li>
            <li> Use the proper stroke method, with a natural lather, and youve got an irritation free, bump free, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> a Double Edge Razor one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do most of the work.</li>
            <li> but I do not feel the need to change the blade more often than every second week or so.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, some of the reviewers who discuss the price of the blade will often brag how they can get another brand blade to last 3 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li> First of all let me say that I have shaved with Derby&#x27;s, Merkur, Gillettes and Shark DE blades</li>
            <li> Make sure to not apply pressure, this is not necessary let the blade do all the work for you.</li>
            <li> The boxes also have a neat razor blade disposal - though many other do so this isn&#x27;t a unique feature.</li>
            <li> slowly, expect to toss a blade after three to four shaves and be happy.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are most likely the sharpest de blades you can buy, period.</li>
            <li> cut my self the first time</li>
            <li> (Most of the time, I replace a blade after every 3rd shave.)</li>
            <li> me, I&#x27;m still on my first order.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought a safety razor, I had heard that it could produce a closer shave, and for a cheaper price than a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> With these my cost is about $5.00 a month, and they give me a better shave than anything else I have used since I started shaving regular in 1963.</li>
            <li> You could possibly get more than a week out of them, but changing every week has become my habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently sporting a seasonally appropriate beard, but during the summer, these are the blades I gravitated towards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a better idea to start with a standard brand and wait to move to Feather once your face has adjusted to this type of shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall: After trying BIC, Derby, and Personna DE blades these have become my favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice Wet</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> I have also been \\&quot;corking\\&quot; my blades before first use.</li>
            <li> will probly go back to the Dorco blades till I get more</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if there was a blade that worked better on my face and beard than the brand I was currently using (Personna).</li>
            <li> I first came on the DE scene about a year ago.</li>
            <li> This blade butchered me the first time, and the shave wasn&#x27;t as close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I tried these blades the first time and reviewed them, I&#x27;ve lost 45 lbs.</li>
            <li> These were the first I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I have nothing to compare them too.</li>
            <li> My face and neck bleed a lot when I first started using these</li>
            <li> 2/13/08:  As my prep has improved, I have discovered that the Feather is even better than my initial comments indicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to first shaves with some blades</li>
            <li> Since writing this review I have been able to use the French Gillette Bleue blades, which a friend obtains for me whenever she is in France.  </li>
            <li> Since writing this review I have been able to use the French Gillette Bleue blades, which a friend obtains for me whenever she is in France.  </li>
            <li> Far sharper than the Shark blades also available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> first off I never even got the chance to see the product tracking said deliver date 1 month after I placed order then got a message that they attempted the delivery</li>
            <li> I am a prime member and this is the first time this has happened to me I have been a prime member for 3 years.</li>
            <li> Spend that extra blade money on the shave cream frontier or a book on Esperanto or something :)</li>
            <li> Once I return to Double Edged blade shaving, I love the cost effectiveness and closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more blades from feather when I need replacements.</li>
            <li> Today marked my 7th shave with my first blade (2 passes a day for 7 days), and my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> these are NOT for the first time user...</li>
            <li> These were the first blades I ever tried when I got into DE.</li>
            <li> First time I used them, I thought...</li>
            <li> I have to admit my first shave</li>
            <li> I would buy more and will now only use Feather.</li>
            <li> Only ones better than these are the Feather Platinums</li>
            <li> It does take a little more time and patience, but once you get the hang of it, quite easy.  </li>
            <li> Just because these Feather blades worked great for me doesn&#x27;t mean they will for you.</li>
            <li> If you really want to do it right, put the end of the razor in rubbing alcohol to store it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll have to use a deft hand, however, because being this sharp means you can also cut yourself even easier.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick as many of the other blades were shipped from overseas and these were in stock in the US.</li>
            <li> And in no time you will be shaving as fast as before only deeper and more</li>
            <li> The learning curve with these lovely Japanese blades is, fortunately, very steep.  </li>
            <li> I spent hundreds of dollars in my young life on Mach 3 blades and got a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most reviewers on here, I don&#x27;t think the Feather blades are really any sharper than your standard</li>
            <li> After trying numerous brands, I found the feather blades to work best with the least, if any, razor burn.  </li>
            <li> The Feather blades also last much longer for me, a week or more.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting out with Straight Razors or Safety Razors then you would benefit from changing out blades more often.</li>
            <li> I also found that those razors with multiple blades actually don&#x27;t do any good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely not a negative review on the blades as they are fantastic, but simply worth noting that you will probably want to try a few different blades before settling on your favorite as \\&quot;sharpest\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean \\&quot;the best for your face\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Positive reviews led me to try the Feather.    </li>
            <li> these razors are amazing, they stay sharp for a bout 2 weeks and they individually rapped &amp; dispense easily.</li>
            <li> If you investigate the reviews for different types of blades, I think the general message is usually a very good approximation to the truth: this particular blade is no different.</li>
            <li> That first shave sounds like you have a straight edge gliding across your face.  </li>
            <li> I used to shave with Merkurs, but those dulled way too fast and the blade quality wasn&#x27;t consistent.  </li>
            <li> After trying each of the brands included in a sampler pack of blades I purchased, the Feathers come in on top by a long way.</li>
            <li> With the price to value ratio, they&#x27;re pretty much a no brainer.</li>
            <li> These work great for me, and are sharp enough to do the job with no pulling or scraping.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: my whiskers are pretty think, so if you have thin/fine whiskers it may be too much.  </li>
            <li> 2nd best blade I&#x27;ve tried, but still a distant 2nd.  </li>
            <li> I shaved with it, every week only once is enough for me,,, my wife comes around touching all over the face and asking HOW do you shave that smoothly :</li>
            <li> Anyways, probably I won&#x27;t change from this brand for some long time, or when a better alternative comes.</li>
            <li> Mostly, it saves me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a full box of 5 blades, so far, and I like the way they feel and the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good, but not significantly better than the Sharks (also ordered from Amazon).  </li>
            <li> I decided to go for the full monty despite people telling me to tread softly.</li>
            <li> So far I have found this to not be true for me.  </li>
            <li> But, these things a sharp and did a good job of getting rid of my week old growth.</li>
            <li> I grant that the last few shaves were not as smooth and comfortable as the first several, BUT there were no nicks or cuts, and virtually all the shaves were superior</li>
            <li> the blades are so good, that by the 2nd round, you can stroke against the grain, and really get that micro stubble, and still irritation free.</li>
            <li> they are kind to my skin and are very sharp without causing nicks.</li>
            <li> Very efficient and last a decent amount of time (4 to 5 shaves WTG and ATG, probably more if you just went WTG).</li>
            <li> but I have super sensitive</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have an adjustment curve (especially when one comes from those supermarket multi-bladed contraptions) and it will require both a good shaving soap such as the [[ASIN:B000Q33CRE Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Sienna]] and a top Double Blade safety razor such as the [[ASIN:B004LDCJV0 Feather]]; however, the end result is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Any other blade could never give me a clean irritation free shave on my neck.</li>
            <li> These have become my favorite blades for over a year now after trying a variety of different brands, which I recommend anyone new to safety razors to do.</li>
            <li> A new razor will cut you and he couldn&#x27;t have been more correct especially with these blades.</li>
            <li> I got about seven good shaves out of one blade by simply patting it dry.</li>
            <li> Now, these might not be the right blades for a new DE shaver to start off with.</li>
            <li> favorite blades, sharp and crisp</li>
            <li> Personally, I think they&#x27;re fine</li>
            <li> The Merkur blades are nice and sharp and so are these, but somehow just a tad sharper because I was not paying attention and just going through the motions as per normal and some skin was exfoliated without me even noticing.  </li>
            <li> They are extremly sharp and long lasting and work wonderfully with my Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of single blade razors and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The first brand I tried was Bic and they were good as starter blades, but seemed to be not sharp enough for me at times, especially around the tougher areas of my face.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have much of a nicking problem.  </li>
            <li> Also using this razor to break into eventually using a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Sounds crazy I know, but it does the best job, period.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s prime and ready to be tossed.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> blood!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told that all DE blades are not created equal - some are sharper than others, and some beards do not require the sharpest blade available.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why people care about this blade so much.</li>
            <li> I use it in my straight razor.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for beginners, but if you are a wet-shaving veteran and you want a close, smooth shave, buy these blades.</li>
            <li> These were for my son, he says they are much nicer in his skin than the shark blades .</li>
            <li> I know the whole ritual surrounding shaving with a safety razor (I have two Merkurs)</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference in the Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so much so that you can hear them give way to the edge.</li>
            <li> It really does make all the difference.</li>
            <li> My face is much thinner now, and since I kept the Feather blades, I tried them out again with a thinner face.</li>
            <li> They work very well. s</li>
            <li> They really are a lot sharper and give me a much easier shave.</li>
            <li> or too much pressure</li>
            <li> Since going to a DE razor and feather blades, I&#x27;ve noticed that they really minimize irritation/burn.  </li>
            <li> The Feather Portable is a lot more aggressive than the 38C, so my first shave with a Feather/Feather combination was not nearly as good or comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Really digging the results now, tho... hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I use it with Parker SR1 stainless steel and it is a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks like I am sharing too much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Feather can make a blade that&#x27;s so much sharper than all the modern razor blades but believe me, they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a much closer shave than the derby blades I was using before.</li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t get a much closer shave over the Derby blades.</li>
            <li> How much difference can there be between blades?  </li>
            <li> They work real well.</li>
            <li> DE shavers, as in those who take this up as a hobby, are very knowledgeable about this type of thing (hence the consistency of the reviews,) and we should expect this, as these people tempt lady fortune and &#x27;study&#x27; the blades for around 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> Be gentle with them if your switching from a blade with a duller edge.</li>
            <li> So after 4 shaves and 1 blade I tried Wilkinson&#x27;s which were easily available at my local pharmacy</li>
            <li> Capable of the finest shaves out there.</li>
            <li> And who really knows if this is a copy or the real thing.</li>
            <li> and thought I would try the Feathers as everything I read indicates these were very</li>
            <li> They are a really treat to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No tracking, no way to know if they really are legit.</li>
            <li> But I finally gave them a shot, and WOW -- love em.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying more of the Feather&#x27;s as they really do give me a much closer shave with no pulling and minimal nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> knowing this made me much more careful and forced me to use good shaving techniques.  </li>
            <li> As a regular DE shaver, I watched the inside my bathroom cabinet&#x27;s contents evolve as I developed a better idea of what I wanted out of a shave.</li>
            <li> Sharp as can be and  VERY comfortable.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and very smooth</li>
            <li> The package also has a little opening to slide the used razors into, very nice extra feature.</li>
            <li> These are extremely sharp and provide a very smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li> If you are a seasoned safety razor shaver and want to feel a whole new level of smoothness, then these are for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Derby and Astra (the other two most popular brands for double-edged razors) and the sharpness that is standard on Feathers is leaps and bounds above the competition.</li>
            <li> After hearing how sharp Feathers are and wondering if the horror stories were true, I finally built up the nerve to order a small sample of these legendary blades.</li>
            <li> even against the grain on my second pass it was incredibly gentle and clean</li>
            <li> The seem thinner and more flexible than any other of the blades I used</li>
            <li> You can find many reviews warning that they are so sharp that if you don&#x27;t respect them then you will shred your face.  </li>
            <li> I felt no pulling, and more hair was removed in one stoke than other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I listened to other reviews and got these and can&#x27;t imagine others being much better.  </li>
            <li> You can probably find some other blades for cheaper depending on how many you buy at a time.</li>
            <li> I like these better than the handful of other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They are just as sharp as most people claim.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that going with the grain, this misses a lot more then other blades.</li>
            <li> Not only do you get a close shave with no drag on the skin but the blades are good for several shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other blade brands, but this is my keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The steel is extremely high quality Japanese stainless, which allows the blade to be significantly thinner than lower quality blades.</li>
            <li> At this point since finding the FEATHER blades, I don&#x27;t particularly care if I ever graduate to the straight razor.    </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really sharp, and give a close shave with an experienced hand&lt;br /&gt;+ Since they are sharp, they don&#x27;t cause irritation during a shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can barely feel Feather blades cut the same swath much more closely.</li>
            <li> the negatives made me hesitate for a bit before trying them, it was actually the overwhelming number of positive reviews that finally got me to make the attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for anyone&lt;br /&gt;who wants a close shave.</li>
            <li> A great lesson for me since it forced me to be much more careful and pay attention to my technique and my second shave was one of</li>
            <li> He highly recommends the Feather stainless blades and so do I.  </li>
            <li> Very very sharp and will cut you if you&#x27;re inexperienced, but once you learn what you&#x27;re doing, it makes a great shave and glides through all hair like it wasn&#x27;t even there.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sharp out of the box, and it leaves a very smooth impression.</li>
            <li> So far all I have read on both the Merkur and the FEATHER have been consistent, for me.      </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had the first cut or weeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Edwin Jagger came with Derby blades, so naturally those were the first I used.</li>
            <li> When the individual blade is a good one, I can get nice close shaves without cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I get a better shave using these blades than anything else i have used hands down.</li>
            <li> It shaves very well leaving little to no \\&quot;wounds\\&quot; like previously experienced with other razor blades.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use them if you are new to safety razors!  </li>
            <li> and I am able to get a few more shaves than other blades I have tried.</li>
            <li> Once that&#x27;s done, they shave great and are more than scary sharp -- think surgical.</li>
            <li> It is both flexible and able to keep a very sharp edge.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these still shave my face amazingly well and smooth.</li>
            <li> these blades are still less than 60cents in most places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess I get half as many shaves.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a traditional Double Edge safety razor is an art neglected by most.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the same price as the same number of Merkurs and these are much better blades.</li>
            <li> Shaving doesn&#x27;t get easier as you get older, and for me it became a choice between an itchy beard or finding something to shave with than</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that the shave is much better, I&#x27;ll keep the star rating the same for the following reasons</li>
            <li> So, even though I don&#x27;t particularly like these Feather blades</li>
            <li> (5) Repeat lather and shave for second pass (mostly with the grain, some days its against the grain on the second pass).</li>
            <li> I have tried many blades and these were the only ones that could maintain sharpness during an entire shaving.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more as needed, but I expect these 30 will last me quite some time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of razors and think ive settled on feather brand razors as my favorite.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t recommend them to novice users because of their sharpness which could cut and nick your face quite easily if you are not careful, for novice users, try the merkurs or the wilkinson swords first, and then when comfortable with them, go ahead and try the Feather&#x27;s, you won&#x27;t go back to any other brand!</li>
            <li> /&gt;there is no drag, gripping, or uncomfortable catching from a feather blade.  </li>
            <li> I snap them in half and use them in a cheap disposable-blade straight razor (also from Amazon!).</li>
            <li> I think that they&#x27;ve just gone down in popularity since the double edge was introduced, but the shave with a safety razor is far superior.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend both the blade and the seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the blades, just look at the shipping options.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these, and do not be scared off by some people saying that these will butcher your face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The price is also a bargain - highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these and will be buying them again..</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend these blades to all you guys thinking about trying this type of shaving.</li>
            <li> I recommend them highly.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Feather blades then I would highly recommend you do.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> then decided to splurge on these as the reviews are high and everyone claims they&#x27;re godsend.</li>
            <li> After checking  yellow or black same great razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp and last for about two weeks for me.</li>
            <li> the little boxes are nifty and provide a safe place to stick the used blades when disposing of them vs tossing in the garbage</li>
            <li> I seem to get a more comfortable shave with these blades on the second or third day when they aren&#x27;t quite so sharp.  </li>
            <li> They give you a fantastic shave when used carefully.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra buck or two.</li>
            <li> had forgotten that I had a few more Feathers in my sample pack and decided to try again with the blade in my Merkur Slant Bar.  </li>
            <li> no going over the same spot a dozen times and not &#x27;cutting it&#x27; like my cartridge razor days.</li>
            <li> So I treat myself with a fresh blade on a semi daily basis.</li>
            <li> I get multiple uses from each one, and each shave is soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> They are definitely worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t really aren&#x27;t that much more expensive and they are still cheap compared to the Gillete Mach 5 or whatever they are up to these days.  </li>
            <li> Shaving has become fun, and I actually look forward to shaving every day.</li>
            <li> Good but not great.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly Gillette 7&#x27;O&#x27;clocks and Bics were close behind; cheapies.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them, but not for new users of manual razors.</li>
            <li> They also last, I can easily use a blade 5 or 6 times, if I shaved daily</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re like me and got a coarse beard, these go right through it.</li>
            <li> These razors glide right through with no problem, and I get several uses out of each blade.  </li>
            <li> I have read many of the reviews on these blades both positive and negative,</li>
            <li> As for the commentary about them being too sharp, I find them to be great and had to use no more caution than I did with inferior brands.</li>
            <li> Now to these razor blades, I first learned using the &amp;#34;Stainless Steel Platinum Coated Double Edge Safety Razor Blades A.K.A Israeli Personnas.&amp;#34; They weren&#x27;t super sharp, but they gave me a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> For my pretty tough beard, these work quite a bit better and aren&#x27;t so prone to nicks &amp;#62; &amp;#62; &amp;#62; Crystal &amp;#34;SUPER +&amp;#34; Stainless Steel Platinum</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;touch\\&quot; now is extremely light with no pressure exerted other than that which the razor&#x27;s weight against the skin exerts.</li>
            <li> These blades are so sharp and cut so smoothly</li>
            <li> Those blades are sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Also very reasonably priced especially compared to normal cartridge blade.</li>
            <li> My new blade of choice.</li>
            <li> These razor blades really do live up to their reputation.</li>
            <li> Popping in a new Feather into your safety razor is like a treat.  </li>
            <li> Feather blades live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Got these as replacements for a new handle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every Monday I start a new blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the safety razor scene.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new at DE shaving.</li>
            <li> as a new shaver i went shark and no nono</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new user of these type of razors and I have not cut myself</li>
            <li> I purchased a new Merkur Futur and a variety sample pack of blades.</li>
            <li> I do caution new DE shavers though...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t miss the new razors of today at all.  </li>
            <li> Light rinse to feel where I need to give extra attention, re-lather, adjust to #1.5 and give a final against the grain pass.      </li>
            <li> The second time, I was a bit more careful.</li>
            <li> Good blades, can get over ten shaves out of a blade if I don&#x27;t let my beard get to thick between shaves.</li>
            <li> Like I said earlier, I love these blades and get a great close shave (I usually shave every 2-3 days and these blades handle my tough beard</li>
            <li> However, after my first couple of shaves with them, I noticed little difference between them and the Super Shark Chrome blades, yet they cost more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are really sharp, but the first shave is not as smooth as the 2nd+ shave with them for some reason.</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin that is prone to razor burn and cuts, but these razors don&#x27;t leave my face and neck looking like I rubbed sandpaper on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using these razors and have compared them to several other brands and have used them in the Feather Razor with the plastic handle, a 1972 Schick Krona, 1949 Gillette Super Speed and a Wilkinson Sword D/E and can honestly say there is no better D/E razor blade on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 59 and started shaving with a D/E razor and blades, after a five year stint using the &#x27;modern cartridge razor&#x27;</li>
            <li> As someone who only a year ago switched to wet shaving, I&#x27;m glad to have found these early.</li>
            <li> I do either a 2 - or - three way shave depending on if I shave every day and end up with a face like an 18 year old girls butt!</li>
            <li> I have been using Merkurs for the last two years, and was interested in seeing what else was out there.  </li>
            <li> I had read up and knew the warnings about Feather blades being mercilessly sharp and to be sure if you are a newbie (me), develop your technique and above all, respect these blades!</li>
            <li> My method for the best shave: (1) steam my face over a skillet of boiling water for 5 min (easier than a hot towel, and seems to do the trick, BIG improvement over just lathering up).</li>
            <li> have a pretty coarse beard, so</li>
            <li> As long as I am aware of how sharp these are things are fine -</li>
            <li> Yes, they are sharp, a little aggressive, and most certainly worth the dough for a 30ct.</li>
            <li> They last me about 5 comfortable shaves and cut me a lot less than most other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li> Just remember that Feathers are super sharp, take your time shaving, and enjoy how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> you have a lot of experience with traditional shaving and you want to experience a real high performance blade, the Feathers are for you.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp so they produce a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> With a lot of growth, the blade dulls faster, so shaving off your beard can take down a razor in less than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from some inconveniences from a travel perspective, Feather Double Edged Razor Blades are almost perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty tough beard and sensitive skin and these blades have helped me get a better shave.  </li>
            <li> every couple of shaves just to treat myself but figure I could get four or five days worth out of a single blade.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, but after many shaves later I have yet to cut my skin with these blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t last as long, but at the overall shave experience is better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last longer and stay comfortable longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to dry the blades after every shave and have not had any rusting issues,  even the blades in my can of used blades don&#x27;t show rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only caveat is that I would not recommend these for a (very) new shaver; even though these are not &#x27;more unsafe,&#x27; as a product, they will magnify the mistakes you are sure to make as a new shaver, and potentially scare you away from what should be a cost-saving, relaxing, and nostalgic experience your grandpa would have been proud you&#x27;re taking an interest in.</li>
            <li> Commercial shaving creams like Edge and Barbasol dry out too fast causing more drag along the face.</li>
            <li> After the third shave, they start to have a little &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;, which is OK for me because that level of dullness is where the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; is for me when shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feather razor blades have a reputation for being super sharp.  </li>
            <li> He said they are super SHARP.</li>
            <li> Because of that, they can have a super sharp edge.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super sharp and maintain their sharpness well.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp as other reviews have stated, so you really need to make sure your blade angle is spot on and you&#x27;re not applying any pressure.</li>
            <li> Feather saves me time in the number of passes, it is absolutely not as expensive as others when you consider how frequently it dulls (re: blade longevity,) and the death of a feather blade is very gradual, allowing me to adapt my shaving accordingly without any major mishap or hiccup along the way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but in a nutshell, a single-blade razor offers a smoother shave, with a better feel, than a cartridge blade shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you clean and dry off your blades (same as with disposable cartridge razors)</li>
            <li> By far.</li>
            <li> I completely concur and will be buying these from now on.</li>

            <li> Do at least a two pass shave, 1st with the grain, (rinse, apply more cream) then against the grain if you want an even closer shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(using these with an old Gillette slim adjustable.)</li>
            <li> (now this only leads me to imagine the shave I can achieve with a straight razor...)</li>
            <li> they will last much longer.</li>
            <li> A far cry from the old blades</li>
            <li> The second shave and on is when these blades really shine.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used a couple dozen of these.</li>
            <li> I suggest the Old Post Road Oil company brand...</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a dated reference to lead with, but you gotta go old school if you use a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I know safety razors came out post-Twain, but I gotta give the old guy credit.</li>
            <li> but I have somewhat sensitive skin (</li>
            <li> Old razor burn from (what I guess)</li>
            <li> My facial hair has become much darker and thicker since then.</li>
            <li> but i thought i was ready being a derby extra blade</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at the sharpness.</li>
            <li> And the 5-blade package is really convenient for traveling with extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I use them in an Edwin Jagger DE89L and have no problems at all as far as being &amp;</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t think its necessary.</li>
            <li> We all know the feather brand is by far the sharpest blade around.</li>
            <li> This is written by a man btw on a female account haha</li>
            <li> Ordered them from a company whose fulfillment was done by Amazon, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait the weeks that some who order the blades wait, they arrived in 5 days along with the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving crème, and I brush and razor stand</li>
            <li> I have had a shaving revelation thanks to these blades and will never go back to the overpriced, razor burn inducing, multi-blade razors that I had been using.</li>
            <li> If these were substantially more expensive, I&#x27;d say they aren&#x27;t worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Context: I&#x27;m 20 years old, with a light beard that must be shaven every few days for my job</li>
            <li> thought all blades where the same was proven wrong with these blades super high quality and you will have an enjoyable shave</li>
            <li> So, the moral of the story is, if you have a proper technique, and, by this I mean a consistent blade angle of attack and a consistent light touch (letting the blade and razor do the work)</li>
            <li> but then I also found several other brands like Astra to be fine.</li>
            <li> While there are plenty of double edge (DE) blades I have yet to try, I have been able to try several other blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old black silver tipped super speed gillette just works wonders with these blades.</li>
            <li> I can frequently get up to two weeks out of each blade, if not a bit more, before it becomes too irritating under normal conditions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had a few cuts during the first few shaves, but was soon able to have the smoothest shave ever with just two passes.</li>
            <li> Glad i bought them, they do the job, they&#x27;re sharp, and stay sharp for about 3 uses each blade.</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is making such a big deal about the \\&quot;danger\\&quot; of these blades.</li>
            <li> My hubby uses this brand religiously for shaving and has had only stellar experiences with it.</li>
            <li> These blades last many times as long as the swords, and are so sharp that it feels like the razor has the texture of an ice-cube as it goes across your face.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend him and not hesitate to use his company in the future.</li>
            <li> If you use or want to use a DE razor, I would highly suggest to ONLY use Feather blades.</li>
            <li> I like these razors, although I don&#x27;t like them any better than the Personnas and they&#x27;re a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> I want, probably, most of what you do: less time spent, longevity of the blade, cost-effectiveness, consistency, and safety.</li>
            <li> So after a long weekend, I reach for a Feather, and pay very close attention to what I&#x27;m doing with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a long time straight edge shaver and safety blade user: There are two ways to cut yourself shaving.</li>
            <li> No more razor burn or irritation and a baby smooth face.</li>
            <li> I had just made the switch to wet shaving and my first shaves with the Derbys</li>
            <li> I almost like the less sharp brands better just because I&#x27;m waking up</li>
            <li> So if you find the shave unbearable try again later with a new blade and see if it is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still somewhat new to double edge shaving, and I had heard that Feather is an &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Feather New Hi-Stainless is currently my preferred, \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; blade.  </li>
            <li> I finally regained my common sense and returned to what works so much better.</li>
            <li> They last a long time, the quality is consistent and they are some of the sharpest blades around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made the right decision early to buy a sampler pack of different blades because I will say different blades work differently for different people.</li>
            <li> The blades are extremely sharp and NOT for someone trying a safety razor for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that I was hesitant to try these at first because of their reputation for being so sharp.</li>
            <li> He kicked major ass.</li>
            <li> SHARP and ready to go!</li>
            <li> I cannot feel the blade pulling at my whiskers, unlike every other blade, so at first I thought I needed to adjust my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would wait however (if you are new to DE shaving) until you have practiced with a few others first</li>
            <li> When I shaved with them for the first time, I wasn&#x27;t being very careful</li>
            <li> B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor</li>
            <li> Sharp enough to cut through 4 or 5 days worth of beard growth.</li>
            <li> Let me tell ya, if I cracked a book on a foreign language as often as I shaved, I&#x27;d be able to tell you by now to buy these things in a whole mess of languages; but, since the human condition forces me to deal with facial hair, I&#x27;m going to have to use English</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend them to my brother (with a caveat that he needs to be careful), so I&#x27;d certainly recommend them to you.</li>
            <li> you press the blade hard against your whiskers or lightly?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know WHAT technical mistakes someone is making that led them to &amp;#34;bleed everywhere&amp;#34;, but you can&#x27;t complain about a razor being too sharp if you are not doing it right.</li>
            <li> If you want to try different blades I highly recommend buying one of the variety packs that provide you with a multitude of different brand blades.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ready for them but wound up cutting myself up pretty badly--about six or seven good nicks at least and</li>
            <li> provide a very close shave, but I am not sure that I am ready for them yet.</li>
            <li> and you really must be careful.  </li>
            <li> also feel it is necessary to say that many of the negative reviews address different issues</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and can only shave once to twice per week.  </li>
            <li> So far Feathers are the sharpest double edged safety blades I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> But you need to be careful since it doesn&#x27;t take too much pressure to give yourself a gash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then Feather blades are the ultimate as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> I recently started shaving with DE blades and have only tried two different brands, so I don&#x27;t have much for comparison.</li>
            <li> These arrived much quicker that I expected.  </li>
            <li> I was washing washing my face with regular bar soap twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, and my skin was really drying out and making it difficult to make more than one pass a day.</li>
            <li> : this is your likely destination as far as blade is concerned.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these approximately 8-10 times each, which is astounding considering his coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> blade was more irritating than the Personna and that may be because I&#x27;m so used to the Personna.  </li>
            <li> Honestly; you can&#x27;t go wrong with Feather products.</li>
            <li> like kitchen knives, if you have a thinner knife, you can get a sharper edge, but because the edge is so thin, it will need to be sharpened more often.  </li>
            <li> and I found that the Sharks are a bit of false economy as these are a better value.</li>
            <li> If you are careful and treat them with the same respect as any other blade, then you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Consistent quality and very sharp.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close and leaves your face baby smooth but go slow and be very very careful.</li>
            <li> Well, it would be except they don&#x27;t seem to give the same quality of shave as my old double edge razor blades.  </li>
            <li> In my mind, the simple fact of lathering (shave creams are basically mild soaps with hair softeners and lubricants) and shaving should be enough to cleanse and remove any dead skin.</li>
            <li> My beard is coarse and thick and multi-directional, so I need to do a 2-3 pass shave against the grain to get that smooth finish.</li>
            <li> He does not have a thick facial hail, mild to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I started my first shave with one of these loaded because I didn&#x27;t hear the blade singing as it cut.</li>
            <li> They were NOT sharp enough.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like my first shave with a new blade; it cuts through even my thick (sometimes overgrown) beard like butter.</li>
            <li> have not experienced any irritation with these, but if you are not careful and rush, it is easy to nick yourself with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are definitely sharper than the other blades I have tried, but I find that I cut myself less often with this sharper blade because of how smoothly it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a chunk of sharpened metal, same general shape, just the label is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are really leagues above any other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving with the world&#x27;s sharpest blades isn&#x27;t so fun when the one you&#x27;re using is 2 shaves past</li>
            <li> Not sure they&#x27;re worth the hassle of ordering and then waiting.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t very forgiving and probably could hurt if you don&#x27;t have your technique down.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades give very close shave.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with these when they are new.</li>
            <li> I was using mercer blades (not sure thats spelled right and don&#x27;t have them in front of me)</li>
            <li> and I usually have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow right after I shave, so</li>
            <li> Feather are simply high quality, extremely sharp razor blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Put a half of one in my straight razor and shaved.  </li>
            <li> Definitely practice your technique before trying them, because you can definitely slice yourself if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> The first few shaves is freaky, actually.  </li>
            <li> it has a pleasant scent and it&#x27;s way less expensive than your standard commercial brands.</li>
            <li> The Derbys weren&#x27;t sharp enough and required multiple passes to get a decent shave, which caused a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li> These cut very well with the grain...but go against the grain and they will make you cry like a little girly</li>
            <li> They really tore up my face with little nicks, and I am by no means a novice safety razor shaver.</li>
            <li> No cuts, but a little burn (something I did not experience with the LORDs), and not nearly as close as the first time.</li>
            <li> What used to be a dull routine is now almost fun.</li>
            <li> However, these ones didn&#x27;t seem as sharp to me as the one that came with my razor, or the new ones I just got from a local shop</li>
            <li> This brand of razor is a little lighter than your standard double edge blade so take your time and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have a very thick, coarse beard and have recently found the pleasure and better results of DE wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, these are very sharp blades that also last for many shaves.  </li>
            <li> I am not going to get into whether or not these are the sharpest blades around that is sort of a given, nobody seems to contest that, the good and bad reviews alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin reviewing this item by saying,  </li>
            <li> At this point it is edged out by a whisker by the Gillette Stainless Platinum (aka \\&quot;Swedes\\&quot;, though they&#x27;re actually made in Poland), but the difference is not huge.  </li>
            <li> At this point it is edged out by a whisker by the Gillette Stainless Platinum (aka \\&quot;Swedes\\&quot;, though they&#x27;re actually made in Poland), but the difference is not huge.  </li>
            <li> and there you have it, here is a little tip to get the extra shave from any double edge blade, put the blade inside of a clear drinking glass against the inside and run it back and forth from left to right with your index finger a few times then flip over and do it again</li>
            <li> Very sharp for 5 shaves and each blade is consistently high quality.</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to get back into DE shaving after a 10 year or so absence and these blades are the only one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ordered since.</li>
            <li> and I immediately prefer it over our new conventional models.</li>
            <li> After using Israeli Personna blades for a few years, I wanted to try a few other brands to see if there was something out there that was better.  </li>
            <li> put one in my Gillette Fatboy and dialed it one less than my normal 7 setting...due to the sharpness of the blade.  </li>
            <li> I have extraordinarily sensitive skin on my neck, so I&#x27;m wondering if perhaps these blades are simply *too* sharp for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp and don&#x27;t pull or tug on a few days worth of growth.</li>
            <li> Other brands usually leave me full of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> The shave was close enough, not much of an improvement from what I was getting before, but the major con was the irritation and bleeding I was getting.</li>
            <li> On the other hand I find really sharp blades to be very forgiving, because they require no pressure, they will cut the hair, all you must do is guide.  </li>
            <li> I was careful the first few times I used them</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned earlier in the review, you really need to have your DE shaving technique down for any really sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to try the Feather since I&#x27;d heard so much about their sharpness and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These work very well, and each lasts me a while, since I usually use them for my head.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands in the past, but these shave smooth as without all of the irritation of other blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about the Feather brand for a long time and finally bought some.  </li>
            <li> However the blades don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the Merkur brand</li>
            <li> My dad started my brother and me on double edge long ago.</li>
            <li> These last about 3x as long as sharks</li>
            <li> No matter how long I&#x27;ve kept a blade -- it can be several weeks as I don&#x27;t shave all that often -- the blade springs</li>
            <li> but, they don&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> Razors come in a little container and are packaged well and are new.</li>
            <li> You really should have your technique down for ANY of the really sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> While I find Feather blades to be sharp, they also seem to dull rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> Many of the reviews make it seem like they are so sharp they should be illegal, and that it will take several weeks of blood and carnage until one masters them.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp, but not insanely sharp.  </li>
            <li> had been using another brand for a few years, for some reason decided to switch it up when ordering my new supply.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these blades for anyone who has the knack of wet shaving down.</li>
            <li> One has to respect the blade, and apply far less pressure than a multi-blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Consider yourself warned but stand by with toilet paper just in case.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re called feather because they are super thin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the el cheapo ones from Walmart for awhile, so using a double sided was not new to me.  </li>
            <li> I give these blades 5 stars because not only are they sharp they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about ordering these blades as they ship directly from Japan.</li>
            <li> The only other DE blades that come close are much harder to find and are more expensive.</li>
            <li> if I really push it) out of a blade before it becomes too dull to use.  </li>
            <li> For first time DE safety blade users, this is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> Shaving is effortless with these blades, as long as you don&#x27;t get too aggressive with your blade angle.      </li>
            <li> Too long.</li>
            <li> He uses the Merkur 180 long handle.</li>
            <li> Just long delivery time.</li>
            <li> If i knew it was going to take that long</li>
            <li> As a long time user of Shark blades I decided to change brands on the recommendation of others.</li>
            <li> I stopped using cartridge razors a long time ago because I felt like I was throwing money away.  </li>
            <li> As long as you are used to shaving, taking your time like you are supposed to, you will have no problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Merkur 180 Long razor&lt;br /&gt;Cheap</li>
            <li> When I first started shaving with safety razors I made a lot more &amp;#34;horizontal&amp;#34; mistakes, but I started with this blade, and I just can&#x27;t imagine the amount of force it would have taken for some of the horrifying comments that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> They also have little regard for skin irregularities so BE CAREFUL when the blades are brand new.</li>
            <li> Way less expensive and as good a shave if not better.  </li>
            <li> I personally believe that the sharper the blade &#x3D; fewer passes necessary &#x3D; less irritation</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp &amp; last long.</li>
            <li> if done incorrectly or too frequently; no matter the blade (from my limited experience).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about cutting yourself, do some research on proper shaving technique and you will be fine.  </li>
            <li> These are the only blades my skin can handle other than Merkur&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands such as Dorco and Derby,they don&#x27;t even come close to Feathers.  </li>
            <li> These things are sharp, but I seem to get nicked every time with the japanese brand.</li>
            <li> The only downside is they are a bit pricey compared to other options.</li>
            <li> I was getting irritation with the other blades I tried and that irritation went away very shortly after switching to theses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with some other brands like Merkur and still come back to Feather.</li>
            <li> A lot of people say to not go with the feathers because they are so sharp, but after switching to feathers from M&#x27;s, there is no reason to go back.  </li>
            <li> The Feathers are extremely sharp and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone that hasn&#x27;t quit figured out their technique in DE shaving yet because the blades are so sharp, you can cut yourself without knowing you cut yourself, not deep, but enough to bleed everywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are indeed sharp but also they last for 4-5 shaves before I notice a dulling of the blade.  </li>
            <li> they are all unbelievably sharp, but the feather just has a different feel on my face.</li>
            <li> I however found that they were too dull for me, I also found that DE shaving is much like riding a bike in that you never really forget how.</li>
            <li> dry taking care not to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> After each shave, I rinse with rubbing alcohol and leave them to dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing that might be a negative is if you have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> By round 2, I look ten years younger.</li>
            <li> I expected the Feathers to be lightsaber sharp, one look and all the hair flying off, or at least a dozen cuts for the first shave...  </li>
            <li> The beard hair got sliced off with little or no drag.  </li>
            <li> Becareful they are not your normal dull blades</li>
            <li> I could get out of a single Feather blade.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the Feather blades I threw caution to the wind and said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a bad ass and can straight shave like a boss.&amp;#34; About a quarter of the way through I noticed the red mist of death: tons of tiny little wounds opened all across my shaving</li>
            <li> My journey into wet shaving was not complete until I found Feather.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> you have nothing to loose</li>
            <li> I heard from various people that these blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> While the blades that came with it weren&#x27;t bad, when I received the first set of Feathers, it absolute blew my mind.  </li>
            <li> I use Astra blades (link below) for daily use because I&#x27;m clumsy and could kill myself with a Feather if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They only fulfilled half of the order.</li>
            <li> Because they last longer and are sharper they don&#x27;t require replacement as often and one&#x27;s costs end up being less.</li>
            <li> I found the Feather blades to be sharp, almost too sharp if that is possible.</li>
            <li> (3) Apply lather with my hands (less irritation than the badger hair brush allowing for a second pass).</li>
            <li> I will have to crank back my razor to a less aggressive angle of attack until the blood stops leaking out of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to tell because the razor you use also helps to determine the right blade for your face, and the properties of your beard and skin as well as the shape of your face and your level of technique all influence what is sharp enough and what is murder on your face because it&#x27;s too dull or too aggressive.</li>
            <li> The scented stuff is a little strong for my tastes, and I think it was irritating my skin a little.</li>
            <li> The razors are definitely sharp as advertised, it just took a long time to receive them once I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> After recently joining the wet shaving community a few months ago, I&#x27;m still a beginner, but not completely brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can destroy a lesser razor in a single shave sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like the little slot in the back of each set for used razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Feathers have almost eliminated little red bumps that I have always had on my neck.</li>
            <li> Life is too short not to splurge a little.</li>
            <li> I am amazed that I can get such a close shave and not even a little bit of irritation.</li>
            <li> The first shave was awful, I probably had 20 nicks, despite extensive face prep and a rich lather.</li>
            <li> Stay sharp for a long time!</li>
            <li> I wish I were as tough as my beard, and grew as fast.</li>
            <li> They did not disappoint, very close shave with fewer passes and little to no irritation, and I have a thick beard...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sharp, and hold up decently for at least three shaves.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, it was just cutting so efficiently, it didn&#x27;t make a sound or tug at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having completed a year, I switched to Feathers expecting at least as close a shave as I was getting before only with blades that would last longer.</li>
            <li> I actually think these could be sharper, but that might make them a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> #34;be careful</li>
            <li> This blade is not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> They showed up quicker than expected too.</li>
            <li> Allegedly, the sharpest blades made.</li>
            <li> so you can allegedly compare...</li>
            <li> Second shave was harsh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mileage varies tremendously in wet shaving</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> However I am an impatient shaver and like to get it over with as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving about three months ago.</li>
            <li> After doing some careful research, which entailed looking at the aggregate pros and cons of customer reviews, I decided that 1) a cheaper razor was probably the way to go in case</li>
            <li> I started safety-razor shaving a few years back after years of Mach 3 use.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re just getting into wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> As a brotha with ingrown hair/bumps, I was careful at fist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a  safety razor for a few years now and have tried a number of different blades.  </li>
            <li> You do need to take a little extra care and not use any pressure with these as they are SHARP.</li>
            <li> Where as the other blades started going dull around the 3rd or 4th day the feathers last and work well through the 5th and 6th day&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Also remember that different razors may have different cutting angles, guards/combs etc, and trying a new razor with a new blade may mean relearning your shaving angles.  </li>
            <li> I am certainly not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> That said, if you are careful and let the weight of the razor do the cutting, the shave you get with these is significantly closer.  </li>
            <li> After trying out a few other blades, I will ONLY use Feather blades now.</li>
            <li> (I will admit the minimal burn is from where I have shaved against the grain on my neck which I don&#x27;t even dare to do with other blades.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blade be careful</li>
            <li> be careful using as they are really sharp.</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough to glide down your face with little effort.  </li>
            <li> Quite a different technique than the new 5-bladed expensive monster razors on the market.  </li>
            <li> blades are sharp....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shopping around you will probably hear that these Platinum coated FEATHER blades are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s due respect.  </li>
            <li> This is an extremely sharp, high-quality DE blade.  </li>
            <li> These blades are sharp as hell.  </li>
            <li> These blades are wicked sharp.</li>
            <li> I do not know if this is a function of some coating on other blades, thickness of the steel, or other variable.</li>
            <li> This is not the case with some other brands.  </li>
            <li> Their sharpness and longevity beat out my Derby blades, the Merkurs, Personnas and other brands.</li>
            <li> My shave with these was smoother than with any other blade I have tried, my Edwin Jagger DE89 just felt like it had the blade it was made for.</li>
            <li> -all razors are razor sharp.</li>
            <li> Not because they are any sharper than any other blade.</li>
            <li> That makes for an extremely sharp shave...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp....</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp as can be, and always produce a close shave.  </li>
            <li> and I use to tell people not to start with these blades because of how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> and I found them to be exceedingly sharp.  </li>
            <li> Extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been changing the blades</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy any other blades now.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with other blades as I have just started shaving with a DE.</li>
            <li> Holy platinum, these are astonishingly sharp.</li>
            <li> I started with Derby after hearing just how sharp the Feather&#x27;s blades are.  </li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any cleaner without these blades, they are as sharp as you can get.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have perfected my DE technique, I can&#x27;t use any other blades except for the Feathers.</li>
            <li> item as describe, but hope you have time and other blades.  </li>
            <li> It took me just a couple uses to learn how to not cut myself - these puppies are sharp.</li>
            <li> They are too sharp.</li>
            <li> the culture that created the Samurai swords to create an insanely sharp blade.</li>
            <li> Some of the other blades tried were Derby, Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock, Astra and one other that I can&#x27;t quite remember.</li>
            <li> These things are amazingly sharp.  </li>
            <li> Really sharp blades, cut you when you look at them.</li>
            <li> I bought theses after reading other reviewers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but these are definitely sharp.</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to try out my new DE razor that I pressed the blade far too hard against the skin and got some serious razor burn, but thankfully no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I use a fresh blade every time for my face, but I have very thick hair and delicate skin -- with lighter hair and/or thicker skin</li>
            <li> your chances of cutting yourself in the kitchen increase when you have dull knives because you use more force when you slice.  </li>
            <li> The shaving soap will help with less drag.</li>
            <li> The third time, I decided I would be extremely careful and slow down a bit.</li>
            <li> In other words, it is SHARP!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d have to agree with the other reviewers, they are SHARP!</li>
            <li> For me I have had other razors these last and allow you at lest 4 to 5 shaves before you get dull down shaving.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades, almost too sharp.  </li>
            <li> These blades last a very long time, and I have thick facial growth, but it does little to slow these blades down.</li>
            <li> I do about two passes a day and the blades stay sharp for about a week to a week and a half.</li>
            <li> And the Swede is just a bit less sharp than the Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And the Swede is just a bit less sharp than the Feather.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same blade for about 4 rounds of shaving, doesn&#x27;t even seem to be dull yet.</li>
            <li> It shaves extremely close and is not too sharp if little or no pressure is applied while shaving.  </li>
            <li> It essentially pulled my hairs out because it was so dull.</li>
            <li> If you are used to using duller blades, all things the same, you might cut yourself quite badly during your first shave with a Feather.</li>
            <li> Unlike Merkurs, you can&#x27;t go fast or be careless.  </li>
            <li> simple, common sense tips here.</li>
            <li> Only negative is if you nick yourself</li>
            <li> They worked well until I noticed how much thicket my beard was, and how difficult shaving had become.</li>
            <li> (I find this oil to be a bit thick, and am currently just using it up)&lt;br</li>
            <li> these are the sharpest razors in the world!&amp;#34; What that simply means is just go slowly and take your time.</li>
            <li> As I gained proficiency, I slowly increased my speed until I could get out of a shave with only one knick on my neck area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DE shaving technique can all be boiled down to giving the blade</li>
            <li> For the Merkur Progress, I start on the #4 setting as a knock down pass on my face and neck with the grain.  </li>
            <li> As soon as you get the technique down</li>
            <li> If you have gotten your DE technique and face prep down, then this blade will not let you down.  </li>
            <li> This beats cartridge razors hands down in quality of shave and price.</li>
            <li> : 1) dudes with a little facial bloating (like I used to be) may have a hard time with this blade still, and 2) the Feather blades shave at least as well as my LORD brand blades when I take my time, only the LORDs</li>
            <li> Sharp!  </li>
            <li> These blades are exceptionally sharp!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t already know about Feather blades, the are sharp!</li>
            <li> FAR less expensive than those razors that cost about $2 a cartridge, plus there&#x27;s a visceral satisfaction that comes from shaving with a single blade.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> These blades carry a reputation for a very sharp edge, and there&#x27;s no doubt about that.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and durable.</li>
            <li> This is a very sharp blade.  </li>
            <li> very sharp.</li>
            <li> VERY sharp blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sharp, as a razor blade needs to be, to reduce pull.</li>
            <li> very sharp which is the point i&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp as others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Thus, the sharpest the blade the less pressure it will take to achieve that close shave - and the less chance of getting nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the slight mole on my neck, which I have resigned to just get nicked when I shave has come through unscathed.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve gone 2 and a half in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> It leaves less nicks.</li>
            <li> less rinsing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking 60 weeks of shaving for half the price of 20 weeks with cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> Using Derbys and Astras I get a close, close shave along with some ever so slight irritation.</li>
            <li> All there in black 5 packs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect nothing less from Feather.</li>
            <li> Much less irritation.</li>
            <li> I will dispel some misinformation in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> It may sound crazy, but you&#x27;ll see what I mean when you try them.</li>
            <li> First let me say that if you were like me, you are eager but afraid to try these blades out.  </li>
            <li> This past week, about three months into wet shaving, I saw the Feathers in the drawer and figured, what the heck....</li>
            <li> If you are considering getting into wetshaving, I&#x27;d start out with something a little less aggressive.  </li>
            <li> and it causes some discomfort the first one or two shaves, but that does mean they last longer as well, so its&#x27; a double edged sword (that&#x27;s a sad pun, sorry).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they seem to &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; on my face even when new.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;even if you don&#x27;t want to drop the extra coin for a 30 pack of feather blades, do yourself a favor and at least get a 5 pack to test them out.  now!</li>
            <li> After shaving with Feather blades for months, I was experiencing a close shave with little to no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Feather blades will accomplish that with little effort.</li>
            <li> However, no better than my other blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes for a cleaner, less irritating shave, plus no pulling of multiple blade fiascos.</li>
            <li> The bonus is these blades are far less expensive than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> My beard is very coarse and tough on razors.</li>
            <li> They come very sharp and maintain that sharp edge for at least 5 to 6 shaves.  </li>
            <li> then a cold water with the grain touch up), I get absolutely BBS results.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;ve been DE shaving for a while, heard about these blades and never tried them, buy a few now.</li>
            <li> (I have gone through quite a few soaps and cremes for lather/lubes.  </li>
            <li> have tried a few others but feather</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a smooth shave at all.</li>
            <li> I started with the Merkur &amp;#34;Futur&amp;#34; Adjustable, but found it to be a bit too aggressive (the angle) and a bit too heavy.</li>
            <li> I will try the Feathers again after a few month shaving with my safety razor and update the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> came within a few days.</li>
            <li> and i can get a few uses out of it</li>
            <li> They shave well and don&#x27;t get clogged up like my atra  even when I have heavy stubble.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;ve destroyed my neck a few times when I was in a hurry...</li>
            <li> I cut myself a few times</li>
            <li> Two weeks if one doesn&#x27;t mind a few nicks.  </li>
            <li> so I have been checking everyday for my packaged never received a letter or card nothing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time trying others.</li>
            <li> 1 inch beard gone in 1 round.</li>
            <li> method 1st round is with the grain.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy bread</li>
            <li> These are VERY sharp!  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that they ARE very sharp!  </li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll then be punished accordingly and you&#x27;ll not easily forget your mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no easy feat given my manly beardness.</li>
            <li> Very slight....</li>
            <li> I recommend these to people with patience who don&#x27;t look at something new or difficult then dismiss it as to hard.</li>
            <li> Amazon is way less expensive than my local</li>
            <li> Second and third, not so bad, but still a few nicks.</li>
            <li> they are EXTREMELY sharp and you could do some damage if your technique is shaky...</li>
            <li> There is something atavistic in putting raw blade to your face every morning.</li>
            <li> which I found very hard to do in the end because you&#x27;re never really using them simultaneously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost very little</li>
            <li> To much pressure or a bad angle</li>
            <li> They last me about 8-10 days of shaving before they start getting slightly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I usually change them every two weeks, or whenever I remember to do it.</li>
            <li> The rest is pointless...</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary when it comes to durability, but I usually get 3</li>
            <li> The reason so many people report nicks is because the blades are terrible.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they use thinner metal than the competition, but I&#x27;ve never managed to cut myself with these.</li>
            <li> I started shaving at 14 and until my son put me on to these blades I was not enjoying my morning shave.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted a year of my life using Wally Wilkinson swords!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Wonderful service through Amazon as usual.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure buy a small lot to see if they work for you or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet what that entails, but the cryo treatment kicks the Feather up a notch in terms of smoothness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet what that entails, but the cryo treatment kicks the Feather up a notch in terms of smoothness.  </li>
            <li> I began once again with these blades, since they get the job done without issue and leave me unbelievably</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used merkur and wilkinson blades in the past.  </li>
            <li> No more nicks now</li>
            <li> Take it very slow because they are incredibly sharp.</li>
            <li> I can barely feel them cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> and I can barely feel it cutting.  </li>
            <li> Before, my neck would get pretty nicked up and bloody</li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> but they will dull faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Derbys are like shaving with a dull rock in comparison.</li>
            <li> The Bic blades were too dull to use after 3-4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I could hear the blade cutting hair I couldn&#x27;t tell that blade was actually shaving (in some areas).  </li>
            <li> well duh...</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> but you get at least 180 shaves as opposed to the 15 to 20</li>
            <li> When you use the last blade in the box just toss it in the trash without fear of the used blades cutting you or someone else.</li>
            <li> were a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> This might not be the razor for everyone, but if you haven&#x27;t tried it then it&#x27;s a must at least once.</li>
            <li> I get at least 3 to 5 shaves with each blade.</li>
            <li> I slowly</li>
            <li> I promptly removed that blade and slowly recovered from the episode (I didn&#x27;t shave for four days).</li>
            <li> and when I say thick</li>
            <li> and I mean slowly used the blades on my face after that.</li>
            <li> no more cartridge buys!</li>
            <li> Cartridges no more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll deal with the stories of how scary sharp these are.</li>
            <li> I mean it.</li>
            <li> Very thin but extremely sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> I personally find it almost impossible to shave with these without getting nicked.  </li>
            <li> I might give some of the less expensive brands a try.</li>
            <li> sawing through each hair in my beard (which is rather thick and tough).</li>
            <li> Poor technique and a dull blade.</li>
            <li> It is also possible (as with any brand) that you have just gotten a bad blade.  </li>
            <li> the closest and least irritating shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dull after half a use when trimming my hair (yes, I use it for hair cutting and not for shaving), unlike the Shark razors I used before.</li>
            <li> The blades were way too sharp for me and I was cutting myself quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> Average replacement rate is once per week; I had to replace my Merkurs once every two or three days &#x27;cause they&#x27;d start tugging at the hairs instead of cutting them).  </li>
            <li> If you know what you&#x27;re doing, and go slowly, you won&#x27;t cut yourself again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to describe</li>
            <li> I still have to work very hard to get a close shave -</li>
            <li> Cuts through my tough beard without a problem.</li>
            <li> (at least that I didnt deserve by going blindly over a pimple or something).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves nothing behind</li>
            <li> Wrappers for each blade are thin so handle by the edges or get cut.</li>
            <li> Do no apply any unnecessary pressure on your razor while shaving...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s something wrong with them.</li>
            <li> Bloody sharp.  </li>
            <li> Now, compare that to the cost of shaving with those flashy and overhyped</li>
            <li> From a company that makes eye and nerve surgical scalples and equipment, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Seeing people worship this blade for its supposed sharpness is silly.</li>
            <li> Unable to get a close shave with this blade.</li>
            <li> If you look at this blade wrong, it will cut you.</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just how difficult my beard is I</li>
            <li> It was just so unbearably difficult to try and shave with a Derby after having used Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are expensive though, but you pay for the quality i guess.</li>
            <li> at them wrong and odds are you&#x27;ll be losing an eye.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But 30 for $17.99 is expensive when you can get the shark brand at 100 for $15.99</li>
            <li> This beats using those expensive disposable razors.</li>
            <li> and they are wrong.</li>
            <li> Well I got bored with them</li>
            <li> (can you get bored of a razor?)</li>
            <li> and my guess is you will be a bloody mess!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe all the horror stories about cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> Remember, moisture is the biggest enemy of blades, not the act of cutting alone.    </li>
            <li> and i wonder why people say that they are so dangerous.</li>
            <li> A sharper blade reduces your risk of cutting yourself.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Try rinsing with cold water, then stroking Aloe Vera gel to seal it.</li>
            <li> I replace a blade when it start pulling my beard instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> Against the grain will cause MAD irritation (redness &amp; bleeding...)</li>
            <li> It was very unfortunate, and not his responsibility, that the blades did not arrive in time for my husband&#x27;s birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you attempt an against-the-grain cut with a bad angle</li>
            <li> this is bull crap</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> very bad delivery!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was the worst.</li>
            <li> I often go weekends without shaving and they perform well even after a week on nasty stubble.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my favorite blades!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent blade. Don&#x27;t believe all the horror stories about cutting yourself. I have a Merkur razor and have never even nicked myself. Very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Recently bought a Parker 96R and a couple of packs of shark blades.  The Parker was suggested as a milder DE razor, but I didnt give any thought to the Shark blades.  3 shaves and I was ripping my neck up pretty good.  So.  after reading up a bit i ordered the Feather blades.  the first shave was brilliant.  BSS with 2 passes.  My new blade of choice.</li>
            <li> These razor blades really do live up to their reputation. They are extremely sharp and don&#x27;t pull or tug on a few days worth of growth. Very efficient and last a decent amount of time (4 to 5 shaves WTG and ATG, probably more if you just went WTG). Buy some to check them out for yourself! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Feather blades are the best I have encountered.  They come very sharp and maintain that sharp edge for at least 5 to 6 shaves.  There is a learning curve required but I&#x27;ve never suffered a cut from one of these blades that doesn&#x27;t heal up overnight.  Popping in a new Feather into your safety razor is like a treat.  That first shave sounds like you have a straight edge gliding across your face.  The 30 count will satisfy my shaving needs for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I bought these blades after buying the same brand for years.  Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp....probably some of the sharpest I&#x27;ve bought.  &amp;#34;Great!&amp;#34; you&#x27;re thinking!  Well, it would be except they don&#x27;t seem to give the same quality of shave as my old double edge razor blades.  These blades seem to catch more and don&#x27;t glide as easily over my stubble.  It&#x27;s very hard to describe but I would definitely say that I&#x27;ll go back to ordering Merkurs or a similar brand in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR Good but not great.  Buy Merkur or similar brand.</li>
            <li> Excellent  very sharp, edge will stay for quite a few shaves,  great package too covered for blades for 6 months,  careful if beginner</li>
            <li> Shaaaaarp.  These are the only blades my skin can handle other than Merkur&#x27;s.  Worth the extra buck or two.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a traditional Double Edge safety razor is an art neglected by most. There is something atavistic in putting raw blade to your face every morning. And when it comes to making blades, the Japanese are still unsurpassed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shopping around you will probably hear that these Platinum coated FEATHER blades are extremely sharp. Yes they are. They are the sharpest. By far. And that is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;When shaving with a Double Edge Razor one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do most of the work. Thus, the sharpest the blade the less pressure it will take to achieve that close shave - and the less chance of getting nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It depends on one&#x27;s bristles but I do not feel the need to change the blade more often than every second week or so. Thus, these 30 blades will probably last me well over 6 months. Now, compare that to the cost of shaving with those flashy and overhyped Gillettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have an adjustment curve (especially when one comes from those supermarket multi-bladed contraptions) and it will require both a good shaving soap such as the [[ASIN:B000Q33CRE Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Sienna]] and a top Double Blade safety razor such as the [[ASIN:B004LDCJV0 Feather]]; however, the end result is well worth it. And in no time you will be shaving as fast as before only deeper and more satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself to the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WITH MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!</li>
            <li> I think these are \\&quot;too sharp!\\&quot; I almost like the less sharp brands better just because I&#x27;m waking up and it causes some discomfort the first one or two shaves, but that does mean they last longer as well, so its&#x27; a double edged sword (that&#x27;s a sad pun, sorry).</li>
            <li> I have used this blade for a number of years and am very happy with it. I am writing this review to tell how please I am with the interaction from this seller. My original order was lost, and after I contacted them, they quickly sent out replacement blades. I can highly recommend both the blade and the seller.</li>
            <li> These are much better than the cheap ones in drug store.  I got 5 good shaves with the first one.  I&#x27;m on my second blade.  Didn&#x27;t have much of a nicking problem.  Used a mug and brush.</li>
            <li> The Feather is the best DE blades made today, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DE shaving technique can all be boiled down to giving the blade it&#x27;s due respect.  The Feather is a teacher of proper technique and the Feather demands the utmost respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use proper technique, you respect and please the blade and you are rewarded with smooth, flawless skin.  If you apply any pressure at all to your face when shaving, you disrespect and insult the blade by implying that it needs your help to do it&#x27;s job.  You&#x27;ll then be punished accordingly and you&#x27;ll not easily forget your mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wish to quickly become a shaving master, let the Feather be your teacher.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely sharp, high-quality DE blade.  I started out wetshaving with Feather blades and a cheap, non-adjustable razor, and it almost made me give it up.  The blades were way too sharp for me and I was cutting myself quite a bit.  I went to the Merkur blades for a couple months and that was easier for a beginner.  I now have a Gillette Slim adjustable razor, and with the razor dialed back a little the Feathers are just perfect.  Shaving is effortless with these blades, as long as you don&#x27;t get too aggressive with your blade angle.      If you are considering getting into wetshaving, I&#x27;d start out with something a little less aggressive.  Once you get the hang of shaving with a DE razor, you can&#x27;t beat the Feathers.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim. I was using budget blades from target, walmart, etc. Those were ok, but these are worlds better. They last me about 8-10 days of shaving before they start getting slightly uncomfortable. I usually change them every two weeks, or whenever I remember to do it.</li>
            <li> Great product, but not up to all the hype.  I&#x27;ve been reading about the Feather brand for a long time and finally bought some.  I&#x27;ve been using the el cheapo ones from Walmart for awhile, so using a double sided was not new to me.  I expected the Feathers to be lightsaber sharp, one look and all the hair flying off, or at least a dozen cuts for the first shave...  The Feathers are nice and extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> Get a weishi- older Gillette super speed or aristocrat, and these blades are the best there can be.  Use a fairly aggressive razor- say an older Gillette Fatboy on the number 7-9 setting and you really must be careful.  Use these blades and not know what the heck you are doing- and my guess is you will be a bloody mess!  My old black silver tipped super speed gillette just works wonders with these blades.</li>
            <li> Simply stated, these are the best blades I have used for a DE razor. I read all the reviews on-line and made my purchase based on the good feedback about Feather. I completely concur and will be buying these from now on. As for the commentary about them being too sharp, I find them to be great and had to use no more caution than I did with inferior brands.</li>
            <li> For first time DE safety blade users, this is not a good choice. The blades are very sharp, and even as an experienced user, I cut myself from time to time. That being said, they produce a great shave and I am always happy buying them in bulk.</li>
            <li> Ive been using these blades for years...IMHO they&#x27;re THE sharpest in double edge choices. Great alternative to the $2-3 blades from the monopoly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about how good these blades were, but put off trying them since they cost more than the Sharks I normally use -- which give me perfectly decent shaves.  But I finally gave them a shot, and WOW -- love em.  No nicks, and they just glide right over my skin.  I can barely feel them cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> First let me say that if you were like me, you are eager but afraid to try these blades out.  I am not going to get into whether or not these are the sharpest blades around that is sort of a given, nobody seems to contest that, the good and bad reviews alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin reviewing this item by saying,  \\&quot;if you are sampling blades to find the one that gives the most comfortable shave, I do believe you need to try these.\\&quot;  I would wait however (if you are new to DE shaving) until you have practiced with a few others first (where you rarely nick yourself).  You really should have your technique down for ANY of the really sharp blades.  I have read many of the reviews on these blades both positive and negative, the negatives made me hesitate for a bit before trying them, it was actually the overwhelming number of positive reviews that finally got me to make the attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say there is a reason for the number of reviews on these blades.  They are amazing!!!  I have never had a smoother shave, not just in how it cuts but how the blade glides over the skin.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I could hear the blade cutting hair I couldn&#x27;t tell that blade was actually shaving (in some areas).  I believe that I have pretty good shaving technique and I have yet to suffer a nick with this blade (knock on wood).  Even the slight mole on my neck, which I have resigned to just get nicked when I shave has come through unscathed.  My face feels great, minimal to no burn (I will admit the minimal burn is from where I have shaved against the grain on my neck which I don&#x27;t even dare to do with other blades.  This is now my go to blade.  My search for my best blade has ended here. Of course everyone&#x27;s best blade may be different I do believe this is a blade to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel it is necessary to say that many of the negative reviews address different issues, that may or may not apply to every user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Price.  While in relation to other DE blades feathers are indeed costlier, in relation to Cartridges, they are incredibly inexpensive.  I just saw a pack of 8 fusion cartridges at a popular discount retail chain for about $28.  My feeling on this is just a matter of priority.  If you are looking for the best shave possible, this may be the blade for you.  Keep in mind, some of the reviewers who discuss the price of the blade will often brag how they can get another brand blade to last 3 weeks or more.  I think that speaks for itself, I have never had any blade that was good for more than a week, and pushing it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Butchering the face while shaving.  Like I mentioned earlier in the review, you really need to have your DE shaving technique down for any really sharp blades.  To much pressure or a bad angle and I can see these blades doing some damage.  On the other hand I find really sharp blades to be very forgiving, because they require no pressure, they will cut the hair, all you must do is guide.  Also remember that different razors may have different cutting angles, guards/combs etc, and trying a new razor with a new blade may mean relearning your shaving angles.  Shave preparation is also very important in getting a clean, close comfortable shave so please keep that in mind as well.  It is also possible (as with any brand) that you have just gotten a bad blade.  So if you find the shave unbearable try again later with a new blade and see if it is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of what I am using at the time of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

            <li> These blades are sharp as hell.  I used to shave with Merkurs, but those dulled way too fast and the blade quality wasn&#x27;t consistent.  The learning curve with these lovely Japanese blades is, fortunately, very steep.  Unlike Merkurs, you can&#x27;t go fast or be careless.  If you do/are, you are going take off your Adam&#x27;s apple or slice off a bit of your chin.  That said, if you are careful and let the weight of the razor do the cutting, the shave you get with these is significantly closer.  In addition, these blades can last up to two weeks (I&#x27;ve gone 2 and a half in a pinch.  Average replacement rate is once per week; I had to replace my Merkurs once every two or three days &#x27;cause they&#x27;d start tugging at the hairs instead of cutting them).  These are the best blades I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to use and I&#x27;d recommend them to my brother (with a caveat that he needs to be careful), so I&#x27;d certainly recommend them to you.</li>
            <li> Why is not everyone shaving their face like this?  I spent hundreds of dollars in my young life on Mach 3 blades and got a good shave.  But now I spend a FRACTION of that, and I get a good shave.  I get more use out of one of these blades than I do out of three our four of the mach 3 or higher stuff.  This is the way your grandpa shaves and there is a reason.  Cheap and works well.</li>
            <li> Thought it would come in the yellow. After checking  yellow or black same great razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic delivery (delivered on Sunday!)</li>
            <li> After buying a large combo pack of blades I used each blade for 2 shaves and decided that these Feather blades gave the best shave of all.  The seem thinner and more flexible than any other of the blades I used and they definitely seem SHARPER!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with these blades. I&#x27;ve been through a full box of 5 blades, so far, and I like the way they feel and the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the quality of the shave is perhaps marginally better than the Merkurs I was using before these. Both brands are excellent (way better than the drugstore blades I started on) but from all the stories and stellar reviews I was expecting an extraordinary difference between the Feather and Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Ninja assassin sharp&amp;#34;, maybe, but most high-quality blades are. If these were substantially more expensive, I&#x27;d say they aren&#x27;t worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am quite happy with these blades.</li>
            <li> I have never looked back after switching to double-edged shaving. Fine blades.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are the best for me and my double edge. Would be five stars for me but the ship time was almost a month. Too long. Highly recommend the blades, just look at the shipping options.</li>
            <li> Feather double edge blades are the sharpest and smoothest blades. the order was sent and recieved very quickly. I will definetly order again in the future.</li>
            <li> These blades are wicked sharp. They give you a fantastic shave when used carefully. I have tried other brands such as Dorco and Derby,they don&#x27;t even come close to Feathers.  If you want the ultimate shave use Feather blades everytime.</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest I have tried.  Unfortunately, they seem to &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; on my face even when new.  Other blades seem to glide more easily than the Feather DE blades. I do not know if this is a function of some coating on other blades, thickness of the steel, or other variable. The Feathers seem to be the sharpest.  I personally find it almost impossible to shave with these without getting nicked.  This is not the case with some other brands.  This is just my experience.  Others may have better outcomes.  Try several blades before settling on one blade.</li>
            <li> I use Astra blades (link below) for daily use because I&#x27;m clumsy and could kill myself with a Feather if I&#x27;m not careful. However, I stocked up on Feathers because they&#x27;re the best for shaving thick scruffy 2+ day growth. So after a long weekend, I reach for a Feather, and pay very close attention to what I&#x27;m doing with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My list of Amazon-acquired shaving supplies:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor #38 + 10 Free DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000F5NRQY Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Pre-Shave Oil, 2 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RG8D6K Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00020UQQQ Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Shave Cream Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004COMB5W Osma Styptic Pencil, Hemo Stop]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li> After trying each of the brands included in a sampler pack of blades I purchased, the Feathers come in on top by a long way. Their sharpness and longevity beat out my Derby blades, the Merkurs, Personnas and other brands. These were the best for my beard, but they might not be the best for everyone.    These blades carry a reputation for a very sharp edge, and there&#x27;s no doubt about that. However, if you&#x27;re like me and got a coarse beard, these go right through it. I was a little concerned when I started my first shave with one of these loaded because I didn&#x27;t hear the blade singing as it cut. As it turns out, it was just cutting so efficiently, it didn&#x27;t make a sound or tug at all. It just went right through the hair. Two passes gave me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. No weepers, bleeders, nicks or cuts.    And talk about lasting a while! I got about seven good shaves out of one blade by simply patting it dry. Remember, moisture is the biggest enemy of blades, not the act of cutting alone.    Now, these might not be the right blades for a new DE shaver to start off with. These aren&#x27;t very forgiving and probably could hurt if you don&#x27;t have your technique down. But if you&#x27;ve been DE shaving for a while, heard about these blades and never tried them, buy a few now. At this price, it&#x27;s hard to beat. They&#x27;re the same price as the same number of Merkurs and these are much better blades. Take your time, enjoy the shave and enjoy the results.</li>
            <li> David was wonderful to me in my experience of buying his blades.  It was very unfortunate, and not his responsibility, that the blades did not arrive in time for my husband&#x27;s birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David was honorable and gave the blades as a gift to my husband!  I would highly recommend him and not hesitate to use his company in the future.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and durable. My husband uses these approximately 8-10 times each, which is astounding considering his coarse facial hair. I also use them for shaving my legs and they last even longer for me. I would highly recommend them. We have tried others, but always return to Feather blades for their superior quality.</li>
            <li> I like the razor&#x27;s sharpness. IMO it shaves more aggressively than the Merkur blades. However the blades don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the Merkur brand so I am torn. Anyway it is a good blade so I will give it a good rating.</li>
            <li> These are VERY sharp!  I cannot over-emphasize that.  It shaves very close and leaves your face baby smooth but go slow and be very very careful.</li>
            <li> Razors are a very personal preference that being said if you like feathers then these will be a great deal pricewise, but they are coming from far away so don&#x27;t expect to get them anytime soon</li>
            <li> Feather razor blades have a reputation for being super sharp.  You can find many reviews warning that they are so sharp that if you don&#x27;t respect them then you will shred your face.  After a year of shaving with a double-edged razor, I decided to order these and I have to say that they ARE very sharp!  I felt no pulling, and more hair was removed in one stoke than other brands I have tried.  I have a different theory: your chances of cutting yourself in the kitchen increase when you have dull knives because you use more force when you slice.  Maybe it works the same with razor blades?  Just remember that Feathers are super sharp, take your time shaving, and enjoy how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that I have shaved with Derby&#x27;s, Merkur, Gillettes and Shark DE blades and I have gotten good shaves with most of them, they are good blades. However, these Feather Blades are considerably better!. My shave with these was smoother than with any other blade I have tried, my Edwin Jagger DE89 just felt like it had the blade it was made for. I got a very comfortable and close shave, with no nicks or cuts whats so ever!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I heard is that these were too aggressive, and left some with cuts and nicks, lots of blood etc. Well my first time shaving was with no issues, and I have nothing but great things to say about it. I would highly recommend these, and do not be scared off by some people saying that these will butcher your face. That is just not so, try these yourself with a quality DE razor and you&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some simple, common sense tips here. Make sure to not apply pressure, this is not necessary let the blade do all the work for you. Just the weight of the razor, and let your shoulder do all the movement. Use a quality cream, and preferably after a nice warm shower. Do at least a two pass shave, 1st with the grain, (rinse, apply more cream) then against the grain if you want an even closer shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone wanting a close shave.  When I was growing up, I remembered my father and grandfather using this type of blade.</li>
            <li> After using Israeli Personna blades for a few years, I wanted to try a few other brands to see if there was something out there that was better.  I ordered a sample pack that included Astra, Crystal, Derby, and Feather.  I was anxious to try the Feather since I&#x27;d heard so much about their sharpness and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;I put one in my Gillette Fatboy and dialed it one less than my normal 7 setting...due to the sharpness of the blade.  After a pass or two, I put it back to 7.  For me, the blade just wasn&#x27;t shaving as well as the Personna.  I switched to my Gillette Red Tip which seemed to be more suitable for this blade.&lt;br /&gt;The blade was more irritating than the Personna and that may be because I&#x27;m so used to the Personna.  I will continue to use the blade and see if I notice an improvement.  For now, the Personna wins over the Feather.  Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March, 2014 Update:&lt;br /&gt;I had forgotten that I had a few more Feathers in my sample pack and decided to try again with the blade in my Merkur Slant Bar.  What a great combination!  Even though the slant bar is a very aggressive razor, the blade and handle seemed to be matched to each other perfectly.  The shave was very smooth, no nicks...no irritation.  I&#x27;m giving the Feather another look.</li>
            <li> The product was received quicker than I anticipated. Solid packing and order was all there. Great experience and I will continue to use this service.</li>
            <li> i ordered these blades hoping for the reviews to stand up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have a very thick, coarse beard and have recently found the pleasure and better results of DE wet shaving.  these blades are a game-changer.  i&#x27;ll never order another blade, even if they are more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is no drag, gripping, or uncomfortable catching from a feather blade.  even against the grain on my second pass it was incredibly gentle and clean cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;paired this with anthony pre-shave oil, art of shaving sandalwood shave cream and after shave balm.  also use bigelow shave cream and baxter of california alcohol free after shave balm, and all of those products have been top notch and create a most enjoyable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even if you don&#x27;t want to drop the extra coin for a 30 pack of feather blades, do yourself a favor and at least get a 5 pack to test them out.  now!</li>
            <li> These work very well, and each lasts me a while, since I usually use them for my head. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I actually think these could be sharper, but that might make them a bit harsh. It&#x27;s so hard to tell because the razor you use also helps to determine the right blade for your face, and the properties of your beard and skin as well as the shape of your face and your level of technique all influence what is sharp enough and what is murder on your face because it&#x27;s too dull or too aggressive. However, Feather has a solid reputation amongst wet-shavers for being just right for many.</li>
            <li> As someone who only a year ago switched to wet shaving, I&#x27;m glad to have found these early. They&#x27;re very sharp out of the box, and it leaves a very smooth impression. The boxes also have a neat razor blade disposal - though many other do so this isn&#x27;t a unique feature. I replace these weekly and have never had a knick or cut or rash (at least that I didnt deserve by going blindly over a pimple or something). I use these with my Merkur and it&#x27;s never given me problems.</li>
            <li> Glad i bought them, they do the job, they&#x27;re sharp, and stay sharp for about 3 uses each blade. They&#x27;re smooth on my skin and haven&#x27;t cut my skin yet.</li>
            <li> The best of the best period.</li>
            <li> (UPDATE) I&#x27;m still using these razors and have compared them to several other brands and have used them in the Feather Razor with the plastic handle, a 1972 Schick Krona, 1949 Gillette Super Speed and a Wilkinson Sword D/E and can honestly say there is no better D/E razor blade on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 59 and started shaving with a D/E razor and blades, after a five year stint using the &#x27;modern cartridge razor&#x27; I finally regained my common sense and returned to what works so much better. We didn&#x27;t have Feather razor blades back when I was using a D/E razor and I wish we did! It is the best and sharpest blade I&#x27;ve ever used! I have a medium/heavy beard and get about 7 - 9 shaves per blade. No plastic to throw away, no razor to replace every 2 - 4 years (I still have my 1971 Gillette Super Speed, 1967 Schick Krona my Dad gave me and a Feather plastic handle D/E that is just like the 1968 Gillette Knack/G1000...I&#x27;ll never need another razor:). I get the closest shave with no knicks or cuts, no going over the same spot a dozen times and not &#x27;cutting it&#x27; like my cartridge razor days. AND it&#x27;s cheaper than using the cartridges that only give me about 3 good shaves.  I do either a 2 - or - three way shave depending on if I shave every day and end up with a face like an 18 year old girls butt! That&#x27;s damned smooth if I remember correctly:)&lt;br /&gt;Really, better product, better result, cost less, better for the environment...why wouldn&#x27;t you switch?  If you already use a D/E razor and are looking for a great blade, I think Feather makes the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. The only thing that might be a negative is if you have really sensitive skin and if that&#x27;s the case maybe a different blade angle...? Honestly; you can&#x27;t go wrong with Feather products. From a company that makes eye and nerve surgical scalples and equipment, you can&#x27;t go wrong. You&#x27;ll wonder why they don&#x27;t cost more!</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  Don&#x27;t worry about cutting yourself, do some research on proper shaving technique and you will be fine.  I listened to other reviews and got these and can&#x27;t imagine others being much better.  Get a sample pack of these and/or others and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> I want to start this with I&#x27;m female. I got this as a gift and it took a while to ship. I read several reviews on different brands of razors and this one had the best it fits nice with the Merker I got my bf to shave with and he used the blade today. He said it worked nicely. there were many of them and the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li> I tried some of these from a sampler pack and was hooked. They are very sharp, but after many shaves later I have yet to cut my skin with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;(using these with an old Gillette slim adjustable.)</li>
            <li> I am using the Merkur Progress adjustable razor.  Also using this razor to break into eventually using a straight razor.  I got the Merkur Progress on a whim, and things have progressed for me a la \\&quot;gateway\\&quot; shaving tool.  At this point since finding the FEATHER blades, I don&#x27;t particularly care if I ever graduate to the straight razor.    After some research and having tried the Merkur and one brand of generic blades, with over a year of getting to know my razor I have finally used up all the Merkur blades I got, I sought out the Feather blades.      So far all I have read on both the Merkur and the FEATHER have been consistent, for me.      I have fairly sensitive skin and can only shave once to twice per week.  The skin on my neck takes a while to recover from shaves, no matter what method I use.  I also use my razor to shave my head.  Sounds crazy I know, but it does the best job, period.  I guess time with the razor has given me a surgical grip on the razor, for obvious reasons.    For the Merkur Progress, I start on the #4 setting as a knock down pass on my face and neck with the grain.  (I have gone through quite a few soaps and cremes for lather/lubes.  This last one I have tried is the best I have found- Cremo Creme.  So good it even effects they grip on my razor making it slippery)  Re-lather, adjust to #2.5 setting and give a cross the grain pass.  Light rinse to feel where I need to give extra attention, re-lather, adjust to #1.5 and give a final against the grain pass.      Between going through the process of using the adjustments on my razor and finding the FEATHER blades I have reduced nicks and total shave time.  Before, it could take up to an hour using blades that were on their third or fourth shave.  Now with the Feather blades I&#x27;m on my third shave/use and this was my fastest at around 20+ minutes including shaving my head.      Before, my neck would get pretty nicked up and bloody, these last shaves with the FEATHER blades have been a real honest treat and joy.  The blades raised my shaving skill points and finished feel.  The smoothest finest shave I have ever had.  Very close shave.  (now this only leads me to imagine the shave I can achieve with a straight razor...)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sample packs and many types but the Feather is the best it&#x27;s true what they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be intimidated by what people say when they say &amp;#34;be careful these are the sharpest razors in the world!&amp;#34; What that simply means is just go slowly and take your time. Think about it - you&#x27;re shaving so wouldn&#x27;t you want the sharpest razor available?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go slowly, expect to toss a blade after three to four shaves and be happy. Amazon pricing makes it affordable to buy 100 at a time. Don&#x27;t be tepid about throwing these blades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with the world&#x27;s sharpest blades isn&#x27;t so fun when the one you&#x27;re using is 2 shaves past it&#x27;s prime and ready to be tossed. The Feather brand also includes a razor bank (place to put used ones) which is cool cause some of the cheaper brands do not provide this, making me wonder what they&#x27;d expect us to do with a used razor.</li>
            <li> favorite blades, sharp and crisp</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES them. He said they are super SHARP. Very close shave. EVEN closer when using GEL shaving cream instead of shaving soap. It leaves less nicks. He uses the Merkur 180 long handle. He DID NOT care for the Merkur blades. They were NOT sharp enough. He does not have a thick facial hail, mild to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are definitely the finest blades that have ever touched my face. I read the reviews before purchasing, and now after having used them, I cannot disagree with the consensus. Feather blades are most likely the sharpest de blades you can buy, period. My skin feels smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom after every shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. My dad started my brother and me on double edge long ago. Have tried the multiblade products and find they cause ingrown hairs which are a pain. Feather is the best. Sharp as can be and  VERY comfortable.</li>
            <li> I received these blades in good time and in good condition, all were sealed and new. They are sharp and very smooth, I get no irritation from these, and I have to shave my neck quite a bit from every direction to get rid of all the stubble. Feather blades live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy d/e shaving this is definitely one of the top shaving blades you should use. They are great!</li>
            <li> Sharp blade be careful&lt;br /&gt;1 blade lasts me four days</li>
            <li> I have purchased both the german merkur brand and these japanese brand of razors. I prefer the german brand. These things are sharp, but I seem to get nicked every time with the japanese brand. The german brand I do not. I have no idea why it would matter but I do use a merkur razor.</li>
            <li> Worth getting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my self the first time but now I know how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few others but feather seems to be the the quickest to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves nothing behind</li>
            <li> After trying out a few other blades, I will ONLY use Feather blades now. The rest is pointless...honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things make my face feel like butter afterwards. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> A quality affordable product.  This is a bulk package with multiple units holding several blades.  Have used two blades and can already tell this is a quality make.  Also, I like the feather design!  Platinum coated, good to go.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of brands of blades. The only other DE blades that come close are much harder to find and are more expensive. Your mileage may vary when it comes to durability, but I usually get 3 really great shaves out of each blade, and can stretch it for 1 or 2 more after that which are still acceptable, but not quite as good. (Most of the time, I replace a blade after every 3rd shave.)</li>
            <li> Quite a different technique than the new 5-bladed expensive monster razors on the market.  Way less expensive and as good a shave if not better.  It does take a little more time and patience, but once you get the hang of it, quite easy.  I&#x27;ve lost very little blood!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told that all DE blades are not created equal - some are sharper than others, and some beards do not require the sharpest blade available.  This is a very sharp blade.  I seem to get a more comfortable shave with these blades on the second or third day when they aren&#x27;t quite so sharp.  I like them a lot, but I think I will try others to see which one is the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest anyone starting to use a DE razor do the same to get the best, most comfortable shave for their type of beard and sensitive face.</li>
            <li> Great product (&amp; price!)</li>
            <li> I paid for two of this order. Each order should have 30 blades - a total of 60 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They only fulfilled half of the order. Considering the order originates in Thailand, this is a huge inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Oh well.  They&#x27;re good, but not significantly better than the Sharks (also ordered from Amazon).  Amazon is way less expensive than my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things took quite a trip.  Blades say &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34;, but they shipped from Thailand through Malaysia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a half of one in my straight razor and shaved.  It cut close.  I was just hoping that the difference in price between the Sharks and the Feather blades was justified.  It&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades and a good value. You can probably find some other blades for cheaper depending on how many you buy at a time. The shipping was quick as many of the other blades were shipped from overseas and these were in stock in the US. I have not been using the double edge safety razor long but am very happy with the switch. If you clean and dry off your blades (same as with disposable cartridge razors) they will last much longer. I suggest just even a good rinse and pat dry taking care not to cut yourself. If you really want to do it right, put the end of the razor in rubbing alcohol to store it.</li>
            <li> Pulls, tugs. I don&#x27;t see why people care about this blade so much. Try Kai or Astra. Both are leagues better. Feather did a good job marketing, but nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also-all razors are razor sharp. Seeing people worship this blade for its supposed sharpness is silly. It&#x27;s not a smooth shave at all. The reason so many people report nicks is because the blades are terrible. Not because they are any sharper than any other blade.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re called feather because they are super thin.  Because of that, they can have a super sharp edge.  That makes for an extremely sharp shave...but they will dull faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like kitchen knives, if you have a thinner knife, you can get a sharper edge, but because the edge is so thin, it will need to be sharpened more often.  Thicker blades are more blunt, but can withstand more use before needing sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I can get about 8-10 shaves out of these.  The first few shaves is freaky, actually.  So effortless, but you can so easily slice your face.  After the third shave, they start to have a little &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;, which is OK for me because that level of dullness is where the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; is for me when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I&#x27;m still on my first order.  Probably will last a year before having to re-order.  Just drop the money on these and store them under your sink.</li>
            <li> Feather&#x27;s blades are absolutely amazing, and at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.  When I first bought a safety razor, I had heard that it could produce a closer shave, and for a cheaper price than a cartridge razor.  While the blades that came with it weren&#x27;t bad, when I received the first set of Feathers, it absolute blew my mind.  These double edged blades are nothing short of wonderous:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ They&#x27;re really sharp, and give a close shave with an experienced hand&lt;br /&gt;+ Since they are sharp, they don&#x27;t cause irritation during a shave.&lt;br /&gt;+ Two blades means a faster shave, and less rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;+ As there is a blade on both sides, the longevity is great.  I can frequently get up to two weeks out of each blade, if not a bit more, before it becomes too irritating under normal conditions.&lt;br /&gt;+ They&#x27;re super cheap.  $10 for 30.  We&#x27;re talking 60 weeks of shaving for half the price of 20 weeks with cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;+ The packaging helps keep you safe!  Nothing like the little slot in the back of each set for used razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- They&#x27;re sharp.... well duh... they&#x27;re razors... be careful.&lt;br /&gt;- You can not take them in a carry on, so expect to check luggage if you want your blades on a trip&lt;br /&gt;- With a lot of growth, the blade dulls faster, so shaving off your beard can take down a razor in less than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from some inconveniences from a travel perspective, Feather Double Edged Razor Blades are almost perfect.  With the price to value ratio, they&#x27;re pretty much a no brainer.</li>
            <li> This blade is not at all what I expected. Unable to get a close shave with this blade. Will continue on the quest to find the perfect blade.</li>
            <li> If you look at this blade wrong, it will cut you. I use it in my straight razor. Very very sharp and will cut you if you&#x27;re inexperienced, but once you learn what you&#x27;re doing, it makes a great shave and glides through all hair like it wasn&#x27;t even there. Virtually no skin irritation either.</li>
            <li> While I find Feather blades to be sharp, they also seem to dull rather quickly.  I get about two shaves (three if I really push it) out of a blade before it becomes too dull to use.  Unlike most reviewers on here, I don&#x27;t think the Feather blades are really any sharper than your standard blade- I  think they just have better marketing.  My very first month of DE shaving was with Feather blades, and my face survived just fine. The bottom line is if you&#x27;ve never tried them, give them a shot... a blade that doesn&#x27;t impress me may impress you!</li>
            <li> Shaving doesn&#x27;t get easier as you get older, and for me it became a choice between an itchy beard or finding something to shave with than didn&#x27;t cost  $50 a month in razor blades.  With these my cost is about $5.00 a month, and they give me a better shave than anything else I have used since I started shaving regular in 1963.</li>
            <li> Sharpest blade in town, worth the price and wait from Asia.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are super sharp--some of the sharpest you can buy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for beginners, but if you are a wet-shaving veteran and you want a close, smooth shave, buy these blades. As far as double-edged razor blades go, they aren&#x27;t cheap, but they are tons cheaper than new razor cartridges and will give you a better shave when coupled with a good razor in a steady hand.</li>
            <li> These blades are great.  They&#x27;re sharp as can be, and always produce a close shave.  The only downside is they are a bit pricey compared to other options.</li>
            <li> My favorite razors to use by far. I&#x27;ve tried Derby and Astra (the other two most popular brands for double-edged razors) and the sharpness that is standard on Feathers is leaps and bounds above the competition. Cuts through my tough beard without a problem.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are awesome. However, these ones didn&#x27;t seem as sharp to me as the one that came with my razor, or the new ones I just got from a local shop</li>
            <li> Sharpest blades out there and consistently give me a great shave.  Only negative is if you nick yourself it&#x27;s like a samurai took a swipe at you with his sword.  These blades are not forgiving to a new DE user, but I love them.</li>
            <li> Upon returning to DE shaving, I selected these blades based on Amazon customer reviews.  They are very sharp so they produce a close and comfortable shave.  I get about 10-12 very good shaves per blade and, with the low cost, my Scottish background does not object to going to a new blade at that point.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much, used the product and it works great. I love these blades, thanks again and I will reorder</li>
            <li> These work great for me, and are sharp enough to do the job with no pulling or scraping. I like them better than the Merkur blades that I used for a while with my Merkur razor.&lt;br /&gt;I also love not spending tons of $ on blades from Shick with 17 blades that don&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is making such a big deal about the \\&quot;danger\\&quot; of these blades. When I shaved with them for the first time, I wasn&#x27;t being very careful but I didn&#x27;t cut myself. And I&#x27;ve only been using a safety razor about two weeks. But these blades are great. Nice and sharp and last for about two weeks for me. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Best blades, ever! I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all and these are the sharpest, give the smoothest (baby&#x27;s bottom) shave you&#x27;ll ever have. They take a bit of practice and the safety-razer (device) that you install them into has a lot to do with their effectiveness. I started with the Merkur &amp;#34;Futur&amp;#34; Adjustable, but found it to be a bit too aggressive (the angle) and a bit too heavy. I&#x27;m now using these blades in Feather&#x27;s own second generation All-Stainless, which is the crème de la crème of double-edge safety razor shaving. It&#x27;s not very aggressive at all, even with these Feather blades, but give a great shave. Of course, technique is everything!</li>
            <li> I started using a safety razor about three months ago. I think that they&#x27;ve just gone down in popularity since the double edge was introduced, but the shave with a safety razor is far superior. Now I can change blades weekly and always have a close shave!</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a safety razor using these blades. The blades are extremely sharp and NOT for someone trying a safety razor for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I am using Astra Platinum and loved them. I will try the Feathers again after a few month shaving with my safety razor and update the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Once I learned exactly how to use the safety razor I bought and what was the best procedure for me to shave, the blades are actually very impressive. I would recommend this product to advanced users not beginners.</li>
            <li> They last me about 5 comfortable shaves and cut me a lot less than most other brands I have used.  Very sharp for 5 shaves and each blade is consistently high quality.</li>
            <li> Using it. No complaints.</li>
            <li> These are the blades to use!  Hands down the best. I use them with the cheapest DE razor on Amazon and I get a great shave.</li>
            <li> Got these as replacements for a new handle I got last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much sharper than the blades that came with my shaver.  I thought maybe I just couldnt&#x27; get the hang of using a safety razor, but the big difference is using really good  blades.  Makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> very sharp. came within a few days. I hear shaving with DE safety razors are better for the skin. Guess I&#x27;ll find out after it stops bleeding :)</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades, almost too sharp.  As long as I am aware of how sharp these are things are fine - the moment I forget it is a massacre!</li>
            <li> Feathers are by far the best blades you can get. Sharp and do their work flawlessly. Not sure if they use thinner metal than the competition, but I&#x27;ve never managed to cut myself with these. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this razor blade most of my adult life.  I started shaving at 14 and until my son put me on to these blades I was not enjoying my morning shave.  These blades are AWESOME!  Becareful they are not your normal dull blades these are as sharpe as they say they are.  I recommend them and will buy them again, and again.  Supplier was great exceeded my expectations and will buy from them again...Buy these blades for the best single edge shave possible..  A far cry from the old blades I started with.</li>
            <li> These have become my favorite blades for over a year now after trying a variety of different brands, which I recommend anyone new to safety razors to do. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I have not shaved for a week or a day, these do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l use these with a [[ASIN:B001LYAQ9E Merkur HD 34C, Chrome Plated]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Monday I start a new blade. You could possibly get more than a week out of them, but changing every week has become my habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really sharp, but the first shave is not as smooth as the 2nd+ shave with them for some reason. They are still superior to the other blades that I have tried. The second shave and on is when these blades really shine. They last longer and stay comfortable longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to dry the blades after every shave and have not had any rusting issues,  even the blades in my can of used blades don&#x27;t show rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think everyone should experiment with different blades to find the ones they like and I use to tell people not to start with these blades because of how sharp they are. I now have a friend who started with these and loves them,  so maybe I won&#x27;t give that recommendation anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t be scared of the sharpness. If you are careful and treat them with the same respect as any other blade, then you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I was using mercer blades (not sure thats spelled right and don&#x27;t have them in front of me) These blades are absolutely superior in every way. They were recommended to me by a co worker and I have yet to find a better razor blade and they aren&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> Very thin but extremely sharp blades.  Last about five shaves. Wrappers for each blade are thin so handle by the edges or get cut. I plan to buy more since they are so cheap and give a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same blade for about 4 rounds of shaving, doesn&#x27;t even seem to be dull yet. In a year when I run out again I will definitely be ordering the same package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use approx five blades... I&#x27;m new to the safety razor scene. So far I&#x27;m pleased with the product. never hesitate to buy quality.</li>
            <li> I started using a double edge razor about six weeks ago after tiring of the cost of Gilette Fusion blades.  Have tried Lord, Merkur and Derby blades.  Just tried my first Feather blade, and it is FAR superior to the others.  It shaves extremely close and is not too sharp if little or no pressure is applied while shaving.  In combination with Proraso cream this is the best double edge shave you can get.  I actually look forward to shaving in the morning.  What used to be a dull routine is now almost fun.</li>
            <li> I have been using Merkurs for the last two years, and was interested in seeing what else was out there.  Positive reviews led me to try the Feather.    Many of the reviews make it seem like they are so sharp they should be illegal, and that it will take several weeks of blood and carnage until one masters them.  I have not found this to be the case at all.    They are sharp, but not insanely sharp.  They seem to hold their edge longer than the Merkur, so I get three shaves out of it instead of the two I was used to with Merkur.  By the end of the third go, it&#x27;s done.  So, it&#x27;s more economical.    The shave is nice, close and comfortable.  I&#x27;ll stick with these.    Disclaimer: my whiskers are pretty think, so if you have thin/fine whiskers it may be too much.  Also, you are steaming your face with a towel before you shave, and then using a pre-shave oil, shaving soap and a brush, right?  Using a safety razor without these elements is like putting a Ferrari engine in a Prius.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp &amp; last long. Most importantly, they provide a suprbly close shave. Delivery was quick. Go with these.</li>
            <li> Work great, close shave. Just long delivery time.</li>
            <li> These were for my son, he says they are much nicer in his skin than the shark blades . He has a Edwin Jagger razor.  My husbad uses a Merkel and he does mind the sharks at all.  But these have made all the difference for my sons experience. They showed up quicker than expected too.</li>
            <li> I love feather blades. These may work for you but everybody is different. Perfect for my coarse, wire-like face hairs. Hi-Ya!</li>
            <li> I have the following brands for many years:&lt;br /&gt;Gillette, wilkinson, Merkur, and many others but these three I consider to be the best until I discover the  Feather brand and believed to be just a tad better but don&#x27;t forget that sometimes you might get a badge that might of been finished 5 minutes before quitting time on a Friday afternoon and there you have it, here is a little tip to get the extra shave from any double edge blade, put the blade inside of a clear drinking glass against the inside and run it back and forth from left to right with your index finger a few times then flip over and do it again, it works for me try it you have nothing to loose but a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Probably the best razor that I&#x27;ve found to shave with. Allow more time for delivery since they&#x27;re shipped from Asia.</li>
            <li> I tried a Feather blade in a sampler pack I bought on Amazon, and out of all the blades, I felt that the Feather blade gave me the closest shave. They are very sharp as other reviews have stated, so you really need to make sure your blade angle is spot on and you&#x27;re not applying any pressure. I&#x27;m very satisfied with these blades and will continue to buy them for my safety razor.</li>
            <li> The best razor - lasts a long time and provides the cleanest shave.  The price is also a bargain - highly recommended</li>
            <li> I like these razors, although I don&#x27;t like them any better than the Personnas and they&#x27;re a little more expensive. Still a very good value. They also took awhile to arrive probably since they came from Thailand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new at DE shaving. I have been doing this now about 6 months. I made the right decision early to buy a sampler pack of different blades because I will say different blades work differently for different people. If I had thought all blades were the same and just stayed with the blade that came with my razor, I probably would have went back to disposable shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But having used Feather blades has just made shaving for me a pleasure! I never thought I&#x27;d ever say that about \\&quot;having to shave\\&quot; as I now see it as \\&quot;wanting to shave.\\&quot; Feathers seem to be sharper than most blades on the market and work great for me. I get several shaves out of just one blade. I&#x27;ll never buy another brand.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best blades that money can buy. I have used other brands in the past, but these shave smooth as without all of the irritation of other blades. I highly recommend these and will be buying them again..</li>
            <li> I use these blades in my Merkur model 180 safety razor. I&#x27;m currently sporting a seasonally appropriate beard, but during the summer, these are the blades I gravitated towards. After buying a sample pack that included seven different blades, I found the Feather blades to be the best. I do about two passes a day and the blades stay sharp for about a week to a week and a half. After each shave, I rinse with rubbing alcohol and leave them to dry.</li>
            <li> I use them for a cheap double edge safety and they work great! Nothing negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> 2nd best blade I&#x27;ve tried, but still a distant 2nd.  For my pretty tough beard, these work quite a bit better and aren&#x27;t so prone to nicks &amp;#62; &amp;#62; &amp;#62; Crystal &amp;#34;SUPER +&amp;#34; Stainless Steel Platinum Coated Double Edge Safety Razor Blades A.K.A Israeli Personnas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Stainless-Platinum-Israeli-Personnas/dp/B002CE3518/ref&#x3D;sr_1_26?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1430997130&amp;sr&#x3D;1-26&amp;keywords&#x3D;safety+razor+blades</li>
            <li> Best shave ever my husband claims</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used a couple dozen of these. Consistent quality and very sharp. I&#x27;m using them with a Weishi 9306CL and get a nice smooth shave with little irritation every time. I like these better than the handful of other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Allegedly, the sharpest blades made. Personally, I think they&#x27;re fine but then I also found several other brands like Astra to be fine. I wish I were as tough as my beard, and grew as fast. I know the whole ritual surrounding shaving with a safety razor (I have two Merkurs) but in the end I can shave just as well with these in the shower as I can over the sink - and never, ever cut myself. And that&#x27;s all without shaving cream. If I do use them &amp;#34;properly&amp;#34; with excellent shaving cream(s), I will admit that it is much easier. I just get LAZY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With or without shaving cream (and Floids pre-shave oil which is the BEST EVER) I still have to work very hard to get a close shave - that&#x27;s just how difficult my beard is I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying the Feather and forget all of the hoopla and warnings. It&#x27;s just a blade. Or get one of those packs that has several brands in it so you can allegedly compare... which I found very hard to do in the end because you&#x27;re never really using them simultaneously.</li>
            <li> quality construction, excellent edge, long lasting.  fits well within my feather de razor.  a great value also.  no more cartridge buys!</li>
            <li> Feather are simply high quality, extremely sharp razor blades. I highly recommend them, but not for new users of manual razors. It&#x27;s probably a better idea to start with a standard brand and wait to move to Feather once your face has adjusted to this type of shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall: After trying BIC, Derby, and Personna DE blades these have become my favorite. I can&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d ever go back to the others. They&#x27;re super sharp and maintain their sharpness well. I was getting irritation with the other blades I tried and that irritation went away very shortly after switching to theses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Sharp&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I was hesitant to try these at first because of their reputation for being so sharp. I was careful the first few times I used them but frankly can&#x27;t quite see what all the fuss was about. If you don&#x27;t know how to properly shave with a DE razor you&#x27;re probably likely to cut yourself with whatever blade you use. As soon as you get the technique down I think it&#x27;s safe to switch to these.</li>
            <li> Been using this brand for years great product.</li>
            <li> as a new shaver i went shark and no nono this blade is the blade for me and thisseller has the best price so close so smooth and i can get a few uses out of it in fact im going to go shave right now</li>
            <li> Bought a merkur razor and it came with the merkur blade. Second shave was harsh. This feather blade, however, was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started shaving with safety razors and I immediately prefer it over our new conventional models. As a recommendation though, use pre oil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Feather blades for several years now.  This shipment arrived promptly, was priced well and did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> The razors are definitely sharp as advertised, it just took a long time to receive them once I made the purchase. If i knew it was going to take that long I would have gone to the local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using a shaving soap with these razors to avoid razor burn. Commercial shaving creams like Edge and Barbasol dry out too fast causing more drag along the face. This brand of razor is a little lighter than your standard double edge blade so take your time and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure. The shaving soap will help with less drag. I suggest the Old Post Road Oil company brand...it has a pleasant scent and it&#x27;s way less expensive than your standard commercial brands. The initial cost is $10.00 but you get at least 180 shaves as opposed to the 15 to 20 shaves from you standard gels and shaving creams. Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> I read a review on these and took a leap of faith. Haven&#x27;t bought another type of blade since.</li>
            <li> I give these blades 5 stars because not only are they sharp they last a long time. I&#x27;m a new user of these type of razors and I have not cut myself I just take my time in shaving and shave in the shower and I love the shave I get from these blades, I highly recommend these blades to all you guys thinking about trying this type of shaving.</li>
            <li> Sharp!  These have made my DE shaving experience much better.  Amazing what a quality blade will do.  Excellent price.  Cartridges no more!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted a year of my life using Wally Wilkinson swords!  What the heck was I thinking.  I have now seen the light.  Feathers are unreal.  These blades last many times as long as the swords, and are so sharp that it feels like the razor has the texture of an ice-cube as it goes across your face.  I will be sticking with these from now on.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a dated reference to lead with, but you gotta go old school if you use a safety razor. I know safety razors came out post-Twain, but I gotta give the old guy credit. He kicked major ass. Now to these razor blades, I first learned using the &amp;#34;Stainless Steel Platinum Coated Double Edge Safety Razor Blades A.K.A Israeli Personnas.&amp;#34; They weren&#x27;t super sharp, but they gave me a pretty close shave. I decided to go for the full monty despite people telling me to tread softly. The first time I used the Feather blades I threw caution to the wind and said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a bad ass and can straight shave like a boss.&amp;#34; About a quarter of the way through I noticed the red mist of death: tons of tiny little wounds opened all across my shaving area(or my canvas of handsome as I like to call my face). This immediately made me realize I must respect the feather if I hope to get better(TM, don&#x27;t steal that line!). I slowly and I mean slowly used the blades on my face after that. I took longer to shave to make sure I mastered it. As I gained proficiency, I slowly increased my speed until I could get out of a shave with only one knick on my neck area. When I rubbed my hand across my face after, it felt like I&#x27;d never had facial hair in my entire life. That&#x27;s no easy feat given my manly beardness. I recommend these to people with patience who don&#x27;t look at something new or difficult then dismiss it as to hard. Your end reward is the best shave you&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> After shaving with the Merkur Futur and Merkur blades for over two years I came across these blades and looked at the reviews.  After shaving one time with the Feather Blades these are absolutely amazing.  I have a course beard and these blades cut through the hair like nothing else.  Best blades hands down and worth the extra cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of the reviews related to bleeding and nicks I would suggest going back to a different blade until your technique improves.  These are great!</li>
            <li> These were my 2nd blades and I found them to be exceedingly sharp.  It goes very smooth over my skin and I can barely feel it cutting.  Great blades but are pricier than others.  I might give some of the less expensive brands a try.</li>
            <li> After hearing how sharp Feathers are and wondering if the horror stories were true, I finally built up the nerve to order a small sample of these legendary blades. I use an Edwin Jagger De89 barley chrome razor and it is well known for it&#x27;s mild shave. Using Derbys and Astras I get a close, close shave along with some ever so slight irritation. Very slight....so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference in the Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after using them for a couple of weeks, they are slowly becoming my go-to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll deal with the stories of how scary sharp these are. I don&#x27;t find them to be that much sharper than an Astra but a good deal sharper than a Derby. Utilizing almost zero pressure with the EJ and letting the weight do the work, the Feathers cleanly slice the whiskers....so much so that you can hear them give way to the edge. So far, I haven&#x27;t had the first cut or weeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mileage varies tremendously in wet shaving but I have somewhat sensitive skin (rosacea)and a standard beard. The Feathers have almost eliminated little red bumps that I have always had on my neck. I was getting better results with the Astras in that realm but the Feathers help even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they are kind to my skin and are very sharp without causing nicks. How about the shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utilizing a three pass system (with the grain, against the grain, and then a cold water with the grain touch up), I get absolutely BBS results. Any direction that I run the back of my hand or fingers I can&#x27;t feel stubble until later on in the day. Extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been changing the blades every couple of shaves just to treat myself but figure I could get four or five days worth out of a single blade. But I like things at their sharpest whether it be my nakiri vegetable slicing blade or my Victorinox Farmer in my pocket. So I treat myself with a fresh blade on a semi daily basis. Life is too short not to splurge a little. If I am taking the time to whip up a great lather with a nice badger brush and do all the prep stuff required, why ruin the experience with a dull blade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for about five years now with a Merkur razor and also a Feather plastic razor. Absolutely no complaints. They last a long time, the quality is consistent and they are some of the sharpest blades around.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with some other brands like Merkur and still come back to Feather.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing.  My journey into wet shaving was not complete until I found Feather.  It really does make all the difference.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them a whole lot since I only need to shave once every couple weeks, but so far these blades are great.  They are sharp and were fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Great results with my Merkur Vision. OK with my EJ. Like all blades, depends on the individual preference. Compared to the price of cartridge razors, definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> These blades are great.  They are very sharp and last for a very long time.  I used to switch my blade every two weeks; with these I get 3, sometimes even 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t buy any other blades now.</li>
            <li> These cut very well with the grain...but go against the grain and they will make you cry like a little girly man.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you stay away from these as they are overpriced as it is.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades, don&#x27;t even hesitate to buy them.  The Derbys are like shaving with a dull rock in comparison.</li>
            <li> They are very good and for the price for quantity I received I think that is a great value. Thank you for your help.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these are definitely the finest blades on the market for DE razors.  But they simply don&#x27;t work the best for me, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it could be technique-related, but I feel as if the blades from Derby seem to work better on my face.  I have extraordinarily sensitive skin on my neck, so I&#x27;m wondering if perhaps these blades are simply *too* sharp for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not a negative review on the blades as they are fantastic, but simply worth noting that you will probably want to try a few different blades before settling on your favorite as \\&quot;sharpest\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean \\&quot;the best for your face\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful service through Amazon as usual.</li>
            <li> I repeat: great razors! I get multiple uses from each one, and each shave is soft and sweet. Good price, too.</li>
            <li> As a long time user of Shark blades I decided to change brands on the recommendation of others. These last about 3x as long as sharks and I found that the Sharks are a bit of false economy as these are a better value. Because they last longer and are sharper they don&#x27;t require replacement as often and one&#x27;s costs end up being less.</li>
            <li> Sharp enough to cut through 4 or 5 days worth of beard growth. You do need to take a little extra care and not use any pressure with these as they are SHARP. They also last, I can easily use a blade 5 or 6 times, if I shaved daily I could probably get more uses out of them but I like to grow my facial hair out before shaving it off. Using these blades lets me whack right through the brush without having to trim with an electric razor first.</li>
            <li> best, sharpest DE razor blades available.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for a very competitive price. I can recommend this seller to anyone who needs these types of Razor Blades.</li>
            <li> If you like a sharp razor these are the ones you want. However I am an impatient shaver and like to get it over with as quickly as possible. After two blades I gave the rest to my son. These are excellent blades once you get used to them, I can&#x27;t but will not downgrade them.</li>
            <li> These blades are coated with platinum and produced by a machine. You can&#x27;t get any sharper than feather blades. The good thing about their sharpness is that they won&#x27;t lag when moving across your face. It makes for a cleaner, less irritating shave, plus no pulling of multiple blade fiascos. If you know what you&#x27;re doing, and go slowly, you won&#x27;t cut yourself again!</li>
            <li> This is a great choice when it comes to blades. Fast shipment nicely packaged for shipment and for home storage. I will purchase these again when I replenish my stock.</li>
            <li> I started using an old school Gillette razor and wasn&#x27;t sure what blade brand to use.  After trying numerous brands, I found the feather blades to work best with the least, if any, razor burn.  As long as I don&#x27;t use the blade too many times I get a nice clean shave.  The package also has a little opening to slide the used razors into, very nice extra feature.</li>
            <li> The blades are high quality and give a great, close shave.  I recommend these blades to anyone that shave with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> thought all blades where the same was proven wrong with these blades super high quality and you will have an enjoyable shave</li>
            <li> So far Feathers are the sharpest double edged safety blades I&#x27;ve used.  The value is when you do not get razor burn on your neck. I recommend them highly.  Old razor burn from (what I guess) is duller blades have finally healed.  be careful using as they are really sharp.</li>
            <li> When I started shaving with a DE razor, I used Derby blades. They were fine. My facial hair has become much darker and thicker since then. When I ran out of Derby&#x27;s, I switched to a generic brand found at CVS. They worked well until I noticed how much thicket my beard was, and how difficult shaving had become. I then switched to Feather based upon many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man, they are sharp. After shaving with Feather blades for months, I was experiencing a close shave with little to no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ran out of Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to Derby&#x27;s. I bought 100 of them. I used one blade. It essentially pulled my hairs out because it was so dull. Mid-shave, I switched to a Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock. Afterwards I promptly ordered some more Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are just superior to all the other blades I have tried. I don&#x27;t think I could ever switch to a different blade at this point. It was just so unbearably difficult to try and shave with a Derby after having used Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It trains good technique, low pressure use, etc. If you are used to using duller blades, all things the same, you might cut yourself quite badly during your first shave with a Feather. Just a warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with everything else shaving related, your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I can only buy Merkur or Gillette blades locally, so I tried some of these Feather blades via mail-order. They&#x27;re okay, not the best. Not sure they&#x27;re worth the hassle of ordering and then waiting.</li>
            <li> VERY sharp blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for against the grain passes. But you need to be careful since it doesn&#x27;t take too much pressure to give yourself a gash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are expensive though, but you pay for the quality i guess. I was warned of their sharpness but i thought i was ready being a derby extra blade user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at the sharpness. I personally believe that the sharper the blade &#x3D; fewer passes necessary &#x3D; less irritation</li>
            <li> Nice Wet Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use shave soap and a boar brush but I need to warm up my face or these blades will leave me with cuts all over my face (all blades do this to me). Once I get lathered up with warm water and the soap I start my shave. These blades works great. I let the blade do the work and I get a smooth shave. I can use each blade about 5 times before I have to change it out which means its only about $.10 a shave. I will buy these again when I run out.</li>
            <li> These were part of a Christmas package I gave my son, which also included a razor and brush stand. He has told me that these are the best blades so this review is not from personal experience. He really gets a smooth, close shave using these.</li>
            <li> The blade is so smooth, it just glides on your skin. love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny, even though this is the sharpest blade I&#x27;ve ever own, i don get any bumps or cuts. This is a top of the line blade right here!</li>
            <li> Hands down, best blades on the market. My face has never felt smoother and they are easy to shave with on top of it all.</li>
            <li> Arrived nicely. All there in black 5 packs.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving about three months ago. I purchased a new Merkur Futur and a variety sample pack of blades. I jumped in with reckless abandon, trying a different blade every other shave or so. I had read up and knew the warnings about Feather blades being mercilessly sharp and to be sure if you are a newbie (me), develop your technique and above all, respect these blades! I did neither and went ahead and tried the Feather blade after only a week or so of shaves. Big mistake. I thought I was ready for them but wound up cutting myself up pretty badly--about six or seven good nicks at least and some razor burn on the \\&quot;problem\\&quot; area on my neck. I had set the Futur on \\&quot;2\\&quot;.  I promptly removed that blade and slowly recovered from the episode (I didn&#x27;t shave for four days). Okay, lesson learned. This past week, about three months into wet shaving, I saw the Feathers in the drawer and figured, what the heck....I must have learned something by now! I loaded a Feather in the Futur and set it on \\&quot;1.5\\&quot;. Well, let me tell you I achieved the best shave to date without a nick or burn! Fantastic! I have now used them for four or five shaves and every one has been perfect with no irritation or cuts! I have settled in with the Futur set to \\&quot;2\\&quot;. My \\&quot;touch\\&quot; now is extremely light with no pressure exerted other than that which the razor&#x27;s weight against the skin exerts. So, the moral of the story is, if you have a proper technique, and, by this I mean a consistent blade angle of attack and a consistent light touch (letting the blade and razor do the work) then Feather blades are the ultimate as far as I am concerned. I have also been \\&quot;corking\\&quot; my blades before first use. I lightly pass them through 1/8\\&quot; cork once on both sides. My theory on this is that it will remove any residual manufacturing lubricants...basically, it cleans the blade. I don&#x27;t necessarily buy into it any deeper than that.</li>
            <li> I am still somewhat new to double edge shaving, and I had heard that Feather is an &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; blade.&lt;br /&gt;I hesitantly decided to try them, and they are in fact extremely sharp. There is a big difference between these and the Dorco blades I started with.&lt;br /&gt;They provide a very close shave, but I am not sure that I am ready for them yet. I have cut myself several times.&lt;br /&gt;I will probly go back to the Dorco blades till I get more experience.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of experience with traditional shaving and you want to experience a real high performance blade, the Feathers are for you. Just use them with caution.</li>
            <li> I discovered these when I purchased a &amp;#34;variety pack&amp;#34; of different brand blades (from Amazon). I wanted to see if there was a blade that worked better on my face and beard than the brand I was currently using (Personna). The Feather provided a noticeably better and closer shave than all of the other brands in the variety pack, and slightly better than the Personna I had been using. I ended up buying more of the Feather&#x27;s as they really do give me a much closer shave with no pulling and minimal nicks and cuts. And having them come in little plastic boxes is a great convenience as your used blade slides into a slot and are safely stored in the box. When you use the last blade in the box just toss it in the trash without fear of the used blades cutting you or someone else. And the 5-blade package is really convenient for traveling with extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Note: everyone&#x27;s face and beard is different. Just because these Feather blades worked great for me doesn&#x27;t mean they will for you. If you want to try different blades I highly recommend buying one of the variety packs that provide you with a multitude of different brand blades. It&#x27;s an inexpensive way to experiment with different blades.</li>
            <li> After trying a few sampler packs, these Feather blades have stood out as the best blade for me. (Although as is always the case with shaving, different blades work for everybody. They&#x27;re very sharp, and hold up decently for at least three shaves. Definitely practice your technique before trying them, because you can definitely slice yourself if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> A great deal .... SHARP and ready to go! I get my best shave with these! They shave well and don&#x27;t get clogged up like my atra  even when I have heavy stubble.</li>
            <li> I bought one of those multi-packs of razor blades, tried them all, and kept notes.  The winner is Feather.  Surprisingly Gillette 7&#x27;O&#x27;clocks and Bics were close behind; cheapies.  But the Feathers are the best... worth the extra money.  Still much cheaper than cartridge shaving, and once you get the hang of it, much better of a shave.</li>
            <li> I first came on the DE scene about a year ago. After doing some careful research, which entailed looking at the aggregate pros and cons of customer reviews, I decided that 1) a cheaper razor was probably the way to go in case I didn&#x27;t like DE shaving, and 2) if I decided that continuing with DE shaving would be in my best interest, I would upgrade to Feather blades. I originally purchased the LORD brand razor because it received glowing reviews from most users. I also selected LORD brand blades based on similar marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few cuts during the first few shaves, but was soon able to have the smoothest shave ever with just two passes. I replaced my blade a bit more often than I would have liked, but I kept telling myself it was because I was using entry level gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having completed a year, I switched to Feathers expecting at least as close a shave as I was getting before only with blades that would last longer. This blade butchered me the first time, and the shave wasn&#x27;t as close. The second time, I was a bit more careful. No cuts, but a little burn (something I did not experience with the LORDs), and not nearly as close as the first time. The third time, I decided I would be extremely careful and slow down a bit. I got nicks, cuts, and burn the third time around and promptly switched back to LORD brand blades. They won&#x27;t last as long, but at the overall shave experience is better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I tried these blades the first time and reviewed them, I&#x27;ve lost 45 lbs. My face is much thinner now, and since I kept the Feather blades, I tried them out again with a thinner face. What a difference! Despite the fact that the shave is much better, I&#x27;ll keep the star rating the same for the following reasons: 1) dudes with a little facial bloating (like I used to be) may have a hard time with this blade still, and 2) the Feather blades shave at least as well as my LORD brand blades when I take my time, only the LORDs arecheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should still try  a sampler pack to figure out what works best for you, and if Feather blades are to your liking, go for it.</li>
            <li> Razors come in a little container and are packaged well and are new. My hubby uses this brand religiously for shaving and has had only stellar experiences with it.</li>
            <li> Ive used a bunch of blades and was wondering if there was anything to name brand or getting featherblades for feather razors. Honestly I cant tell to much of a difference, the shave feels the same, albeit good.</li>
            <li> Love these razors. I started safety-razor shaving a few years back after years of Mach 3 use. Will not be going back. The word needs to get out: Stop buying disposable razors. Close, clean, quick, and bump-free. These work great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. My husband loves these razors and I love the value package. It saves me from having to constantly order and they are priced great. They always some quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> These were the first I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I have nothing to compare them too. They work very well. s</li>
            <li> I recently started shaving with DE blades and have only tried two different brands, so I don&#x27;t have much for comparison. The first brand I tried was Bic and they were good as starter blades, but seemed to be not sharp enough for me at times, especially around the tougher areas of my face. The Bic blades were too dull to use after 3-4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews that said how great and sharp the Feather blades are, so I decided to give them a try. I am thoroughly impressed with these blades. They really are a lot sharper and give me a much easier shave. I am no longer snagging in some of the more difficult areas like I was with the Bic blades. The Feather blades also last much longer for me, a week or more. They are definitely worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any irritation with these, but if you are not careful and rush, it is easy to nick yourself with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> My Edwin Jagger came with Derby blades, so naturally those were the first I used. I had just made the switch to wet shaving and my first shaves with the Derbys were a big disappointment. The shave was close enough, not much of an improvement from what I was getting before, but the major con was the irritation and bleeding I was getting. The Derbys weren&#x27;t sharp enough and required multiple passes to get a decent shave, which caused a lot of irritation. I read some reviews and hoped that the Feathers would be better, and I took a gamble and bought a pack of 30 blades. They did not disappoint, very close shave with fewer passes and little to no irritation, and I have a thick beard...and when I say thick I mean it. I&#x27;m Armenian and I usually have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow right after I shave, so if you&#x27;re in a similar situation and want a closer shave, go for the sharpest blades out there and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, received in a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li> What can anyone say about Feather blades?  They are extremly sharp and long lasting and work wonderfully with my Merkur razor. I have tried others but have always come back to Feather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect nothing less from Feather. They give you a close shave... if you have the technique and prep routine to support it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors will not automatically impart skill upon you. You need repetition and the experience that comes with it. If you&#x27;re just starting out with Straight Razors or Safety Razors then you would benefit from changing out blades more often. Maybe every 3-4 shaves, if not less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about these blades in a good Safety Razor is the feedback you&#x27;ll get. If you attempt an against-the-grain cut with a bad angle or too much pressure you&#x27;ll feel the blade jump or dig. These blades aren&#x27;t too hardcore for the beginner, but a beginner should most certainly take more time and perhaps use a longer prep period to get ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your shave is only as good as your prep.</li>
            <li> Just great cane on time and the blade is nice and sharp iys what you expect from feather blades</li>
            <li> Writing a review for razor blades is kind of like reviewing a movie. Not everyone likes the same stuff. So, even though I don&#x27;t particularly like these Feather blades doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s something wrong with them. They&#x27;re just not for me. I found the Feather blades to be sharp, almost too sharp if that is possible. They really tore up my face with little nicks, and I am by no means a novice safety razor shaver. If you&#x27;re unsure buy a small lot to see if they work for you or not. Personally I like my Astra blades paired with my Merkur, but again that&#x27;s my preference.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Feather blades then I would highly recommend you do.  These blades glide through my beard like nothing.  I have a pretty tough beard and sensitive skin and these blades have helped me get a better shave.  Combine these with a good brush and either soap or cream.  DE blades are awesome if you want a close shave.  I stopped using cartridge razors a long time ago because I felt like I was throwing money away.  I also found that those razors with multiple blades actually don&#x27;t do any good for my skin.  Since going to a DE razor and feather blades, I&#x27;ve noticed that they really minimize irritation/burn.  Give Feather blades a try if you&#x27;re just getting into wet shaving.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> These arrived much quicker that I expected.  They are just as sharp as most people claim.  Very close shave and very smooth.  I use them in an Edwin Jagger DE89L and have no problems at all as far as being &amp;#34;too sharp&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are among the sharpest made and very smooth.  I highly recommend them for anyone&lt;br /&gt;who wants a close shave.</li>
            <li> Got a safety razor with Shark blades - they were ok but these rock with a really nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, as a razor blade needs to be, to reduce pull. Blade lasts 4 days for me. I recommend these. The key to a good shave seems to be to pick a good blade, then stay with it to learn how to use that brand of blade.</li>
            <li> I have the Edwin Jagger DE razor which is a more milder design so I picked these blades. I noticed that going with the grain, this misses a lot more then other blades. Going against the grain it&#x27;s the closest shave I have had. My face and neck bleed a lot when I first started using these but now I know how to control them. I still use a Mach razor for days that I need to rush.</li>
            <li> The Feather New Hi-Stainless is currently my preferred, \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; blade.  While there are plenty of double edge (DE) blades I have yet to try, I have been able to try several other blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather \\&quot;wins\\&quot; because of its sharpness.  In other words, it is SHARP!  If you have gotten your DE technique and face prep down, then this blade will not let you down.  The flip side of that is ... if you are brand new to DE shaving or have not yet been able to achieve a smooth, nick-free and super-close shave, then beware.  You may not yet be ready for the Mighty Feather.  :)  (Keep the styptic pencil handy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say this blade, while extremely sharp, is not as smooth as some others and doesn&#x27;t provide as many good shaves as it might.  So far I have found this to not be true for me.  I can routinely get 3 great shaves out of a Feather, and the 4th shave is at least very good, if not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all blades, your choice of razor makes a difference.  In my Merkur 38C razor, this blade is the perfect choice.  The Feather Portable is a lot more aggressive than the 38C, so my first shave with a Feather/Feather combination was not nearly as good or comfortable.  It wasn&#x27;t horrible, and I think I can now do better since I&#x27;ve had more experience with the Portable.  But that said, if you use the Feather blade in a more aggressive or adjustable razor, take care with your technique and/or setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/13/08:  As my prep has improved, I have discovered that the Feather is even better than my initial comments indicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, as to longevity:  Just for kicks I decided to see how many shaves I could get out of a single Feather blade.  With meticulous face prep, I actually got TEN shaves out of one blade!  I grant that the last few shaves were not as smooth and comfortable as the first several, BUT there were no nicks or cuts, and virtually all the shaves were superior to first shaves with some blades I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as to smoothness:  Better prep also has meant my impression of the Feather&#x27;s smoothness has increased.  At this point it is edged out by a whisker by the Gillette Stainless Platinum (aka \\&quot;Swedes\\&quot;, though they&#x27;re actually made in Poland), but the difference is not huge.  And the Swede is just a bit less sharp than the Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently testing some Feathers that received cryogenic treatment.  I&#x27;m not sure yet what that entails, but the cryo treatment kicks the Feather up a notch in terms of smoothness.  It&#x27;s not quite a Swede, but is closer.  YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather is still my favourite blade.  Since writing this review I have been able to use the French Gillette Bleue blades, which a friend obtains for me whenever she is in France.  I find them extremely close to the Feather in sharpness, and subjectively they seem smoother.  The Bleues also seem better than the Gillette \\&quot;Sweedes\\&quot;.  Again, YMMV.pression of the Feather&#x27;s smoothness has increased.

            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with other blades as I have just started shaving with a DE. But, these things a sharp and did a good job of getting rid of my week old growth.</li>
            <li> A nice blade and a smooth cut and I am able to get a few more shaves than other blades I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of blades by purchasing sample packs. I keep coming back to this blade. It gives me the best shave of any of the 20-some blades I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;This blade is the Chuck Norris of razor blades. Just being in the same room with it may cause you injury if you don&#x27;t respect the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Look at them wrong and odds are you&#x27;ll be losing an eye.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - they are that sharp.&lt;br /&gt;If your technique is to use pressure and &#x27;help&#x27; the blade do its work, you&#x27;ll upset the blade and it will let you know it.&lt;br /&gt;However - if you just let the blade glide and do its work for you, the blade will be happy and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a fantastic shave that takes almost no effort.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember - If Chuck Norris were a razor blade, he would be this one. We all know Chuck Norris doesn&#x27;t need a razor blade because he just tells his beard how to grow. For the rest of us, there&#x27;s these blades.</li>
            <li> The  product is great. But 30 for $17.99 is expensive when you can get the shark brand at 100 for $15.99</li>
            <li> When the individual blade is a good one, I can get nice close shaves without cutting myself.  However, once in a while you get a blade that is not as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as the rest of them which results in nicks.  But when the blade is good, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Sharpest blades I&#x27;ve used... I&#x27;ve used Merkur blades and some generic DE&#x27;s from Walgreens. Pretty new to DE shaving and need to try more brands, but I&#x27;d have to agree with the other reviewers, they are SHARP! And they&#x27;ve destroyed my neck a few times when I was in a hurry... Hehehe, still learning. However, when you take the time tho, Feathers give a GREAT shave. FYI, I&#x27;m using them with a Merkur razor and Ultimate Comfort shave cream from Truefitt &amp; Hill. Truefitt &amp; Hill make excellent shave creams, much better than Art of Shaving in my opinion. The scented stuff is a little strong for my tastes, and I think it was irritating my skin a little. My method for the best shave: (1) steam my face over a skillet of boiling water for 5 min (easier than a hot towel, and seems to do the trick, BIG improvement over just lathering up). (2) Create the warm lather in a bowl using a badger hair brush. (3) Apply lather with my hands (less irritation than the badger hair brush allowing for a second pass). (4) Shave... with the grain. (5) Repeat lather and shave for second pass (mostly with the grain, some days its against the grain on the second pass). Finish off with another 5 min of the steam treatment. If i do this with care, most days I don&#x27;t even need after shave balm, would like to try Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s skin food tho. Oh, almost forgot an important detail... never wash your face! I was washing washing my face with regular bar soap twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, and my skin was really drying out and making it difficult to make more than one pass a day. Stopped washing my face and presto! clean shave and healthy skin. I&#x27;m guessing I could probably wash with a more mild facial soap... but I really don&#x27;t think its necessary. In my mind, the simple fact of lathering (shave creams are basically mild soaps with hair softeners and lubricants) and shaving should be enough to cleanse and remove any dead skin. I&#x27;m sharing this because I wish someone had told me thisbefore I started... would&#x27;ve have saved me some pain and frustration. Really digging the results now, tho... hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Holy platinum, these are astonishingly sharp. I snap them in half and use them in a cheap disposable-blade straight razor (also from Amazon!). They have to be bent almost all the way back on themselves to snap (I do it with the wrapper still on, works fine, just don&#x27;t press on the edges). Once that&#x27;s done, they shave great and are more than scary sharp -- think surgical. Far sharper than the Shark blades also available on Amazon. I use a fresh blade every time for my face, but I have very thick hair and delicate skin -- with lighter hair and/or thicker skin I think you could get two or three uses out of these.</li>
            <li> As the title says it. Smooth and precise. It shaves very well leaving little to no \\&quot;wounds\\&quot; like previously experienced with other razor blades. I use it with Parker SR1 stainless steel and it is a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I shaved with it, every week only once is enough for me,,, my wife comes around touching all over the face and asking HOW do you shave that smoothly :D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I am sharing too much. Anyways, probably I won&#x27;t change from this brand for some long time, or when a better alternative comes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the regular American brands and even the Merkur blades from Germany.  I don&#x27;t know how Feather can make a blade that&#x27;s so much sharper than all the modern razor blades but believe me, they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first try one be sure to look very closely in the mirror.  I cannot feel the blade pulling at my whiskers, unlike every other blade, so at first I thought I needed to adjust my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have to use a deft hand, however, because being this sharp means you can also cut yourself even easier.</li>
            <li> These are well-made blades. I disagree with them being the best ever though. I didn&#x27;t get a much closer shave than the derby blades I was using before. I do notice that I get 1 extra shave out of the Feathers than I did with the derby blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty coarse beard, so maybe that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t get a much closer shave over the Derby blades. Or maybe my technique just isn&#x27;t as honed as others. I will purchase these again since I get more mileage out of them.</li>
            <li> These blades are exceptionally sharp!  Don&#x27;t use them if you are new to safety razors!  I have tried many blades and these were the only ones that could maintain sharpness during an entire shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this together with a safety razor. They have lasted a good long time. Its been months and I just cracked the second box. They are better than what came with  the razor, It will be a while before I try something else. I probably would buy again, after I try some others of course.</li>
            <li> Looking for fine blades at a reasonable price.  These fit the requirement.  Clean smooth shave, every time. I will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> I have been using a safety razor for a long time now and have tried a lot of blades, and the Feather blades are still the best that I have tried. Some say that they are too sharp, but for me they are perfect as they easily glide through my coarse beard.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried most of the other major brands and find that these lades work the best for my face and razor. I have used these with both my EJ and Merker razor and they work well with both.</li>
            <li> How much difference can there be between blades?  It&#x27;s a chunk of sharpened metal, same general shape, just the label is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;I had been using another brand for a few years, for some reason decided to switch it up when ordering my new supply.  These blades are so sharp and cut so smoothly I was surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my face and my head with a double edge razor, but had stopped using it on my head after a while.  I began once again with these blades, since they get the job done without issue and leave me unbelievably smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews put fear in me to try these.  Don&#x27;t worry about it.  As long as you are used to shaving, taking your time like you are supposed to, you will have no problem.  It is much more rare that I cut myself with these blades than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the little boxes are nifty and provide a safe place to stick the used blades when disposing of them vs tossing in the garbage loosely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> It is well worth learning how to use these blades. I can feel the Merkur blade (came with my DE razor) sawing through each hair in my beard (which is rather thick and tough). I can barely feel Feather blades cut the same swath much more closely. And yes, these do require skill and a lighter touch, but as I noted: this effort is rewarded.</li>
            <li> Killer blades!!! i switched from derby blades to feather blades and i can see the difference. i did not get any nicks and i wonder why people say that they are so dangerous. btw, im only a month DE shaver who shaves twice a week.  try them, you will not regret it</li>
            <li> I started with merkur, then switched to these ones for a smooth shaving, i recommend them, cheap and great quality</li>
            <li> I heard from various people that these blades are very sharp.  I found this to be true!  knowing this made me much more careful and forced me to use good shaving techniques.  The beard hair got sliced off with little or no drag.  I love these blades.  I&#x27;ve used merkur and wilkinson blades in the past.  I never had a problem with those either, I just like the feather ones more.  They aren&#x27;t really aren&#x27;t that much more expensive and they are still cheap compared to the Gillete Mach 5 or whatever they are up to these days.  these blades are still less than 60cents in most places.</li>
            <li> I have switched over to DE shaving after catching the \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; bug.  I started with Derby after hearing just how sharp the Feather&#x27;s blades are.  Well, I tried the Feather&#x27;s blades and I won&#x27;t be leaving them.  As a brotha with ingrown hair/bumps, I was careful at fist.  Now, I don&#x27;t have that problem.  I just put on my jazz music and commence to shaving.</li>
            <li> I have only shaved once but these blades are pretty good. I cut myself a few times so you know it gives you a close shave and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are the best shave I&#x27;ve had with a safety razor. Other brands usually leave me full of nicks and cuts. I do have very sensitive skin that is prone to razor burn and cuts, but these razors don&#x27;t leave my face and neck looking like I rubbed sandpaper on it. This beats using those expensive disposable razors.</li>
            <li> A blade basically lasts a week.  Two weeks if one doesn&#x27;t mind a few nicks.  FAR less expensive than those razors that cost about $2 a cartridge, plus there&#x27;s a visceral satisfaction that comes from shaving with a single blade.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but in a nutshell, a single-blade razor offers a smoother shave, with a better feel, than a cartridge blade shaver.  One has to respect the blade, and apply far less pressure than a multi-blade cartridge.  The bonus is these blades are far less expensive than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> After trying some of these in a sampler pack, I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;They are definitely sharper than the other blades I have tried, but I find that I cut myself less often with this sharper blade because of how smoothly it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first switched to safety razors, I wasn&#x27;t convinced that there was a significant difference between blades, but these provide a significantly better shave than the Merkurs I started with. Much less irritation.</li>
            <li> first off I never even got the chance to see the product tracking said deliver date 1 month after I placed order then got a message that they attempted the delivery and I would get it till 3 week after. so I have been checking everyday for my packaged never received a letter or card nothing. now I check and they have it as being sent back to shipper. this is bull crap I am a prime member and this is the first time this has happened to me I have been a prime member for 3 years. very bad delivery!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about a year with a Feather razor blade. They work real well. Sometimes I get 2 shaves out of a blade. Mostly, it saves me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> As good as it gets. I can&#x27;t shave with any other brand anymore. These blades are sharp and smooth!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
            <li> If you investigate the reviews for different types of blades, I think the general message is usually a very good approximation to the truth: this particular blade is no different. As a regular DE shaver, I watched the inside my bathroom cabinet&#x27;s contents evolve as I developed a better idea of what I wanted out of a shave. I want, probably, most of what you do: less time spent, longevity of the blade, cost-effectiveness, consistency, and safety. I used to see a cupboard full of sample packs, eventually, feathers plus the occasional bargain blade when the price was appealing. Today, there is and will only be feather on the shelf. Feather saves me time in the number of passes, it is absolutely not as expensive as others when you consider how frequently it dulls (re: blade longevity,) and the death of a feather blade is very gradual, allowing me to adapt my shaving accordingly without any major mishap or hiccup along the way. DE shavers, as in those who take this up as a hobby, are very knowledgeable about this type of thing (hence the consistency of the reviews,) and we should expect this, as these people tempt lady fortune and &#x27;study&#x27; the blades for around 15 minutes a day. Let me tell ya, if I cracked a book on a foreign language as often as I shaved, I&#x27;d be able to tell you by now to buy these things in a whole mess of languages; but, since the human condition forces me to deal with facial hair, I&#x27;m going to have to use English: buy these! The only caveat is that I would not recommend these for a (very) new shaver; even though these are not &#x27;more unsafe,&#x27; as a product, they will magnify the mistakes you are sure to make as a new shaver, and potentially scare you away from what should be a cost-saving, relaxing, and nostalgic experience your grandpa would have been proud you&#x27;re taking an interest in. There&#x27;s joy in the road to finding this stuff out, but I&#x27;d like to save you time: this is your likely destination as far as blade is concerned. Spend that extra blade money on the shave cream frontier or a book on Esperanto or something :)</li>
            <li> We all know the feather brand is by far the sharpest blade around. This razor provides me with nice, smooth shaves time after time. This might not be the razor for everyone, but if you haven&#x27;t tried it then it&#x27;s a must at least once.</li>
            <li> I used several brands before trying Feather. These are the only ones to buy. Don&#x27;t waste your time trying others. If you want the sharpest, smoothest blade for your shave, Feather blades are the way to go.</li>
            <li> I bought these blades based on Amazon reviews. I am certainly not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave and getting multiple uses without cuts.</li>
            <li> Past seven years i was using Merkur Rost free platinum coated blades, but went for a change and was pretty happy.  The Merkur blades are nice and sharp and so are these, but somehow just a tad sharper because I was not paying attention and just going through the motions as per normal and some skin was exfoliated without me even noticing.  Bloody sharp.  I will have to crank back my razor to a less aggressive angle of attack until the blood stops leaking out of my face and neck.  Be gentle with them if your switching from a blade with a duller edge.</li>
            <li> very sharp which is the point i&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> the blades are very sharp and do a very good job. They are sharper than the Merkur ones that came with the razor</li>
            <li> These are great blades that only require the lightest touch. I used to get razor burn until I started using a saftey razor and feather blades.</li>
            <li> Good blades, can get over ten shaves out of a blade if I don&#x27;t let my beard get to thick between shaves. I don&#x27;t like how the have word minimums for the reviews.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades give very close shave.  Recommend for experienced shavers as these are ultra sharp and will cut you easily.</li>
            <li> A lot of people say to not go with the feathers because they are so sharp, but after switching to feathers from M&#x27;s, there is no reason to go back.  I have never felt a better cut in my life, I plan on putting in a second order to stock up, and my friends are purchasing them as well after my recommendation.  Awesome product, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  This is written by a man btw on a female account haha</li>
            <li> Really sharp. Doesn&#x27;t dull after half a use when trimming my hair (yes, I use it for hair cutting and not for shaving), unlike the Shark razors I used before. I also don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to worry about running out of razors either with 30 (essentially 60) of them.</li>
            <li> Once I return to Double Edged blade shaving, I love the cost effectiveness and closeness of the shave.  Those blades are sharp and smooth.  The cost savings alone was worth the price of the razor. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you use or want to use a DE razor, I would highly suggest to ONLY use Feather blades. Best shave you will ever ever ever have.</li>
            <li> Not only do you get a close shave with no drag on the skin but the blades are good for several shaves. I use a Merkur double bladed razor, which with its heft makes a great combination with the Feather  blade.</li>
            <li> Love the feather blades. They are very sharp and give a very close shave. Also very reasonably priced especially compared to normal cartridge blade. Will definitely buy more blades from feather when I need replacements.</li>
            <li> After many years of shaving with the newest types of multi blade razors that most everyone has been using, I decided to go back to old fashioned DE shaving. Let me say from the start that I am very glad I did. Shaving has become fun, and I actually look forward to shaving every day. Ti di this I ordered a Edwin Jagger DE which came with 5 derby blades. The Derby blades were ok for just getting started, because they are not the sharpest blades and are forgiving of mistakes. I however found that they were too dull for me, I also found that DE shaving is much like riding a bike in that you never really forget how. So after 4 shaves and 1 blade I tried Wilkinson&#x27;s which were easily available at my local pharmacy, They were pretty good, much sharper than the Derby&#x27;s and I got a fairly good shave from them. I still however felt I would do better with a sharper blade, I had read many reviews of Feather, and from the reviews I could tell that the sharpness of the blades intimidated some shavers, but decided to order them anyway. I am very glad I did. Ordered them from a company whose fulfillment was done by Amazon, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait the weeks that some who order the blades wait, they arrived in 5 days along with the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving crème, and I brush and razor stand I had ordered (both great products). The blades themselves give me an excellent shave. Today marked my 7th shave with my first blade (2 passes a day for 7 days), and my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. I have also not had one nick. I highly recommend these blades for anyone who has the knack of wet shaving down. If you are still experimenting, you MIGHT want to graduate to these blades as I did.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades.  Probably my favorites but I think the packaging is misleading.  You spend WAY more for the 30 pack than you do for the 100ct.  Platinum version is BS; they are no different than the regular Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Just respect the blade.  As long as you do shafts, light pressure, the badges are very good.  This is my first time with a double edge edge razor and so far so good</li>
            <li> blades hold up really well, get a good shave,.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are simply the best. There is nothing like my first shave with a new blade; it cuts through even my thick (sometimes overgrown) beard like butter. I&#x27;ve tried many other blade brands, but this is my keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy them for your safety razor you will NOT be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for anyone with concerns over the &amp;#34;easy to cut your face&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;I bled everywhere&amp;#34;, etc comments:&lt;br /&gt;  These are all concerns based on technique. A razor is meant to be sharp. I don&#x27;t know WHAT technical mistakes someone is making that led them to &amp;#34;bleed everywhere&amp;#34;, but you can&#x27;t complain about a razor being too sharp if you are not doing it right. When I first started shaving with safety razors I made a lot more &amp;#34;horizontal&amp;#34; mistakes, but I started with this blade, and I just can&#x27;t imagine the amount of force it would have taken for some of the horrifying comments that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a  safety razor for a few years now and have tried a number of different blades.  IMHO these are NOT for the first time user...they are EXTREMELY sharp and you could do some damage if your technique is shaky...I love them but they were not my starter blade.  I bought a couple of  sampler packs over time (great way to try a bunch of different blades) and then found my way to these.  Like I said earlier, I love these blades and get a great close shave (I usually shave every 2-3 days and these blades handle my tough beard NO problem.) I get 4-6 shaves per blade..I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I cannot say they are better than other blades, but they sure are good blades. The platinum may be a name or marketing only?</li>
            <li> I will dispel some misinformation in previous reviews. Being a long time straight edge shaver and safety blade user: There are two ways to cut yourself shaving. Poor technique and a dull blade. A sharper blade reduces your risk of cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt; I recommend these blades to new and experienced shavers alike.</li>
            <li> If you want to be clean as a whistle, whether your face, head or both, then buy these blades.  It doesn&#x27;t get any cleaner without these blades, they are as sharp as you can get.  just be sure to take your time and not cut yourself.  you will sparkle after your done I promise.</li>
            <li> These were the first blades I ever tried when I got into DE. They ripped my face to pieces. I had no technique. I had no finesse. I was ignorant enough to think the Dorco&#x27;s I bought were superior blades for my face because they didn&#x27;t nick me. 6 months later. Now that I have perfected my DE technique, I can&#x27;t use any other blades except for the Feathers. I can get a BBS in two passes every time with these using my Merkur Progress. Any other blade could never give me a clean irritation free shave on my neck. But these are perfect every time. No more nicks now that I have perfected my technique. I thought the Astra&#x27;s were good blades. After using these for a couple of weeks and going back to to trying an Astra. I will never use another blade except Feathers. They are really leagues above any other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find a million or so reviews touting these blades as &#x27;sharpest&#x27; made. Capable of the finest shaves out there. First time I used them, I thought...great shave, what is all this fuss about? Then I noticed blood - all over the bathroom! Didn&#x27;t feel a thing. Just be respectful, and buy sceptic gel for your shave kit as well!</li>
            <li> item as describe, but hope you have time and other blades.  It took more than a month to arrive.  And who really knows if this is a copy or the real thing. So many things coming from china is counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Best blade I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Best Razors EVER! These blades last a very long time, and I have thick facial growth, but it does little to slow these blades down.</li>
            <li> These razors are great and sharp. They last for about 10 shaves - each blade that is. It took me just a couple uses to learn how to not cut myself - these puppies are sharp. I tried some cheaper ones and couldn&#x27;t stand them - they just didn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I will never use another razor blade again. It&#x27;s the smoothest shave ever. 1 inch beard gone in 1 round. By round 2, I look ten years younger. Use the proper stroke method, with a natural lather, and youve got an irritation free, bump free, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;My method 1st round is with the grain. the blades are so good, that by the 2nd round, you can stroke against the grain, and really get that micro stubble, and still irritation free. Try rinsing with cold water, then stroking Aloe Vera gel to seal it. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing like shaving with these blades. Its a meditative man tradition, the blade is top notch. I accidentally left it in my Merkur, then tried to board a plane. They took it, leaving me no choice but to shave for my cousins wedding with an airport Bic disposable razer. It was the worst. I lost a little bit of confidence that day, even running into my old high school sweetheart at the wedding and beautiful bridal party that I defiantly had a chance with it, because my face wasnt as smooth as it wouldve been with the Feather blades. Disposable razors feel like barb wire against your face compared to the Feather brand. I bought this 30 pack, and will continue to buy in 30 sets so that&#x27;ll never happen to me again.</li>
            <li> These are not your &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; safety razors. These are extremely sharp and provide a very smooth shaving experience. If you are a seasoned safety razor shaver and want to feel a whole new level of smoothness, then these are for you. I won&#x27;t recommend them to novice users because of their sharpness which could cut and nick your face quite easily if you are not careful, for novice users, try the merkurs or the wilkinson swords first, and then when comfortable with them, go ahead and try the Feather&#x27;s, you won&#x27;t go back to any other brand!</li>
            <li> Across for attention, along for results...  Seriously, these are very sharp blades that also last for many shaves.  I often go weekends without shaving and they perform well even after a week on nasty stubble.</li>
            <li> I recently started using a DE razor after years of using multi-blade razors. I am astounded at what a great shave I&#x27;m getting now. No more razor burn or irritation and a baby smooth face. I have to admit my first shave I was so anxious to try out my new DE razor that I pressed the blade far too hard against the skin and got some serious razor burn, but thankfully no nicks or cuts. It took 2 days to fully heal. A great lesson for me since it forced me to be much more careful and pay attention to my technique and my second shave was one of the closest and least irritating shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. Zero razor burn and my skin felt like I hadn&#x27;t even shaved. I guess I was just used to getting mild irritation from using a multi-blade razor. I am amazed that I can get such a close shave and not even a little bit of irritation. I have had a shaving revelation thanks to these blades and will never go back to the overpriced, razor burn inducing, multi-blade razors that I had been using. Just remember to take your time and don&#x27;t apply any pressure, let the razor do the work. Yes, these blades are really sharp, but used with care and patience they will reward you with an amazingly close comfortable shave and no razor burn. My skin looks so much better now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of my shave now.</li>
            <li> These are sharp..make sure you pay attention...some of the best blades around.  These do cost more..but shave your face smooth.  I have a heavy bread and I shave every morning..I get at least 3 to 5 shaves with each blade. I always have some Feathers in my cabinet..</li>
            <li> They are too sharp. It may sound crazy, but you&#x27;ll see what I mean when you try them. An old barber once told me that most people think a brand new razor will give them the best shave and they are wrong. A new razor will cut you and he couldn&#x27;t have been more correct especially with these blades. The first shave was awful, I probably had 20 nicks, despite extensive face prep and a rich lather. Second and third, not so bad, but still a few nicks. Now it shaves like a dream. Very close, no nicks, no cuts, just a nice clean shave. I honestly wish they were a bit duller out of the box, but I won&#x27;t fault the company for producing the sharpest edge possible which is why I decided it was worthy of a 5 star rating. All in all, I am satisfied. The quality is clearly there, the price is great, and shipping was fast. I will definitely order more as needed, but I expect these 30 will last me quite some time. Just be careful with these when they are new. Take it very slow because they are incredibly sharp.</li>
            <li> the culture that created the Samurai swords to create an insanely sharp blade. I just recently decided to get back into DE shaving after a 10 year or so absence and these blades are the only one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ordered since. My beard is coarse and thick and multi-directional, so I need to do a 2-3 pass shave against the grain to get that smooth finish. I&#x27;ve also hooked three friends onto DE shaving and all four of us have reached the consensus that these blades are fantastic. Some of the other blades tried were Derby, Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock, Astra and one other that I can&#x27;t quite remember. The Feathers are extremely sharp and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone that hasn&#x27;t quit figured out their technique in DE shaving yet because the blades are so sharp, you can cut yourself without knowing you cut yourself, not deep, but enough to bleed everywhere.</li>
            <li> Great Price, great product got it next day. If never shaved with this blades try it you will not regret.What more can you ask. Thank you guys</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for maybe 5 years or so now.  I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of razors and think ive settled on feather brand razors as my favorite.</li>
            <li> this blade works well for me for 3 shaves. Closer than any multi blade system. will cut yourself initially, but after 7-8 shaves, it stops. Will order again.</li>
            <li> These things are amazingly sharp.  I have a dense, beard with very coarse hair.  I can destroy a lesser razor in a single shave sometimes.  These razors glide right through with no problem, and I get several uses out of each blade.  I would recommend these to anyone who has gotten into DE shaving.  There is review after review online that will say the same thing.  I do caution new DE shavers though... these things can cut you up in a heartbeat.  Do no apply any unnecessary pressure on your razor while shaving... simply concentrate on maintaining your blade angle, let the weight of the razor do the work, and these blades will do the rest without a problem.</li>
            <li> Are you looking for a sharper Razor? Feather  De Razors are some of the best. For me I have had other razors these last and allow you at lest 4 to 5 shaves before you get dull down shaving. I would buy more and will now only use Feather.</li>
            <li> I still have to shave my neck in the summertime when the beard is short. I was introduced to Feather brand double-edged blades several years ago and have used nothing but them ever since. The steel is extremely high quality Japanese stainless, which allows the blade to be significantly thinner than lower quality blades. It is both flexible and able to keep a very sharp edge. I use a Mercury razor which keeps the blade in constant tension, curved inside the two-piece head. No matter how long I&#x27;ve kept a blade -- it can be several weeks as I don&#x27;t shave all that often -- the blade springs right out and is never set or fatigued. If you have never tried Feather blades, you are in for a very pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I replace a blade when it start pulling my beard instead of cutting it. Wilkinson Sword blades are good for 1 -2 shaves. These blades serve well for a week to two weeks before I need to replace them.</li>
            <li> Really sharp blades, cut you when you look at them. Just joking, these work great, you just have to be slower and careful with them.</li>
            <li> These Blades are the best. I&#x27;ve tried others and always end up going back to the Feather Blades. Thank god for Amazon because i&#x27;ve looked everywhere and can&#x27;t find them local.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine introduced me to method shaving via methodshavings youtube channel.  I decided to try it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  All the promises made by Charles Roberts have come true for me.  He highly recommends the Feather stainless blades and so do I.  I get three shaves per blade with no drama.  This beats cartridge razors hands down in quality of shave and price.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of single blade razors and this one is by far my favorite.  I went to this style once the I saw the price of fusions cost more than they were worth.  I don&#x27;t miss the new razors of today at all.  I get a better shave using these blades than anything else i have used hands down.</li>
            <li> Tried all the big brands and feather always gives the best and closest shave. I absolutely recommend Feather and this seller has great prices.</li>
            <li> Possibly the sharpest blades I have ever used. Liking the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; double-edged blade shave, and being &amp;#34;follicularly challenged&amp;#34; on a good portion of my pate (my head NOT my brain) I have chosen to scrap off the remaining follicles as close to the scalp as possible. The Feather blades will accomplish that with little effort. They also have little regard for skin irregularities so BE CAREFUL when the blades are brand new. Consider yourself warned but stand by with toilet paper just in case. A great value, too.</li>
            <li> After recently joining the wet shaving community a few months ago, I&#x27;m still a beginner, but not completely brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Context: I&#x27;m 20 years old, with a light beard that must be shaven every few days for my job but I have super sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Parker 99R I ordered came with 5 Shark Super Chrome blades that I actually loved. Got 2-3 shaves out of each of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to splurge on these as the reviews are high and everyone claims they&#x27;re godsend. However, after my first couple of shaves with them, I noticed little difference between them and the Super Shark Chrome blades, yet they cost more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, my own personal experience. Maybe some people see bigger gains with a thicker beard. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these still shave my face amazingly well and smooth. However, no better than my other blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 because I can get the shame shave with cheaper blades in the same amount of passes.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use these from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product I have found !!</li>
            <li> I bought theses after reading other reviewers on Amazon. I had Merkur razors as well and these are just a shade better. I get more shaves out of the Feather than the Merkur, and they are not so costly.</li>
            <li> I have been using a double edge safety razor for about a year now.  My beard is very coarse and tough on razors. I started DE shaving with a sampler pack of razors, which the Feathers were not apart of, and found Derby&#x27;s to be the best of the that bunch. I found a great deal on the Derby&#x27;s and have been using those ever since.  Well I got bored with them (can you get bored of a razor?) and thought I would try the Feathers as everything I read indicates these were very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are indeed sharp but also they last for 4-5 shaves before I notice a dulling of the blade.  Compared to the Derby&#x27;s in which I got maybe 2 shaves per razor.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with nicks but I have never had an issue with nicks from any razor blade.  I would recommend the Feathers to anyone, even beginners.  They are a really treat to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving setup...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur 180 Long razor&lt;br /&gt;Cheap badger brush&lt;br /&gt;Cheap shaving mug&lt;br /&gt;Geo F.

            <li> Sharpest blades I ever used..</li>
            <li> Great blades! Stay sharp for a long time! I only use feather blades after using them in my Merkur for the last 9 months! This is easily a years supply.</li>
            <li> I started wtih Merkur blades for my razor but the shaveing wasn&#x27;t that comfortable.  Definitely better with the Feather blades but, they don&#x27;t last as long.  I&#x27;d guess I get half as many shaves.  Would I buy them again?  I don&#x27;t know.  I may try another brand, still searching for my favorite but these are definitely sharp.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp as others have mentioned.  Are these for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you prefer the blade to only pass once over your whiskers?  Then these may be for you.  If you take several passes over the same area on your face then I would suggest that you look elsewhere.  You just increase the possibility of a nick or cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you press the blade hard against your whiskers or lightly?  If you have a light touch then I think these blades would work well for you.  They are sharp enough to glide down your face with little effort.  Please remember that you need to pay attention and use the proper technique when using these.</li>
            <li> I have tried the cheap blades, 12 for 2 bucks, the murker blade that came with my razor, and the wilkinson swords. The feather is by far the best. they are all unbelievably sharp, but the feather just has a different feel on my face. Its smoother going across the stubble on my face. Where as the other blades started going dull around the 3rd or 4th day the feathers last and work well through the 5th and 6th day&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but am willing to bet that these are pretty awesome in comparison to other well reviewed blades. I say this because I started with the Merkur blades that came with my model 180, and they were fine starter blades; being a beginner DE shaver. However, I quickly, within two months, moved to the Feather; and have kept using them. Yes, they are sharp, a little aggressive, and most certainly worth the dough for a 30ct. I can say that if you want an easy DE shave experience, and have tough skin, these Feathers are a great buy. I will preface this: I have been DE shaving for one year. I do not regularly nick myself, even with a thickish beard. Against the grain will cause MAD irritation (redness &amp; bleeding...) if done incorrectly or too frequently; no matter the blade (from my limited experience). If you are still learning technique DE shaving and have a light beard, hold off! But then again, do not be sacred of these blades; they are easy to use once adjusted to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Great shave and a fantastic price.  My husband loves these blades!  Would recommend them over those sold by The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about ordering these blades as they ship directly from Japan. No tracking, no way to know if they really are legit. Amazon gave me a 30 day delivery window and the came within 10 days! If you don&#x27;t already know about Feather blades, the are sharp! Very sharp! I only use these in a Gillette Tech razor, my Merkur 34c tears my face up with these blades. They come in five count boxes as well so you&#x27;re going to get a lot of boxes.</li>
            <li> these razors are amazing, they stay sharp for a bout 2 weeks and they individually rapped &amp; dispense easily. Only ones better than these are the Feather Platinums</li>
