    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>The soap now lathers beautifully and is very kind to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter is great for hydrating and you can feel it when you lather this bar</li>
            <li>Smells great, but &amp;#34;man-sized&amp;#34; just means squared edges.</li>
            <li>Lather great</li>
            <li>I use a wash cloth and it lathers very nicely.</li>
            <li>It cleans, it smells nice - done!</li>
            <li>Totally love it!</li>
            <li>It gets the dirt off and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Always have liked this scented soap.  </li>
            <li>Man-sized bar is nice.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Great lather and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the soap smelled awesome and was very nice soap.</li>
            <li>The smell itself is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I suppose thats ok though.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and lingers after the shower is finished.  </li>
            <li>I feel even more manly, now that I use this soap.</li>
            <li>because I am just used to a more moisturized feeling.</li>
            <li>I like the exfoliating one better.</li>
            <li>They are for men, but I love them.</li>
            <li>So given the already low price, these are a particularly excellent value per ounce.</li>
            <li>Love this scent, nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>Kind of a fresh feeling</li>
            <li>Seems to lather better than original.</li>
            <li>has that, though it&#x27;s not too strong, thankfully.  </li>
            <li>Strong, though, so if you do not like strong scents, you will want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but I feel like this version melts away quicker while just sitting there in the shower.</li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t a huge fan of &amp;#34;perfumy-smelling&amp;#34; soap, and this</li>
            <li>Why is that important?</li>
            <li>I did not receive Free bars through vine, nor did I receive any compensation.  </li>
            <li>Good scent, but too soft soap.</li>
            <li>Out of the package, these bars have a VERY powerful scent.  </li>
            <li>Let me say it again, these bars have a VERY powerful scent out of the package.  </li>
            <li>I love this man sized bar they are actually bigger giving men a better grip and more bar of soap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more hydrating than the original Irish Spring and the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that today I am online looking to see if they have any more new releases.</li>
            <li>Not bad soap.  </li>
            <li>I found this Irish Spring Hydrating version to have a nice scent, good lather and the dry feeling on the skin was not as strong as the original.</li>
            <li>enjoying the new Signature product line and recommend it!</li>
            <li>My nose isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d call sensitive, I enjoy many scents and fragrances over 30 years</li>
            <li>If you’re an original Irish Spring user I would think you might switch to this if you wanted a bit more moisture and a more contemporary scent.</li>
            <li>Well these bars certainly are &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34;, they&#x27;re HUGE.  </li>
            <li>He found it too large to fit comfortably in his hand, even though he has rather large hands.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent, lathers up well, and the larger sized bar seems like it will last longer than the original.</li>
            <li>The claim of a &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; bar is accurate and I can highly recommend this soap, provided you have the time to air-dry them out.  </li>
            <li>I have light-colored washcloths and towels, and the first time I used this soap</li>
            <li>These bars are much thicker / dense / compacted more than what you are used to and aren&#x27;t filled with as much fluff as the national brands.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m a woman.</li>
            <li>I love this scent immensely!</li>
            <li>and I love the big bar.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The soap washes clean off and smells like original Irish Spring.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t it just come in a soft, clean scent ?  </li>
            <li>This is not some perfume-heavy soap catering to women – you have the classic scent that is not overpowering and is right up a man’s alley.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty much it&lt;</li>
            <li>The scent has dissipated to a more normal, yet still very present amount.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant mild fragrance that lingers on your skin after you&#x27;ve left the shower and dried off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, a hard-milled men&#x27;s soap that lasts long at a good price.</li>
            <li>What a difference from the regular bar, its more intense and adult smell !</li>
            <li>I really like using a moisturizing soap that doesn’t feel</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this soap.</li>
            <li>Smells very close to the original Irish spring.</li>
            <li>My husband likes the size of the bars more because he hates chasing little slivers of soap around the shower - and hates my girly soap in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I put them in the laundry using regular laundry detergent and OxyClean and that seemed to clean it all out.</li>
            <li>so it last longer then those skinny little bars with a scent that makes you go feel refreshed, it really does smell good</li>
            <li>Most soaps, if they are drying, will become less drying.  </li>
            <li>The only reason for not giving this five stars is that there is something in the soap that has to be somewhat acidic as you better pray that you do not have an open cut or scratch and get this stuff in there.</li>
            <li>I’ve been a Dove user since high school when it was recommended to me by a dermatologist for acne.</li>
            <li>Also, the bar is too large for a standard travel soap box.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t rinse my legs fast enough.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- really soft</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between this soap and the regular Irish Spring soap, but it is the size that is really the problem.</li>
            <li>Classic Irish spring scent, marketed for guys...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deeper green color, and of course it is soap so you can get it off, but I have gone to putting the bar on top of a sponge because the residue is so obvious against my white shower.</li>
            <li>The green color is nice, but I don&#x27;t like the way it leaves green residue on my shower.</li>
            <li>Luckily  it&#x27;s not too strong, and it won&#x27;t linger too long, but it definitely has a scent for men.</li>
            <li>Sweet Almond) Oil Extract, Titanium Dioxide, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10, D&amp;C Green No.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried the original Irish Spring in the past (my Dad used it)</li>
            <li>; here&#x27;s the kicker, the closet is on the complete opposite side of this moderately sized house.  </li>
            <li>Before you laugh, I also keep lightbulbs, saws, and a toolbox and other rough stuff in this same closet...</li>
            <li>unusually large -- bar soaps are typically 4 oz; these Irish Spring bars are 6 oz.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Irish Spring soap has a man&#x27;s cologne scent to it.  Luckily  it&#x27;s not too strong, and it won&#x27;t linger too long, but it definitely has a scent for men. My husband isn&#x27;t a huge fan of &amp;#34;perfumy-smelling&amp;#34; soap, and this has that, though it&#x27;s not too strong, thankfully.  His first comment was that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;slimier&amp;#34; than the regular Irish Spring (which is what he usually uses). What he really means is that because of the extra hydrating, it lathers up easier and the lather feels less harsh than regular soap.  Shea butter is great for hydrating and you can feel it when you lather this bar up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bars come in a square block, not the rounded bars you&#x27;re used to seeing from Irish Spring.  And, yes they are bigger - &amp;#34;man sized.&amp;#34;  I would give this 5 stars if you could get it in less cologne scented version.  Can&#x27;t it just come in a soft, clean scent ?  not all men want to smell like they&#x27;re wearing perfume/cologne.  Thankfully this scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long after showering.</li>
            <li> As a soap, this stuff isn&#x27;t so bad. It gets the dirt off and smells nice. The &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; part of it is questionable, though. I used to use plain &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Irish Spring soap (which costs half as much) and I can&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin since switching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major flaw in this soap, however, is the green dye they use. I have light-colored washcloths and towels, and the first time I used this soap it was very difficult to rinse out the bright green residue left by the soap on the washcloth in the shower. I put them in the laundry using regular laundry detergent and OxyClean and that seemed to clean it all out. However, after a few more weeks, I see a slight green tinge building up on some of my bathroom linens. I just threw out the remainder of the package and will use another type of soap that doesn&#x27;t use staining dyes.</li>
            <li> The smell itself is refreshing. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s different from any other soap--that I can notice.</li>
            <li> This is not some perfume-heavy soap catering to women – you have the classic scent that is not overpowering and is right up a man’s alley.  These bars are much thicker / dense / compacted more than what you are used to and aren&#x27;t filled with as much fluff as the national brands.  Why is that important? I&#x27;m not talking about the size of the bar, but the density / composition of the soap as it lasts a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Always have liked this scented soap.  Kind of a fresh feeling</li>
            <li> Like this soap a lot - I always use Irish Spring Mountain (the blue one) - but bought this because it looked enticing. The soap washes clean off and smells like original Irish Spring. The bars are very big and somewhat cumbersome to handle in the shower. However, they last roughly three times as long as a bar of the Irish Spring Mountain.</li>
            <li> Well these bars certainly are &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34;, they&#x27;re HUGE.  Since I didn&#x27;t buy them for my delicate girly hands anyway I suppose thats ok though.  My husband likes the size of the bars more because he hates chasing little slivers of soap around the shower - and hates my girly soap in the first place.  The scent is lovely and lingers after the shower is finished.  I suppose the &amp;#34;Man sized&amp;#34; bars are a bonus for any man concerned about the size (or lack of( of their soap.  It cleans, it smells nice - done!</li>
            <li> What can I say? I feel even more manly, now that I use this soap. No more of that foo-foo Dove crap for me.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, nice and fresh. Strong, though, so if you do not like strong scents, you will want to look elsewhere. The green color is nice, but I don&#x27;t like the way it leaves green residue on my shower. It&#x27;s a deeper green color, and of course it is soap so you can get it off, but I have gone to putting the bar on top of a sponge because the residue is so obvious against my white shower.</li>
            <li> Finally, a hard-milled men&#x27;s soap that lasts long at a good price.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but &amp;#34;man-sized&amp;#34; just means squared edges. It&#x27;s fine, but I feel like this version melts away quicker while just sitting there in the shower. I plan on continuing to buy Irish Spring but will go back to regular sized bars.</li>
            <li> What a difference from the regular bar, its more intense and adult smell !</li>
            <li> Did not like for the price</li>
            <li> Not bad soap.  It&#x27;s definitely more hydrating than the original Irish Spring and the smell is amazing.  Great lather and rinses clean.  The only reason for not giving this five stars is that there is something in the soap that has to be somewhat acidic as you better pray that you do not have an open cut or scratch and get this stuff in there. It&#x27;s like dumping lemon juice into a paper cut.  I had finished doing some yard work and had a bunch of little cuts on my legs from ripping out some old hedges on my property.  The shower that followed was quite painful.  I couldn&#x27;t rinse my legs fast enough.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Irish Spring Signature Hydrating. I’ve been a Dove user since high school when it was recommended to me by a dermatologist for acne. Years later when Dove come out with their men’s line I switched to that. I really like using a moisturizing soap that doesn’t feel like I’m using one. I’ve tried the original Irish Spring in the past (my Dad used it) and I didn’t like the dry feeling it left on my skin. I found this Irish Spring Hydrating version to have a nice scent, good lather and the dry feeling on the skin was not as strong as the original. However, I wouldn’t switch because I am just used to a more moisturized feeling. If you’re an original Irish Spring user I would think you might switch to this if you wanted a bit more moisture and a more contemporary scent.</li>
            <li> I love this man sized bar they are actually bigger giving men a better grip and more bar of soap so it last longer then those skinny little bars with a scent that makes you go feel refreshed, it really does smell good</li>
            <li> Good scent, but too soft soap. My brother did not like it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a woman. I love this scent immensely! I was going through the bar aisle and discovered this and have been showering with this&lt;br /&gt;for over a week and I love the big bar. I use a wash cloth and it lathers very nicely. When I was in Europe, I showered with Vitabath in Spring&lt;br /&gt;green. This is like that smell in a bar. Totally love it!</li>
            <li> I like the exfoliating one better.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this soap. It has a great scent, lathers up well, and the larger sized bar seems like it will last longer than the original. It does have hydrating properties without leaving a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Soap (Sodium Tallowate and/or Sodium Palmate, Sodium Cocoate and/or Sodium Palm Kernelate), Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Tallow Acid, Petrolatum, Coconut Acid, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-6, Pentasodium Pentetate, Pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Bityrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil Extract, Titanium Dioxide, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10, D&amp;C Green No. 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re enjoying the new Signature product line and recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a review for the green &amp;#34;hydrating bar&amp;#34;.  I did not receive Free bars through vine, nor did I receive any compensation.  On to the comments.  Out of the package, these bars have a VERY powerful scent.  My nose isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d call sensitive, I enjoy many scents and fragrances over 30 years so I&#x27;m not a n00b to smells.  Let me say it again, these bars have a VERY powerful scent out of the package.  Within 10 minutes of simply placing, not using, it in the shower, my wife asked what cologne have I sprayed on.  So I unwrapped the bars and placed them to air out in my soap and toiletry closet (admitted addict).  Before you laugh, I also keep lightbulbs, saws, and a toolbox and other rough stuff in this same closet...Anyway, I woke up in the middle of the night with the smell of this stuff in my nostril; here&#x27;s the kicker, the closet is on the complete opposite side of this moderately sized house.  Anybody saying this soap is mildly scented and not overpowering has a broken nose.  I moved these soaps to a wire rack and let them dry/air out in the garage closet for a couple months.  The scent enveloped the entire garage and you could smell it every time upon entering.  The scent has dissipated to a more normal, yet still very present amount.  The soap now lathers beautifully and is very kind to the skin.  The claim of a &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; bar is accurate and I can highly recommend this soap, provided you have the time to air-dry them out.  Pro Tip:  Unwrap and air out ALL of your bar soaps prior to use, not just this soap.  Most soaps, if they are drying, will become less drying.  Further, the soap will last longer.  Why does this work?  Drying soap is the final step of the soap-making process.  Some soap-makers will dry their soap for a minimum of 6 months prior to sale.  In the case of commercial soap, it must be wrapped and shipped to the retailer ASAP.  They don&#x27;t have the luxury of time.  Its up to you to cure it at home.  [FYI - bar soap does not expire]</li>
            <li> Classic Irish spring scent, marketed for guys...that&#x27;s pretty much it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Lather great&lt;br /&gt;- Smells Amazing&lt;br /&gt;- cleans great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Kinda small&lt;br /&gt;-  You need soap container for it&lt;br /&gt;- really soft</li>
            <li> They are for men, but I love them.</li>
            <li> Cleans. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Man-sized bar is nice. Doesn&#x27;t cook me food or go to work for me. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Bought because of the size.</li>
            <li> My husband and I picked this up yesterday. Smells very close to the original Irish spring. Bigger bar. Seems to lather better than original. I think it will last longer. I liked it so much that today I am online looking to see if they have any more new releases. From what I could find online and at the store I see only the two which are listed on Amazon.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other one. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Seems to have the same smell/effects of the standard Irish Spring.  Witch is half the price btw.</li>
            <li> This soap left my face with hives... Other than that the soap smelled awesome and was very nice soap. Too bad I can&#x27;t use it...</li>
            <li> As a soap it works well. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry. It has a pleasant mild fragrance that lingers on your skin after you&#x27;ve left the shower and dried off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bars are unusually large -- bar soaps are typically 4 oz; these Irish Spring bars are 6 oz. So given the already low price, these are a particularly excellent value per ounce.</li>
            <li> I passed this on to my husband, as the man in the family, for his opinion. He was not impressed. He didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between this soap and the regular Irish Spring soap, but it is the size that is really the problem. He found it too large to fit comfortably in his hand, even though he has rather large hands. Also, the bar is too large for a standard travel soap box. So we&#x27;ll just stick to the regular Irish Spring.</li>
