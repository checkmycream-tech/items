            <li>Nothing lighter and more yummy smelling on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a couple more</li>
            <li>Must have will love for Sun parched skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay and does the job, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>but it is a nice lightly scented organic body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I just love this body lotion.  </li>
            <li>On top of all this it is organic and contains nothing chemical or harmful to the body.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like greasy body lotions then you will probably love this.  </li>
            <li>I keep 2 bottles to make sure I don&#x27;t run out :-)</li>
            <li>This lotion is so soft and smells incredible.  </li>
            <li>I love Eminence products and that it&#x27;s 100% organic.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work, but it smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and never feels like it lays on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this and always get compliments whenever I wear it as if i were wearing a light perfume.</li>
            <li>Most, even the ones that advertise as good for sensitive skin, often sting and burn.  </li>
            <li>This lotion gives you a nice, clean, and crisp feeling after a shower or bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The entire line is great.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive reactive skin and this product did not irritate my skin and did a good job keeping it moist and irritation free.</li>
            <li>That makes it worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>body lotion is worth every penny</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s my experience that it is different to other products in this line that is excellent</li>
            <li>It contains mostly natural ingredients and it is so light I use it on my face to calm the rosacea.  </li>
            <li>The lotion spreads so smoothly, and soaks into your skin completely.</li>
            <li>I actually use this mostly on my face.</li>
            <li>Since my skin is really dry, I find that Eminence&#x27;s Coconut Firming Body lotion provides better hydration.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this lotion until the end of time haha.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and soothing to the skin and makes your skin feel like silk.  </li>
            <li>The product is good but fatty, while using it after the shower was oily on the skin, I have appeared pimples on the back and feel oily skin ...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this, the number of dark spots has significantly reduced, any I had from years ago are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>they would be completely gone.</li>
            <li>Finally a body lotion that really does what it&#x27;s supposed to: moisturize.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does this lotion help to heal any problem areas that haven&#x27;t already healed, it also significantly fades the dark spots.</li>
            <li>the only product that has really worked for my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>(I think there might be a coconut lotion) as I do like the Eminence products in general.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was as expected</li>
            <li>two of the caps were not tightly sealed - and so within the individual wrapping I got spillage</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You only need a small amount even for a larger area like legs.</li>
            <li> little background, I have always had dark scar spots on my legs and arms due to being loved dearly by mosquitos and a pretty nasty sun sensitivity/allergy (that thankfully dissipates as my summer sun exposure continues).</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the bottle is way smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased it, but when I saw how thin the lotion was, I didn&#x27;t think it would be very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This lotion smells heavenly, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking to this one, have used a few different lotions in the past.</li>
            <li> Between these two things, every year I break out and it causes dark surface</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a lonnnnnggg way.</li>
            <li> I took one star off for price and because I feel the texture could be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love their products but was disappointed to learn that this product contains a serious allergen.</li>
            <li> only possible bad thing I can say about this is that it can be a little greasy.</li>
            <li> If I were to use it every day for a month (which I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m terribly lazy)</li>
            <li> The lotion gave me a violent headache and made my skin itch, and I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion&#x27;s smell is worse than any lotion I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> I go through 1 of these bottles approximately every two years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> Very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention that this stuff stinks?!</li>
            <li> Horrible smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Eminence Stone Crop is simply the best body lotion for after-shower use.  I discovered it when a massage therapist used it on me after a massage a number of years age.  I tried it at home and have been using it ever since.  Everyone I have suggested it to has agreed with me.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  Pleasant scent</li>
            <li> The lotion spreads so smoothly, and soaks into your skin completely. I love the fragrance it&#x27;s like nothing else I&#x27;ve enjoyed.</li>
            <li> The product is good but fatty, while using it after the shower was oily on the skin, I have appeared pimples on the back and feel oily skin ... I can not continue to use the product only in legs. I&#x27;m sorry that&#x27;s my experience that it is different to other products in this line that is excellent but this cream did not work for me. Too expensive…</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my hands and feet.  I need a lotion to fight the drying affect of my medications.  Most, even the ones that advertise as good for sensitive skin, often sting and burn.  This doesn&#x27;t.  That makes it worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love this cream. the only product that has really worked for my sensitive, dry skin. Light and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion of all time. I used to buy this locally and was charged over the double the price. I will buy this lotion until the end of time haha. Nothing lighter and more yummy smelling on the market. And all natural ingredients. Incredible stuff.</li>
            <li> It works!! My skin has gotten brighter with a nice glow to it. I&#x27;m ordering a couple more so I never run out. I&#x27;m sticking to this one, have used a few different lotions in the past. The only complaint is that the bottle is way smaller than expected. Looks bigger on the web.</li>
            <li> Must have will love for Sun parched skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this product smell great it nourishes without stickiness or greasy residue perfect summer moisturizer. Stonecrop plant has similar healing properties as aloe.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and the way it makes my skin look and feel is wonderful.  My hands look and fell  younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Eminence, and since this lotion got rave reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s okay and does the job, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Since my skin is really dry, I find that Eminence&#x27;s Coconut Firming Body lotion provides better hydration.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> warning: contains wheat protein&lt;br /&gt;i love their products but was disappointed to learn that this product contains a serious allergen.</li>
            <li> quality with a price to match... it is very good lotion no question.. try it and your skin will thank you</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Moisturizes and erases brown spots.</li>
            <li> The entire line is great. We used it in our SPA and all of our clientele loved it</li>
            <li> Excelllent organic product</li>
            <li> I actually use this mostly on my face. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and supple. A little bit goes a lonnnnnggg way. It absorbs easily and never feels like it lays on top of your skin. I highly recommend it. I smells wonderful</li>
            <li> This lotion&#x27;s smell is worse than any lotion I have ever smelled. I used it once and had to escort it outside to the trash can. The lotion gave me a violent headache and made my skin itch, and I do not have sensitive skin. Did I mention that this stuff stinks?!</li>
            <li> Great lotion, feels wonderful soaking into your skin!</li>
            <li> I bought the lotion after reading how wonderful it smelled, but for me, the smell was too strong and smelled like perfume.  I tried to use it before going to sleep so I would not smell it, but this did not work either.  Although the supplier would not allow me to return the item, I received a 25% refund.  I do like the blueberry soy exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> Does not smell too good and I do not believe it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this lotion, but it smells like Lemon Pledge. Horrible smell. Nice consistency though. I will probably try a different scent (I think there might be a coconut lotion) as I do like the Eminence products in general. Couldn&#x27;t use this at all.</li>
            <li> I took one star off for price and because I feel the texture could be a little thicker. Those are my only complaints with this lotion. I love the scent of this and always get compliments whenever I wear it as if i were wearing a light perfume. I have extremely sensitive reactive skin and this product did not irritate my skin and did a good job keeping it moist and irritation free. I didnt notice any firming, tightening, or toning effects with this but it was a nice change from chemical-laden moisturizers. Not sure i&#x27;d purchase it again due to the price and how short of a time it lasted if applying it daily to your entire body but it is a nice lightly scented organic body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this body lotion.  My aesthetician recommended this body lotion.  I purchased it, but when I saw how thin the lotion was, I didn&#x27;t think it would be very moisturizing.  Boy was I wrong!  This lotion smells heavenly, and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m going to purchase some for my sisters for Christmas.  I think every woman should have this.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I just love this body lotion.  It is very hydrating and soothing to the skin and makes your skin feel like silk.  And it smells absolutely wonderful.  On top of all this it is organic and contains nothing chemical or harmful to the body.  You just cannot beat that.</li>
            <li> This lotion gives you a nice, clean, and crisp feeling after a shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year. I put it on a bedtime. Love it!</li>
            <li> Nothing better than the smell of stonecrop! Shipped fast and was as expected</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like greasy body lotions then you will probably love this.  It is very light and not greasy at all.  It contains mostly natural ingredients and it is so light I use it on my face to calm the rosacea.  It is soothing on a sunburn as well.  I keep 2 bottles to make sure I don&#x27;t run out :-)</li>
            <li> two of the caps were not tightly sealed - and so within the individual wrapping I got spillage</li>
            <li> Awesome for post sun exposure and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very expensive.  Smells good, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> This lotion is so soft and smells incredible.  It&#x27;s really moisturizing and makes my skin feel wonderful.  I love Eminence products and that it&#x27;s 100% organic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff since I found it in a spa in Bermuda years ago while I was on a vacation with family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background, I have always had dark scar spots on my legs and arms due to being loved dearly by mosquitos and a pretty nasty sun sensitivity/allergy (that thankfully dissipates as my summer sun exposure continues). Between these two things, every year I break out and it causes dark surface scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this lotion help to heal any problem areas that haven&#x27;t already healed, it also significantly fades the dark spots. If I were to use it every day for a month (which I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m terribly lazy) they would be completely gone. Since I&#x27;ve started using this, the number of dark spots has significantly reduced, any I had from years ago are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also lasts me a long, long time. I end up using it about 2-3 times a week for various parts including my hands. You only need a small amount even for a larger area like legs. I go through 1 of these bottles approximately every two years. And the scent is just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible bad thing I can say about this is that it can be a little greasy. I recommend using it after showering for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though if you have any issues like I described above, get this stuff. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Finally a body lotion that really does what it&#x27;s supposed to: moisturize. I love it. Not only does it work, but it smells wonderful too. Just a dime size per lower leg and I have don&#x27;t have to worry about my legs being ashy for up to 48 hours. FABULOUS! Not to mention that it is all organic.&lt;br /&gt;This body lotion is worth every penny and then some.</li>
