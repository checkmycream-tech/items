    <ol>
            <li>It looks great!</li>
            <li>Great price, excellent product!</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>My hair turned out beautifully, will be buying again (:</li>
            <li>a person well experienced in home coloring</li>
            <li>I saw this and decided to try it, it worked great.</li>
            <li>It has been almost a week and the color looks great.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this one a try because of the 3D color technology and all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>This product works fairly well.</li>
            <li>This product is great and the price is even better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The color was nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a licensed cosmetologist for 12 years (given, I haven&#x27;t worked as a stylist for 9 years, but I still color my own hair and that of my friends and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice added touch.</li>
            <li>NICE AND SILKY</li>
            <li>It looked good maybe the first couple of days, but the color didn&#x27;t stay on so great.</li>
            <li>The color is great at first and does not leave my hair brittle or damaged</li>
            <li>and it should look more</li>
            <li>Tried women&#x27;s in place of just for men, couldn&#x27;t be happier, more product helps a lot also</li>
            <li>Did it myself no problem. :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s best to NOT have any styling chemicals in hair AND last washed 48 hrs BEFORE applying color.</li>
            <li>I almost bought more dye.</li>
            <li>single strand was covered perfectly and the dye lasted 3 months before showing any signs of brown returning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is inexpensive, easy to apply, &amp; permanent.</li>
            <li>but I do it for every colour and it works fine)</li>
            <li>So your hair &amp; scalp be fine during &amp; after the chemical treatment.</li>
            <li>I tried this one because I had purchased the Luxurious Colorsilk Buttercream and it left my hair great.</li>
            <li>so it was very exciting to find an inexpensive ammonia-free hair dye.  </li>
            <li>I am not disappointed at all!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I mostly used the tones of brown and they worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>The longer you go without touching up your hair, I&#x27;ve noticed in certain light, it will start to get an auburn tone.</li>
            <li>you have a special occasion coming up and want a quick, cheap solution, this is your product.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally to cover up my dyed bright red hair.</li>
            <li>If you like a good deal, go check your local shops before surrendering these price marks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful shade of black.</li>
            <li>main concern is whether or not it is safe.  </li>
            <li>I wish this product lived up to it&#x27;s claims of improving the state of your hair because it is very affordable and readily available, but this hair dye is damaging to hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was light brown to begin with and it dyed it very evenly and shiny.</li>
            <li>hair always feels soft after a dye and it does fade a *bit* after a month but most box hairdye does; and it&#x27;s so inexpensive</li>
            <li>Great straight black color.</li>
            <li>or if I&#x27;ve dyed my hair some wacky color and want to bring it back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this dye has been exactly what I need it to be</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i naturally had light brown hair with gold highlights that i wanted to disspear</li>
            <li>Exact what it says ...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve seen many others say the same thing.</li>
            <li>color I believe is a bit darker than my natural color but then fades to almost identically my natural color, which I love for when I just would like it a darker brown</li>
            <li>, it actually even helped my hair get more nourish to it , not sure if my hairs magic or this dye is</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say it dyed my hair black.  </li>
            <li>Not a whole lot of staining, washed off easy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my main brand and color of hairdye now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My recommendation would be to spend the extra $4 on a dye that will last more than a week or 2.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is a light gingery blonde and this dye covers it and does not fade at all.</li>
            <li>lemme tell you that the cheap price doesnt mean cheap quality</li>
            <li>HI I BEEN USING THIS COLOR FOR A LONG TIME THE COLOR LOOKS SO RICH ON YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>I used the black brown dye at first, it started fading to a light brown after a week.</li>
            <li>I probably looked a little wacky at first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are ammonia free like most expensive haircolors and most other ingredients match with them too.</li>
            <li>I normally use hair dye from health stores (which are about $18-20 per box)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, probably buy something costlier and better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I noticed minimal breakage - should be gentle enough if you have healthy hair to begin with</li>
            <li>I feel so sexy with my new black hair!</li>
            <li>The dying process is simple and the color processes much more quickly than other, similar products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;at stores where i live</li>
            <li>also usually makes my hair EXTREMELY healthy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to re-dye on a monthly basis (which, generally you at least need to touch up roots after a month so you might as well re-cover all your hair, right?</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this item costs less than half the price of the other brands and being cheap does not mean that you are getting low quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking for an extremely budget-friendly, quick dye.</li>
            <li>It was soft and the color lasted.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Excellent gray coverage (I have maybe 5 gray hairs that even professional color won&#x27;t</li>
            <li>using the conditioning treatment, my hair was soft and silky</li>
            <li>The black does run a lot for the first few days like most dye wil do, but it does stay.</li>
            <li>Almost all other light grayish parts of her hair are still the same.</li>
            <li>but I bleached it and dyed it red, then bleached it and dyed it back black (with manic panic) but it faded pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Fortunately my hair is very dark brown; almost black; so it&#x27;s hidden with the top hair.</li>
            <li>if you arnt looking for that i suggest  you look for the colorsilk color \\&quot;soft black\\&quot; or \\&quot;natural blue black\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price for this stuff is almost irresistible, and a few days later after my first shampoo I&#x27;m already seeing hints of red/brown!!</li>
            <li>As always, the black color is true to image and my hair is always left silky and healthy-looking after using this product.</li>
            <li>i actually had walked around town with my friend for one day with it ) and it would cover it up completely</li>
            <li>This is way too much since I purchased the same item from the local Target at $3.35 including the 6% tax (same price at walmart too).  </li>
            <li>My hair is the same as it was before, it is not extra brittle or anything, it feels the same, shiny and soft and stuff.</li>
            <li>Just pure, jet black.</li>
            <li>It had a ton of dye in the box, so I could dye my whole head of hair (which is about down to my armpits) and still have dye</li>
            <li>when you first wash it out it does look rather fake but just give it a few more washes</li>
            <li>/&gt;i dont use this shade blackest black anymore as i grew out having black hair to the extreme , being pale and having dark hair used to be something i loved, but it now just makes me look like im apart of the undead haha</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Dark Burgundy one too.</li>

            <li> highly recommend the Dark Burgundy one too.</li>
            <li> the colour is still vibrant in my hair with no special care and even after trying to remove it (that&#x27;s just with home remedies though)</li>
            <li> So I was wanting to dye my hair black for like, forever, and saw this inexpensive dye in a grocery store close to where I live.</li>
            <li> Once it gets wet  and all the products I have to use now to keep it soft comes out and it&#x27;s back to a dry clump.</li>
            <li> but it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I naturally have black hair</li>
            <li> Since the beauty supply was closed, I decided to take a risk and buy this box of color at my local drug store.  </li>
            <li> AND IT STAYS THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I dyed the underneath of my naturally blonde hair black and within a week of putting it in the color faded to brown, not even a month later</li>
            <li> All I ended up with is straw dry hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend REVLON COLORSILK BLACK!!!</li>
            <li> I go Black in the winter &amp; deep burgundy for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just noticed that now not only is the black coming out</li>
            <li> your hair is long or thick, one box will not be enough to cover your hair unless you&#x27;re only coloring your regrowth</li>
            <li> I ended up missing a middle part of my hair.</li>
            <li> When I washed it out and it dried, it looked BLUE!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for those who only commit to dying their hair every few months or so, as the product fades a lot quicker than other dyes on the market.</li>
            <li> then I usually do after I dye my hair, several times to help with the scalp and ear irritation.</li>
            <li> If the color falls out of your hair for the first 8 washes, it just makes me uncomfortable because of all of the cancer-from-dark-hair-color rumors.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It lasts about a month for me (with washing hair every other day) until I notice that my shiny black hair has faded to dark brown again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a dark brunette.</li>
            <li> The print on the box/instructions include to leave colorant in for (at least) 10 extra minutes for gray/salt &amp; pepper hair types.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it is a dark brown.</li>
            <li> dark color was stubborn - did not want to wash off of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I always purchase Colorsilk in Black (10/1N) whenever my naturally dark hair starts to fade</li>
            <li> Whenever I want to put some black in my hair, I go to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied 1N (Black) 3 months ago...</li>
            <li> Colored fully as per the instructions, noticed after washing that it has has almost no effect ... except a slight darker grayish tinge at places.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve wanted gothic black hair</li>
            <li> I went ahead and dyed the rest black with this dye, just because the store didn&#x27;t have the dye I wanted and</li>
            <li> But then I washed it again with shampoo and conditioner, and it was jet black.</li>
            <li> waste as little product as possible!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of all the black dyes this one stains the tub the least.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i usually do pros and cons for hairdye reviews</li>
            <li> When washing the dye out my hair felt like a heavy knot, like it had been bleached, and needed serious conditioning.</li>
            <li> dye again- so much for permanent. :(</li>
            <li> Hardly anything.</li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde hair and this has never faded on me.</li>

            <li> Worst Hair Dye I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I normally use hair dye from health stores (which are about $18-20 per box) so it was very exciting to find an inexpensive ammonia-free hair dye.  Never again!  This product dried my hair out so much that there was some breakage.  When washing the dye out my hair felt like a heavy knot, like it had been bleached, and needed serious conditioning. I wish this product lived up to it&#x27;s claims of improving the state of your hair because it is very affordable and readily available, but this hair dye is damaging to hair.  The color was nice.</li>
            <li> The rest of these reviews make me go \\&quot;huh. strange.\\&quot; I started using this dye months ago and it&#x27;s my main brand and color of hairdye now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair always feels soft after a dye and it does fade a *bit* after a month but most box hairdye does; and it&#x27;s so inexpensive it&#x27;s easy to re-dye on a monthly basis (which, generally you at least need to touch up roots after a month so you might as well re-cover all your hair, right? waste as little product as possible!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their #20? color I believe is a bit darker than my natural color but then fades to almost identically my natural color, which I love for when I just would like it a darker brown or if I&#x27;ve dyed my hair some wacky color and want to bring it back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this dye has been exactly what I need it to be and I plan to use it until they stop making it, if ever.</li>
            <li> Whenever I want to put some black in my hair, I go to this. At first I was rather sceptical because low pricing usually means low quality. But this wasn&#x27;t the case. I left it in for an hour(I know you&#x27;re not. suppose to but I do it for every colour and it works fine) the colour is still vibrant in my hair with no special care and even after trying to remove it (that&#x27;s just with home remedies though) The black does run a lot for the first few days like most dye wil do, but it does stay. when you first wash it out it does look rather fake but just give it a few more washes and it should look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;It also usually makes my hair EXTREMELY healthy. But all hair types are different</li>
            <li> Tried women&#x27;s in place of just for men, couldn&#x27;t be happier, more product helps a lot also</li>
            <li> Great straight black color. Not a whole lot of staining, washed off easy. I loved it! I feel so sexy with my new black hair! Did it myself no problem. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied 1N (Black) 3 months ago... This stuff is inexpensive, easy to apply, &amp; permanent. I also have WHITE strands of hair that crop up every now &amp; again. I&#x27;m naturally a dark brunette. The print on the box/instructions include to leave colorant in for (at least) 10 extra minutes for gray/salt &amp; pepper hair types. I am not disappointed at all!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Dark Burgundy one too. I go Black in the winter &amp; deep burgundy for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person well experienced in home coloring, it&#x27;s best to NOT have any styling chemicals in hair AND last washed 48 hrs BEFORE applying color. So your hair &amp; scalp be fine during &amp; after the chemical treatment. DO NOT wash hair 48 hrs after coloring hair &amp; use proper specified color treated hair shampoo &amp; conditioning products.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mother who wanted to color her hair. Colored fully as per the instructions, noticed after washing that it has has almost no effect ... except a slight darker grayish tinge at places. Almost all other light grayish parts of her hair are still the same. Don&#x27;t waste your money, probably buy something costlier and better.</li>
            <li> Worst Hair Dye I&#x27;ve ever used! I tried this one because I had purchased the Luxurious Colorsilk Buttercream and it left my hair great. It was soft and the color lasted. I decided to give this one a try because of the 3D color technology and all the good reviews. All I ended up with is straw dry hair. No Color&#x27;SILK&#x27;. I also made the mistake of thinking it was cream. It was liquid. Unlike the Colorsilk Buttercreamcolor I couldn&#x27;t comb it through my hair after I applied it (which it said you could); it was a clump of matted hair. I ended up missing a middle part of my hair. Fortunately my hair is very dark brown; almost black; so it&#x27;s hidden with the top hair. I also had a bad reaction to it. Something I have never had before with any hair dye. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and my scalp is still bothering me. It was itchy and stinging and I had to wash it sooner then I usually do after I dye my hair, several times to help with the scalp and ear irritation. That only made my hair dryer. Once it gets wet  and all the products I have to use now to keep it soft comes out and it&#x27;s back to a dry clump. The only good thing I can say it dyed my hair black.  I just noticed that now not only is the black coming out but my hair is turning brown! I don&#x27;t have naturally brown hair! :((</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve wanted gothic black hair and I finally got it. It&#x27;s a beautiful shade of black. I hope it lasts. If not, I&#x27;ll just redo it in a month or so. I highly recommend REVLON COLORSILK BLACK!!!</li>
            <li> ive used this hairdye for about 4 years&lt;br /&gt;from age 12 to 14 i would redye my hair with it every 2 months&lt;br /&gt;and no its not because the colour faded fast&lt;br /&gt;i just had an obsession with dying hair haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways lemme tell you that the cheap price doesnt mean cheap quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at stores where i live it is around 4.50 + tax&lt;br /&gt;i naturally had light brown hair with gold highlights that i wanted to disspear&lt;br /&gt;i applied the dye though my hair and left it in for 40 minutes and i used the conditioner to wash my hair&lt;br /&gt;every single strand was covered perfectly and the dye lasted 3 months before showing any signs of brown returning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was my too go to colour when i wanted to cover something up , ive had experiances of bleaching and dying my hair and it turning into a horrid colour ( once i had horrible PINK hair unntentionally i actually had walked around town with my friend for one day with it ) and it would cover it up completely , it actually even helped my hair get more nourish to it , not sure if my hairs magic or this dye is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont use this shade blackest black anymore as i grew out having black hair to the extreme , being pale and having dark hair used to be something i loved, but it now just makes me look like im apart of the undead haha&lt;br /&gt;so if you arnt looking for that i suggest  you look for the colorsilk color \\&quot;soft black\\&quot; or \\&quot;natural blue black\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i usually do pros and cons for hairdye reviews but i dont even have any cons to say!!!</li>
            <li> It looked good maybe the first couple of days, but the color didn&#x27;t stay on so great. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Of all the black dyes this one stains the tub the least. Hardly anything.</li>
            <li> Exact what it says ...</li>
            <li> I have used this hair dye since I was 14 (I&#x27;m 24 now) I absolutely love this stuff! I have dirty blonde hair and this has never faded on me.</li>
            <li> The color is great at first and does not leave my hair brittle or damaged but it does not last long at all. I used the black brown dye at first, it started fading to a light brown after a week. I went ahead and dyed the rest black with this dye, just because the store didn&#x27;t have the dye I wanted and the price for this stuff is almost irresistible, and a few days later after my first shampoo I&#x27;m already seeing hints of red/brown!! It could just be my hair but I&#x27;ve seen many others say the same thing. Definitely not a permanent dye. My recommendation would be to spend the extra $4 on a dye that will last more than a week or 2.</li>
            <li> I dyed the underneath of my naturally blonde hair black and within a week of putting it in the color faded to brown, not even a month later and it is a dark brown. i was so disappointed im only 14 and i want to cry whenever i see it. i will never be buying this brand of hair dye again- so much for permanent. :(</li>
            <li> So I was wanting to dye my hair black for like, forever, and saw this inexpensive dye in a grocery store close to where I live. I bought it and applied it that night. It had a ton of dye in the box, so I could dye my whole head of hair (which is about down to my armpits) and still have dye left for something else, like giving someone else coontails. When I washed it out and it dried, it looked BLUE! I was freaking out, because it didn&#x27;t match my extensions. I almost bought more dye. But then I washed it again with shampoo and conditioner, and it was jet black. No blue at all. It looks great! My hair was light brown to begin with and it dyed it very evenly and shiny. My hair is the same as it was before, it is not extra brittle or anything, it feels the same, shiny and soft and stuff. It hasn&#x27;t faded at all, besides the starting BLUE color, but now it isn&#x27;t blue at all. Just pure, jet black. I would definitely buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I bought this to touch up my hair with. I naturally have black hair but I bleached it and dyed it red, then bleached it and dyed it back black (with manic panic) but it faded pretty quickly and so I needed to touch it up AGAIN. I decided against going with manic panic again seeing as it only lasts a short time before it fades.. I saw this and decided to try it, it worked great. It arrived on time and well packaged, so nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a licensed cosmetologist for 12 years (given, I haven&#x27;t worked as a stylist for 9 years, but I still color my own hair and that of my friends and family).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an event one night and my regrowth was looking gross.  Since the beauty supply was closed, I decided to take a risk and buy this box of color at my local drug store.  Here are the pros and cons that I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;-Excellent gray coverage (I have maybe 5 gray hairs that even professional color won&#x27;t cover)&lt;br /&gt;-I noticed minimal breakage - should be gentle enough if you have healthy hair to begin with&lt;br /&gt;-After using the conditioning treatment, my hair was soft and silky&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply - everything you need is included, even gloves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It wasn&#x27;t until I washed my hair 9 times that the color stopped falling out of my hair into the shower.  Is this healthy?&lt;br /&gt;-If your hair is long or thick, one box will not be enough to cover your hair unless you&#x27;re only coloring your regrowth&lt;br /&gt;-The dark color was stubborn - did not want to wash off of my skin.  I probably looked a little wacky at first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern is whether or not it is safe.  If the color falls out of your hair for the first 8 washes, it just makes me uncomfortable because of all of the cancer-from-dark-hair-color rumors.  Other than that, if I found myself in another pickle, I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> My hair turned out beautifully, will be buying again (:</li>
            <li> I always purchase Colorsilk in Black (10/1N) whenever my naturally dark hair starts to fade and I&#x27;m looking for an extremely budget-friendly, quick dye. This product works fairly well. The dying process is simple and the color processes much more quickly than other, similar products. As always, the black color is true to image and my hair is always left silky and healthy-looking after using this product. However, I wish that the kit contained a bigger packet/tube of conditioner because, even with shoulder-length hair, I never seem to have enough conditioner to coat my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a special occasion coming up and want a quick, cheap solution, this is your product. I would not recommend it for those who only commit to dying their hair every few months or so, as the product fades a lot quicker than other dyes on the market. It lasts about a month for me (with washing hair every other day) until I notice that my shiny black hair has faded to dark brown again.</li>
            <li> I have used the revlon color silk series for over a year. I mostly used the tones of brown and they worked pretty well. These are ammonia free like most expensive haircolors and most other ingredients match with them too. Surprisingly this item costs less than half the price of the other brands and being cheap does not mean that you are getting low quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the vendors in amazon sell it at around $7-8. This is way too much since I purchased the same item from the local Target at $3.35 including the 6% tax (same price at walmart too).  If you like a good deal, go check your local shops before surrendering these price marks.</li>
            <li> Great price, excellent product!</li>
            <li> It has been almost a week and the color looks great. I have been experiencing the issue similar to others where the color keeps washing out when I shampoo. It has improved the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> I do not understand how this product has such low reviews, but I suppose everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I bought this originally to cover up my dyed bright red hair. It worked perfectly, no red was to be seen. My natural hair color is a light gingery blonde and this dye covers it and does not fade at all. The longer you go without touching up your hair, I&#x27;ve noticed in certain light, it will start to get an auburn tone. It&#x27;s a nice added touch. This product is great and the price is even better.</li>
            <li> HI I BEEN USING THIS COLOR FOR A LONG TIME THE COLOR LOOKS SO RICH ON YOUR HAIR&lt;br /&gt;ITS NICE AND SILKY AND IT STAYS THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME. AND IT IS A GREAT PRICE.</li>
