            <li>It is stunning, wore it for my wedding.  </li>
            <li>The comb&#x27;s teeth are metal, so give the comb more stability.</li>
            <li>i think a toddler could easily bend it,aside of this the pearls are ok.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very special.</li>
            <li>But other than that I am very happy with the comb.</li>
            <li>It is just as big and beautiful as the picture and the description.  </li>

            <li>, it was still a fabulous price, so I&#x27;ll gift it.</li>
            <li>Does NOT look cheap.</li>
            <li>the comb fit nicelyl in my hair.</li>
            <li>But up close looks cheap made.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, slow shipping but great quality.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too!!!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed as I did not have any huge expectations.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use this hair pin.</li>
            <li>So pretty and elegant.</li>
            <li>I received this yesterday, a full week ahead of the estimated arrival date.  </li>
            <li>It came fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped to me rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as pictured with all stone firmly secure.</li>
            <li>Give it time to arrive, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Beautiful hair clip, but not for thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Good design but the only issue is the metal hocks to the hair are too soft</li>
            <li>But its pretty.</li>
            <li>its just so pretty.</li>
            <li>The price was really reasonable !</li>
            <li>It was exactly as pictured and appears well made...</li>
            <li>Much prettier in person</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this company</li>
            <li>Normally, you would spend $60+ on something like this a Davids Bridal.</li>
            <li>This comb is much larger that I thought, of course, I have a small head :) It&#x27;s suited for thick or curled hair best, as it is quite heavy and needs a lot of hair volume to hold it.</li>
            <li>too heavy didn&#x27;t stay in, but very pretty combs!</li>
            <li>old world feel and look to it because of the pearls.  </li>
            <li>This is very pretty but also quite heavy.</li>

            <li> This is very pretty but also quite heavy.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it for a wedding as it is not stunning or expensive looking enough, but for a less special occasion it will be just fine.</li>
            <li> Only con is it took really long to ship.</li>
            <li> It is definitely pretty but a little hard to stay in your hair if you have thinnish hair</li>
            <li> I got what I hoped &amp; expected.</li>
            <li> Broken when received, it is pretty though not able to use for wedding.</li>
            <li> Others have stated it is  heavy.</li>
            <li> very heavy and tends to want to fall out of my hair.</li>
            <li> it is sturdy yet delicate looking.  </li>
            <li> I had medium thick curly hair so getting it out of my hair is the challenge.</li>
            <li> A less expensive hair accessory, and it works &amp; stays in place.</li>
            <li> So if you have thin hair like mine, I&#x27;d skip it.</li>
            <li> it was broken when received</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shiny alloy with glass stone and fake pearls.</li>
            <li> the comb is medium gauge twisted wire with wire hold clip.</li>
            <li> I bought it just for a dress up party &amp; since I was unable to wear it</li>

            <li> The hair comb looks very nice but it doesn&#x27;t follow the shape of a head, so I could only use it on the side. Otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> A beautiful hair accessory. Much prettier in person and I received complements all day.</li>
            <li> It came fairly quickly. It&#x27;s a shiny alloy with glass stone and fake pearls.It came exactly as pictured with all stone firmly secure. It&#x27;s substantial costume jewelry. Others have stated it is  heavy. I found it workable. I had medium thick curly hair so getting it out of my hair is the challenge. the comb is medium gauge twisted wire with wire hold clip. I look forward to wearing it at my reception in the summer.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip, but not for thick hair.  Wish the comb had been wider.</li>
            <li> 2 pearls were off in package upon delivery. But its pretty.</li>

            <li> I gave this to my friend to wear at her wedding. It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful! Give it time to arrive, but well worth the wait. Normally, you would spend $60+ on something like this a Davids Bridal. Save money an use this one. So pretty and elegant. Does NOT look cheap.</li>

            <li> I received this yesterday, a full week ahead of the estimated arrival date.  It was exactly as pictured and appears well made...I haven&#x27;t worn it yet, it is for my wedding in June, so no comment on how it wears or if it stays put.</li>

            <li> This comb is much larger that I thought, of course, I have a small head :) It&#x27;s suited for thick or curled hair best, as it is quite heavy and needs a lot of hair volume to hold it.

            <li> A wonderful product. I would highly recommend this company</li>
            <li> My sister wore this to prom, and it looked very beautiful!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful bridal hair comb. The comb&#x27;s teeth are metal, so give the comb more stability. My only criticism is that it was mailed without any protective packaging. I had to glue 2 of the pearls back on. But other than that I am very happy with the comb.</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;Very old world feel and look to it because of the pearls.  One has to wear hear up to use this but it&#x27;s very special.</li>
