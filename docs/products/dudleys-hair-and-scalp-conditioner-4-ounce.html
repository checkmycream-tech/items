            <li>Was excited to see the great reviews, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly petroleum jelly and mineral oil.</li>
            <li>It came out ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The oil is light and not as greasy as amla oil.</li>
            <li>Light texture.</li>
            <li>It is light on your hair without the buildup.  </li>
            <li>Light and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Those are the top two main ingredients.</li>
            <li>My hair turned out pretty cool.</li>
            <li>It showed up right when it said it would.....</li>
            <li>I have been looking for it everywhere but have only been able to find it online.</li>
            <li>It actually did ok on the moisture.</li>
            <li>Works well and smells better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I think its responsible for no balding at 51.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>But 1 it costs too much for the size and ingredients.</li>
            <li>really, really, really greasy.  </li>
            <li>Really greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have fine long hair</li>
            <li>The main ingredient is Petrolatum, which is petroleum jelly, according to Wikipedia.</li>
            <li>I would wet my hair lightly, use the moisture retainer, then use this.</li>
            <li>Once introduced to Dudley products, I fell in love with it and have been using it for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely--not too heavy--but go easy as all you need for average length is a nickel sized dollop.  </li>
            <li>And if I&#x27;m going to oya the price, I rather it be all natural.</li>
            <li>and I started to have big red bumps all over my scalp soon after the first application.</li>
            <li>You should use this after you towel dry your hair or when your hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have not tried Dudley&#x27;s as a scalp oil but only use it on my really dry ends.</li>

            <li> It showed up right when it said it would..... They did an excellent job in getting this to me congrats guys!!!</li>
            <li> Once introduced to Dudley products, I fell in love with it and have been using it for quite a few years.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Despite the ecstatic reviews on this product, it did not work for me at all... and not for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a good conditioner to use as an alternative to what I have (which is an awesome conditioner BTW) and I came across Dudley&#x27;s on Amazon. Was excited to see the great reviews, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the instruction on how to use this was very vague. This is an OIL conditioner. You should use this after you towel dry your hair or when your hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it made my scalp so itchy and I started to have big red bumps all over my scalp soon after the first application. I was scratching my head like crazy and I made several bloody wounds. I waited for a week and tried it again just in case the bumps were not caused by this... and boy I regret I did.... am still scratching my head after over two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it did not work for me, I gave it to my husband to try and his scalp had almost the same reaction... not huge red bumps, but itchy scalp and dandruff kind of things on his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us have sensitive scalp --at least to this date that we are in our mid 30&#x27;s... I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> It is not what I thought it was.  I used to buy a daily moisturizer that was white and creamy.  This was like oily hair grease.</li>
            <li> Dudley&#x27;s oil is great- I have been looking for it everywhere but have only been able to find it online. The oil is light and not as greasy as amla oil. I have not tried Dudley&#x27;s as a scalp oil but only use it on my really dry ends. Great oil!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended Dudley&#x27;s to me years ago and it works great for my hair. Never greasy just a dab will do. Gives great silky shine .&lt;br /&gt;Please do not stop selling Dudleys its a hard to find item&lt;br /&gt;Love the seller gets a A+ for customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I learned about this product from my hair stylist.  It&#x27;s lovely--not too heavy--but go easy as all you need for average length is a nickel sized dollop.  Keeps the frizzies down without that nasty, drying silicone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. I think its responsible for no balding at 51.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Light texture.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient is Petrolatum, which is petroleum jelly, according to Wikipedia. The second ingredient is mineral oil and the third is paraffin. I would not have bought this product if I had seen a list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great product and the shipping was quick.I will order again .Thanks</li>
            <li> This product from Dudley is great.  It is light on your hair without the buildup.  It makes your hair sheen well and manageable.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. My hair turned out pretty cool. But 1 it costs too much for the size and ingredients. It&#x27;s mostly petroleum jelly and mineral oil. Those are the top two main ingredients. That&#x27;s not preferable for me. So why 3 stars instead of 1. It actually did ok on the moisture. I would wet my hair lightly, use the moisture retainer, then use this. And when I would go out I&#x27;d add gel too. It came out ok. But not great. It got the job done but not at the price. So this is a no for me but whatever. It&#x27;s better products out there. And if I&#x27;m going to oya the price, I rather it be all natural. Petroleum and mineral oils are inexpensive. And based off the ingredients I think it should cost about half the price. No more than about $5 for the product.</li>
            <li> good stuff if you have a dry scalp. you can use it once or twice a week and wash your hair in between</li>
            <li> Light and works like a charm. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is not for my hair... really, really, really greasy.  Really greasy.  Like crisco greasy</li>
            <li> I have fine long hair and I wanted something scalp conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t weight down my hair. Dudley&#x27;s Hair and Scalp Conditioner is perfect. Thank you.</li>
