            <li> will order more in time</li>
            <li> Answer to a costly situation. I went to my local pharmacy to pick up a bottle of this and discovered the price had doubled on it! I bought an 8 oz bottle because my father (in hospice care) really needed it for cracked heels (bad if one is diabetic and he is). An 8 oz bottle will not last very long.  I looked at what Amazon had to offer and they were a godsend, having two 28oz bottles for under the same price I paid for the 8 oz bottle locally.  This stuff (recommended by a dermatologist) really works and clears up the dry cracked skin in just about 2 weeks,  Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t stain or beach out clothing.  It feels gummy and sticky though but with socks that is not a problem.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for a friend with troubled feet before.  He says it works pretty good. He keeps asking me to order it when he is almost out, so I guess it&#x27;s ok.  it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> Almost a miracle product for treating cracked heels from thick, dry scale. Using regularly along with abrasive defoliation has permitted effective treatment of a chronic problem. Amazon pricing is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Ammonium Lactate lotion I have tasted. I usually mix some in with my yogurt, but now that summer is here I have it straight over ice. Makes a great summer cocktail!!</li>
            <li> Product is great, mailer packaging not so great.  They have gone from boxes to bubble mail packaging and I have received lotion with broken lids, bottle smash and the lotion heats up and gets sticky from summer heat....charge more for the box, I&#x27;ll pay it.</li>
            <li> used for years, very good.  b</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for several years after the dermatologist recommended it to me.  It really helps my dry skin and is not the least bit greasy.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was sooper fast. I have KP in my upper arms. Using this once a day after shower for the past 20 days. The redness has cleared and the bumps have slightly reduced. I have this condition for the past 25 years. I dont expect a miracle solution. But this slowly clears. I also have dark spots on my legs. This lotion is slowly working on that too. Please do purchase this lotion. It works better than all the drugstore lotions.</li>
            <li> Has a weird thick feeling residue. And makes skin looks oily/greasy. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my KP except it got worse.</li>
            <li> Good product!  Does the trick!</li>
            <li> Great product with great price.</li>
            <li> The best results I had in years.</li>
            <li> Does a great job for my skin.</li>
            <li> making my skin smoothy</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised and is of very good quality.</li>
            <li> As good as Amlactin but cheaper - I keep buying it. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Good product. My son skin is dry and scaley and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST for dry, cracked feet.  Used this every day after a shower and in no time my feet were healed.  There is no smell.  i have bought this twice and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I was having a awful time bumping myself on any thing I would break the skin ( I am 79 ) and would be bleeding .  The lotion has added moisture to my thin skin  and it has refused the skin breaking tremendously .  I recommend it to any one aging .  My wife now uses it all the time .  I have given it to friends with the same problem.  Jim</li>
            <li> I have unbelievably dry skin.  The first time I purchased this was a few years ago, at a drug store.  They stopped carrying it, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it online ever since.  It has a 12% lactic acid component, that helps dry skin achieve the proper PH balance.  I certainly hope that it continues to remain accessable.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but pricey</li>
            <li> They used this in the hosp. and I was very impressed with it that I wanted some more and found it on amazom. Very good product.  thank you</li>
