            <li>Its an excellent product to tame the frizz, resolve split ends, add moisture to course hair as well as add shine to the hair.</li>
            <li>but I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>: One can use argan oil as a full body moisturizer, just like you would use any body cream.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>shipped fast to my home!!</li>

            <li>.. I actually really like it , itâ€™s not oily or does it make my hair oily ..</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I find my wife mixing a spoon of the argon oil with intense conditioner and let her hair soak in it for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I have found that using Argan oil on my face and neck at night has really helped my skin, I really like the way it has make my skin feel.</li>
            <li>The face is smooth, clear and radiant, all thanks to using argan oil as my daily morning</li>
            <li>There are two things that I particularly enjoy using this for, dry feet and for my hands.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for hair, as well as for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way that this oil leaves my hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to everyone who wants soft, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I did have a few more break-outs on my chin</li>
            <li>I am new to this oil</li>
            <li>It smells great, is lightweight enough for everyday use under sunscreen and the dispenser is so much easier to use than other products.</li>
            <li>I also dab on the tips of my (very fine) hair, wet and dry.</li>
            <li>Have used this oil as a moisturizer for skin (with lotion) and a conditioner for my hair (both wet and dry) and love it for both.</li>
            <li>: It might seem unconventional to apply pure argan oil to your face, especially if you have oily prone acne skin, but I have been doing just that</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is pretty dry and have been using a few drops in my hair after I take a shower.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for several days and it really soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so soft and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my skin and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>This has been much better for me than just doing one wash a week with only conditioner - it was too heavy on my hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other products are heavily concentrated, which is nice on occasion.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle scent so if you use it with your other lotions there&#x27;s no conflicting scents.  </li>
            <li>It is much nicer than some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried that include a spray pump.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much softer and less parched and that feeling stays with me throughout the day.  </li>

            <li> This oil is a great product to use for all parts of the body without worrying about sickening chemicals.</li>
            <li> The other Argan Oil I have used left my hair feeling and looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> (very minor though)</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I also have a daughter who has dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Towel dry her hair and brush.</li>
            <li> Her hair is no longer dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It helps with my dry skin in the winter time.</li>
            <li> It works on patches of dry skin</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how little goes a long way--and I do mean just a tiny dab.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair all the time and that makes it very dry.</li>
            <li> Blended well with other oils.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m planning on using it every other night instead of every night to see how that will work.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it to my hair after shower while it is still a bit damp for an all over deep treatment or just take a few drops and apply to the ends after you blow dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scalp: If you have a dry or itchy scalp, dab a few drops of argan oil on to a cotton ball apply to your scalp.</li>
            <li> The results have been shiny hair with less frizz.</li>
            <li> The smell was not strong for argan oil.</li>
            <li> like the small bottle and the pump nozzle.</li>
            <li> It performs as I need it to, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this Organic Argan Oil. The pump bottle is very convenient and easy to use. I color my hair all the time and that makes it very dry. So I heard Argan Oil is a fantastic way to have moisture added to your hair so I decided to give this a try. It works wonders. My hair is no longer dry and brittle. I also have a daughter who has dry frizzy hair. Once a week I will apply some of this oil to her hair and work it in thoroughly, let it sit for an hour or even over night depending on what we have planned then wash it out. Towel dry her hair and brush. There are no tangles unlike if I just use a conditioner. Her hair is no longer dry and frizzy. This oil is now a part of our weekly hair routine.&lt;br /&gt;  I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review. Regardless all options are 100% my own based on experiences with said product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic !00% Organic Argan oil!! I love Argan oil. I use it every day. It helps with my dry skin in the winter time. Also helps improves my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil Benefits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair: Argan oil is an extremely popular hair care product and there are good reasons behind it. Its an excellent product to tame the frizz, resolve split ends, add moisture to course hair as well as add shine to the hair. I usually apply it to my hair after shower while it is still a bit damp for an all over deep treatment or just take a few drops and apply to the ends after you blow dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp: If you have a dry or itchy scalp, dab a few drops of argan oil on to a cotton ball apply to your scalp. If you do this in the nighttime before you go to sleep, it will give time for the oil to moisturize your scalp. You can then wash your hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face: It might seem unconventional to apply pure argan oil to your face, especially if you have oily prone acne skin, but I have been doing just that and my skin stays hydrated and nourished. The face is smooth, clear and radiant, all thanks to using argan oil as my daily morning moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body: One can use argan oil as a full body moisturizer, just like you would use any body cream. Use argan oil right after you get out of shower for best moisturizing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands: Your hands would love argan oil. If your cuticles or nails are prone to cracking and peeling, argan oil would work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that this oil leaves my hair silky and soft.  I have used it as a carrier oil infused with essential oils. It works great as a carrier. It&#x27;s scent is very light as to not interfere with the scents of the essential oils.  It works on patches of dry skin and  It helps to control the frizzy ends of my hair.  It comes sealed with the pump separate.  The instructions are clear and easy to read on the box.  I would suggest this one.</li>
            <li> Blended well with other oils. Adsorbed into the skin rapidly and pumped out of bottle easily.  I received this product at a discounted price; however, my feedback is my own.</li>
            <li> I am new to this oil but I was not disappointed.  I have fine hair that is pretty dry and have been using a few drops in my hair after I take a shower.  The results have been shiny hair with less frizz. It doesn&#x27;t seem to add any weight to my hair either.  This has been much better for me than just doing one wash a week with only conditioner - it was too heavy on my hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been putting it on my face and neck at night.  My skin feels much softer and less parched and that feeling stays with me throughout the day.  I did have a few more break-outs on my chin (very minor though) so I&#x27;m planning on using it every other night instead of every night to see how that will work.</li>
            <li> I like to keep this in the shower and at the very end I use it as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s not too greasy - doesn&#x27;t clog my skin. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> .. I actually really like it , itâ€™s not oily or does it make my hair oily .. very light oil. Thanks</li>
            <li> This argon oil is just as good as the well known argon oil on one of the shopping channels.</li>
            <li> Using this for my hair and skin. Leaves me feeling so soft and smooth. This is great for traveling. I find my wife mixing a spoon of the argon oil with intense conditioner and let her hair soak in it for an hour or so. Once she rinses out her hair, it&#x27;s got a brilliant shine. This oil is a great product to use for all parts of the body without worrying about sickening chemicals. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> There are two things that I particularly enjoy using this for, dry feet and for my hands.  You can immediately feel the softness take over.  What I love most is that it absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  It has a nice subtle scent so if you use it with your other lotions there&#x27;s no conflicting scents.  I was very surprised at how little goes a long way--and I do mean just a tiny dab.  This will last me forever and it&#x27;s easy to use!  Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using for several days and it really soaks into your skin. I would buy again</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!  And, wonderful customer service with this company!  Highly recommended.  This product is fantastic for hair, as well as for dry skin.  A friend&#x27;s son suffering from Rosacea has also seen great improvement.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of Argan oil.  Mild scent and applies so smooth to my face!  will definitely purchase again.  shipped fast to my home!!</li>
            <li> Works great, I have been using it every day before I style</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Argan Oil. I use it as facial moisturizer after showering and before bedtime. Other products are heavily concentrated, which is nice on occasion. This product is perfect for me for everyday use. I also dab on the tips of my (very fine) hair, wet and dry. It smells great, is lightweight enough for everyday use under sunscreen and the dispenser is so much easier to use than other products. I highly recommend this! Oh - an added benefit is to rub your hands together to get the last bits on your nails - it strengthens and helps them grow!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good - very light and not greasy!</li>
            <li> I have found that using Argan oil on my face and neck at night has really helped my skin, I really like the way it has make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is fabulous. It&#x27;s light and non-oily feeling on the skin. I will definitely re-order.</li>
            <li> HoaP would like to thank North Island for giving us product to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the small bottle and the pump nozzle. It is much nicer than some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried that include a spray pump. Who sprays oil on their face? The pump nozzle allowed me to put just enough on my fingertips and rub it into my face. I used the excess on my nails. It helped to loosen cuticles and make my nails shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this argan oil because it is organic. The smell was not strong for argan oil. It reminds me of suntan oil, but smoother and a lighter scent. I was impressed with how easily the oil was absorbed by my skin. It did not leave a greasy residue. The scent did not overwhelm, and I am a happy customer. I will use this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HoaP received sample product in exchange for an honest review. [...]</li>
            <li> Have used this oil as a moisturizer for skin (with lotion) and a conditioner for my hair (both wet and dry) and love it for both. I also really like the soft, subtle smell!</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil is awesome. It leaves my hair feeling so soft and not at all greasy. I have used Argan oil on my hair for awhile and this is one of my favorites. I have never tried Argan Oil on my skin but the directions said you can use it on your skin and hair. I tried it on my skin and it makes my skin feel so soft. I just love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this argan oil product! It performs as I need it to, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent. I will purchase from this company again!</li>
            <li> All I can say is I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair and on my face before bedtime.  Awesome stuff.  The other Argan Oil I have used left my hair feeling and looking greasy.  This doesn&#x27;t!  Would recommend to everyone who wants soft, shiny hair.</li>
