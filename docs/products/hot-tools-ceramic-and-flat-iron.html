            <li>I like it much better than the pricey Sedu I have, but not quite as much as my Babyliss.  </li>
            <li>My Hot Tools flat iron works great.</li>

            <li>This is a great iron and not overpriced like other brands.  </li>

            <li>Great for the price, Very shiny finish don&#x27;t need to retouch next day .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this would be a great, long lasting investment!</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron in March after hearing that Hot Tools was a good brand.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and get something more professional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super hot</li>
            <li>I have had this product for a month now and its is great am so glad that I purchased this flat iron than all the other one I looked at and the price was affordable.</li>
            <li>And it was priced just right.  </li>
            <li>Had to go out right away to replace it.</li>
            <li>I love it mostly because you can turn it up or turn it down, what ever you need.</li>
            <li>I have been trying all the flat irons anyone can possibly imagine but this one is by far THE BEST!</li>
            <li>so I finally did and it is a great flat iron....</li>
            <li>The first Hot tools item I purchased through a vendor did not work.</li>
            <li>Works just as efficiently as the higher priced models.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools becasue</li>
            <li>I have first hand expirence with it.  </li>
            <li>so that is a real benefit for me!  </li>
            <li>and it gets BARELY hot.</li>
            <li>I copied the numbers from one at the salon to make sure I got the exact same model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had hot tools for my curling irons</li>
            <li>I achieved professional results with this flat iron, and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t go out and buy the one my salon uses on my hair because I would have been out $100 bucks at least for a product that doesn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li>I love my new flat iron.</li>
            <li>Says that doing her hair is much easier.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed straight all day.</li>
            <li>Actually, it&#x27;s much faster than drying it.  </li>
            <li>and I felt it was just not as hot as the new ones on the market now, so I decided to purchas a new one.  </li>
            <li>Gets a little too hot on the highest setting but overall very straight and very smooth.</li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up fast and stays hot.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>I have received several compliments on how silky and pretty my hair looked.</li>
            <li>Now it takes me 20-30 minutes, which is a pretty big difference.</li>
            <li>It works fine, just was hoping for less breakage.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward 6 months and all of the sudden, I go to use it</li>
            <li>bought this to replace my wifes breaking hair straightener, as her sister uses this brand professionally</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and my curls last longer.  </li>
            <li>The only inconvenience though is that you will need the CHROMATIQUE Professional High Temperature Heat Resistant Hair Iron Holder.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and I only have to make a swipe and its straight and my hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li>I have a Hot Tools flat iron from several years ago</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and it straightened it pretty well, not nearly as straight as my roommate&#x27;s titanium straightener did.</li>
            <li>I had an older flat iron that had no temperature setting</li>
            <li>This item was only 5 months old when this occurred.  </li>
            <li>My fave flat iron by far!</li>
            <li>(about 3 times a week)  Went to use it today and there is barely any power or heat coming from the barrel.  </li>
            <li>It only took me 20 minutes to straighten my whole head, and my hair is very long.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd flat iron in the last 4 years (same exact model)</li>
            <li>Gets nice and hot to straighten even my thick, thick pile of hair!  </li>
            <li>I had owned this hot iron previously for 5 years.</li>
            <li>Such high quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>This straightens my thick, coarse hair well even on a low temperature setting, and it&#x27;s easy to hold.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This straightens my thick, coarse hair well even on a low temperature setting, and it&#x27;s easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron January and just recently it blew out when I was doing my hair and burnt my hair in 2 places.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Had to run out to the store to get another flat iron because I was in the middle of doing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the only flat iron that does my hair justice 😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 9 months, and it works just as it did when I got it back in January.</li>
            <li> least Amazon was willing to refund my money by sending back the defected flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me to buy a flat iron with ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> And I probably left it plugged in too long..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never owned a flat iron before now!</li>
            <li> in all, don&#x27;t leave it on too long</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair to the point where it can be unmanageable sometimes, so I had my doubts that this low-cost strightener would work well, but it really does.</li>
            <li> Not hot enough to do anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought straightening it would take so long!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very wavy hair and need something that can get the job done as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It straightens my medium-thick and wavy hair in a single pass.</li>
            <li> I just received this new one in late April-</li>
            <li> I have had mine less then a month and during use it will heat up to desired heat, then all of a SUDDEN NOT WORK AND HAVE LOSS OF HEAT.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Less time on hair makes me happier.</li>
            <li> working mid May. I wrote to the vender and asked them to at least examine the iron before rejecting my request to exchange as it was maybe 30 days past the exchange date.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this everyday and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> I have used it no more than once a week.  </li>
            <li> But it was at least 6 months or so after I started using it..</li>

            <li> This product came recommended by another consumer. My wife loves it. Says that doing her hair is much easier. Less time on hair makes me happier. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love it! For the price, it works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent straightener at a bargain price.  Gets nice and hot to straighten even my thick, thick pile of hair!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome....  Great flat iron... My friend recommended me to buy it so I finally did and it is a great flat iron.... It heats up fast and the good thing is that you can adjust the temperature on it... Very satisfied with purchasing this item....</li>
            <li> I have been trying all the flat irons anyone can possibly imagine but this one is by far THE BEST! The only inconvenience though is that you will need the CHROMATIQUE Professional High Temperature Heat Resistant Hair Iron Holder. Other than that I can just say that this is my best one!</li>
            <li> Hiii i wasnt able to receive it because of my mistake of not puting the apt number on the address and now the package is going back what can I do ??</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up fast and stays hot.  My hairdresser told me to buy a flat iron with ceramic plates.  Works a lot better than the ancient one I was replacing.  And it was priced just right.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy one for $100 or more.  This one just suits me fine.</li>
            <li> This flat iron leaves you with beautiful straight hair that lasts all day. I have thick, long hair to the point where it can be unmanageable sometimes, so I had my doubts that this low-cost strightener would work well, but it really does. I love it. My hair stayed straight all day. It only took me 20 minutes to straighten my whole head, and my hair is very long. I achieved professional results with this flat iron, and I love it! I have received several compliments on how silky and pretty my hair looked. This is a must-have product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron January and just recently it blew out when I was doing my hair and burnt my hair in 2 places.  This item was only 5 months old when this occurred.  I have used it no more than once a week.  There is no reason why it should have blown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to run out to the store to get another flat iron because I was in the middle of doing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least Amazon was willing to refund my money by sending back the defected flat iron.  I love Amazon.  I always purchase from Amazon and I recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> The first Hot tools item I purchased through a vendor did not work. I was already nervous about buying things online so that experience didn&#x27;t help. Then I contacted Amazon. The customer service rep. was wonderful and helped me find the same item that I could purchase directly from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The second Hot tools item arrived quickly and  has been working perfectly.  I now know items purchased through Amazon or vendors are 100% guaranteed, from A to Z.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is a great flat iron. Nice consistent heat. Glides through your hair. Works just as efficiently as the higher priced models.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; keeps hair shiny &amp; smooth! The pricing is great as well. I definitely recommend this product. Buy it and enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I have a Hot Tools flat iron from several years ago and I felt it was just not as hot as the new ones on the market now, so I decided to purchas a new one.  I of course looked at all brands, but was drawn to Hot Tools becasue I have first hand expirence with it.  After reading the reviews that stated this worked great, I decided at this price I would give it a try.  WOW!!  It really does work great!  It&#x27;s super hot and I got my hair done much faster because it slides right over my hair the first time and make it stick striaght and nice and shinny too!  I have very long hair so that is a real benefit for me!  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t go out and buy the one my salon uses on my hair because I would have been out $100 bucks at least for a product that doesn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> This is a great iron and not overpriced like other brands.  It works just as well at smoothing my hair as the $100 ones.  It heats up quickly, is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This straightens my thick, coarse hair well even on a low temperature setting, and it&#x27;s easy to hold.  As someone who tends to burn myself with styling tools, I can say that this is fairly klutz-proof.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.  My wife uses this everyday and she loves it.  Still going strong since christmas.  This is month 3.</li>
            <li> Always satisfied with this product! My fave flat iron by far! 🙌😁 I have very thick hair n this is the only flat iron that does my hair justice 😊</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a month now and its is great am so glad that I purchased this flat iron than all the other one I looked at and the price was affordable. It gets really hot and I only have to make a swipe and its straight and my hair is pretty thick I would recomend this product to anyone just like my friend did to me!</li>
            <li> Thankyou Sooo Much !!!!</li>
            <li> Looks nice but turns out doesn&#x27;t work very well at all! I have had mine less then a month and during use it will heat up to desired heat, then all of a SUDDEN NOT WORK AND HAVE LOSS OF HEAT. NOT A GOOD BY FROM MY EXPERIENCE!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in March after hearing that Hot Tools was a good brand. When I received it, it worked okay... maybe would have given it 3 stars initially. I have wavy hair and it straightened it pretty well, not nearly as straight as my roommate&#x27;s titanium straightener did. Fast forward 6 months and all of the sudden, I go to use it and it gets BARELY hot. Not hot enough to do anything to my hair. Had to go out right away to replace it. So considering that several others have had this issue with this product... I do not recommend it.  (Though, I give 5 stars to Amazon for always being wonderful!!)</li>
            <li> This is the flat-iron they use at the salon I go to.  I copied the numbers from one at the salon to make sure I got the exact same model. Such high quality for such a low price. I like it much better than the pricey Sedu I have, but not quite as much as my Babyliss.  I have very thick, very wavy hair and need something that can get the job done as quickly as possible.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd flat iron in the last 4 years (same exact model) Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> I had an older flat iron that had no temperature setting and know I needed a new one. My Hot Tools flat iron works great. I keep the temp at about 375 degrees and it straightens my hair beautifully and keeps it straight. So easy to use and glides through my hair.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and still works great after having it over a year</li>
            <li> Great iron. I bought one for my college age daughter an she loves it. It is what my hair stylist uses!</li>
            <li> Very good, I do my hair so fast it works</li>
            <li> bought this to replace my wifes breaking hair straightener, as her sister uses this brand professionally I knew I was getting a good deal on a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has adjustable heat setting and a pulse technology (whatever that means) and goes up to 450 degrees. what used to take her an hour and  min no takes about 45 min....id say that&#x27;s a smart buy!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never owned a flat iron before now! This product is excellent.  I have curly/wavy hair, and I wear it that way most of the time, but sometimes I like to straighten it.  This is a quick and easy method to do so without rewashing my hair.  Actually, it&#x27;s much faster than drying it.  I thought straightening it would take so long! Not so!</li>
            <li> This straightener was great.  For 4 months (about 3 times a week)  Went to use it today and there is barely any power or heat coming from the barrel.  Turned it off and on/unplugged it etc.  Will be contacting Amazon to try to get a replacement or a refund.  VERY disappointed.  Do yourself a favor and get something more professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 9 months, and it works just as it did when I got it back in January. It straightens my medium-thick and wavy hair in a single pass. I used to spend 1 hour or 1 and 1/2 hours to straighten my hair in the morning. Now it takes me 20-30 minutes, which is a pretty big difference. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Great for the price, Very shiny finish don&#x27;t need to retouch next day . Recomend it!</li>
            <li> used to get the Chi brand but hey raised their prices! I&#x27;ve always had hot tools for my curling irons and I can say proudly now that they are my offical brand I will always use them!</li>
            <li> Looked for a straightener to replace my hot tools helix and this one is perfect!! Heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull out hair, and leaves my hair super smooth!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this brand to me.  I have since bought two flatirons and a curling iron.  Heats up fast and my curls last longer.  My daughters love their flatirons.</li>
            <li> Gets a little too hot on the highest setting but overall very straight and very smooth.</li>
            <li> I had owned this hot iron previously for 5 years. I just received this new one in late April- It stopped working mid May. I wrote to the vender and asked them to at least examine the iron before rejecting my request to exchange as it was maybe 30 days past the exchange date.The iron was not dropped,or damaged in any way. They refused. I will no longer be ordering from them- I&#x27;d rather pay extra and deal with a vender who has some class.</li>
            <li> The heating coils (or which ever part is used to heat it) went out on me.. But it was at least 6 months or so after I started using it.. And I probably left it plugged in too long.. All in all it is probably my fault that it stopped working. I loved it while it was in commission. It made my hair silky and smooth. I love hot tools products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, don&#x27;t leave it on too long and I&#x27;m sure this would be a great, long lasting investment!</li>
            <li> I had another one and my hair was frying all the time.  I tried this one and my hair is still frying.  I use hair oil and heat spray too.  It works fine, just was hoping for less breakage.</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron. I love it mostly because you can turn it up or turn it down, what ever you need. My hair is easy to break at the roots so I use a lower temp, it&#x27;s great !</li>
