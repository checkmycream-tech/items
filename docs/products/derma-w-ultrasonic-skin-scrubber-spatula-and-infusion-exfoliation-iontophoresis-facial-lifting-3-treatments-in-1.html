            <li>I really liked this ultrasonic cleaner for the first month</li>

            <li>This skin ultrasonic scrubber is fantastic.</li>

            <li>I did a very good job of cleaning my face &amp; neck, especially those pesky little pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>really could remove dead skin and surprisingly remove my pimple too.</li>
            <li>The spatula is easy to use and gives a gentle boost to facial cleansing and product penetration.</li>

            <li>now i touch my skin so soft, no dead skin at all</li>
            <li>There are three settings, the first clears the skin of congestion with no down time,  the second setting helps the skin to absorb products such as serums into the skin, and the third helps with lifting of the skin.</li>
            <li>The manual is not very clear on how to use it but just go to U-Tube and there are plenty of live instructions for similar product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t vibrate like it did the first few times</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this item January 15th and it has cease to hold a charge 3 months later.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you $$$$$ !!!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be adding it to my options for clients to try. It really does everything it states. I am very pleased with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> It stops working after one week! It can&#x27;t be charged any more and signal lights do not show up any longer......</li>
            <li> Very pleased and happy with this purchase. It cleans the skin very well and that is the reason I purchased. I find that it does not irritate the skin and is extremely effective as it is non abrasive.</li>
            <li> I used this product 1 time. I loved it. I worked wonderfully. I was looking forward to the benefits that I received with just one use. Unfortunately the product would not turn on after that. I charge it fully, tried everything I could think of. There was no number to call, no trouble shooting instructions. I have thought about purchasing this product again. Maybe another one would last.</li>
            <li> I really liked this ultrasonic cleaner for the first month I had it. I did a very good job of cleaning my face &amp; neck, especially those pesky little pores on my nose. The only reason I stopped liking it was that it stopped working at one month &amp; it is beyond the Amazon  return date. I called HansDerma &amp; they told me to file a case with Amazon. Now I feel caught &amp; don&#x27;t have an ultrasonic cleaner, which I need for my skin care.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is usually very good so I&#x27;m going to find out how to &amp;#34;open a case&amp;#34; as Hansderma instructed.&lt;br /&gt;The irony is I bought this one which cost more than others because it had  better warranty &amp; customer service ratings.</li>
            <li> how can i charge it ? i don&#x27;t know how i tried to plug it in my computer but it didn&#x27;t work my computer got turned off right away ,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please help</li>
            <li> Stopped working after using it a few times. Don&#x27;t bother. Do not waste your money...For this $$$$$$-very bad quality products!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing is an understatement. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 days and already see a huge difference!</li>
            <li> after using couple times I could tell my skin feels cleaner and soother&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product</li>
            <li> Ultrasonic is the new Clarisonic, that&#x27;s all I can say! Unlike bristle/brush heads that kind of just push dirt around, I feel much more confident in spatula devices like this one to do a thorough deep cleaning. I wear makeup and even after I think I&#x27;ve washed my face well, a few swipes of this tool shows the bits of residual makeup and grey &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; (dead skin cells) that manual face washing doesn&#x27;t take off. I only need to do this a couple of times a week and I see a difference in the radiance. I am breaking out at the moment so I am more careful with the settings and what areas of my face I go over; however, I am very familiar with the benefits of ultrasonic devices in particular for healthy skin and this is a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after using it a few times.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This is a nice at at home adjunct to your existing skin care regimen. The spatula is easy to use and gives a gentle boost to facial cleansing and product penetration.</li>
            <li> It should be &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for every girl and woman.</li>
            <li> I have used this product professionally for the last two months now, and I love the results! Very easy to use,very easy to handle. There are three settings, the first clears the skin of congestion with no down time,  the second setting helps the skin to absorb products such as serums into the skin, and the third helps with lifting of the skin. I love using this is my treatments and my clients and I have definitely noticed a difference in their skin..A great buy! Karen at Kensington salon and spa Tampa FL</li>
            <li> works great , I brought for my daughter as a xtmas gift , she loves it</li>
            <li> I like this spatula very much. At first I was not impress with the way it works and the result. But as I got use to handling it and improve on the technique, I definitely see a difference in my skin tone and brightness. This product delivered what it promised. The manual is not very clear on how to use it but just go to U-Tube and there are plenty of live instructions for similar product. It was delivered promptly and arrived intact. Definitely worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Works great and cleans out the skin</li>
            <li> No mess, quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I usually wipe off my make up with a wipe then wash. I tried the scrubber and still saw makeup coming off my skin. I have acne prone skin so have a clean face is crucial. Love the scrubber, I take my time with it. I use it about twice a week and noticed the the serums thats recommend with it has been great for my skin. No breakouts means great products!</li>
            <li> I guess I would have liked it if it worked for more than a month. Now its too late to ask for a replacement.  Doesn&#x27;t vibrate like it did the first few times I used it.  I only used it once or twice a week, and now the vibration is almost gone.  Too expensive for such a short replacement period.</li>
            <li> I bought a Vitamin C serum and I heard that vitamin c doesn&#x27;t penetrate well to the skin. I made some research and found that ultrasonic scrubber boost vitamin c absorption. I tried it with my vitamin serum and I can see serum absorbs better.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. It stopped working after a week!</li>
            <li> It works very nicely. Good blasting power.</li>
            <li> I really like this scrubber, it&#x27;s powerful and keeps a charge! I have used it on myself and will be using it in aesthetics business when I open next month. It does a great job of lifting the skin, I use it in conjunction with lymphatic drainage. Fantastic job in penetrating products as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this skin scrubber!  It is also good for extractions makes them come right out after you use steam.  The nutrition mode is very good at driving products into the skin.  Will be introducing it in my skin care studio!  Linda Principe  Linda&#x27;s Skin Care Studio</li>
            <li> This skin ultrasonic scrubber is fantastic. It cleans blackheads and congestion quickly on prepared skin. The nutrition mode is helpful for infusing serums. The skin obviously loves it! And the lift function is fantastic. It helps me put things back where they belong - the neck! I love the soft feel of it in my hand. I am a fan. Can&#x27;t wait to introduce it to my clients.</li>
            <li> Great product üëç üëç üëç üëç</li>
            <li> really could remove dead skin and surprisingly remove my pimple too. now i touch my skin so soft, no dead skin at all</li>
