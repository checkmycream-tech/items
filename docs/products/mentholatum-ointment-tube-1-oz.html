            <li>One female passenger repeatedly boards the bus, manages to ride for free with sob stories to the driver, and talks everyone&#x27;s head off with inane banter.</li>

            <li>much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>This makes traveling much much easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a plus that it also works so very well.  </li>
            <li>so this was a real find</li>
            <li>WORKS AS DISCRIBED THANKS</li>
            <li>thank youi for offering it connie high wynkoop</li>
            <li>The tube lets me dispense a precise dab without getting it all over my fingers and the tube takes up much less room.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same Mentholatum, but cleaner, neater, more controlled, and with less chance of cross-contamination.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda hard to find Mentholatum any more.</li>
            <li>unsanitary as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>Keeps nostrils clear when air is hot and dry.</li>
            <li>nothing, I mean Nothing, works better for chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Thus product us becoming harder and harder to find in pharmacues,si imagine my surprise when I discovered it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find now in drug stores, especially in the handy tube size.</li>
            <li>Hard to find locally, and is like the idea of not having to stick my finger in a jar and get more than I needed.</li>

            <li>But lately it has only been available in a jar.  </li>
            <li>but if you really have chapped lips and you want them to get better, use this mentholatum ointment on your lips and or nose (if you had a cold) and the next day--no chapping.</li>
            <li>My doctor says it is a good nautual alternative to the prescription nose drops I was using and much less expensive.  </li>

            <li> Menthalatum is excellentfor dry nose and lips</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to carry a little jar of these products and only Mentholatum seems to come in a tube that I can stow in my backpack.</li>
            <li> My daughter is now 16 and plays the oboe and her lips were a mess.</li>
            <li> just the little tub is sold now....</li>
            <li> I have allergies and a little asthma, so I put Mentholatum on my lips and a dab under my nose every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> The jar type is messy and unsanitary to poke your finger in.</li>
            <li> But what really bites is that she smells so bad, like rotting garbage; you can literally see a gray wall of stinky fog emanating from her.</li>
            <li> When police officers are in rooms with decaying remains, they can find it bearable if they take some Vicks VaporRub or Mentholatum and put a small dab inside each nostril.</li>
            <li> I have used Mentholatum on my lips for the past 35 years, and credit it for not having ANY wrinkles around my mouth, and I was a smoker for 40 years.</li>
            <li> Since I was a kid, we have used Mentholatum, usually when we had colds.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this item in lots.</li>
            <li> My dad used it on his lips and nose when he had a cold and taught me the same when I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> People always leave the bus earlier than their assigned stops, loudly announcing that they have chosen to walk a few miles rather than suffer through that horrible odor.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, though.  </li>
            <li> Not effective for itch relief, aches, or congestion.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in a tube!</li>
            <li> Within a mintue of application the weak menthol smell dissipated.  </li>
            <li> so I use a secret trick that I learned form my law enforcement days.</li>
            <li> The base ointment is similar to petrolatum.</li>
            <li> Too expensive  </li>
            <li> My grandma is totally obsessed with mentholatum :</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to find this in the stores.  </li>
            <li> The air coming in the nose is filtered to some degree by traveling through the Mentholatum, and it just doesn&#x27;t smell as bad.</li>
            <li> hate the jar that you have to put your finger in to get it our.  </li>
            <li> As when I was in law enforcement, the population needing police services and the population riding the bus run the gamut from well groomed to -- well, disgustingly smelly.</li>

            <li> just what my wife was looking for</li>
            <li> They make blistex, chapstick, bert&#x27;s bees ointment etc. but if you really have chapped lips and you want them to get better, use this mentholatum ointment on your lips and or nose (if you had a cold) and the next day--no chapping. My parents used this,they are now 96. My mother gave me a tube when I left home, and then another tube when I couldn&#x27;t find any 20 years later. My daughter is now 16 and plays the oboe and her lips were a mess. We sharing the last 1/100th left in the tube. I can&#x27;t find this in drug stores. Thanks Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> We had an old tube of Mentholatum for over 10 years that was finally nearing its end.  Had tried to find the product at drug stores and pharmacies off and on with no luck.  I was pleased to find it online so ordered a tube.  The product came promptly and was just like the one we had used up.  It is great for opening up a stuffed nose and makes it easier to sleep.  Definitely worth the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 77 and I&#x27;ve always used Mentholatum (since a child)and prefer it in a tube.  But lately it has only been available in a jar.  I&#x27;m going to Taiwan and the tube will be smaller and lighter. So I  was very happy to find you have the tube.</li>
            <li> I worked in law enforcement for 10 years. I ride a bus to work every day now. As when I was in law enforcement, the population needing police services and the population riding the bus run the gamut from well groomed to -- well, disgustingly smelly. One female passenger repeatedly boards the bus, manages to ride for free with sob stories to the driver, and talks everyone&#x27;s head off with inane banter. But what really bites is that she smells so bad, like rotting garbage; you can literally see a gray wall of stinky fog emanating from her. People always leave the bus earlier than their assigned stops, loudly announcing that they have chosen to walk a few miles rather than suffer through that horrible odor. I paid for my ride unlike this woman and I want to get home, so I use a secret trick that I learned form my law enforcement days. When police officers are in rooms with decaying remains, they can find it bearable if they take some Vicks VaporRub or Mentholatum and put a small dab inside each nostril. The air coming in the nose is filtered to some degree by traveling through the Mentholatum, and it just doesn&#x27;t smell as bad. It still smells, but it is MUCH more bearable. I didn&#x27;t want to carry a little jar of these products and only Mentholatum seems to come in a tube that I can stow in my backpack. The tube lets me dispense a precise dab without getting it all over my fingers and the tube takes up much less room. My bus trips have been rescued by the Mentholatum ointment in tubes. I bought five of them!</li>
            <li> purchased this several times already, not only for me but my sister and mother.  IT WORKS.  can&#x27;t find it in local stores</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do without this product.  So much gentler than Vicks which irritates my skin.  My doctor says it is a good nautual alternative to the prescription nose drops I was using and much less expensive.  Hard to find in stores, though.  Easily found on the Internet.</li>
            <li> Too expensive  but just what I wanted and needed!! Hope it will be available  again in the future!?!</li>
            <li> Like Mentholatum MUCH better than Vicks Vapor Rub. Keeps nostrils clear when air is hot and dry. Tube easier to use. The jar type is messy and unsanitary to poke your finger in.</li>
            <li> I have used Mentholatum on my lips for the past 35 years, and credit it for not having ANY wrinkles around my mouth, and I was a smoker for 40 years. I use it every day, several times a day. My lips are as full and soft as when I was in my 20s. Yes, my friends are quite jealous. I grew up using Mentholatum, and I will always use it.</li>
            <li> Menthalatum is excellentfor dry nose and lips dy ornight. Why did they stop selling it in bottles? A shame.And why did you charge so much for it?</li>
            <li> I can no longer get this product except on line.  Being in a tube is easier to carry in my purse.  I use it for my lips.</li>
            <li> Much better than the jars.  You can&#x27;t find at any of the Local Stores.</li>
            <li> I used it as a lip balm. Really helps chapped lips. Smells good too.  Convenient to put in my purse</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Happy to be able to sit back and order reasonably priced products like this. I am clueless as to why this product cannot be found in major chain grocery store personal care aisles nor major drug store chains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody &amp;#34;splain&amp;#34; that to me please.</li>
            <li> much easier to use.  hate the jar that you have to put your finger in to get it our.  unsanitary as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, you could buy metholatum at the corner drug store...now you can only get it ON LINE..thank youi for offering it connie high wynkoop</li>
            <li> Since I was a kid, we have used Mentholatum, usually when we had colds. It&#x27;s a great way to soothe chapped skin and decongest yourself. The problem always was that you had to dig it out of those jars, probably contaminating it with your germs and also getting it under your nails and all over your fingers in a rather uncontrolled way. I was happy to find out that they now have a tube option. It&#x27;s the same Mentholatum, but cleaner, neater, more controlled, and with less chance of cross-contamination. I like having it around.</li>
            <li> My husband told me his grandfather used this always. Now I use it nightly and like the tube, but it is unavailable...just the little tub is sold now.... It is great for my nose at bedtime since I use a CPAP machine to keep it from drying out too much.</li>
            <li> Grandmom lives on this stuff - great to get it delivered -</li>
            <li> I use it as you would chap stick.  Works great and I love the menthol feel to it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in a tube! Thrilled this format for travelling. Bought one 4 my sister.I love this stuff seriously!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and years and only just found this packaging. This makes traveling much much easier. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing to carry in your purse for chapped lips.  I have used this product for &amp;#62;50 years !!</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally, and is like the idea of not having to stick my finger in a jar and get more than I needed. Overall better use control and can take in my purse.</li>
            <li> I grew up using Mentholatum from both the tube and jar. My dad used it on his lips and nose when he had a cold and taught me the same when I was a little girl.  The smell makes me think of him.  It&#x27;s just a plus that it also works so very well.  You can&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore.  I am thrilled to find it on Amazon in both the tube for traveling and the jar for beside the bed.</li>
            <li> tubes are hrd to come by so this was a real find</li>
            <li> Favorite chapstick! Came quickly too!</li>
            <li> Thus product us becoming harder and harder to find in pharmacues,si imagine my surprise when I discovered it on Amazon. It is the same product that I have always used for opening a stuff nisr. Love it!</li>
            <li> Mentholatum is a great product when you are suffering from head and chest colds. I can remember my Mom using Metholatum whenever we had colds!  The vapors help you breath and the ointment is soothing on tender noses!  I prefer Mentholatum to Vicks because it can be used for chest and head colds. You can rub the ointment under and around your nose to help you breath and relieve skin.  I believe Vicks is used just for chest colds. I could not find Mentholatum in any store and thought it wasn&#x27;t made anymore!  I was so relieved to find it on Amazon!  Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of the tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mentholatum for over 50 years. My Mom used it and introduced it to me. It&#x27;s great for chapped lips...nothing, I mean Nothing, works better for chapped lips. I have allergies and a little asthma, so I put Mentholatum on my lips and a dab under my nose every night before I go to bed. Helps me breathe better and keeps my lips soft. Can&#x27;t sleep without it. If you can get it in the tube that&#x27;s always best. Can put a dab on your finger instead of sticking fingers in a jar every time and spreading germs. Thank you Amazon for carrying it..can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff since I was a kid.  I still LOVE the smell! It&#x27;s kinda hard to find Mentholatum any more. I had never seen it available in a tube.  I love the convenience.</li>
            <li> I have used mentholatum for many years and have never found anything wuite like it. It&#x27;s very hard to find now in drug stores, especially in the handy tube size.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my graNdmother. She loves this stuff. My grandma is totally obsessed with mentholatum :p&lt;br /&gt;Product as described.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years with great results.  Eliminates cracking and chapping of lips.  I usually buy this item in lots.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to find this in the stores.  I grew up using mentholatum so it was nice to be able to order it online.</li>
            <li> Execellent, well satisfied</li>
            <li> On time delivery.  Product and application excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for chappy lips.  It is a great travel size and I am glad I could find it for sale somewhere.</li>
            <li> WORKS AS DISCRIBED THANKS</li>
            <li> got the item and very pleased</li>
            <li> the tube works so much better than the tub when travelling!</li>
            <li> The cooling effect was not noticeable.  Within a mintue of application the weak menthol smell dissipated.  Not effective for itch relief, aches, or congestion.  Not at all what I remember of the Mentholatum I used from a tin pot as a child.  I am keeping it purely as a topical moisture barrier.  The base ointment is similar to petrolatum.</li>
