            <li>I&#x27;m excited and can&#x27;t wait to carry.</li>
            <li>but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I have been looking for and haven&#x27;t been able to find where I live.</li>
            <li>Its EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>it does have a smell when you first take it out of the package.</li>
            <li>But I will say that it&#x27;s a nice size for carrying around a Bible and other church material.</li>

            <li>They look large in the pictures but are deceiving.</li>

            <li> If u need a small bag to just hold a few thing to run to the store or such, then it&#x27;s worth having.</li>

            <li> things and does not feel heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a small everyday bag</li>
            <li> in fact, it looks like a small backpack styled purse.  </li>
            <li> When I received the bag it&#x27;s small in comparison to the pic!  </li>
            <li> They are very small.</li>

            <li> Poor quality product, the bag(s) are not leather but plastic.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is a great purse .I love it perfect size and nicely made .roomy and has great shape too it.The feet on the bottom are a nice touch. Thank you</li>
            <li> I thought it was a leather purse and found out it was not leather.</li>
            <li> So  much bigger than I thought it would be. The handles are different lengths.  I looked everywhere for a tote type purse,  square and firm that wasnt ridiculiously large. This was the closest I could find at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> the bag i received looked NOTHING like the bag online.  in fact, it looks like a small backpack styled purse.  i intend to use it with my occupational storage needs.  i do not forsee a 2nd purchase from this dealer.</li>
            <li> Sincerely not what I expected...lining is a type of plasti, but for the price is ok. Took too long to arrive after I placed ider</li>
            <li> The bag was way smaller that it displayed.  I would not order this product again.  I rather go to store and actually view  product before purchasing product</li>
            <li> too cheap looking.&lt;br /&gt;sent to third world country</li>
            <li> I like this bag and the color.  I also ordered the blue one.  Great price, great deal.  I&#x27;m excited and can&#x27;t wait to carry.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product, the bag(s) are not leather but plastic.&lt;br /&gt;This bag(s) were donated to goodwill.  The are not what was expected.</li>
            <li> Really great bag for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Its EXACTLY what I was looking for. Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> The bag is dirty inside with black water but is ok, the design is good and confortable but I have to cleaned it</li>
            <li> The lining is coming apart. Well -it was never touted to be quality merchandise. it holds your stuff and doesn&#x27;t look that bad.</li>
            <li> This handbag is not made of faux leather. It is just plastic, even the interior pockets. It smells bad. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I received the bag it&#x27;s small in comparison to the pic!  Really disappointed.  It&#x27;s the size of a small purse  and the lining is cheaply sown.  I&#x27;m not the one for delicacy when it comes to bags - due to all the books I carry around and that lining wouldn&#x27;t have a chance in hell dealing with me.  Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend buying it.  I just gave the bag to my local church; But I will say that it&#x27;s a nice size for carrying around a Bible and other church material.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews about bad smells and such, I ordered one anyways and I almost love it!&lt;br /&gt;True: it does have an odd plastic smell. 2 days with a couple dryer sheets fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;I love the size. My 7\\&quot; tablet fits perfectly&#x27; along with wallet, glasses case, phone, and the rest of my crap. A 10\\&quot; tablet will fit if you maneuver it right.&lt;br /&gt;The downfall..... The middle pocket is not sewn to the bottom. I find it annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Advice: for the price, it&#x27;s a great bag. Take 2-3 days, stuff the bag (it is shipped flat and needs time to look normal) and put 1 dryer sheet in each side.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to order at least 1 more.</li>
            <li> Helps me preserve my brand name bags from getting scratches. Use for everyday and any kind of weather. It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Love my bag. If you are looking for a small everyday bag but well made this is&lt;br /&gt;the one for you. I fit my wallet, cell phone, cosmetics bag, hairbrush and a few&lt;br /&gt;other things and does not feel heavy or bulky. Love the chocolate color, but it also&lt;br /&gt;comes in other colors. I use it everyday and so far is holding great.</li>
            <li> Love this brown tote it&#x27;s not a large tote but is exactly what I was looking for.  A good value for the  price.</li>
            <li> I love this purse. It&#x27;s what I have been looking for and haven&#x27;t been able to find where I live.</li>
            <li> it does have a smell when you first take it out of the package. but it quickly went away. its a nice purse for the price. it&#x27;s a little bigger than I thought it would be. but still a good buy. I will buy more colors.</li>
            <li> When I finally discover how to close the bag it was a nice surprise!!! It seems durable enough for the price</li>
            <li> I got my bag at a very reasonable time and was happy about that. My one reason for not giving it a five stars is that it was much smaller than I expected. I though I would never use it but give it away, well I used it one day and got very attached to it, so it&#x27;s a keeper. If u need a small bag to just hold a few thing to run to the store or such, then it&#x27;s worth having. I love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is too small.&lt;br /&gt;It smells bad.&lt;br /&gt;not as good as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;it is usefull in daily work.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say enough about this little gem of a purse, it is amazing to me what this can hold!  in time I will buy more it is stylish and practical...I love it....Eths</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I think it´s okay. I wish the straps were longer. Then it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Wish I had never ordered them. They look large in the pictures but are deceiving. They are very small. Colors are nice.</li>
