    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Mary Kay products! This is one of my favorite products ever! I will never use another eye remover product. I have tried many others, and nothing compares to Mary Kay&#x27;s.     I just love the ease of its use and the fact I don&#x27;t have to rinse my face after using it. Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li> with regular mascara, it&#x27;s very efficient. with water proof mascara, it requires a bit more persistence. but it works fine.</li>
            <li> 2 star because it, well, takes the makeup off...but that&#x27;s about it.  The product touts being \\&quot;oil free\\&quot; but it&#x27;s the opposite.  When you shake the bottle it looks like a mixture of oil and water.  Using it is nothing different.  My eyes feel soggy and oily after use.  If I don&#x27;t wash my face after using this eye makeup remover, I can barely read before going to sleep because my eyes are so goopy with the oil.  Gross.  Do not buy if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s wipe-and-go.</li>
            <li> Love that I can buy this product at Amazon and not have to necessarily go through a Mary Kay person for it. I love that it is oil free, works wonderful mostly gets my mascara off with no problems. A must have/buy for me!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SELLER. The product arrived VERY FAST AND CORRECTLY. ORIGINAL PRODUCT, NEW AND WITHOUT DEFECTS. SEND A REQUEST OF THE EXACT COLOR, ERROR-FREE.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day I wear makeup! It completely removes ALL traces off eye makeup from the day, including long lasting eyeliners or waterproof mascaras. I like the fact that it takes it all off without leaving my face feeling sticky. (ie. my experience with cold creams) It&#x27;s a good price for the amount you get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: A little goes a long way! You don&#x27;t have to keep pouring out more remover even if the tissue/towel feels dry. You can still use that same solution and take off the rest by wiping down your eyes and maybe using some water afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is a staple for me.  It is like THE ONLY Mary Kay item I purchase.  But it works like a charm so I always keep it around.  Never stings or burns my eyes.  Removes very well!</li>
            <li> This is better than any makeup remover you can buy in a store. Thank you amazon for making it available for us without going through a Mary Kay Rep!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted! This is the best oil free eye makeup remover ever. I&#x27;ve tried many oil free products and this one works the best for sure.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of make up removers, but always seem to have trouble removing the mascara or looking like I have raccoon eyes after I wake up the next morning because the make up residue moved. This stuff removes everything so quickly and easily! I will admit, it does leave a little bit of an oily feeling, but it&#x27;s barely anything. And I usually just wipe it off with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would 100% recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best make up remover I have ever used. It&#x27;s gentle, light and really does the job. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The perfect makeup remover I&#x27;ve used, it remove eye makeup easily and I didn&#x27;t feel any uncomfortable. I will definitely purchase it next time when I run out with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my eyes because it says it is oil free and it was slighty cheaper then the one that I prefer which is MAC, but Im dissapointed becuase although it does get the make up off, it leaves an oily residue in my eyes which I hate. It seems like it takes forever for the make up to come off and then I have to end up washing the oil out with soap and water. Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and plus bonus!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover ever</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love this remover</li>
            <li> This product gently removed eye makeup without difficulty.  It is easy and kind to sensitive skin.  I hope it is available forever!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!!</li>
            <li> The title of this review says it all. This is the easiest eye makeup remover I have ever used. It practically dissolves makeup on contact needing only a few swipes of the cotton ball and my eye area is clean.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go back to any other remover. This is the best...and I deserve the best!!  :)</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for many years and keep a stock pile of it.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on the skin and does a very good job removing make-up.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works well and doesn&#x27;t sting!  I have contacts and can&#x27;t use all products. I have found this to be the best on the market for me. I have been using this product for ten years and keep trying others but always come back to this because it works the best.&lt;br /&gt;I like the travel size which is handy for overnight trips.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner.  The price was fair.</li>
            <li> This eye make up remover is the absolute best. I have been using this product for 10 years and it comes off nice and easy without hurting my eye area</li>
            <li> Removes makeup extremely well!! Leaves no marks on your face nor any greasy residue. I would recommend for all makeup users</li>
            <li> Overall this product is nice.  It works a little better than other eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve tried.  I always use Dior mascara and this does help take the mascara off, where many of the eye makeup removers don&#x27;t.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and doesn&#x27;t leave any film over my contacts (I don&#x27;t take them out often since they are made to be worn for 30 days)...so that was definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really really really really well i LOVE IT. Even if there is no makeup on your eye it will still clean like dirt and stuff off from the day</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but the packaging was bad.  One of the tops was not on tight and some of the liquid leaked out.  Good thing I opened the package when I got it otherwise it all would have been lost.  A better job should be done on the packaging, maybe make sure the tops are tight or tape them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, works great to remove waterproof makeup as well. Definitely would recommend buying! Not oily at all!</li>
            <li> I was a Mary Kay consultant and I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. However, that is not what I received.  I believe the bottle was reused and something else put in it.  Nothing was sealed and the &amp;#34;eye remover&amp;#34; leaked in the box.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It removes your make up easily without rubbing or anything even waterproof mascara. I&#x27;ve been loving this makeup remover and will be ordering another 1. So pleased with this ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Love the make up remover. Feels oily when you delete make up and in couple seconds no sign of oil.Really does delete make up.Does not leave any signs of make up.&lt;br /&gt;great value for the price</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It is the only makeup remover I&#x27;ll ever use. The make up comes off so easy.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not greasy!</li>
            <li> Better then anything other product that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to be able to purchase Mary Kay online.  It is usually sold only through individual dealers.  The price was reasonable, but I would like to be advised of any Mary Kay sales that may occur.</li>
            <li> It truly doesn&#x27;t remove mascara that well. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Take it all off! Waterproof, regular, everything, including lipstick slides off easily, quickly and gently with this product.  You will love it and it is nonirritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 10+ years now. It is the only eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve found that works. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It the best remover for eye make up. However it states oil free but it seems it does have oil in it. Doesnt leave face feeling oily. I hope this product never goes away !</li>
