            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly always associated NYX with sub-par cosmetics</li>
            <li>Nice variety of finishes and colors.</li>
            <li>The mirror is also huge and very nice quality.</li>
            <li>It has a huge mirror that is very handy to set anywhere and do your makeup.</li>
            <li>This is a great palette some colors don&#x27;t look good on me, but overall the shadows are great.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best palettes I have purchased.  </li>

            <li>The blushes are beautiful, very pigmented as well.</li>
            <li>eyeshadow colors are beautiful and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty and good quality as well.</li>
            <li>Or maybe Amazon should have, and thus use appropriate packing materials.  </li>
            <li>As for the product - I love every colour and shade contained in this set.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love the make up palette</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and great for gals just getting into makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but it was ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the colors in this palette.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay palette for a neutral look but the colors are NOT as shown on the product page.  </li>
            <li>Packaging is ok</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel safe traveling with it anymore.</li>
            <li>Love this pallet.  </li>
            <li>I love every eyeshadow in this palette.</li>
            <li>The cheek products are okay, though both highlighters have a lot of shimmer to them, as do most of the blushes.</li>
            <li>love this palette for travel because of its portable size.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this palette</li>
            <li>I love the blushes that come with it as well.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and the quality.</li>
            <li>The color palette is nice -- there&#x27;s an iridescent goldish-purple color that is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>I found I just don&#x27;t use most of the colors.  </li>
            <li>The blushes/bronzers/highlighter are okay</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying this pallet and it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li>And top it off with nfx babydoll mascara.  </li>
            <li>Some shades are more pigmented than others.</li>
            <li>I am not a novice to makeup, I use it every day, but you can get better coverage with L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>im totally in love</li>
            <li>And I love that stashed underneath the top compartment</li>
            <li>I personally love the matte peachy shade of the blush, with the peachier highlight.</li>
            <li>Love this set.</li>
            <li>This time though, from another Amazon seller with better S&amp;H practices.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth way more than you pay for it!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that is doesn&#x27;t flake off easy or rub off easy throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Most importantly; when I apply them, they stay where I put them.  </li>
            <li>This was one of my first makeup palettes and was perfect for the young beginner.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and  all cool tones, great for everyday or night out.</li>
            <li>Applies okay, nothing too fantastic.</li>
            <li>It arrived early and great condition.</li>
            <li>Even at $25, it&#x27;s a good deal since there&#x27;s so much product in the palette</li>
            <li>Texture and blendability is good, I havent dipped into the blushes and powders much.</li>
            <li>The colors are pigmented and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>I laugh every time I open my makeup case at the label, but the makeup is great!</li>
            <li>Color pay off is strong.  </li>
            <li>Now, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m older and wiser&amp;#34; as they say, and I&#x27;m lucky enough to be able to purchase/ have been gifted some great more pricy palettes, which I&#x27;ve fallen in love with!</li>
            <li>The matte bronzer/contour color is good and while not as pigmented as other matte bronzers, works well on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>They lean more towards the cool side, which I like.</li>
            <li>For 25 dollars, this creates an entire face, and the quality is pretty excellent!!  </li>
            <li>This palette is mostly neutral, but the colors look fresh and I can easily combine and with eyeliner upgrade my face from day to night.</li>
            <li>This palette is amazing, pigmented, large, but...</li>
            <li>which is a huge plus</li>
            <li>And the contouring and highlighters are huge.</li>
            <li>Overall great palette for the price.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product for travel.</li>
            <li>This palette is perfect for travel or everyday use.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised how much I loved this.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the only reason I gave this product 3 stars is because the blushers are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The wear for a long time and are great quality.</li>
            <li>First, of all, I just love this.  </li>
            <li>Excited to get this</li>
            <li>They also sell this brand at Target for super cheap, so don&#x27;t forget to look there if you can&#x27;t find online.</li>
            <li>The case is solid, the colors are great and the amount of product is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>One of the colors is very bright hot pink.  </li>
            <li>Some colors are more pigmented than others but thats with any palette really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too worried about the packaging because it&#x27;s just such a good</li>
            <li>The price here is great too, cheaper than NYX website themselves and other make up carriers</li>
            <li>The illuminators, I do not use on my face because I do not like the super glowy look</li>
            <li>I recommend this set for someone looking for neutral but very pretty eye colours, as well as blush, bronzer and highlighters for your cheeks and rest of your face.  </li>
            <li>Price is great but not worth over 25 dollars.</li>
            <li>They are great shades, but the dark shades are not pigmented as I hoped.</li>
            <li>I love these colors, very natural</li>
            <li>This palette is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I have crepy eye lids and the colors look very smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>Greay seller and an amazing product especially for traveling and every day use.</li>
            <li>Most of the eyeshadows have good pigmentation, though a few are much lighter than the color they appear to be in the pots.</li>
            <li>Looks like it has the potential to be a really nice palette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the hype.</li>
            <li>The only place the pigments look great are when I apply them onto my fingertips directly from the palette.  </li>
            <li>Soft, basic palette that is great for travel.</li>
            <li>Other than that I Love it :)</li>
            <li>Everything is extremely pigmented and all of the colors are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>2 right after I got this,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re new to makeup and want many different nude tones - it does over shimmery and matte shadows -</li>
            <li>I purchased the NYX Sexy Blue Eyes Palette, but was looking for something more natural.  </li>
            <li>the colors are mild but I can complain to much</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the bronzer actually works with my skin tone (fair).</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, the colours are beautiful, but I think it&#x27;s worth forking over the extra cash for the other brand of the same name.</li>
            <li>Once applied, the products feel light and airy; not heavy or itchy like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Too glittery for my taste, but pretty nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Thanks NYX for making affordable makeup!</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many different looks from this palette.</li>
            <li>you definitely get more than what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>There are so many different looks that this palette can create and</li>
            <li>Love it, use it in rotation with my Naked Basics palette.</li>
            <li>but this is pretty bullet proof.</li>
            <li>I love the blushes, there is a good range of colors and a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li>so see that it blended very well and seemed more sheer, which was a relief.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly be rebuying this once I start to run out.</li>
            <li>This is an okay product, it&#x27;s not a high end cosmetic</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because its lightly pigmented so the colors don&#x27;t stand out as much as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>I also really like the blushes which apply very smoothy.</li>
            <li>I can do a smokey eye look with this palette and brighten up my eyes a bit when I&#x27;m tired lol.</li>
            <li>I think some people might really like this palette.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for me although I kept the set because there are a couple of matte colors in there that I like.</li>
            <li>and it comes off very orange on me.</li>
            <li>They are very chalky and have chunks of glitter which I can&#x27;t stand in a highlighter.</li>
            <li>The bottom drawer glides really well.</li>
            <li>I find that they apply smoothly and last all day.</li>
            <li>The darker pigmented shadows hold fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>is really practical for trips because you have everything there</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really like the blushes</li>
            <li>Very pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>Not very expensive.</li>
            <li>I was really, really scared to use the blush because my cheeks are naturally ruddy and the colors look very intense.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to hunt this down, and when I opened it</li>
            <li>fair, blonde hair, blue eyes and the neutral tones really bring out blue eyes.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s purple - more dark violet or grape which goes on more dark gray when applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li>(after all, make up isn&#x27;t so cute when your watery eyes have it running down your face).</li>
            <li>Luckily it slide back in!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still highly recommend this palette to a beginner because it also comes with a bronzer, blush and highlight to play around with.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The bronzer was a little orangey for me, but it worked okay blended</li>
            <li>Worth the money if you can&#x27;t afford the Naked palette.</li>
            <li>The other colors are more browns, taupes, black, and two very light colors - white and an ivory or buff shade.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure about the name because many of the colors really are not nude or natural.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no Urban Decay, but it does the job and all the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>so when the kit first arrived I applied some of the hot pink blush to my cheeks with my fingers and was surprised</li>
            <li>but I have much better palettes for not much more.</li>
            <li>but it is heavy for a traveling and does scratch easily.</li>
            <li>The light illuminator I will put over my finished eyes to make them sparkly, especially if I am using a matte shadow, which I am not really used to.  </li>
            <li>The colors are soft and buttery.  </li>
            <li>I use this palette for that natural look for everday make up.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my 16yr old daughter.  </li>
            <li>The colors are so natural I wear it almost every day.  </li>
            <li>They are sparkly and I really don&#x27;t like sparkles on my face, but that is personal preference and no fault of the palette.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes/skin</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I love that this palette is neutral enough to wear everyday.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not as crazy about the blush colors alone, but when I mix 2 I get my perfect blush color, that&#x27;s also long lasting.</li>
            <li>Very pretty on my skin, olive dark tan.</li>
            <li>I usually wear these shadows for a very natural, subtle day look but this pallet is also great for a smokey eye.</li>
            <li>jump again in a darker direction to colour my crease.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how a lot of the colours work together, they are set out in a way that makes it a no brainer if you are having trouble deciding what to wear that day, just start somewhere and jump in any direction down the pallet!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>My biggest problem with palettes is that while most colors are good, some are so bad only drag queens would wear them!  </li>
            <li>I would say this is a really good set if you lust after the urban decay naked palettes, which are fabulous, but twice as expensive for less product.</li>
            <li>When I was trying to slide back the top drawer to reveal the blushes and highlighters, I pulled too hard and broke off the drawer.  </li>
            <li>Yes there is a dark purple, bottom right, but it is as pictured as the image.  </li>
            <li>Usually I can&#x27;t use bronzer because it makes my face too glowy, but just a bit on certain points really brings out my features.  </li>
            <li>everyday simple three colours I start at one of the light colours for brow area and inner lid to highlight.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Item arrived broken, otherwise I love the pallette.</li>
            <li>I jump almost in any direction from the first colour to a slightly darker colour for the lid.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I like that you can create very subtle looks or my favorite, a smoky eye, in a variety of ways.  </li>
            <li>So dissatisfied, because the shipping was fast and the package looked pristine, but inside the actual pallet was nothing but a powdery mess.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly always associated NYX with sub-par cosmetics</li>

            <li> eyeshadow colors are beautiful and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty and good quality as well.</li>
            <li> Or maybe Amazon should have, and thus use appropriate packing materials.  </li>
            <li> As for the product - I love every colour and shade contained in this set.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love the make up palette</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and great for gals just getting into makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> but it was ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the colors in this palette.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay palette for a neutral look but the colors are NOT as shown on the product page.  </li>
            <li> Packaging is ok</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel safe traveling with it anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this pallet.  </li>
            <li> I love every eyeshadow in this palette.</li>
            <li> The cheek products are okay, though both highlighters have a lot of shimmer to them, as do most of the blushes.</li>
            <li> love this palette for travel because of its portable size.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette</li>
            <li> I love the blushes that come with it as well.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the quality.</li>
            <li> The color palette is nice -- there&#x27;s an iridescent goldish-purple color that is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li> I found I just don&#x27;t use most of the colors.  </li>
            <li> The blushes/bronzers/highlighter are okay</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this pallet and it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li> And top it off with nfx babydoll mascara.  </li>
            <li> Some shades are more pigmented than others.</li>
            <li> I am not a novice to makeup, I use it every day, but you can get better coverage with L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> im totally in love</li>
            <li> And I love that stashed underneath the top compartment</li>
            <li> I personally love the matte peachy shade of the blush, with the peachier highlight.</li>
            <li> Love this set.</li>
            <li> This time though, from another Amazon seller with better S&amp;H practices.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth way more than you pay for it!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that is doesn&#x27;t flake off easy or rub off easy throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Most importantly; when I apply them, they stay where I put them.  </li>
            <li> This was one of my first makeup palettes and was perfect for the young beginner.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and  all cool tones, great for everyday or night out.</li>
            <li> Applies okay, nothing too fantastic.</li>
            <li> It arrived early and great condition.</li>
            <li> Even at $25, it&#x27;s a good deal since there&#x27;s so much product in the palette</li>
            <li> Texture and blendability is good, I havent dipped into the blushes and powders much.</li>
            <li> The colors are pigmented and easy to blend.</li>
            <li> I laugh every time I open my makeup case at the label, but the makeup is great!</li>
            <li> Color pay off is strong.  </li>
            <li> Now, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m older and wiser&amp;#34; as they say, and I&#x27;m lucky enough to be able to purchase/ have been gifted some great more pricy palettes, which I&#x27;ve fallen in love with!</li>
            <li> The matte bronzer/contour color is good and while not as pigmented as other matte bronzers, works well on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> They lean more towards the cool side, which I like.</li>
            <li> For 25 dollars, this creates an entire face, and the quality is pretty excellent!!  </li>
            <li> This palette is mostly neutral, but the colors look fresh and I can easily combine and with eyeliner upgrade my face from day to night.</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing, pigmented, large, but...</li>
            <li> which is a huge plus</li>
            <li> And the contouring and highlighters are huge.</li>
            <li> Overall great palette for the price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product for travel.</li>
            <li> This palette is perfect for travel or everyday use.</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised how much I loved this.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, the only reason I gave this product 3 stars is because the blushers are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The wear for a long time and are great quality.</li>
            <li> First, of all, I just love this.  </li>
            <li> Excited to get this</li>
            <li> They also sell this brand at Target for super cheap, so don&#x27;t forget to look there if you can&#x27;t find online.</li>
            <li> The case is solid, the colors are great and the amount of product is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> One of the colors is very bright hot pink.  </li>
            <li> Some colors are more pigmented than others but thats with any palette really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too worried about the packaging because it&#x27;s just such a good</li>
            <li> The price here is great too, cheaper than NYX website themselves and other make up carriers</li>
            <li> The illuminators, I do not use on my face because I do not like the super glowy look</li>
            <li> I recommend this set for someone looking for neutral but very pretty eye colours, as well as blush, bronzer and highlighters for your cheeks and rest of your face.  </li>
            <li> Price is great but not worth over 25 dollars.</li>
            <li> They are great shades, but the dark shades are not pigmented as I hoped.</li>
            <li> I love these colors, very natural</li>
            <li> This palette is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I have crepy eye lids and the colors look very smooth and natural.</li>
            <li> Greay seller and an amazing product especially for traveling and every day use.</li>
            <li> Most of the eyeshadows have good pigmentation, though a few are much lighter than the color they appear to be in the pots.</li>
            <li> Looks like it has the potential to be a really nice palette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the hype.</li>
            <li> The only place the pigments look great are when I apply them onto my fingertips directly from the palette.  </li>
            <li> Soft, basic palette that is great for travel.</li>
            <li> Other than that I Love it :)</li>
            <li> Everything is extremely pigmented and all of the colors are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> 2 right after I got this,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re new to makeup and want many different nude tones - it does over shimmery and matte shadows -</li>
            <li> I purchased the NYX Sexy Blue Eyes Palette, but was looking for something more natural.  </li>
            <li> the colors are mild but I can complain to much</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the bronzer actually works with my skin tone (fair).</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, the colours are beautiful, but I think it&#x27;s worth forking over the extra cash for the other brand of the same name.</li>
            <li> Once applied, the products feel light and airy; not heavy or itchy like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Too glittery for my taste, but pretty nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Thanks NYX for making affordable makeup!</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many different looks from this palette.</li>
            <li> you definitely get more than what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> There are so many different looks that this palette can create and</li>
            <li> Love it, use it in rotation with my Naked Basics palette.</li>
            <li> but this is pretty bullet proof.</li>
            <li> I love the blushes, there is a good range of colors and a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li> so see that it blended very well and seemed more sheer, which was a relief.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly be rebuying this once I start to run out.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product, it&#x27;s not a high end cosmetic</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because its lightly pigmented so the colors don&#x27;t stand out as much as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> I also really like the blushes which apply very smoothy.</li>
            <li> I can do a smokey eye look with this palette and brighten up my eyes a bit when I&#x27;m tired lol.</li>
            <li> I think some people might really like this palette.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for me although I kept the set because there are a couple of matte colors in there that I like.</li>
            <li> and it comes off very orange on me.</li>
            <li> They are very chalky and have chunks of glitter which I can&#x27;t stand in a highlighter.</li>
            <li> The bottom drawer glides really well.</li>
            <li> I find that they apply smoothly and last all day.</li>
            <li> The darker pigmented shadows hold fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> is really practical for trips because you have everything there</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really like the blushes</li>
            <li> Very pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> Not very expensive.</li>
            <li> I was really, really scared to use the blush because my cheeks are naturally ruddy and the colors look very intense.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to hunt this down, and when I opened it</li>
            <li> fair, blonde hair, blue eyes and the neutral tones really bring out blue eyes.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s purple - more dark violet or grape which goes on more dark gray when applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li> (after all, make up isn&#x27;t so cute when your watery eyes have it running down your face).</li>
            <li> Luckily it slide back in!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still highly recommend this palette to a beginner because it also comes with a bronzer, blush and highlight to play around with.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The bronzer was a little orangey for me, but it worked okay blended</li>
            <li> Worth the money if you can&#x27;t afford the Naked palette.</li>
            <li> The other colors are more browns, taupes, black, and two very light colors - white and an ivory or buff shade.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about the name because many of the colors really are not nude or natural.  </li>
            <li> I cannot live without this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no Urban Decay, but it does the job and all the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> so when the kit first arrived I applied some of the hot pink blush to my cheeks with my fingers and was surprised</li>
            <li> but I have much better palettes for not much more.</li>
            <li> but it is heavy for a traveling and does scratch easily.</li>
            <li> The light illuminator I will put over my finished eyes to make them sparkly, especially if I am using a matte shadow, which I am not really used to.  </li>
            <li> The colors are soft and buttery.  </li>
            <li> I use this palette for that natural look for everday make up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 16yr old daughter.  </li>
            <li> The colors are so natural I wear it almost every day.  </li>
            <li> They are sparkly and I really don&#x27;t like sparkles on my face, but that is personal preference and no fault of the palette.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes/skin</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I love that this palette is neutral enough to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not as crazy about the blush colors alone, but when I mix 2 I get my perfect blush color, that&#x27;s also long lasting.</li>
            <li> Very pretty on my skin, olive dark tan.</li>
            <li> I usually wear these shadows for a very natural, subtle day look but this pallet is also great for a smokey eye.</li>
            <li> jump again in a darker direction to colour my crease.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how a lot of the colours work together, they are set out in a way that makes it a no brainer if you are having trouble deciding what to wear that day, just start somewhere and jump in any direction down the pallet!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with palettes is that while most colors are good, some are so bad only drag queens would wear them!  </li>
            <li> I would say this is a really good set if you lust after the urban decay naked palettes, which are fabulous, but twice as expensive for less product.</li>
            <li> When I was trying to slide back the top drawer to reveal the blushes and highlighters, I pulled too hard and broke off the drawer.  </li>
            <li> Yes there is a dark purple, bottom right, but it is as pictured as the image.  </li>
            <li> Usually I can&#x27;t use bronzer because it makes my face too glowy, but just a bit on certain points really brings out my features.  </li>
            <li> everyday simple three colours I start at one of the light colours for brow area and inner lid to highlight.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Item arrived broken, otherwise I love the pallette.</li>
            <li> I jump almost in any direction from the first colour to a slightly darker colour for the lid.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I like that you can create very subtle looks or my favorite, a smoky eye, in a variety of ways.  </li>
            <li> So dissatisfied, because the shipping was fast and the package looked pristine, but inside the actual pallet was nothing but a powdery mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the highligh colors, while they do work well as a highlight (and eyeshadow), there&#x27;s too much glitter in them for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not highly pigmented but if you add an eyeshadow primer prior to applying, it,will last all day.</li>
            <li> The price seemed good and I already have some mascara and eyeshadow base from the same brand.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t hit the pans as long as I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> This was so much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> The other colors are browns, gray, and even a soft black, along with light/highlighting colors and a mix of matte and shimmer.  </li>
            <li> You can get so much use out of this palette, seriously.</li>
            <li> if you are pale like me, the matte eyeshadow that is skin color or nude makes a great base to sweep over your entire lid to prep it before doing the other eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> While the lighter colors aren&#x27;t highly pigmented (the pink is the least pigmented of the colors)</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was with the black case itself.  </li>
            <li> She totally loves it and has used it everyday since it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I currently use it everyday.</li>
            <li> A giant mess!</li>
            <li> Not really able to rate the product itself (quality nor colors of the makeup) because it arrived utterly shattered and crumbled into a powdery</li>
            <li> colors are not as pigmented as my other other nyx eye shadows.</li>
            <li> So if your going to buy this be very careful.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this palette, like I may be legitimately obsessed.. addicted, even.</li>
            <li> I also suggest using it with an eyeshadow base or primer for better color payoff throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My palette came damaged, with the blush/bronzer pan broken completely off of the rest of the palette.</li>
            <li> Other than that, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> After purchasing, I realized that the palette just looks a little muddy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Biggest problem with this palette is that after a few months the palette ( at least mine ) became very loose</li>
            <li> I use this pallet everyday, no joke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday since I&#x27;ve gotten it.</li>
            <li> This has all the essentials, and they are all everyday colors.  </li>
            <li> I will try to look past the fact that the product does not provide any info on dates.  </li>
            <li> but just aren&#x27;t colors I usually use.  </li>
            <li> and I usually have shiny skin problems anyways.  </li>
            <li> but, it was a mess as one of the blushes was broken and had gone everywhere.</li>
            <li> it was late coming</li>
            <li> Hopefully my skin will not be having any negative reactions.</li>
            <li> One reviewer complained about the colors, I have to disagree with her.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a crazy Urban Decay fan girl.</li>
            <li> The highlighter was shattered and covered everything, I mean everything.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately since I&#x27;m  pale, the bronzer looks orange on me.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have the nfx eyeshadow base, it will make this last forever.  </li>
            <li> It is a heavy palette, feeling very expensive.</li>
            <li> You can mix it up for day, dramatic for night.</li>
            <li> I even use expensive eyeshadow primer and it makes no difference.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the item arrived yesterday afternoon, DAMAGED.</li>
            <li> Sadly it arrived damaged, but that was the seller fault, NOT Amazon.</li>
            <li> and she is crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> I just hate the desighn of the pull out blush and bronzer ...</li>
            <li> it was a mess!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bronzer is terrible.</li>

            <li> Best compact I have ever bought, worth the money, awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! The colors are pigmented and easy to blend. This is the perfect neutral palette that looks good on anyone. The face products it comes with are amazing too!</li>
            <li> omg..do not buy this,i got mine in today and every bit of it was broke!!!!! when i opened it makeup was everywhere it was a mess!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this palette because I wanted a good set of neutral colors for when I travel. Most of the eyeshadows have good pigmentation, though a few are much lighter than the color they appear to be in the pots. I love the blushes, there is a good range of colors and a little can go a long way. The matte bronzer/contour color is good and while not as pigmented as other matte bronzers, works well on my fair skin. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the highligh colors, while they do work well as a highlight (and eyeshadow), there&#x27;s too much glitter in them for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this palette and often use it even if I&#x27;m not traveling. It&#x27;s a good dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li> My daughter had received this as a gift. I had to stop stealing hers and just order my own!</li>
            <li> Not really able to rate the product itself (quality nor colors of the makeup) because it arrived utterly shattered and crumbled into a powdery mess.&lt;br /&gt;Guess I should have foreseen that possibility - shipping pressed powders in the mail.  Or maybe Amazon should have, and thus use appropriate packing materials.  Had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to find it locally so I can try again.  Looks like it has the potential to be a really nice palette.</li>
            <li> I love these colors, very natural</li>
            <li> This is a great pallete. I have crepy eye lids and the colors look very smooth and natural. I usually wear these shadows for a very natural, subtle day look but this pallet is also great for a smokey eye. I also really like the blushes which apply very smoothy. I have purchased several of these and also have given them as gifts.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a gift so can&#x27;t comment on the price listed here.  As for the product - I love every colour and shade contained in this set. Every colour and trio of colours is neutral and goes with anything and everything. Once applied, the products feel light and airy; not heavy or itchy like others I have tried. Most importantly; when I apply them, they stay where I put them.  I recommend this set for someone looking for neutral but very pretty eye colours, as well as blush, bronzer and highlighters for your cheeks and rest of your face.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love the make up palette the colors are great for every completion... I just hate the desighn of the pull out blush and bronzer ... It fellout and broke all over the floor😢..... So if your going to buy this be very careful.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! The colors are soft and buttery.  Color pay off is strong.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the two highlighters and the bronzer.  Too glittery for my taste, but pretty nonetheless. Reasonably priced and great for gals just getting into makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay it was late coming but it was ok the colors are mild but I can complain to much</li>
            <li> I like the neutral colors it came with I don&#x27;t wear a lot of eye shadow so this was a perfect fit for me. I can do a smokey eye look with this palette and brighten up my eyes a bit when I&#x27;m tired lol. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because its lightly pigmented so the colors don&#x27;t stand out as much as I would have hoped. Other than that I Love it :)</li>
            <li> colors are not as pigmented as my other other nyx eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Great product and, it came alot earlier than it was supposed to! Greay seller and an amazing product especially for traveling and every day use.</li>
            <li> I use this pallet everyday, no joke. The colours are so pigmented and feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worked out a bit of a formula to how I use this pallet.&lt;br /&gt;For everyday simple three colours I start at one of the light colours for brow area and inner lid to highlight.&lt;br /&gt;Then I jump almost in any direction from the first colour to a slightly darker colour for the lid.&lt;br /&gt;Then jump again in a darker direction to colour my crease.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how a lot of the colours work together, they are set out in a way that makes it a no brainer if you are having trouble deciding what to wear that day, just start somewhere and jump in any direction down the pallet!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a while since I bought this palette and it now sits in the back of my drawer collecting dust. This was one of my first makeup palettes and was perfect for the young beginner. Now, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m older and wiser&amp;#34; as they say, and I&#x27;m lucky enough to be able to purchase/ have been gifted some great more pricy palettes, which I&#x27;ve fallen in love with! For the price and my level of skill this was once a loved product. I&#x27;d still highly recommend this palette to a beginner because it also comes with a bronzer, blush and highlight to play around with. Just don&#x27;t expect the pigmentation of a Lorac Pro etc. palette. Happy makeup-ing!</li>
            <li> I use this palette for that natural look for everday make up. So far, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 16yr old daughter.  She totally loves it and has used it everyday since it arrived.  Really nice colors and good pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the colors in this palette. Perfect for a nude smokey eye! You can mix it up for day, dramatic for night. This set does it all!</li>
            <li> This is the second NYX Butt Naked Make-Up Kit that I have purchased. I love this product. It glides on, stays on and the colors are beautiful. Perfect for summer days and summer nights!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece and she is crazy about it.  Since I did not use it myself, I can only go by her reaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay palette for a neutral look but the colors are NOT as shown on the product page.  On the product page, these shadows look as though they have several purple shades.  There&#x27;s only one shade that&#x27;s purple - more dark violet or grape which goes on more dark gray when applied to the skin.  My skin anyway.  The other colors are more browns, taupes, black, and two very light colors - white and an ivory or buff shade.  Some are matte, others are shimmery.  I think some people might really like this palette.  Doesn&#x27;t really work for me although I kept the set because there are a couple of matte colors in there that I like.</li>
            <li> Love this palette !!  Price is great but not worth over 25 dollars. Colors are beautiful, pigmented good mix of mattes and shimmers.Palette comes with 4 blushes 2 matte 2 shimmers. A matte bronzer which is nice and 2 highlights which are very nice and happen to be my favorite. I have tan skin and all the eyeshadows  look nice on me as well as all the face products.  Packaging is ok but it is heavy for a traveling and does scratch easily. The mirror is great ! Biggest problem with this palette is that after a few months the palette ( at least mine ) became very loose and I didn&#x27;t feel safe traveling with it anymore.</li>
            <li> I did not get an answer from the seller when I asked them to give me info on either the  expiration date or manufacture date of this product. I still took a gamble and purchased it anyway. The colors are beautiful and  all cool tones, great for everyday or night out. I will try to look past the fact that the product does not provide any info on dates.  Hopefully my skin will not be having any negative reactions.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, great pigmentation, love the blush colors too. I love that this palette is neutral enough to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no Urban Decay, but it does the job and all the colors are pretty. Worth the money if you can&#x27;t afford the Naked palette.</li>
            <li> Love this pallet.  The colors are perfect.  If you are going to travel this is all you need to take. It has your eye shadow,  blush and bronzer.</li>
            <li> I laugh every time I open my makeup case at the label, but the makeup is great! Thanks NYX for making affordable makeup! They also sell this brand at Target for super cheap, so don&#x27;t forget to look there if you can&#x27;t find online.</li>
            <li> I love every eyeshadow in this palette. They lean more towards the cool side, which I like. Some colors are more pigmented than others but thats with any palette really. The blushes are beautiful, very pigmented as well. The brozer i can&#x27;t use because I&#x27;m fair skinned and it comes off very orange on me. The two highlighters i don&#x27;t like at all. They are very chalky and have chunks of glitter which I can&#x27;t stand in a highlighter. Overall great palette for the price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product for travel. The eyeshadows are all nicely pigmented and come in a nice range of neutral shades with varying finishes. The cheek products are okay, though both highlighters have a lot of shimmer to them, as do most of the blushes. The bronzer was a little orangey for me, but it worked okay blended out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this palette for travel because of its portable size. Plus, it includes everything you need to add color to your face and eyes. All you need in addition is foundation, concealer, mascara and lipstick. I also suggest using it with an eyeshadow base or primer for better color payoff throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I have used this every day since I received it. I have gotten so many different looks from this palette.</li>
            <li> This palette is honestly amazing. Everything is extremely pigmented and all of the colors are gorgeous. I LOVE this palette</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best palettes I have purchased.  I purchased the NYX Sexy Blue Eyes Palette, but was looking for something more natural.  This palette is exactly what I was looking for! The colors are so natural I wear it almost every day.  While the lighter colors aren&#x27;t highly pigmented (the pink is the least pigmented of the colors) you definitely get more than what you pay for.  The only problem I had was with the black case itself.  When I was trying to slide back the top drawer to reveal the blushes and highlighters, I pulled too hard and broke off the drawer.  Luckily it slide back in!</li>
            <li> This is a great palette some colors don&#x27;t look good on me, but overall the shadows are great. I love the blushes that come with it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has everything I need for traveling in one compact! The colors are very pretty and good quality as well. I am so happy that I decided to buy it! It also arrived very quickly and in great condition. I would def recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing, pigmented, large, but... The highlighter was shattered and covered everything, I mean everything. So dissatisfied, because the shipping was fast and the package looked pristine, but inside the actual pallet was nothing but a powdery mess.</li>
            <li> The shadows have great pigment, plus they layer and mix beautifully.  I&#x27;ve honestly always associated NYX with sub-par cosmetics so I was pleasantly surprised how much I loved this.  One reviewer complained about the colors, I have to disagree with her.  Yes there is a dark purple, bottom right, but it is as pictured as the image.  The other colors are browns, gray, and even a soft black, along with light/highlighting colors and a mix of matte and shimmer.  While I&#x27;m not as crazy about the blush colors alone, but when I mix 2 I get my perfect blush color, that&#x27;s also long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the quality of this product. Especially since I only paid $18 for it. It is a heavy palette, feeling very expensive. The bottom drawer glides really well. I was very impressed with the quality of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow colors are beautiful and very pigmented. I am most impressed with the blushes. All four are beautiful and buff out beautifully on the skin. I was surprised that the bronzer actually works with my skin tone (fair). My only &#x27;eh&#x27; about the palette is the highlights. They are sparkly and I really don&#x27;t like sparkles on my face, but that is personal preference and no fault of the palette.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Ulta over 6 months ago and I use it daily. It even travels with me when I go out of town because it&#x27;s a staple in my make up routine. I will certainly be rebuying this once I start to run out. There are so many different looks that this palette can create and the colors are the perfect for my skin tone. I&#x27;m fair, blonde hair, blue eyes and the neutral tones really bring out blue eyes. I find that they apply smoothly and last all day. I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes/skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate that at all which is a huge plus (after all, make up isn&#x27;t so cute when your watery eyes have it running down your face). Even at $25, it&#x27;s a good deal since there&#x27;s so much product in the palette and it lasts a really long time. I still haven&#x27;t hit the pans as long as I&#x27;ve been using it. Doesn&#x27;t disappoint!!</li>
            <li> The color palette is nice -- there&#x27;s an iridescent goldish-purple color that is FABULOUS.  The colors go on nicely, with okay staying power.  I found I just don&#x27;t use most of the colors.  After purchasing, I realized that the palette just looks a little muddy on my skin.  The blushes/bronzers/highlighter are okay but just aren&#x27;t colors I usually use.  This is an excellent beginners palette, or a great addition to people who wear a lot of gray/black tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My palette came damaged, with the blush/bronzer pan broken completely off of the rest of the palette.</li>
            <li> They are great shades, but the dark shades are not pigmented as I hoped. They are still good shadows to use though.</li>
            <li> This was so much bigger than I expected. Wow. The eyeshadows are bigger than quarters. And the contouring and highlighters are huge. The mirror is also huge and very nice quality.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this pallet and it&#x27;s just perfect. The wear for a long time and are great quality. The price here is great too, cheaper than NYX website themselves and other make up carriers</li>
            <li> This is an okay product, it&#x27;s not a high end cosmetic but it&#x27;s not the lowest of the low either. The best feature about this product is it&#x27;s staying power. The darker pigmented shadows hold fast. Applies okay, nothing too fantastic. It&#x27;s a sturdy compact, impressive mirror and selection of shades, blushes, and a bronzer. It&#x27;s priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> This palette is perfect for travel or everyday use. It has a huge mirror that is very handy to set anywhere and do your makeup. The colors are beautiful and they blend so well. I would recommend this to anyone! Simply amazing!</li>
            <li> After looking at several nude pallets by various brands, I decided on this one.  The price seemed good and I already have some mascara and eyeshadow base from the same brand.  First, of all, I just love this.  I am not sure about the name because many of the colors really are not nude or natural.  I like that you can create very subtle looks or my favorite, a smoky eye, in a variety of ways.  I was really, really scared to use the blush because my cheeks are naturally ruddy and the colors look very intense.  One of the colors is very bright hot pink.  I was worried about this so when the kit first arrived I applied some of the hot pink blush to my cheeks with my fingers and was surprised so see that it blended very well and seemed more sheer, which was a relief.  All of the colors in the kit seem to be more sheer, vulnerable, and buildable.  I like that a lot.  Usually I can&#x27;t use bronzer because it makes my face too glowy, but just a bit on certain points really brings out my features.  The illuminators, I do not use on my face because I do not like the super glowy look and I usually have shiny skin problems anyways.  I found another great way to use them, I use them as eyeshadows.  The light illuminator I will put over my finished eyes to make them sparkly, especially if I am using a matte shadow, which I am not really used to.  I also found a helpful hint if you are pale like me, the matte eyeshadow that is skin color or nude makes a great base to sweep over your entire lid to prep it before doing the other eyeshadow.  Love, love, love.  I cannot live without this.  Also, if you have the nfx eyeshadow base, it will make this last forever.  I never crease.  And top it off with nfx babydoll mascara.  It&#x27;s worth the hype.</li>
            <li> Good quality eye shadows for the price you are paying. Some shades are more pigmented than others. Great blushes. Bronzer is terrible.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the only reason I gave this product 3 stars is because the blushers are pretty good.  Other than that, don&#x27;t waste your money.  I am not a novice to makeup, I use it every day, but you can get better coverage with L&#x27;Oreal.  I even use expensive eyeshadow primer and it makes no difference.  I have tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but it just disappoints.  It doesn&#x27;t blend at all. If it does go on, it smears.  The coverage is not even.  The only place the pigments look great are when I apply them onto my fingertips directly from the palette.  I wanted to love this, the colours are beautiful, but I think it&#x27;s worth forking over the extra cash for the other brand of the same name.</li>
            <li> They send it to me in 4 days  since that day i dont use anything else is really practical for trips because you have everything there and  you dont have to carry a big bag of makeup really really good im totally in love</li>
            <li> Everything you need for a great neutral look.  The bronzer is matte.  Two of the blushers are matte.  The eyeshadows have a great mix of finishes.</li>
            <li> Soft, basic palette that is great for travel. I love NYX shadows, they are great quality for the money and generally have excellent color payoff on my very fair skin.  This palette is mostly neutral, but the colors look fresh and I can easily combine and with eyeliner upgrade my face from day to night. Packing made easier for trips. Good deal.</li>
            <li> Great colors. I didn&#x27;t think i would like this palette, but after trying the colors they are absolutely perfect!!! Thanks</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teen - who is a fan of the urban decay palettes - and she loves it!  Great set at a great price!</li>
            <li> All it was cracked up to be.  Really like the blushes too!&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadows don&#x27;t crease until the end of the day</li>
            <li> Excited to get this but, it was a mess as one of the blushes was broken and had gone everywhere. A giant mess!</li>
            <li> I honestly love this palette, like I may be legitimately obsessed.. addicted, even. I&#x27;ve used it everyday since I&#x27;ve gotten it. My boyfriend bought me Naked 2 right after I got this, and I still haven&#x27;t even touched that palette, yet...and I&#x27;m a crazy Urban Decay fan girl. But this palette is so good! All the colors have great pigmentation. And I love that stashed underneath the top compartment is 4 blushes, a bronzer, and highlighters. Unfortunately since I&#x27;m  pale, the bronzer looks orange on me. However, the blushes and highlighters are great! I personally love the matte peachy shade of the blush, with the peachier highlight. You can get so much use out of this palette, seriously. I highly, highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s worth way more than you pay for it!</li>
            <li> Makes great shadow eyes. Love the fact that is doesn&#x27;t flake off easy or rub off easy throughout the day. Very pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> This pallet is awesome! What a great buy for the money. The case is solid, the colors are great and the amount of product is definitely worth buying. I will reorder this again!</li>
            <li> Buy it. Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, use it in rotation with my Naked Basics palette. I am not a big eye make up person but this is pretty bullet proof. Texture and blendability is good, I havent dipped into the blushes and powders much.</li>
            <li> love love love this!!!! this is a great set and it&#x27;s way cheaper than the urban decay naked pallet.  very happy w/this.</li>
            <li> Ordered this palette for myself. It arrived early and great condition. It&#x27;s not highly pigmented but if you add an eyeshadow primer prior to applying, it,will last all day. I currently use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I cannot use this palette without an eye primer. It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re new to makeup and want many different nude tones - it does over shimmery and matte shadows - but I have much better palettes for not much more.</li>
            <li> I think I got a knock off, but it&#x27;s still works good</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to go get this when I saw a youtuber using it.  All the colors here are useable, which is excellent.  My biggest problem with palettes is that while most colors are good, some are so bad only drag queens would wear them!  This has all the essentials, and they are all everyday colors.  Also, the drawer underneath has a bronzer, two highlighters, and some blushers.  For 25 dollars, this creates an entire face, and the quality is pretty excellent!!  The color pay off is great and I can&#x27;t believe everything you get for the price.  I was super excited to hunt this down, and when I opened it I was extremely happy I bought it.  The bottom \\&quot;drawer\\&quot; did disconnect on me, but I just snapped it back.  I&#x27;m not too worried about the packaging because it&#x27;s just such a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m even thinking about buying a second one for my mom, and a third for my sister.  I would say this is a really good set if you lust after the urban decay naked palettes, which are fabulous, but twice as expensive for less product.</li>
            <li> Loved my palette! It came on time and the price was perfect!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Colors are beautiful. Not very expensive. Shipped quickly, and packaged very well. Love this set. Very pretty on my skin, olive dark tan. I will definitely buy this again soon.</li>
            <li> Item arrived broken, otherwise I love the pallette.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the item arrived yesterday afternoon, DAMAGED. That said, the NYX palette was beautiful. Quality of product &amp; casing is like a item from a high-end cosmetic company. Sadly it arrived damaged, but that was the seller fault, NOT Amazon. Still was very impressed with the product. I will be ordering it again. This time though, from another Amazon seller with better S&amp;H practices.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of finishes and colors. Especially like the bottom drawer!</li>
