    <ol>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>I had surgery, and this product has been wonderful!</li>
            <li>Best results I&#x27;ve seen from a scar reducing product.</li>
            <li>It is a good product recommended by his surgeon and we have reordered it as the process continues.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I bought at the doctors office and it works great!</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL PRODUCT REALLY HELPS BURN SCARS</li>
            <li>It is no longer effective.</li>
            <li>However, the best stuff to use is really the ScarAway surgical length strips.  </li>
            <li>sure it sounds like a good product from the ingrediants.....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this can be effective at treating scars if all of it flakes off in an hour</li>
            <li>not so sure how effective it is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking into silicone sheets/strips to see if those work better.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure it will expire before I ever use even an eighth of the bottle.</li>
            <li>the bottle says to not use more than twice a day.....</li>
            <li>When trying to pull it off the scar, it hurt my son and called even more attention to his scars.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love love love and would highly recommend..</li>
            <li>but after a while it just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>ScarGuard is a pretty good product so far!</li>
            <li>Last year i bought this product and it works so good.</li>
            <li>product smells a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>but after that, the discoloration changes quickly.</li>
            <li>Peels off some areas pretty quickly, others it works fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>this is the best silicone i have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;i suffered from severe queloide, so i got so many scars on me, from my big and small accidents, surgeries, cesaria.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Scarguard MD at my local Target for around $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was even more self conscience about wearing short sleeves now because of the scar.  </li>
            <li>and also I can attest to that because when i first put it on, it stinged like it was killing off any infection prone bacteria.  </li>
            <li>I wore the silicone patches the hospital gave me at first</li>
            <li>okay if you never have anything touching the scar, but do not buy this if your clothes cover it... been a complete waste.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff I would highly recommend especially after trying every scar cream out there ..</li>
            <li>Yes, the smell is strong initially, however it is because of the antiseptic properties that make it smell that way</li>
            <li>HUGE improvement to the scar months later</li>
            <li>Does not apply well - - very flakey</li>
            <li>Stays on very well, through a shower even.</li>
            <li>so you really can&#x27;t apply it and then go anywhere where you care if you smell like chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I doubt it is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>There is no brush in bottle and it smells much stronger.  </li>
            <li>ScarGuard MD has been very helpful in protecting scars my husband has from surgery.</li>
            <li>This product has been very helpful.</li>
            <li>My entire house was filled with the fumes from this product.  </li>
            <li>This helped my friend with a huge raised scar on her knee, it&#x27;s a tad more flat now, but I&#x27;m trying to use it to fade some little acne-type scars on my stomach.</li>
            <li>Also, what really has helped the most for me has been firmly massaging the scar.</li>
            <li>However, it is very important that you use the product EVERYDAY.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>This product was so good at first, but now it is fake.</li>
            <li>after i start using this product, the scar got better; at least it can stop the itchiness and redness; also it gives certain relief on my scar</li>
            <li>so I only use the product when I am at home or wearing a shirt with a higher neckline.  </li>
            <li>I was so self conscious about my scar before, but not anymore!</li>
            <li>so I reasoned within myself &amp;#34;this must be a hot item since this is the last one on the shelf&amp;#34; so I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I wish that the brush was bigger or there was a better way to apply on such a big scar.  </li>
            <li>I wish he had just bought the small, as it is not as good as expected</li>
            <li>My husband bought the extra large container.</li>
            <li>It leaves a shiny film on the scar and a white peeling film around the scar and is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have a ways to go but the results that I notice in this short amount of time is promising.  </li>
            <li>As far as the lightening effect of my scar, Im</li>
            <li>and the puckering is gone and the redness is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using product for a  few days, but in that short space of time I feel confident that scarguard will do what is supposed to do</li>
            <li>I am just a few weeks in in using the product so I cant give a full review</li>
            <li>and my scar is barely there!</li>
            <li>needless to say, I am glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this bottle hoping it would help and at first, portions started to peel while other parts took scrubbing to remove.  </li>
            <li>i did a plastic surgery to remove the old queloide scar and did beta teraphy(a superficial chemo to treat queloide and skins) but the queloide still came back....</li>
            <li>Scars do not magically disappear but they are protected and that has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Not only has the redness of the scars faded dramatically (one of them is now completely skin-toned) but the scar is flat, feels just like regular skin without the lumpy scar tissue that was trying to form underneath.</li>
            <li>(you can only imagine applying this brush equivalent to a nail polish brush to a scar on each arm that is over 12 inches long and ranges from 1/2 inch to 1 inch wide, It can get quite frustratting trying to ensure it is fully applied, and also you can imagine how much i use.  </li>
            <li>: The bottle doesn&#x27;t close very well, but I would just brush a little of the silicone on the tp screw of the bottle and then close.  </li>

            <li> (you can only imagine applying this brush equivalent to a nail polish brush to a scar on each arm that is over 12 inches long and ranges from 1/2 inch to 1 inch wide, It can get quite frustratting trying to ensure it is fully applied, and also you can imagine how much i use.  </li>
            <li> : The bottle doesn&#x27;t close very well, but I would just brush a little of the silicone on the tp screw of the bottle and then close.  </li>
            <li> I found ths product at a local target (just doing my occasional girl time shopping) and stumble upon this product</li>
            <li> - it does not stay on the scar long enough to have any impact.  </li>
            <li> I had plastic surgery a few months back (arm lift) which left long scars on the inside of both of my upperarms each over 12 inches long!  </li>
            <li> It does not stay on skin very long before it peels off.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by others, it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s dry, you don&#x27;t notice it.  </li>
            <li> this scarguard liquid (applying twice a day) only leave u with about an hour to 2 hour coverage....very expensive and big waste of money...not worth it....</li>
            <li> it looks like very dry skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, it protects the area from abrasions since it forms that little second skin over the incision area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now (this is the second bottle) and since its use is a proactive one, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s actually working.</li>
            <li> It is not helping as much as expected at this time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell pungent when wet, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t apply everyday(too lazy), but i do need this when i am in pain or crazy itch attack.&lt;br /&gt;i strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can say that when it stays on , which doesn&#x27;t happen unless I remain stationary, the scar does appear to be less red and less raised.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why the last reviewer couldn&#x27;t keep this stuff on his scar.</li>
            <li> but as soon as im done im looking for other products</li>
            <li> All my dark spot were gone after using it for about three weeks.</li>
            <li> One brushes it on, gives it a couple minutes to dry and then can dress as usual.</li>
            <li> have been using the product for about 3-4 months on a scar from a previous dermal piercing.  </li>
            <li> It has not work and im half way done.</li>
            <li> Stinks to high heaven for the few seconds that you are painting it on, but it&#x27;s dry in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> within an hour 3/4 of it has flaked off and within a few hours or less all of it has come off.....</li>
            <li> and I find pieces of dried silicon all over my house.  </li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t plan on using it everyday</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is very unpleasant (like strong nail polish).  </li>
            <li> The portion that peeled was not Touching the scar</li>
            <li> Not sure how though.</li>
            <li> it has been about a year and is now hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start to see results for at least 2 months</li>
            <li> scarcare products suggest u have the product on AT LEAST 12 hours a day.....</li>
            <li> I recommend putting on 2 coats MAX or it can form a thick layer that hardens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> seriously would recommend this product to all my friends</li>
            <li> Doing this, in the end saved money from buying the thick silicone pads and bandages to keep it on and no one noticing it nearly as much as having a bandage on your wrist at work and clients staring at it thinking the worst.  </li>
            <li> It flakes off, like peeling skin so the small bottle becomes expensive with repeated</li>
            <li> I suffers a lot from acne and it always leave me with dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it because my doctor has put the fear in me that if I don&#x27;t the scars will be worse.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously a miracle in a jar!</li>
            <li> My question is this product so expensive</li>
            <li> Its all fake now.</li>
            <li> It has a horrible smell,I use to have to go outside just so my house wouldn&#x27;t smell!</li>
            <li> but perhaps I used it the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid to even put it on his face.  </li>
            <li> One bad thing that I can say  about this product is the application.  </li>
            <li> It dries so ugly</li>
            <li> I saw no difference and very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I broke my wrist a year ago which required surgery- with a horrible, puckered scar.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not apply well - - very flakey - it does not stay on the scar long enough to have any impact.  I wrote to the company to inquire about a refund but did not recieve a reply.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it depends on where you&#x27;re applying it, but for me this stuff begins to flake off as soon as I move.  Also, the smell is very unpleasant (like strong nail polish).  I&#x27;ve read that silicone is the way to go for scar treatment, but how is anything supposed to help if it wont stay on?  I can say that when it stays on , which doesn&#x27;t happen unless I remain stationary, the scar does appear to be less red and less raised.  I&#x27;ll be looking into silicone sheets/strips to see if those work better.  Also, what really has helped the most for me has been firmly massaging the scar.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the last reviewer couldn&#x27;t keep this stuff on his scar. I paint this on two scars I have from arthroscopic surgery and have been since my bandages came off (about two weeks post-surgery). Not only has the redness of the scars faded dramatically (one of them is now completely skin-toned) but the scar is flat, feels just like regular skin without the lumpy scar tissue that was trying to form underneath. Stays on very well, through a shower even. I have to peel it off so that my physical therapist can massage the area. Stinks to high heaven for the few seconds that you are painting it on, but it&#x27;s dry in less than a minute. I can wear jeans over it, and the fabric won&#x27;t remove it. In fact, it protects the area from abrasions since it forms that little second skin over the incision area. Overall, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works well to reduce scars...mostly flattening them and thinning them out a bit.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because once it dries, it flakes off (you&#x27;re supposed to peel it off 2 times a day), and I find pieces of dried silicon all over my house.  Gross!  Also it smells like a chemical, so you really can&#x27;t apply it and then go anywhere where you care if you smell like chemicals.  It does go away though.  I had surgery, and this product has been wonderful!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research about scar treatments before buying Scargard MD.  From my research, I found that silicone based treatments have been proven to be most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Scarguard MD at my local Target for around $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for about 3-4 months on a scar from a previous dermal piercing.  I have seen a vast improvement!!!  However, it is very important that you use the product EVERYDAY.  I try to have the gel on at all times (if it can be covered).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells a bit strong at first but once it&#x27;s dry, you don&#x27;t notice it.  I recommend putting on 2 coats MAX or it can form a thick layer that hardens.&lt;br /&gt;The gel seems to cling to scar tissue and peel where there is no scar tissue which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise putting Scarguard MD on a scar that shows; my scar is on my chest so I only use the product when I am at home or wearing a shirt with a higher neckline.  It leaves a shiny film on the scar and a white peeling film around the scar and is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone with ANY shade of skin (my skin is medium brown- like a paper bag).  But if you don&#x27;t plan on using it everyday -don&#x27;t bother.  I didn&#x27;t start to see results for at least 2 months but after that, the discoloration changes quickly.</li>
            <li> This helped my friend with a huge raised scar on her knee, it&#x27;s a tad more flat now, but I&#x27;m trying to use it to fade some little acne-type scars on my stomach. Literally a MINUTE after putting this god-awful-smelling stuff on, it comes off. It might work okay if you never have anything touching the scar, but do not buy this if your clothes cover it... been a complete waste.</li>
            <li> It is not helping as much as expected at this time. I have only been using a couple of weeks. I had plastic surgery and it actually burned the skin where the steri- strips were placed, so I stopped using for awhile. I began using again. It does not stay on skin very long before it peels off. My husband bought the extra large container. I wish he had just bought the small, as it is not as good as expected and I only use a tiny amount. And I&#x27;m sure it will expire before I ever use even an eighth of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I would highly recommend especially after trying every scar cream out there .. I sstarted using Scarguard once my scar healed and its been a lil over two months and my scar is barely there! It was recommend by my surgeon.&lt;br /&gt;I seriously would recommend this product to all my friends I was so self conscious about my scar before, but not anymore! This stuff is seriously a miracle in a jar! Thank you Scarguard!!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I bought at the doctors office and it works great! I highly recommend this it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This scarguard was not the consistency of the one I bought in the drugstore.  I doubt it is the real thing.  Also packaging is not the same.  There is no brush in bottle and it smells much stronger.  I think it is counterfeit.  You shoul not sell this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using product for a  few days, but in that short space of time I feel confident that scarguard will do what is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Plastic Surgeon to keep scars from expanding while forming. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now (this is the second bottle) and since its use is a proactive one, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s actually working. If I had to venture a guess from my scarring, I would say no. Therefore the two stars. As mentioned by others, it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long. It flakes off, like peeling skin so the small bottle becomes expensive with repeated applications.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell pungent when wet, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I will keep using it because my doctor has put the fear in me that if I don&#x27;t the scars will be worse. I will give it 6 months and report back.</li>
            <li> ScarGuard is a pretty good product so far! I am just a few weeks in in using the product so I cant give a full review but so far so good!  I had plastic surgery a few months back (arm lift) which left long scars on the inside of both of my upperarms each over 12 inches long!  I was even more self conscience about wearing short sleeves now because of the scar.  I found ths product at a local target (just doing my occasional girl time shopping) and stumble upon this product, I was reluctant in buying this product but then i realized that out of a big shelf this was the last one sitting there so I reasoned within myself &amp;#34;this must be a hot item since this is the last one on the shelf&amp;#34; so I bought it.  needless to say, I am glad I did!  Yes, the smell is strong initially, however it is because of the antiseptic properties that make it smell that way and also I can attest to that because when i first put it on, it stinged like it was killing off any infection prone bacteria.  I use the product as directed (twice a day) and within a weeks time I could visually notice the scar flattening, and fading.  I still have a ways to go but the results that I notice in this short amount of time is promising.  I wish i can upload pictures to show the scar and the severitiy of it.  One bad thing that I can say  about this product is the application.  I wish that the brush was bigger or there was a better way to apply on such a big scar.  (you can only imagine applying this brush equivalent to a nail polish brush to a scar on each arm that is over 12 inches long and ranges from 1/2 inch to 1 inch wide, It can get quite frustratting trying to ensure it is fully applied, and also you can imagine how much i use.  As far as the lightening effect of my scar, Im not so sure how effective it is but if it doesnt work I have so hydroquinone cream that I will try after the scar flattens</li>
            <li> this is the best silicone i have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;i suffered from severe queloide, so i got so many scars on me, from my big and small accidents, surgeries, cesaria. i did a plastic surgery to remove the old queloide scar and did beta teraphy(a superficial chemo to treat queloide and skins) but the queloide still came back.... i injected and still injecting Corticosteroid every 2 months, coz it&#x27;s constantly itching and red(means it&#x27;s still growing).&lt;br /&gt;but after i start using this product, the scar got better; at least it can stop the itchiness and redness; also it gives certain relief on my scar everytime i stretch my body. i don&#x27;t apply everyday(too lazy), but i do need this when i am in pain or crazy itch attack.&lt;br /&gt;i strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It has not work and im half way done. And i put it on the morning and before bed time</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT REALLY HELPS BURN SCARS</li>
            <li> If you have had a C-section or are planning to have one, definitely invest in this product to lessen your scar.  I see a big difference in the color and texture of my scar...it has been about a year and is now hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product was so good at first, but now it is fake. It is no longer effective. My question is this product so expensive and yet it doesn&#x27;t work. My $52 was gone for nothing. I suffers a lot from acne and it always leave me with dark spot on my face. Last year i bought this product and it works so good. All my dark spot were gone after using it for about three weeks. But I purchased the same product this time and i have used it for over a month now and still no changes. This product is no longer the same as before. Its all fake now. Buyers please, don&#x27;t waist your money on this.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these in 2011,Does not fade scars at all! The only thing I like about this product is that it has a brush-on application! It has a horrible smell,I use to have to go outside just so my house wouldn&#x27;t smell! It dries so ugly it looks like very dry skin. And it is NOT waterproof!</li>
            <li> However, the best stuff to use is really the ScarAway surgical length strips.  I use both products, supplementing with ScarGuard MD when the strips start to fall off before the week is up.  Definitely can recommend both Scarguard MD and ScarAway strips for post-surgical scarring reduction.</li>
            <li> I broke my wrist a year ago which required surgery- with a horrible, puckered scar.  I wore the silicone patches the hospital gave me at first but after a while it just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable. I purchased this bottle hoping it would help and at first, portions started to peel while other parts took scrubbing to remove.  That&#x27;s when I realized applying in a cross-cross fashion extending beyond the scar helped me.  The portion that peeled was not Touching the scar and I could wear it all day long.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The bottle doesn&#x27;t close very well, but I would just brush a little of the silicone on the tp screw of the bottle and then close.  Worked wonders hand hasn&#x27;t thickened in 7 months, even I forgot to use it for 2 mo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Doing this, in the end saved money from buying the thick silicone pads and bandages to keep it on and no one noticing it nearly as much as having a bandage on your wrist at work and clients staring at it thinking the worst.  HUGE improvement to the scar months later and the puckering is gone and the redness is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> ScarGuard MD has been very helpful in protecting scars my husband has from surgery. It is a good product recommended by his surgeon and we have reordered it as the process continues. It is easy to use. One brushes it on, gives it a couple minutes to dry and then can dress as usual. It will abrade after some hours and come off but that is to be expected. This product has been very helpful. Scars do not magically disappear but they are protected and that has helped tremendously. The scars have faded and continue to do so.</li>
            <li> sure it sounds like a good product from the ingrediants.....but it starts peeling/flaking off after 5-10 minutes...within an hour 3/4 of it has flaked off and within a few hours or less all of it has come off.....the bottle says to not use more than twice a day.....I don&#x27;t see how this can be effective at treating scars if all of it flakes off in an hour and u can only apply it twice a day....scarcare products suggest u have the product on AT LEAST 12 hours a day.....this scarguard liquid (applying twice a day) only leave u with about an hour to 2 hour coverage....very expensive and big waste of money...not worth it....ive noticed no improvement in my scars during 4 months of use....im finishing the rest of it so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste but as soon as im done im looking for other products</li>
            <li> Love love love and would highly recommend.. I lived with it on for a month on post surgery scars and they are healed and not noticeable! Is was recommend by my surgeon and I know why. Best results I&#x27;ve seen from a scar reducing product.</li>
            <li> Peels off some areas pretty quickly, others it works fine.</li>
            <li> I had to use this on a child with scars around his mouth.  The smell is over powering and I was afraid to even put it on his face.  My entire house was filled with the fumes from this product.  Additionally, the medicine turns to a white film which flakes.  When trying to pull it off the scar, it hurt my son and called even more attention to his scars.  I saw no difference and very disappointed.  Would not recommend it but perhaps I used it the wrong way.  Not sure how though.</li>
