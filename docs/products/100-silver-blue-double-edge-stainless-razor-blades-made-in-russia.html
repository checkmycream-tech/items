            <li>I use feather and derby and find these are the best shave shave for most of my de razors.</li>

            <li>I get good shaves out of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found them to be good for about 3 shaves.</li>
            <li>each review with a grain of salt, not everyone&#x27;s face is equal so what will work best for me, might not work the best for you.</li>
            <li>Have been very pleased with these.</li>
            <li>, Great product i love these blades</li>
            <li>/&gt;These give me a fantastic incredibly close shave with no irritation, even going against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very smooth close shave!</li>
            <li>Sure they will work great if you&#x27;re shaving peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Great blades; work better than my platinum blades</li>
            <li>blades are the best I&#x27;ve tried so far, they work great in my Merkur HD and 1962 Gillette Tech.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these blades!</li>
            <li>Love these blades!</li>
            <li>I bought these based on the positive reviews and I must say I am quite impressed.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product unless you&#x27;re certain this is the best blade for your skin and shaving style!</li>
            <li>These blades gave me a great shave and they fit my razor.</li>
            <li>Amazing blade with a slant bar razor.</li>
            <li>nice blades .</li>
            <li>These are nice blades, I use these and Feathers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ironic that Gillette, the brand that created the overpriced marketing solution that is cartridge razors, still produces the best safety razors around.  </li>
            <li>Nice sharpness.</li>
            <li>Very nice and smooth for shaving and doing line ups.</li>
            <li>Gives a great shave every time and I can use one blade for five days without any significant drop off in blade performance.</li>
            <li>Not every razor blade is great for every person, but I have found this one is great for my skin type, which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Great in a mild razor (Feather or Edwin Jagger).</li>
            <li>Just had my first shave with these great blades using my Parker 99R razor - what a close - irritation free - shave!!  </li>
            <li>For me, these are the best blades so far.  </li>
            <li>I got the best shave this morning in nearly 30 years of shaving.</li>
            <li>These blades are by and far the best DE blades out there.  </li>
            <li>You could easily cut your nose or lip off and never notice until the blood starts flowing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for quite some time and have tried many of the more popular blades.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Silver Blue are by far the best blades I have used and work best for me.</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read, as well as my own experience, I too, highly rate and recommend this great Gillette product.</li>
            <li>They work great and give a clean and smooth cut, way better than the multi-blade crud.</li>
            <li>Not too aggressive like the Featherlights, but better than a Derby.</li>
            <li>3rd time buying this blades excellent product</li>
            <li>These blades are in that top three.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of these.  </li>
            <li>I tried one of the sampler packs, and the Gillette Silver Blue was the best of all the blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so so glad a friend turned me on to this</li>
            <li>Love these blades.  </li>
            <li>The price is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I think there&#x27;s an even better shave out there for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trashing mine and replacing them with better blades.</li>
            <li>Take my advice and save your money for something better.</li>
            <li>I like them better than the durby razors.</li>
            <li>I also love the Astra SP blades, but the GSBs are a tad better for me.</li>
            <li>These blades are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many blades since I began to shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Gillette Silver Blue, Great Blade for The Money!!</li>
            <li>Best double edge razors I have used</li>
            <li>Prices vary, but the best current price is about $20 for 100 blades; that&#x27;s 20 cents a blade and - depending on your razor and shaving habits - around 2-5 cents a shave.</li>
            <li>Displeased with many so many de blades.  </li>
            <li>Tried a sampler pack and found that these and feather tied for my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I agree, but there is one more thing.&lt;br /&gt;Four</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started shaving with a DE razor, I&#x27;ve tried most of the DE razor blades out there in both of my DE razors.  </li>
            <li>I kept track of the results and found the Gillette Silver Blues to be the best overall.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more so that I have some in stock.</li>
            <li>I love these blades.</li>
            <li>Just like with most everything else out there.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re a man like like most guys that went shave.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades to use for wetshaving.</li>
            <li>Tried all blades and these were definitely the best blades of the bunch for me.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>By taking greater care, I have not repeated my mistakes.</li>
            <li>Gave to my dad as a gift and they&#x27;re his favorite blade.  </li>
            <li>Personally this is a great pack with great blades, so I took full advantage of</li>
            <li>shave still as smooth as a babies bottom and very easy .</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I wish that I had bought a variety pack of blades first, these are good blades.  </li>
            <li>I also thinking the packaging is kind of cool.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the new blades.</li>
            <li>Like all DE blades, the GSBs may not work with every face or every razor, but they are one of my top performers, helping elevate the outcome with milder razors, while smoothly efficient in more aggressive razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably tried 40 different brands of blades and these are some of the best available.  </li>
            <li>these blades are superior to both the Derby Extra and the Astra Superior Platinum razor blades.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am happy with these blades, I&#x27;ll keep using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how smooth they are and the sharpness.</li>
            <li>Nothing against Wilkinson, but these are just more comfortable.</li>
            <li>They had the most comfortable shave with the fewest nicks/cuts.  </li>
            <li>I use them in my Above This Tie razors and they perform flawlessly giving me a smooth close comfortable shave every time.  </li>
            <li>I loved them so much, I got the 100 pack.  </li>
            <li>Still, based on pure results, Silver Blues are so far the best thing going for</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see me using any other blade there one of the best out there</li>
            <li>Excellent value and a really sharp blade.</li>
            <li>They work great for me in my Merkur 37C.  Similar to Astra Platinums, but just slightly better for me.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best razor in the pack.  </li>
            <li>Stick with Feather that is a fine blade.</li>
            <li>Both are under $20 and both work fine although I prefer the lighter weight and longer handle of the Feather.</li>
            <li>l find these to give a fantastic smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy shaving every day.</li>
            <li>I have just started using double edged blades again and these are great.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I opened the Gillette Silver Blue pack, and had a great shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>and if you buy in 100 lot that equal to 6.6¢ per blade great value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in awe of how smooth these blades are.</li>
            <li>Spectacular blades at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have as gentle a hand as the aptly named Feathers require, these won&#x27;t cut you up.  </li>
            <li>It feels like rubbing a smooth piece of metal on your face rather than a razor blade, but gets a close shave (not AS close as Feathers).  </li>
            <li>Using a Jagger, these blades provide me with a comfortable shave for up to 5 uses.  </li>
            <li>Great shaves , with the same blade before I even begin to start feeling any tugging.</li>
            <li>Amazed, because it actually gave me a better shave than my beloved Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A smooth, clean, comfortable shave with a quality blade.</li>
            <li>They are fairly aggressive and tend to give a lot of weepers if your not careful.</li>
            <li>These are also significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li>I tried these blades originally as part of a sampler pack also including BlueBird, Derby, Shark, Feather, Astra, and Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Greens.  </li>
            <li>These are currently some of the more popular and well thought of blades available today.  </li>
            <li>I am one of those who thinks lots of blades seem more alike than not, but the first time I used the GSB was a revelation.  </li>
            <li>Gillette Nacets were also very good, but these edged those out just slightly.  </li>
            <li>Have tried about a dozen different blade brands and these so far are the best for me.</li>
            <li>These blades cut close and clean.</li>
            <li>Great smooth sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>Also good for designs to give it that extra clean look.</li>
            <li>Even the duller ones give a good shave, but for 2-3 shavings only, the sharpest ones, 4-5 shaves.</li>
            <li>While I get several shaves from a blade, at this price, I could use one a day and still feel; I got a good value.</li>
            <li>OK, I recognize that everybody has different skin types and that&#x27;s why there are so many blade options available.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed because I thought that Gillette made their items in America, the Russian blades are good.</li>
            <li>This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper.</li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li>So sharp I can shave against the grain without irritation when I want an especially smooth shave for date night with my wife.</li>
            <li>I find them a lot more forgiving than a Feather blade, but I&#x27;m only able to get about 3 shaves out of each blade.  </li>
            <li>If there isn&#x27;t a better one, then I&#x27;ll gladly come back to these razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently experimenting with the Silver Blues, Permasharps, and Gillette yellow blades to see which I like the best.  </li>
            <li>Toja shave stick, Alum, Lucky tiger,  then Bert&#x27;s Bees after shave which is or like a balm.</li>
            <li>Quick service, quality blades.</li>
            <li>If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
            <li>At twenty cent per blade, the cost savings are tremendous over multi-blade disposables.</li>
            <li>I have onlu used them a few times and so far they have been very good, more to come on these.</li>
            <li>The Permasharp are very sharp and also give me a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used several blades in my safety razor and these are the best balance of sharp and smooth that I have found.</li>
            <li>I just started using these, but they&#x27;re my new favorite blade.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave every day (full beard), but when I do these blades cut right through with no problem.</li>
            <li>My favorite DE blades so far!  </li>
            <li>They are wonderful in all my razors, new and vintage and seem to really shine in my Edwin Jagger DE-89.  Extraordinarily sharp.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp but also exceptional smooth.</li>
            <li>The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much success with these blades.</li>
            <li>These are far &amp; away my favorite DE blade.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re near the top of the line in terms of performance and longevity, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending them to anyone, although there have been some price/scarcity concerns (they are a bit on the costlier side -</li>
            <li>These give the most comfortable shave and last longer than any blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>These along with Bluebird blades (made by Derby in Turkey) are my favorite blades so far.  </li>
            <li>At this price it makes sense to have a fresh blade</li>
            <li>, I decided it wasn&#x27;t even worth finishing out the rest of the samples.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that these do not pull as much as a fresh Wilkinson does on a three-day beard.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old blades.</li>
            <li>I,ve used GSB in several different DE razors and wish I could say more then they are Ok, but they are just Ok for me.</li>
            <li>Well worth trying.</li>
            <li>I can cut through 5 days worth of growth will ease,</li>
            <li>this is worth</li>
            <li>Worth a shot if you haven&#x27;t tried them.</li>
            <li>That said, I find these to be smoother, sharper, and superior to any other blade.  </li>
            <li>These are sharp blades with good wear characteristics.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to worry about finding the right blade anymore.</li>
            <li>I accidentally bumped into these and I can right away</li>
            <li>The price is just right on these.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a merkur 38C razor for the past 6 years and this blade works the best with my razor and my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love these blades, up there with Personna Med Prep, Polisilver Super Iridiums as far as sharpness goes,  Pretty smooth and forgiving as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>First about the vendor, they shipped quickly and I got exactly what I ordered 5 stars for CosmeticRX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish they were packaged better, the individual blades themselves being nicely double-wrapped but as a five-pack are presented in a simple cardboard box.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, sharp, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>They are smooth and very good on my neck which has very coarse and thick hair.</li>
            <li>These blades are my current favorite.  </li>
            <li>I get 4 shaves at most from a red personna..  </li>
            <li>After I run out in 27 1/2 years, I&#x27;ll be back for more ;)</li>
            <li>Packaging kind of dodgy, but not a real problem.</li>
            <li>My first trial</li>
            <li>The first thing I can tell you is, don&#x27;t assume there&#x27;s a blade out there that is the silver bullet for your beard.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of experimenting when I first started using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different blades, Feather, Lord, Polsilver.</li>
            <li>so if you want the better ones from Russia you better grab them now for no more</li>
            <li>This is a Longtime trusted product that has consistently been rated amount the highest.</li>
            <li>Have to double check that I put in a blade every time that I change it, so smooth!</li>
            <li>These razors are inexpensive, and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>After extensive testing, for my  skin/  beard combo, I get a better shave with these than the Feather blades - not because the Silver Blues  are sharper than the Feathers</li>
            <li>tell of the much higher quality product here.</li>
            <li>A much better buy than feathers or personna medical grade blades.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>The shaves are better and it&#x27;s so much cheaper after the initial purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the first razors I bought when I switched to a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As I relearned my first day, it is much easier to nick your skin shaving by this method.</li>
            <li>I can get up to 5 or 6 good three pass shaves from this blade but usually toss them at 3 or 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li>Most of that sampler went right in the trash after my first shave with each type, but the first time I loaded up a Gillette Silver Blue I was amazed at how smooth and sharp it was.  </li>
            <li>Wow super fast shipping, and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>If you hadn&#x27;t noticed, I also like Feathers for their baby smooth shave, but they&#x27;ve cut and irritated me one too many times while the Gillettes never have, and I switched to safety razors for the comfort, not necessarily a better shave</li>
            <li>While some DE blades are good in one DE razor, and bad in the other (the Edwin Jagger is far more forgiving), these blades are great in both.  </li>
            <li>I find them pretty comparable to Merkur&#x27;s blades which would be my other favorite.</li>
            <li>These blades are super sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried other blades that were highly rated on Amazon and by far I found these to be significantly the best at least for my beard.</li>
            <li>Thanks, I will order again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>If you need a sharper blade than Astra without sacrificing much smoothness or price, go for the Personna lab prep blades here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so it took several additional passes to get smooth.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a cheap Micro Touch razor and it came with Dorado blades.</li>
            <li>Fast Service.</li>
            <li>So much so that I went ahead and bought a year&#x27;s supply.  </li>
            <li>I was using feathers but these are much smoother.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>have one of the stainless steel Feather razors.</li>
            <li>It really felt as if there was no blade in the razor.</li>
            <li>For a sufficiently smooth, and entirely irritantless, shave, they get 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But these are much smoother.</li>
            <li>Much sharper than blades by Merkur / Derby / etc., and much smoother than Feathers.</li>
            <li>my persona israeli or shark stainless.  </li>
            <li>A word of caution though is I&#x27;ve found them to be very unforgiving.  </li>
            <li>Good for at least four shaves on one blade I have found.</li>
            <li>He prefers them over many much more expensive blades due to the smooth and close, irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li>Sharp as feather, smooth as astra!</li>
            <li>These blades work better for me than any other</li>
            <li>sharp but not to sharp, Great for me</li>
            <li>Very sharp and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very sharp very smooth.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, yet for me, very smooth.</li>
            <li>The Silver Blue&#x27;s are a dream come true though.</li>
            <li>I use Van Der Hagen Glycerin soap and have used their deluxe shave soap in the past.</li>
            <li>For me, the Gillette Silver Blue Double Edge Razor Blades elevated my good shaves with the Feather Double Edge Blades (that I used for 2 years) to *</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several dozen different brands by now and the GSB is still my favorite modern blade.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my previous blades.</li>
            <li>The Silver Blues are a considerable step up from milder double-edged blades that many shavers start their wet shaving journeys with.</li>
            <li>after doing some reading in some of the shaving forums I recently tried Gillette Silver Blue and Permasharp blades and like both better than the Personnas.  </li>
            <li>And if you like Astra, these are like the super turbocharged version from the same factory in St. Petersburg.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have kept my shaver.</li>
            <li>excellent blades, they stay sharp for a long time ,  gives you a clean,smooth shave a lot better than the expensive throw aways.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gone as high as 12..</li>
            <li>I highly suggest a variety pack to start with.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you give these a try.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Towards the end of the shave it got so comfortable that I forgot myself and went over one dangerous spot one time too many -- and then I got a quick nick to remind me that yes, Virginia, GSBs can cut you.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>These are great blades, a little cheaper than Feather and sharp!  </li>
            <li>Having tried 7 O&#x27;Clock, Shark, and all of your classic safety razor blades, I found that Gillette Silver Blue was the right blade for me.</li>
            <li>fav!&lt;br /&gt;Not only are they smooth/comfortable, but I feel like they’re more effective at cutting hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li>The blades give a very close shave even on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Through much trial and error this is my fav blade by far.</li>
            <li>They are far better, not even in the same low class, as the junk made in the orient.</li>
            <li>Everybody likes something different and even though the trial packs are not as cost effective you need to find what you like before you end up using the same brand of blade for the next year or 2.</li>
            <li>Good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  </li>
            <li>Not a sharp as most other DE blades also</li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband as he loves his double edge single razor shaver, he says they are ok</li>
            <li>Not a single nick and consistent quality, blade after blade.</li>
            <li>I prefer sharper blades and also enjoy the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Black, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Yellow, Polsilver Super Iridium and Feather blades.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, sharp and lasts 7 days for one blade.</li>
            <li>Almost as sharp as a feather, lasts longer than the feather, and is almost as smooth as an Astra.</li>
            <li>Sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>They blades are sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was new to double-edge shaving and tried a variety of blades.</li>
            <li>These are my new Go-To blade.  </li>
            <li>(I can use a new razor every day.</li>
            <li>It always starts word of mouth, then they buy an old Fat boy or Progress from me, &amp; I give them a handful of blades I have found I have no use for (Personnas in particular).  </li>
            <li>Frankly the only modern blade I&#x27;ve found to be comparable is the 7 O&#x27;Clock (Blue) Super Platinum from Russia (*not*</li>
            <li>The Gillette Silver Blue is a double edge blade that balances several sharpness, smoothness, and long life in a surprisingly good value.</li>
            <li>different and different blades seem to love different razors.  </li>
            <li>My initial favorites were from Feather but these seem to be just as sharp and maybe a bit more forgiving.  </li>
            <li>Went through a dozen other different brands and these work better than any I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li>Significantly inferior to (Japanese) feather blades, and probably German ones as well.</li>
            <li>Cheap, but not worth the money.</li>
            <li>an extra gift from my seller (GP- DE razor blades) and he shipped fast!</li>
            <li>if you want to, you rotate the blade between cleaning of the razor, or you could return the blade to the exact same position it was at before you removed it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but these give 3-4 consistent, close shaves without nicks, scrapes or cuts if my face is properly lathered.</li>
            <li>I get nervous going any more past that.</li>
            <li>This is the only double edge blade that fits my shaver and gives me a clean close shave without cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Randell</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and far to thin for a good double edged instrument.</li>
            <li>I have three favorite blades and there are very few differences between them that I can tell for smoothness and longevity.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, and smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li>A day started with a new Gillette Super Blue &amp; a cup of black coffee gets things going on the right foot.  </li>
            <li>Having somewhat coarse hair, it was very difficult to find some blades that were perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>And the Gillette Silver Blues are much more face-friendly, in that they are smoother and less prone to producing weepers and bumps than my Feathers, which have now been moved to second place in my blade rankings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Several premium blades (like the Polsilver and Feather) are the same level, but the value is quite extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them a few times and feel that they&#x27;re a fine shaver, and I feel they shave as well as</li>
            <li>New go to blade, I use 3 to 4 before sealing out for new blade, other shavers may get more, I like a sharp blade</li>
            <li>Japanese-made Feathers are clearly sharper but these are smoother.  </li>
            <li>like is a shave or two old.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used Derby, Personna Blues, Feather, Astra Platinum, and some no name brand blades that came with a Van Der Hagen Razor.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but so far nine have come close to the performance I get from these.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised with him</li>
            <li>I switched to old fashion razors.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be that much sharper...and there are probably different additional reasons that I can&#x27;t identify.</li>
            <li>I have used one blade so far, and I got the smoothest shave I have had in a while without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have tried multiple DE blades and found these seem to work really well for me.</li>
            <li>I was totally sold on the Feather blades in my Muhle R41, but figured I would try a few more brands, just to see what else was out there.  </li>
            <li>but they go dull pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I Have tried many other de blades and keep coming back to the Silver Blue.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave and lasting sharp edges.</li>
            <li>At 22 cents a blade (at present), these are dirt cheap (for reference, Gillette Pro Fusion cost around $4 each and last just as long).  </li>
            <li>Because of its smoothness, those accustomed to using too much pressure with lesser blades may find themselves getting a rough shave on the first try.  </li>
            <li>Similar blade at my local pharmacy cost $3.00 for 5, these were cost less, but were far better quality.</li>
            <li>When I tested out several different blades I narrowed my top 2 down to these and the Feather blades.</li>
            <li>,t shave everyday 4 days of beard and cut off clean .  </li>
            <li>sharp they were and most of all how long they last!</li>
            <li>have been using these exclusively for the past couple of weeks now and can say without hesitation that these are fantastic blades.</li>
            <li>- they are not - but they are rather more forgiving - less nicks and cuts due to operator error (to which I am prone - think I have ADD or something)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Razor sharp shaving efficiency at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I tossed the other blades in the sample pack after the first shave.</li>
            <li>I have a tough beard and find that sharper blades usually do a better job for me.  </li>
            <li>These are the only ones so far that do not irritate my skin when I am shaving.</li>
            <li>well worth the price and seem to be as good if not better than the expensive double edge blades, used to use these in the 60,s.</li>
            <li>the cardboard box does not dispense one at a time once you open it they all want to come out and no place for the old blades.</li>
            <li>As I was shaving this morning,  the cutting was so smooth I wasn&#x27;t sure the blades were even sharp.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and are pretty forgiving.</li>
            <li>are 95% as sharp as Feathers, yet much, much smoother.</li>
            <li>A week or so later, perhaps when I or another guy receive Gillette Super Blues in the mail, we pass on no more than a couple to someone who has yet to try them.  </li>
            <li>They start out super sharp, and stay sharp longer.</li>
            <li>Nearly as sharp as the Feather, much, much smoother, and longer lasting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having run the gamut of all methods of shaving, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that, although my main tool is the safety razor, the other tools have their place too.  </li>
            <li>Smooth Shave, A hard blade to beat!</li>
            <li>Terrible blades, should have realized the price was to good to be true.</li>
            <li>I have to shave every day because my whiskers are thick and grow quickly.</li>
            <li>The Astra&#x27;s were gentle, reliable, and long lasting but weren&#x27;t that sharp</li>
            <li>Then other times a new blade will glide through whiskers.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s different though, so try a few before buying a large quantity.</li>
            <li>I used Merkur double edge razor blades for years but due to the cost I started looking for a new blade.</li>

            <li> each review with a grain of salt, not everyone&#x27;s face is equal so what will work best for me, might not work the best for you.</li>
            <li> Have been very pleased with these.</li>
            <li> , Great product i love these blades</li>
            <li> /&gt;These give me a fantastic incredibly close shave with no irritation, even going against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very smooth close shave!</li>
            <li> Sure they will work great if you&#x27;re shaving peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Great blades; work better than my platinum blades</li>
            <li> blades are the best I&#x27;ve tried so far, they work great in my Merkur HD and 1962 Gillette Tech.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these blades!</li>
            <li> Love these blades!</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the positive reviews and I must say I am quite impressed.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product unless you&#x27;re certain this is the best blade for your skin and shaving style!</li>
            <li> These blades gave me a great shave and they fit my razor.</li>
            <li> Amazing blade with a slant bar razor.</li>
            <li> nice blades .</li>
            <li> These are nice blades, I use these and Feathers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ironic that Gillette, the brand that created the overpriced marketing solution that is cartridge razors, still produces the best safety razors around.  </li>
            <li> Nice sharpness.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth for shaving and doing line ups.</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave every time and I can use one blade for five days without any significant drop off in blade performance.</li>
            <li> Not every razor blade is great for every person, but I have found this one is great for my skin type, which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Great in a mild razor (Feather or Edwin Jagger).</li>
            <li> Just had my first shave with these great blades using my Parker 99R razor - what a close - irritation free - shave!!  </li>
            <li> For me, these are the best blades so far.  </li>
            <li> I got the best shave this morning in nearly 30 years of shaving.</li>
            <li> These blades are by and far the best DE blades out there.  </li>
            <li> You could easily cut your nose or lip off and never notice until the blood starts flowing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for quite some time and have tried many of the more popular blades.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Silver Blue are by far the best blades I have used and work best for me.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, as well as my own experience, I too, highly rate and recommend this great Gillette product.</li>
            <li> They work great and give a clean and smooth cut, way better than the multi-blade crud.</li>
            <li> Not too aggressive like the Featherlights, but better than a Derby.</li>
            <li> 3rd time buying this blades excellent product</li>
            <li> These blades are in that top three.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more of these.  </li>
            <li> I tried one of the sampler packs, and the Gillette Silver Blue was the best of all the blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so so glad a friend turned me on to this</li>
            <li> Love these blades.  </li>
            <li> The price is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s an even better shave out there for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trashing mine and replacing them with better blades.</li>
            <li> Take my advice and save your money for something better.</li>
            <li> I like them better than the durby razors.</li>
            <li> I also love the Astra SP blades, but the GSBs are a tad better for me.</li>
            <li> These blades are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many blades since I began to shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Gillette Silver Blue, Great Blade for The Money!!</li>
            <li> Best double edge razors I have used</li>
            <li> Prices vary, but the best current price is about $20 for 100 blades; that&#x27;s 20 cents a blade and - depending on your razor and shaving habits - around 2-5 cents a shave.</li>
            <li> Displeased with many so many de blades.  </li>
            <li> Tried a sampler pack and found that these and feather tied for my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I agree, but there is one more thing.&lt;br /&gt;Four</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started shaving with a DE razor, I&#x27;ve tried most of the DE razor blades out there in both of my DE razors.  </li>
            <li> I kept track of the results and found the Gillette Silver Blues to be the best overall.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more so that I have some in stock.</li>
            <li> I love these blades.</li>
            <li> Just like with most everything else out there.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re a man like like most guys that went shave.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades to use for wetshaving.</li>
            <li> Tried all blades and these were definitely the best blades of the bunch for me.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li> By taking greater care, I have not repeated my mistakes.</li>
            <li> Gave to my dad as a gift and they&#x27;re his favorite blade.  </li>
            <li> Personally this is a great pack with great blades, so I took full advantage of</li>
            <li> shave still as smooth as a babies bottom and very easy .</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I wish that I had bought a variety pack of blades first, these are good blades.  </li>
            <li> I also thinking the packaging is kind of cool.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the new blades.</li>
            <li> Like all DE blades, the GSBs may not work with every face or every razor, but they are one of my top performers, helping elevate the outcome with milder razors, while smoothly efficient in more aggressive razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably tried 40 different brands of blades and these are some of the best available.  </li>
            <li> these blades are superior to both the Derby Extra and the Astra Superior Platinum razor blades.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am happy with these blades, I&#x27;ll keep using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love how smooth they are and the sharpness.</li>
            <li> Nothing against Wilkinson, but these are just more comfortable.</li>
            <li> They had the most comfortable shave with the fewest nicks/cuts.  </li>
            <li> I use them in my Above This Tie razors and they perform flawlessly giving me a smooth close comfortable shave every time.  </li>
            <li> I loved them so much, I got the 100 pack.  </li>
            <li> Still, based on pure results, Silver Blues are so far the best thing going for</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see me using any other blade there one of the best out there</li>
            <li> Excellent value and a really sharp blade.</li>
            <li> They work great for me in my Merkur 37C.  Similar to Astra Platinums, but just slightly better for me.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best razor in the pack.  </li>
            <li> Stick with Feather that is a fine blade.</li>
            <li> Both are under $20 and both work fine although I prefer the lighter weight and longer handle of the Feather.</li>
            <li> l find these to give a fantastic smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy shaving every day.</li>
            <li> I have just started using double edged blades again and these are great.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I opened the Gillette Silver Blue pack, and had a great shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> and if you buy in 100 lot that equal to 6.6¢ per blade great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in awe of how smooth these blades are.</li>
            <li> Spectacular blades at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have as gentle a hand as the aptly named Feathers require, these won&#x27;t cut you up.  </li>
            <li> It feels like rubbing a smooth piece of metal on your face rather than a razor blade, but gets a close shave (not AS close as Feathers).  </li>
            <li> Using a Jagger, these blades provide me with a comfortable shave for up to 5 uses.  </li>
            <li> Great shaves , with the same blade before I even begin to start feeling any tugging.</li>
            <li> Amazed, because it actually gave me a better shave than my beloved Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A smooth, clean, comfortable shave with a quality blade.</li>
            <li> They are fairly aggressive and tend to give a lot of weepers if your not careful.</li>
            <li> These are also significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li> I tried these blades originally as part of a sampler pack also including BlueBird, Derby, Shark, Feather, Astra, and Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Greens.  </li>
            <li> These are currently some of the more popular and well thought of blades available today.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those who thinks lots of blades seem more alike than not, but the first time I used the GSB was a revelation.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Nacets were also very good, but these edged those out just slightly.  </li>
            <li> Have tried about a dozen different blade brands and these so far are the best for me.</li>
            <li> These blades cut close and clean.</li>
            <li> Great smooth sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> Also good for designs to give it that extra clean look.</li>
            <li> Even the duller ones give a good shave, but for 2-3 shavings only, the sharpest ones, 4-5 shaves.</li>
            <li> While I get several shaves from a blade, at this price, I could use one a day and still feel; I got a good value.</li>
            <li> OK, I recognize that everybody has different skin types and that&#x27;s why there are so many blade options available.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed because I thought that Gillette made their items in America, the Russian blades are good.</li>
            <li> This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper.</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> So sharp I can shave against the grain without irritation when I want an especially smooth shave for date night with my wife.</li>
            <li> I find them a lot more forgiving than a Feather blade, but I&#x27;m only able to get about 3 shaves out of each blade.  </li>
            <li> If there isn&#x27;t a better one, then I&#x27;ll gladly come back to these razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently experimenting with the Silver Blues, Permasharps, and Gillette yellow blades to see which I like the best.  </li>
            <li> Toja shave stick, Alum, Lucky tiger,  then Bert&#x27;s Bees after shave which is or like a balm.</li>
            <li> Quick service, quality blades.</li>
            <li> If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
            <li> At twenty cent per blade, the cost savings are tremendous over multi-blade disposables.</li>
            <li> I have onlu used them a few times and so far they have been very good, more to come on these.</li>
            <li> The Permasharp are very sharp and also give me a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used several blades in my safety razor and these are the best balance of sharp and smooth that I have found.</li>
            <li> I just started using these, but they&#x27;re my new favorite blade.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave every day (full beard), but when I do these blades cut right through with no problem.</li>
            <li> My favorite DE blades so far!  </li>
            <li> They are wonderful in all my razors, new and vintage and seem to really shine in my Edwin Jagger DE-89.  Extraordinarily sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp but also exceptional smooth.</li>
            <li> The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much success with these blades.</li>
            <li> These are far &amp; away my favorite DE blade.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re near the top of the line in terms of performance and longevity, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending them to anyone, although there have been some price/scarcity concerns (they are a bit on the costlier side -</li>
            <li> These give the most comfortable shave and last longer than any blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> These along with Bluebird blades (made by Derby in Turkey) are my favorite blades so far.  </li>
            <li> At this price it makes sense to have a fresh blade</li>
            <li> , I decided it wasn&#x27;t even worth finishing out the rest of the samples.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that these do not pull as much as a fresh Wilkinson does on a three-day beard.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old blades.</li>
            <li> I,ve used GSB in several different DE razors and wish I could say more then they are Ok, but they are just Ok for me.</li>
            <li> Well worth trying.</li>
            <li> I can cut through 5 days worth of growth will ease,</li>
            <li> this is worth</li>
            <li> Worth a shot if you haven&#x27;t tried them.</li>
            <li> That said, I find these to be smoother, sharper, and superior to any other blade.  </li>
            <li> These are sharp blades with good wear characteristics.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to worry about finding the right blade anymore.</li>
            <li> I accidentally bumped into these and I can right away</li>
            <li> The price is just right on these.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a merkur 38C razor for the past 6 years and this blade works the best with my razor and my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love these blades, up there with Personna Med Prep, Polisilver Super Iridiums as far as sharpness goes,  Pretty smooth and forgiving as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> First about the vendor, they shipped quickly and I got exactly what I ordered 5 stars for CosmeticRX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish they were packaged better, the individual blades themselves being nicely double-wrapped but as a five-pack are presented in a simple cardboard box.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, sharp, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> They are smooth and very good on my neck which has very coarse and thick hair.</li>
            <li> These blades are my current favorite.  </li>
            <li> I get 4 shaves at most from a red personna..  </li>
            <li> After I run out in 27 1/2 years, I&#x27;ll be back for more ;)</li>
            <li> Packaging kind of dodgy, but not a real problem.</li>
            <li> My first trial</li>
            <li> The first thing I can tell you is, don&#x27;t assume there&#x27;s a blade out there that is the silver bullet for your beard.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of experimenting when I first started using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different blades, Feather, Lord, Polsilver.</li>
            <li> so if you want the better ones from Russia you better grab them now for no more</li>
            <li> This is a Longtime trusted product that has consistently been rated amount the highest.</li>
            <li> Have to double check that I put in a blade every time that I change it, so smooth!</li>
            <li> These razors are inexpensive, and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> After extensive testing, for my  skin/  beard combo, I get a better shave with these than the Feather blades - not because the Silver Blues  are sharper than the Feathers</li>
            <li> tell of the much higher quality product here.</li>
            <li> A much better buy than feathers or personna medical grade blades.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> The shaves are better and it&#x27;s so much cheaper after the initial purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the first razors I bought when I switched to a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As I relearned my first day, it is much easier to nick your skin shaving by this method.</li>
            <li> I can get up to 5 or 6 good three pass shaves from this blade but usually toss them at 3 or 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li> Most of that sampler went right in the trash after my first shave with each type, but the first time I loaded up a Gillette Silver Blue I was amazed at how smooth and sharp it was.  </li>
            <li> Wow super fast shipping, and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> If you hadn&#x27;t noticed, I also like Feathers for their baby smooth shave, but they&#x27;ve cut and irritated me one too many times while the Gillettes never have, and I switched to safety razors for the comfort, not necessarily a better shave</li>
            <li> While some DE blades are good in one DE razor, and bad in the other (the Edwin Jagger is far more forgiving), these blades are great in both.  </li>
            <li> I find them pretty comparable to Merkur&#x27;s blades which would be my other favorite.</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried other blades that were highly rated on Amazon and by far I found these to be significantly the best at least for my beard.</li>
            <li> Thanks, I will order again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> If you need a sharper blade than Astra without sacrificing much smoothness or price, go for the Personna lab prep blades here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so it took several additional passes to get smooth.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a cheap Micro Touch razor and it came with Dorado blades.</li>
            <li> Fast Service.</li>
            <li> So much so that I went ahead and bought a year&#x27;s supply.  </li>
            <li> I was using feathers but these are much smoother.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> have one of the stainless steel Feather razors.</li>
            <li> It really felt as if there was no blade in the razor.</li>
            <li> For a sufficiently smooth, and entirely irritantless, shave, they get 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But these are much smoother.</li>
            <li> Much sharper than blades by Merkur / Derby / etc., and much smoother than Feathers.</li>
            <li> my persona israeli or shark stainless.  </li>
            <li> A word of caution though is I&#x27;ve found them to be very unforgiving.  </li>
            <li> Good for at least four shaves on one blade I have found.</li>
            <li> He prefers them over many much more expensive blades due to the smooth and close, irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li> Sharp as feather, smooth as astra!</li>
            <li> These blades work better for me than any other</li>
            <li> sharp but not to sharp, Great for me</li>
            <li> Very sharp and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very sharp very smooth.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, yet for me, very smooth.</li>
            <li> The Silver Blue&#x27;s are a dream come true though.</li>
            <li> I use Van Der Hagen Glycerin soap and have used their deluxe shave soap in the past.</li>
            <li> For me, the Gillette Silver Blue Double Edge Razor Blades elevated my good shaves with the Feather Double Edge Blades (that I used for 2 years) to *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dozen different brands by now and the GSB is still my favorite modern blade.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my previous blades.</li>
            <li> The Silver Blues are a considerable step up from milder double-edged blades that many shavers start their wet shaving journeys with.</li>
            <li> after doing some reading in some of the shaving forums I recently tried Gillette Silver Blue and Permasharp blades and like both better than the Personnas.  </li>
            <li> And if you like Astra, these are like the super turbocharged version from the same factory in St. Petersburg.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have kept my shaver.</li>
            <li> excellent blades, they stay sharp for a long time ,  gives you a clean,smooth shave a lot better than the expensive throw aways.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gone as high as 12..</li>
            <li> I highly suggest a variety pack to start with.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you give these a try.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Towards the end of the shave it got so comfortable that I forgot myself and went over one dangerous spot one time too many -- and then I got a quick nick to remind me that yes, Virginia, GSBs can cut you.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> These are great blades, a little cheaper than Feather and sharp!  </li>
            <li> Having tried 7 O&#x27;Clock, Shark, and all of your classic safety razor blades, I found that Gillette Silver Blue was the right blade for me.</li>
            <li> fav!&lt;br /&gt;Not only are they smooth/comfortable, but I feel like they’re more effective at cutting hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li> The blades give a very close shave even on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Through much trial and error this is my fav blade by far.</li>
            <li> They are far better, not even in the same low class, as the junk made in the orient.</li>
            <li> Everybody likes something different and even though the trial packs are not as cost effective you need to find what you like before you end up using the same brand of blade for the next year or 2.</li>
            <li> Good, but not great.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  </li>
            <li> Not a sharp as most other DE blades also</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband as he loves his double edge single razor shaver, he says they are ok</li>
            <li> Not a single nick and consistent quality, blade after blade.</li>
            <li> I prefer sharper blades and also enjoy the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Black, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Yellow, Polsilver Super Iridium and Feather blades.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, sharp and lasts 7 days for one blade.</li>
            <li> Almost as sharp as a feather, lasts longer than the feather, and is almost as smooth as an Astra.</li>
            <li> Sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> They blades are sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was new to double-edge shaving and tried a variety of blades.</li>
            <li> These are my new Go-To blade.  </li>
            <li> (I can use a new razor every day.</li>
            <li> It always starts word of mouth, then they buy an old Fat boy or Progress from me, &amp; I give them a handful of blades I have found I have no use for (Personnas in particular).  </li>
            <li> Frankly the only modern blade I&#x27;ve found to be comparable is the 7 O&#x27;Clock (Blue) Super Platinum from Russia (*not*</li>
            <li> The Gillette Silver Blue is a double edge blade that balances several sharpness, smoothness, and long life in a surprisingly good value.</li>
            <li> different and different blades seem to love different razors.  </li>
            <li> My initial favorites were from Feather but these seem to be just as sharp and maybe a bit more forgiving.  </li>
            <li> Went through a dozen other different brands and these work better than any I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li> Significantly inferior to (Japanese) feather blades, and probably German ones as well.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> an extra gift from my seller (GP- DE razor blades) and he shipped fast!</li>
            <li> if you want to, you rotate the blade between cleaning of the razor, or you could return the blade to the exact same position it was at before you removed it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but these give 3-4 consistent, close shaves without nicks, scrapes or cuts if my face is properly lathered.</li>
            <li> I get nervous going any more past that.</li>
            <li> This is the only double edge blade that fits my shaver and gives me a clean close shave without cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Randell</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and far to thin for a good double edged instrument.</li>
            <li> I have three favorite blades and there are very few differences between them that I can tell for smoothness and longevity.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, and smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li> A day started with a new Gillette Super Blue &amp; a cup of black coffee gets things going on the right foot.  </li>
            <li> Having somewhat coarse hair, it was very difficult to find some blades that were perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> And the Gillette Silver Blues are much more face-friendly, in that they are smoother and less prone to producing weepers and bumps than my Feathers, which have now been moved to second place in my blade rankings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Several premium blades (like the Polsilver and Feather) are the same level, but the value is quite extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a few times and feel that they&#x27;re a fine shaver, and I feel they shave as well as</li>
            <li> New go to blade, I use 3 to 4 before sealing out for new blade, other shavers may get more, I like a sharp blade</li>
            <li> Japanese-made Feathers are clearly sharper but these are smoother.  </li>
            <li> like is a shave or two old.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used Derby, Personna Blues, Feather, Astra Platinum, and some no name brand blades that came with a Van Der Hagen Razor.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but so far nine have come close to the performance I get from these.  </li>
            <li> and I was surprised with him</li>
            <li> I switched to old fashion razors.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be that much sharper...and there are probably different additional reasons that I can&#x27;t identify.</li>
            <li> I have used one blade so far, and I got the smoothest shave I have had in a while without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple DE blades and found these seem to work really well for me.</li>
            <li> I was totally sold on the Feather blades in my Muhle R41, but figured I would try a few more brands, just to see what else was out there.  </li>
            <li> but they go dull pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I Have tried many other de blades and keep coming back to the Silver Blue.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave and lasting sharp edges.</li>
            <li> At 22 cents a blade (at present), these are dirt cheap (for reference, Gillette Pro Fusion cost around $4 each and last just as long).  </li>
            <li> Because of its smoothness, those accustomed to using too much pressure with lesser blades may find themselves getting a rough shave on the first try.  </li>
            <li> Similar blade at my local pharmacy cost $3.00 for 5, these were cost less, but were far better quality.</li>
            <li> When I tested out several different blades I narrowed my top 2 down to these and the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> ,t shave everyday 4 days of beard and cut off clean .  </li>
            <li> sharp they were and most of all how long they last!</li>
            <li> have been using these exclusively for the past couple of weeks now and can say without hesitation that these are fantastic blades.</li>
            <li> - they are not - but they are rather more forgiving - less nicks and cuts due to operator error (to which I am prone - think I have ADD or something)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razor sharp shaving efficiency at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I tossed the other blades in the sample pack after the first shave.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and find that sharper blades usually do a better job for me.  </li>
            <li> These are the only ones so far that do not irritate my skin when I am shaving.</li>
            <li> well worth the price and seem to be as good if not better than the expensive double edge blades, used to use these in the 60,s.</li>
            <li> the cardboard box does not dispense one at a time once you open it they all want to come out and no place for the old blades.</li>
            <li> As I was shaving this morning,  the cutting was so smooth I wasn&#x27;t sure the blades were even sharp.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and are pretty forgiving.</li>
            <li> are 95% as sharp as Feathers, yet much, much smoother.</li>
            <li> A week or so later, perhaps when I or another guy receive Gillette Super Blues in the mail, we pass on no more than a couple to someone who has yet to try them.  </li>
            <li> They start out super sharp, and stay sharp longer.</li>
            <li> Nearly as sharp as the Feather, much, much smoother, and longer lasting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having run the gamut of all methods of shaving, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that, although my main tool is the safety razor, the other tools have their place too.  </li>
            <li> Smooth Shave, A hard blade to beat!</li>
            <li> Terrible blades, should have realized the price was to good to be true.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every day because my whiskers are thick and grow quickly.</li>
            <li> The Astra&#x27;s were gentle, reliable, and long lasting but weren&#x27;t that sharp</li>
            <li> Then other times a new blade will glide through whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s different though, so try a few before buying a large quantity.</li>
            <li> I used Merkur double edge razor blades for years but due to the cost I started looking for a new blade.</li>
            <li> some of the blades were sharp and smooth others were dull or jagged feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp like a Feather, but much, much smoother and no where near as harsh.  </li>
            <li> Try to use less pressure than normal.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and I have now used one 3 times, which is pretty good for my tough, thick and heavy beard.</li>
            <li> The Feather&#x27;s were wonderfully sharp, nothing smoother, but were just a tad to aggressive for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also, and this could flat out be my imagination, but they seem to last forever.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Feathers are a great blade, but they can be a little harsh and unforgiving.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not a wetshaver, you really don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing!</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind also that I tested only one product of each brand so it is possible that other models within the same brand might be sharper (or duller).</li>
            <li> This hundred pack will last a very long tim .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly why, other than to stick the paper cover in place?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried going back and testing other blades all with the same result.</li>
            <li> Those who are only familiar with the mediocre Derby blade or the horrendously overpriced Merkur will be in for a treat with this blade.  </li>
            <li> They do have a little wax spot near the corners.</li>
            <li> I have I could halve that number and still have blades for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I was trying different varieties of blades, I kept seeing a pattern; whenever I used a Gillette brand of razor I would get a close shave with minimal tug.  </li>
            <li> Been wet shaving for the last 40 years.</li>
            <li> I could describe the test procedure I used and make this review long and drawn out but won&#x27;t bore you with the details.  </li>
            <li> have got heavy whiskers 8 times on one blade so far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on those overpriced ten packs of  German blades just because you have a German razor.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse facial hair but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They cut right through my tough whiskers like butter.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a heavy beard, which makes it very difficult to find a winning combination.</li>
            <li> As all the other reviews on these Silver Blue blades, I have to sayt hat</li>
            <li> After shaving with Feathers for the last 7 years, I decided to try a sample pack of some other brands just to see if I could improve on comfort without sacrificing closeness.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are made in Russia (only a problem if you politically motivated) and are on the higher end of the price spectrum for DE razors.  </li>
            <li> Last along time and stay sharp</li>
            <li> The silver blues are sharp blades and my personal favorites.  </li>
            <li> It turns out that single blades do not irritate the skin as those 3-4-5-bladers do.  </li>
            <li> The Feather blades seemed to be a hair sharper but were less forgiving and did not last as long.</li>
            <li> I,d say a bit above average.</li>
            <li> In a nut shell ;  while there appears to be some very small differences between these  various brands  in initial sharpness levels there isn&#x27;t enough to write about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two different razors, the Van Der Hagen and the Black Plastic Feather razor.</li>
            <li> Prefer them slightly to Astra&#x27;s and Red Personna&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have yet to mess with Japanese feather blades and feel no need to.  </li>
            <li> I use these blades when wet shaving with my safety razor</li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> No thanks</li>
            <li> I use an Edwin Jagger closed comb</li>
            <li> Compared to Dorco they last a few shaves longer and seem to provide a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I use Feather blades, tried Gillette Blue and few others because I want to have alternative blades</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t what we expected.</li>
            <li> but no matter how careful I was, I always seemed to get at least a few nicks, where these silver blues are very forgiving.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and really thick whiskers</li>
            <li> They give me less irritation and tug even after a long weekend of no shaving.  </li>
            <li> I believe the nacets were just a tad less sharp, so perhaps if my hair ever starts thinning out on my face, I will probably step back down to those.</li>
            <li> A little background to back up my outrageous claims about to follow:  I am military, &amp; own or have owned the following:</li>
            <li> narrowed it down to these Silver Blue blades and the 7 o Clock ones and these narrowly beat them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try these out &amp; you will not be disappointed, they are my favorite</li>
            <li> They feel Feather sharp but easier to use and friendlier to the face.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re incredibly sharp.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have every other day with then against the grain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the nicks and cuts I got with other blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews on other DE razor blades, and tried them all.  </li>
            <li> I picked up 300 due to this.</li>
            <li> these blades are extremely sharp</li>
            <li> Another small difference is the Feather blades come with a blade bank built into the container vs these that are in a cardboard box but are individually wrapped unlike the Feather.</li>
            <li> Sharp and no nicks.</li>
            <li> Rick from Pawn Stars was right, the double-edged razors are much less expensive and provide a closer shave.</li>
            <li> have a tough beard and moderately sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the 7 O&#x27;Clock Black from India which is sharp but a bit rougher).  </li>
            <li> Consistency of sharpness is average.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the plastic boxes with the blade disposal slots, but that is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> If you shave once a day, it&#x27;ll last at least two hundred days.</li>
            <li> The only negative I&#x27;ve found is the four lumps glue on the blade.</li>
            <li> these blade are sharp!</li>
            <li> Feathers were very sharp, but lacked the smoothness as compared to these imo.</li>
            <li> I use them as i would a feather (in a tech or adjustable set 2-4) and have less issues all around.  </li>
            <li> This seems odd, but maybe it&#x27;s the way they do it now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found feathers to be slightly sharper than these</li>
            <li> The difference is these are less than half the price bought in bulk.</li>
            <li> Received one hundred half blades.</li>
            <li> Conk 920 Silver Tip Badger Brush with black Handle</li>
            <li> less irritating/fewer nicks.</li>
            <li> I typically use Feather because of the sharpness they provide, however, I always felt that feather is sort of not well made.</li>
            <li> I can get as close of a shave with these blades as I can with feather blades, but with less irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a little while now a</li>
            <li> A little background:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However I need something a little bit sharper.</li>
            <li> For me to get the closest, while at the same time safest shave, I use the DE on pass 1, a norelco on pass 2 and a cartridge razor on the tough to shave areas.</li>
            <li> (I think I have a bad combination of really coarse stubble and sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone to cutting myself way more often from being careless</li>
            <li> I have somehow managed to convert quite a few guys to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> Without fail, EVERY time, guys are ordering these by the 100 and then passing off their old blades on someone else.  </li>
            <li> but the truth is they get the job done for a few</li>
            <li> My work buddy was complaining how poorly his razor performed, so I gave him a pack, and he said the same thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably it won&#x27;t matter and this review was a waste ...</li>
            <li> I shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought the variety packs and if few separate packs.</li>
            <li> Am I missing something?</li>
            <li> In my experience, these blades are very slightly sharper than Astras, but not nearly as smooth as Astras.  </li>
            <li> The Feathers are sharper, but leave my face feeling a little raw.</li>
            <li> I tried Feather blades and determined that those were way too sharp and would leave my face feeling very raw even while I did not apply much/any force with each</li>
            <li> I thought I would put myself through a blind trial of a few different brands to figure out if I could tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> I usually switch blades after three shaves with my Feather blades, I can go to five with the Silver Blues.  </li>
            <li> In my experience (as usual, YMMV)</li>
            <li> am not sure which is better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bang for the buck, this is hard to beat</li>
            <li> In fact, I tossed the Derby halfway through a shave because it was so dull.</li>
            <li> For my beard type and level of experience(8 months wet shaving), I just can&#x27;t go wrong with these blades.</li>
            <li> I had only one blade that was bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other people all reference their razors, but it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I prefer mergress, Gillette thin boy adjustable, merkur slant, the edwin jagger 89l and  merkur 34c.  </li>
            <li> So trial and error is the name of the game.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the name brands and expensive DE blades</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I rank them up there with Sharks.  </li>
            <li> Not the best/not the worst I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The Derby&#x27;s were God awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They work great for me in my Merkur 37C.  Similar to Astra Platinums, but just slightly better for me.</li>
            <li> These blades are the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> Terrible blades, should have realized the price was to good to be true. Very flimsy and far to thin for a good double edged instrument. Stick with Feather that is a fine blade.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much success with these blades. They are fairly aggressive and tend to give a lot of weepers if your not careful.</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly. Great shave. Not too aggressive like the Featherlights, but better than a Derby. Everyone&#x27;s different though, so try a few before buying a large quantity.</li>
            <li> Consistency of sharpness is average.  Keep in mind the ALL shave well, but every 3rd blade or so seems like is a shave or two old.  Then other times a new blade will glide through whiskers.  I think it is a quality control issue.  Even the duller ones give a good shave, but for 2-3 shavings only, the sharpest ones, 4-5 shaves.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great razor blade!!</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent.  You will not be disappointed.  They are far better, not even in the same low class, as the junk made in the orient.</li>
            <li> A little background to back up my outrageous claims about to follow:  I am military, &amp; own or have owned the following: Merkur Futur, Slant, Progress, Mergress &amp; Gillette Fat Boys (1959).  Have sampled a fair amount of DE blades that have come with razors purchased or been sourced elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;  These are far &amp; away my favorite DE blade.  Perfection.  A day started with a new Gillette Super Blue &amp; a cup of black coffee gets things going on the right foot.  Also, recently being deployed I have somehow managed to convert quite a few guys to DE shaving.  It always starts word of mouth, then they buy an old Fat boy or Progress from me, &amp; I give them a handful of blades I have found I have no use for (Personnas in particular).  A week or so later, perhaps when I or another guy receive Gillette Super Blues in the mail, we pass on no more than a couple to someone who has yet to try them.  Without fail, EVERY time, guys are ordering these by the 100 and then passing off their old blades on someone else.  I have yet to mess with Japanese feather blades and feel no need to.  Try these out &amp; you will not be disappointed, they are my favorite and I also buy Astras for my slant razors.</li>
            <li> Any review of razor blades should be taken with a grain of salt.  All faces are different and different blades seem to love different razors.  YOUR MILAGE MAY VARY... That said- These blades are my current favorite.  They are wonderful in all my razors, new and vintage and seem to really shine in my Edwin Jagger DE-89.  Extraordinarily sharp.  They feel Feather sharp but easier to use and friendlier to the face.  I use them as i would a feather (in a tech or adjustable set 2-4) and have less issues all around.  Also, and this could flat out be my imagination, but they seem to last forever.  I get 4 shaves at most from a red personna..  Kais and Feathers from 4-6 shaves a blade, but I can get 8 shaves from these blades and I&#x27;ve gone as high as 12..</li>
            <li> Great value and product</li>
            <li> Great price on these blades.  I&#x27;ve tried all different types of DE blades.  My initial favorites were from Feather but these seem to be just as sharp and maybe a bit more forgiving.  These are also significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li> bang for the buck, this is hard to beat</li>
            <li> I was going to buy Feather Brand, until I came to this one in my sample pack that I bought...  Hands down the best razor in the pack.  It&#x27;s sharp like a Feather, but much, much smoother and no where near as harsh.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Feathers are a great blade, but they can be a little harsh and unforgiving.</li>
            <li> One of the best blades available.</li>
            <li> The Silver Blues are a considerable step up from milder double-edged blades that many shavers start their wet shaving journeys with. Like all DE blades, the GSBs may not work with every face or every razor, but they are one of my top performers, helping elevate the outcome with milder razors, while smoothly efficient in more aggressive razors. They&#x27;re near the top of the line in terms of performance and longevity, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending them to anyone, although there have been some price/scarcity concerns (they are a bit on the costlier side - if you consider 25 cents a blade pricey compared to cartridge razors).</li>
            <li> An excellent blade at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having run the gamut of all methods of shaving, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that, although my main tool is the safety razor, the other tools have their place too.  For me to get the closest, while at the same time safest shave, I use the DE on pass 1, a norelco on pass 2 and a cartridge razor on the tough to shave areas.</li>
            <li> 3rd time buying this blades excellent product</li>
            <li> I have three favorite blades and there are very few differences between them that I can tell for smoothness and longevity. These blades are in that top three. For my beard type and level of experience(8 months wet shaving), I just can&#x27;t go wrong with these blades.</li>
            <li> nice blades . shipping not so good by amazon but handles on the problem. Thanks, I will order again.</li>
            <li> Blades are very good for this price range. Usable, for me, for the week although the difference by the end of the week is noticeable. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> I use these blades when wet shaving with my safety razor and they&#x27;re incredibly sharp. After I run out in 27 1/2 years, I&#x27;ll be back for more ;)</li>
            <li> For me, these are the best blades so far.  Went through a dozen other different brands and these work better than any I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li> I tried these blades originally as part of a sampler pack also including BlueBird, Derby, Shark, Feather, Astra, and Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Greens.  My regular blades were Feathers and occasionally Crystals (Israeli Personnas).  I was totally sold on the Feather blades in my Muhle R41, but figured I would try a few more brands, just to see what else was out there.  Most of that sampler went right in the trash after my first shave with each type, but the first time I loaded up a Gillette Silver Blue I was amazed at how smooth and sharp it was.  Amazed, because it actually gave me a better shave than my beloved Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a standpoint of sharpness, this blade is close to the Feather.  It holds it&#x27;s edge longer too.  I usually switch blades after three shaves with my Feather blades, I can go to five with the Silver Blues.  And the Gillette Silver Blues are much more face-friendly, in that they are smoother and less prone to producing weepers and bumps than my Feathers, which have now been moved to second place in my blade rankings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they were packaged better, the individual blades themselves being nicely double-wrapped but as a five-pack are presented in a simple cardboard box.  I prefer the plastic boxes with the blade disposal slots, but that is my only complaint.  Will be buying more of these.  Actually I would buy a 1000 lot just in case they decide to stop making these, which I have heard rumors of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these exclusively for the past couple of weeks now and can say without hesitation that these are fantastic blades.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband as he loves his double edge single razor shaver, he says they are ok but they go dull pretty quick. Not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> No need to shop around further. These give the most comfortable shave and last longer than any blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I tried one of the sampler packs, and the Gillette Silver Blue was the best of all the blades. Have been very pleased with these. They start out super sharp, and stay sharp longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a little while now a I don&#x27;t see me using any other blade there one of the best out there</li>
            <li> I am now on day 7 with the same blade. this is awesome, because I could never get more than 2 shaves with a track 2 razor.&lt;br /&gt;today&#x27;s shave still as smooth as a babies bottom and very easy . I am so happy with the new blades.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product unless you&#x27;re certain this is the best blade for your skin and shaving style! Buy a sampler pack with 20 brands and use 2 of each before you decide on this. Assuming you&#x27;ve done all that, this is the way to shave. 100 blades for 20 bucks, each blade lasts for me about 5-6 shaves but with the amount of blades I have I could halve that number and still have blades for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not a wetshaver, you really don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing! The shaves are better and it&#x27;s so much cheaper after the initial purchase. Have you seen what they charge for gillette mach4 or 5 or whatever they are these days?!?! These blades work out to something like 2 cents a blade, and a tub of shaving cream can last 6 months+ for 10-15 bucks. I&#x27;m so so glad a friend turned me on to this, it saves tons of money and I enjoy shaving every day.</li>
            <li> Switch to these. They are sharp and get the job done. Sometimes I get 2-3 shaves out of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for quite some time and have tried many of the more popular blades.  I&#x27;ve probably tried 40 different brands of blades and these are some of the best available.  I prefer sharper blades and also enjoy the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Black, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Yellow, Polsilver Super Iridium and Feather blades.  I can get up to 5 or 6 good three pass shaves from this blade but usually toss them at 3 or 4 shaves.  Keep in mind that blades will perform different in different razors and different people have different preferences.  These are currently some of the more popular and well thought of blades available today.  I use them in my Above This Tie razors and they perform flawlessly giving me a smooth close comfortable shave every time.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and very comfortable. Maybe not quite the deal that Astra Platinums blade are but they provide faster beard reduction. Awesome blades.</li>
            <li> These are great blades, a little cheaper than Feather and sharp!  I find them a lot more forgiving than a Feather blade, but I&#x27;m only able to get about 3 shaves out of each blade.  Each shave has two passes and then clean-up, but there is no irritation or nicking present.  These along with Bluebird blades (made by Derby in Turkey) are my favorite blades so far.  I like the minimalist packaging, they don&#x27;t take up a lot of room in the medicine chest.  Another great Gillette product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given them a 5 star rating if they were cheaper or I could have gotten 4-5 shaves from each blade.</li>
            <li> Great close shave.  Non-irritating or tugging.  So sharp I can shave against the grain without irritation when I want an especially smooth shave for date night with my wife.</li>
            <li> Love these blades.  Very sharp, and smooth on my face.  The price is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Cheep, do the job. Two to three shaves a blade. If you shave once a day, it&#x27;ll last at least two hundred days. Packaging kind of dodgy, but not a real problem.</li>
            <li> These are my go to blades. Smooth, sharp and lasts 7 days for one blade. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades and these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product. I had only one blade that was bad.</li>
            <li> My go to blade for shaving.</li>
            <li> These blades seem to do the job! I&#x27;m giving them a try. They do have a little wax spot near the corners. I&#x27;m not sure exactly why, other than to stick the paper cover in place? This seems odd, but maybe it&#x27;s the way they do it now. I haven&#x27;t used double edge blades in years, and have recently gone back to a safety razor. The blades are sharp and I have now used one 3 times, which is pretty good for my tough, thick and heavy beard. I think I&#x27;ll get several shaves out of a blade. So far, I am happy with these blades, I&#x27;ll keep using them.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these for the cost.</li>
            <li> A little background:&lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard and moderately sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;These are the first razors I bought when I switched to a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I only use each blade once and I only shave once a week or so (not because it doesn&#x27;t grow, but because I&#x27;m lazy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wish that I had bought a variety pack of blades first, these are good blades.  They give me a moderately close shave and I don&#x27;t regret having purchased them.  I also think that the price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, my next purchase will be that variety pack.  I think there&#x27;s an even better shave out there for me and I&#x27;m going to go find it.  If there isn&#x27;t a better one, then I&#x27;ll gladly come back to these razors.</li>
            <li> I started using a double edge razor (Edwin Jagger DE89lbl) this year and have been trying different razor blades.  I have a tough beard and find that sharper blades usually do a better job for me.  I tried Derby, Wilkinson, Bic, Astra, and Personna lab blues and found the Personna to be the best of these razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after doing some reading in some of the shaving forums I recently tried Gillette Silver Blue and Permasharp blades and like both better than the Personnas.  The Silver Blues are sharper and smoother and give me a great shave.  The Permasharp are very sharp and also give me a great shave.  I&#x27;m currently experimenting with the Silver Blues, Permasharps, and Gillette yellow blades to see which I like the best.  The Silver Blues seem a bit smoother, the others a tad sharper but all do a good job for me.</li>
            <li> In my experience, these blades are very slightly sharper than Astras, but not nearly as smooth as Astras.  Since these blades are twice the price of Astras, I do not plan to purchase them again.  If you need a sharper blade than Astra without sacrificing much smoothness or price, go for the Personna lab prep blades here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I read a review on shaving site and thought I would try these out.  My first trial I only ordered 25 blades.  I loved them so much, I got the 100 pack.  Have tried about a dozen different blade brands and these so far are the best for me.</li>
            <li> I have just started using double edged blades again and these are great.</li>
            <li> arrived on time. as expected., Great product i love these blades</li>
            <li> While I get several shaves from a blade, at this price, I could use one a day and still feel; I got a good value.</li>
            <li> Significantly inferior to (Japanese) feather blades, and probably German ones as well. Cheap, but not worth the money. I&#x27;m trashing mine and replacing them with better blades. Take my advice and save your money for something better.</li>
            <li> Not the best/not the worst I&#x27;ve used. I like them better than the durby razors. I change the blade every shave. At this price it makes sense to have a fresh blade every go around but the truth is they get the job done for a few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously get one of the trial packs before buying 100 or 200 of the same blade. Everybody likes something different and even though the trial packs are not as cost effective you need to find what you like before you end up using the same brand of blade for the next year or 2.</li>
            <li> Having somewhat coarse hair, it was very difficult to find some blades that were perfect for me.  I got one of these in a sampler pack and was immediately impressed, I decided it wasn&#x27;t even worth finishing out the rest of the samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These give me a fantastic incredibly close shave with no irritation, even going against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found feathers to be slightly sharper than these but no matter how careful I was, I always seemed to get at least a few nicks, where these silver blues are very forgiving.  Gillette Nacets were also very good, but these edged those out just slightly.  I believe the nacets were just a tad less sharp, so perhaps if my hair ever starts thinning out on my face, I will probably step back down to those.</li>
            <li> First about the vendor, they shipped quickly and I got exactly what I ordered 5 stars for CosmeticRX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are the best I&#x27;ve tried so far, they work great in my Merkur HD and 1962 Gillette Tech. I love how smooth they are and the sharpness. They cut right through my tough whiskers like butter. I also love the Astra SP blades, but the GSBs are a tad better for me. Why only 4 stars? I&#x27;ll tell you why, they only last 3 shaves, the 4th shave brings on the burn during the alum block stage. My face was on fire that fourth day, but it only lasted about 15 minutes. So I stick with 3 shaves, and my face is happy.</li>
            <li> Best razor for my face. I use feather and derby and find these are the best shave shave for most of my de razors. I prefer mergress, Gillette thin boy adjustable, merkur slant, the edwin jagger 89l and  merkur 34c.  Toja shave stick, Alum, Lucky tiger,  then Bert&#x27;s Bees after shave which is or like a balm. I&#x27;ve tried about 15 different razor blades.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used Derby, Personna Blues, Feather, Astra Platinum, and some no name brand blades that came with a Van Der Hagen Razor. The Derby&#x27;s were God awful. Like shaving with a belt sander. The Personnas&#x27;s were great but unreliable- some of the blades were sharp and smooth others were dull or jagged feeling. The Feather&#x27;s were wonderfully sharp, nothing smoother, but were just a tad to aggressive for my sensitive skin. The Astra&#x27;s were gentle, reliable, and long lasting but weren&#x27;t that sharp so it took several additional passes to get smooth. The Silver Blue&#x27;s are a dream come true though. Almost as sharp as a feather, lasts longer than the feather, and is almost as smooth as an Astra. I&#x27;ve used two different razors, the Van Der Hagen and the Black Plastic Feather razor. Both are under $20 and both work fine although I prefer the lighter weight and longer handle of the Feather. I use Van Der Hagen Glycerin soap and have used their deluxe shave soap in the past. I&#x27;ve tried going back and testing other blades all with the same result. I have thick, coarse facial hair but sensitive skin. I have every other day with then against the grain. These blades are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many blades since I began to shave with a safety razor. The first thing I can tell you is, don&#x27;t assume there&#x27;s a blade out there that is the silver bullet for your beard. Everyone&#x27;s face is different and what works for you or I, may not work for the next guy. That being said, I&#x27;ve been using Wilkinson Sword as my go to blade. I was given a pack of these by my father to try, (he loves them). I found that these do not pull as much as a fresh Wilkinson does on a three-day beard. I have sensitive skin and a heavy beard, which makes it very difficult to find a winning combination. Longevity is the same as Wilkinson, but they&#x27;re easier on my face. These are now my daily blade after about a year of being a Wilkinson man. Nothing against Wilkinson, but these are just more comfortable. Get a five pack and try them out. I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> As all the other reviews on these Silver Blue blades, I have to sayt hat these blade are sharp!</li>
            <li> Made in Russia...No thanks</li>
            <li> These are nice blades, I use these and Feathers</li>
            <li> A great blade at a good price. I find them pretty comparable to Merkur&#x27;s blades which would be my other favorite. The difference is these are less than half the price bought in bulk.</li>
            <li> Very nice blades and an unbeatable price!  Very smooth close shave!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of experimenting when I first started using a safety razor. Having tried 7 O&#x27;Clock, Shark, and all of your classic safety razor blades, I found that Gillette Silver Blue was the right blade for me. I use each blade for two shaves and then switch. That said, take this review (and others like it) with a grain of salt: community wisdom has it that everyone&#x27;s hair and face are different, and everyone has a blade they swear by. I highly suggest a variety pack to start with.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these blades! I was new to double-edge shaving and tried a variety of blades. Finally came to rest on these and bought this 100-pack. I don&#x27;t get the nicks and cuts I got with other blades. They are smooth and very good on my neck which has very coarse and thick hair. I don&#x27;t shave every day (full beard), but when I do these blades cut right through with no problem.</li>
            <li> After shaving with Feathers for the last 7 years, I decided to try a sample pack of some other brands just to see if I could improve on comfort without sacrificing closeness. I tossed the other blades in the sample pack after the first shave. In fact, I tossed the Derby halfway through a shave because it was so dull. That&#x27;s when I opened the Gillette Silver Blue pack, and had a great shave with no irritation. These will happily replace my Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are 95% as sharp as Feathers, yet much, much smoother.</li>
            <li> Love these blades, up there with Personna Med Prep, Polisilver Super Iridiums as far as sharpness goes,  Pretty smooth and forgiving as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> New go to blade, I use 3 to 4 before sealing out for new blade, other shavers may get more, I like a sharp blade and if you buy in 100 lot that equal to 6.6¢ per blade great value. Very sharp very smooth. Very good value!</li>
            <li> I recently bought a cheap Micro Touch razor and it came with Dorado blades. I was not impressed with the shave,  although it was better than my cartridge razors. After reading what razor gurus say about the blade making the razor and trying all sorts of blades,  I tried this one. As I was shaving this morning,  the cutting was so smooth I wasn&#x27;t sure the blades were even sharp. It was the opposite.  I got the best shave this morning in nearly 30 years of shaving. I don&#x27;t need to worry about finding the right blade anymore. This is the one.</li>
            <li> Gillette Silver Blue, Great Blade for The Money!! Smooth Shave, A hard blade to beat! Fast Service. A great blade.</li>
            <li> A smooth, clean, comfortable shave with a quality blade. My work buddy was complaining how poorly his razor performed, so I gave him a pack, and he said the same thing. Russia did Gillette proud with this one. Great service from the dealer, too. I told my buddy who to look for on Amazon</li>
            <li> OK, I recognize that everybody has different skin types and that&#x27;s why there are so many blade options available.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the name brands and expensive DE blades but so far nine have come close to the performance I get from these.  Not a single nick and consistent quality, blade after blade.</li>
            <li> These blades gave me a great shave and they fit my razor. I was amazed because I thought that Gillette made their items in America, the Russian blades are good.</li>
            <li> Sharp and smooth. Works well in all of my razors. Definitely on my short list of buy again blades. Only drawback are the wax dots.</li>
            <li> Best double edge razors I have used</li>
            <li> The Gillette Silver Blue is a double edge blade that balances several sharpness, smoothness, and long life in a surprisingly good value. Prices vary, but the best current price is about $20 for 100 blades; that&#x27;s 20 cents a blade and - depending on your razor and shaving habits - around 2-5 cents a shave. Several premium blades (like the Polsilver and Feather) are the same level, but the value is quite extraordinary.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!  I Have tried many other de blades and keep coming back to the Silver Blue.  So much so that I went ahead and bought a year&#x27;s supply.  I use an Edwin Jagger closed comb and it handles great.  Displeased with many so many de blades.  I did a lot of research about which blades would be the best.  Although skin types and the razor you use are factors...this is the best combination that works for me on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look into the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Yellows I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but have heard good things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got an extra gift from my seller (GP- DE razor blades) and he shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Amazing blade with a slant bar razor. I was using feathers but these are much smoother.</li>
            <li> I was using a more expensive three bladed razor and not getting a close enough shave.  Rick from Pawn Stars was right, the double-edged razors are much less expensive and provide a closer shave. Compared to Dorco they last a few shaves longer and seem to provide a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Not every razor blade is great for every person, but I have found this one is great for my skin type, which is very sensitive. I used Merkur double edge razor blades for years but due to the cost I started looking for a new blade. I read a lot of reviews and tried several different types. The Gillette Silver Blue are by far the best blades I have used and work best for me.</li>
            <li> In my experience (as usual, YMMV) these blades are superior to both the Derby Extra and the Astra Superior Platinum razor blades.  They provide a closer shave without any accompanying soreness.  Used with Gillette Slim Adjustable set at 5.</li>
            <li> Tried a sampler pack and found that these and feather tied for my favorite. Ended up buying these as they were a touch cheaper than the feather ones. Have not regretted it one bit</li>
            <li> Great blade, service and price.</li>
            <li> Very good blades! However I need something a little bit sharper. But you cannot beat this price! So for me, I can deal for a bit...</li>
            <li> Others here will tell you what a great blade these are and I agree, but there is one more thing.&lt;br /&gt;Four of the corners of the blade are numbered from 1 to 4.&lt;br /&gt;Thus if you want to, you rotate the blade between cleaning of the razor, or you could return the blade to the exact same position it was at before you removed it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure which is better.&lt;br /&gt;I might experiment with both methods.&lt;br /&gt;Probably it won&#x27;t matter and this review was a waste ... sorry</li>
            <li> These blades are by and far the best DE blades out there.  Since I&#x27;ve started shaving with a DE razor, I&#x27;ve tried most of the DE razor blades out there in both of my DE razors.  I have one Edwin Jagger, and one Merkur.  While some DE blades are good in one DE razor, and bad in the other (the Edwin Jagger is far more forgiving), these blades are great in both.  I&#x27;ve read all the reviews on other DE razor blades, and tried them all.  These outshine them all.  I am almost hesitant to write this review, as I don&#x27;t want all of these to disappear!</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp and smooth. I&#x27;ve used many different blades, Feather, Lord, Polsilver. Astra, etc. the Silver blues are among the best. They pair very nicely with a vintage Gillette safety razor.</li>
            <li> After trying several blades in my variety pack, I found these to be my fav!&lt;br /&gt;Not only are they smooth/comfortable, but I feel like they’re more effective at cutting hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li> These blades cut close and clean. I am truly amazed.  Much better than my previous blades.</li>
            <li> I bought one of those variety packs of DE razors and immediately went to the Feathers thinking they&#x27;d be the best because everyone says they are sharpest. I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silver Blues were one of the last I got to and I was surprised with him sharp they were and most of all how long they last! They also don&#x27;t irritate my skin like the others do.</li>
            <li> Sharp as feather, smooth as astra!</li>
            <li> After hearing that people react differently to blades I thought I would put myself through a blind trial of a few different brands to figure out if I could tell the difference.  I tried four different blades: Personna, Feather, Gillette Silver Blues, and a generic brand I picked up from Rite Aid.  I had my wife swap the blades out after shaving with each twice.  I kept track of the results and found the Gillette Silver Blues to be the best overall.  They had the most comfortable shave with the fewest nicks/cuts.  Unfortunately they are made in Russia (only a problem if you politically motivated) and are on the higher end of the price spectrum for DE razors.  Still, based on pure results, Silver Blues are so far the best thing going for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone cares, Feather came in second, followed by Rite Aid and Personna.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the positive reviews and I must say I am quite impressed. The blades give a very close shave even on sensitive skin like mine. Much better than my old blades. Would definitely recommend and I am definitely going to repurchase. I also thinking the packaging is kind of cool.</li>
            <li> Quick service, quality blades.</li>
            <li> I switched to old fashion razors.  Saved myself a bunch.  It turns out that single blades do not irritate the skin as those 3-4-5-bladers do.  Highly recommend.  Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday. Through much trial and error this is my fav blade by far. Blades usually last me about a week.</li>
            <li> Blades are probably a very individual thing that depend on your skin type, razor, soap, and method of shaving. For me, the Gillette Silver Blue Double Edge Razor Blades elevated my good shaves with the Feather Double Edge Blades (that I used for 2 years) to *great* shaves. Why? They seem to be that much sharper...and there are probably different additional reasons that I can&#x27;t identify. I highly recommend you give these a try.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic razors,the best!</li>
            <li> While I was trying different varieties of blades, I kept seeing a pattern; whenever I used a Gillette brand of razor I would get a close shave with minimal tug.  I tried Feather blades and determined that those were way too sharp and would leave my face feeling very raw even while I did not apply much/any force with each pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I narrowed it down to these Silver Blue blades and the 7 o Clock ones and these narrowly beat them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take each review with a grain of salt, not everyone&#x27;s face is equal so what will work best for me, might not work the best for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in awe of how smooth these blades are. I will buy more so that I have some in stock. To date my favourite blade was the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock (yellow box) blade made in Russia. I had recently bought a whack of Feather blades which just don&#x27;t agree with my face. I know a lot of people like then and I&#x27;d happily get let go of them.</li>
            <li> I love these blades. They are very sharp, yet for me, very smooth. Don&#x27;t even attempt to shave with these if you are &amp;#34;rushed&#x27; or distracted. You could easily cut your nose or lip off and never notice until the blood starts flowing! Great in a mild razor (Feather or Edwin Jagger). These are my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; blades along with my Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blacks.</li>
            <li> l find these to give a fantastic smooth comfortable shave. I have tried other blades that were highly rated on Amazon and by far I found these to be significantly the best at least for my beard. Mine are from Russia. Keep in mind that trade with Russia is now banned (fall 2014) so if you want the better ones from Russia you better grab them now for no more will be coming to the States I would think. I picked up 300 due to this. Good for at least four shaves on one blade I have found.</li>
            <li> For me, this is a good Blade. But notice I said, for me. Everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and a really sharp blade. No complaints at all. These are what I will use until I no longer have a choice!</li>
            <li> Purchased these fory boyfriend. Shaves close and no nicks or cuts. Multiple shaves per blade. This hundred pack will last a very long tim . Great quality</li>
            <li> Yo-    WOW!!!!  Just had my first shave with these great blades using my Parker 99R razor - what a close - irritation free - shave!!  I had sampled the Derby Extras, Feathers and Sharks - but these are the best for my face!!  Recommend A+++++</li>
            <li> Good, but not great.  I prefer Polsilver and the Gillette Blacks.</li>
            <li> After buying a muhle R89 and trying a blade sampler pack, I arrived,that these blades are the best for me. They have the sharpness and above all the smoothness. Feathers were very sharp, but lacked the smoothness as compared to these imo. Buy a sampler and give them a try.</li>
            <li> They are Ok. I,d say a bit above average. Been wet shaving for the last 40 years. PolSilver,s can,t be beat. I,ve used GSB in several different DE razors and wish I could say more then they are Ok, but they are just Ok for me.</li>
            <li> Well I guess I&#x27;m just having a blast. I tested the sharpness level of and reviewed  Feather double edge razor blades last week and then turned around and ordered Dorcos,  Derbies, Sharks, Personnas and Gillette Silver Blues.  I already had Astras and Wilkinson Swords on hand so didn&#x27;t need to order them again. I tested again with the same edge sharpness instrument that I had used to test the Feathers. The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon and I may need it if I keep this up. I could describe the test procedure I used and make this review long and drawn out but won&#x27;t bore you with the details.  In a nut shell ;  while there appears to be some very small differences between these  various brands  in initial sharpness levels there isn&#x27;t enough to write about. This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper. Please don&#x27;t shoot the messenger!  I am not a Feather salesman. In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  Please keep in mind also that I tested only one product of each brand so it is possible that other models within the same brand might be sharper (or duller). If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
            <li> Have tried Gilette 7 O&#x27;clock blades (Blue), Astra SPs, and Personna Med Preps. These are the only ones so far that do not irritate my skin when I am shaving. (I think I have a bad combination of really coarse stubble and sensitive skin) Cannot recommend them enough.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and easy on the skin. The only negative I&#x27;ve found is the four lumps glue on the blade.</li>
            <li> This is a Longtime trusted product that has consistently been rated amount the highest. From what I&#x27;ve read, as well as my own experience, I too, highly rate and recommend this great Gillette product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this product, then chances are you&#x27;ve already tried the blade. If you haven&#x27;t, consider buying a blade sample pack to see what you and your skin prefer before buying in bulk. Personally this is a great pack with great blades, so I took full advantage of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars because it works for me.</li>
            <li> Before buying all these blades. I bought the variety packs and if few separate packs. From what I&#x27;ve seen you pay for what you get. Just like with most everything else out there. If you want to buy 100 blades for nine dollars go ahead. Sure they will work great if you&#x27;re shaving peach fuzz. But if you&#x27;re a man like like most guys that went shave. Stick with some good brand. I go with Gillet silver blue. Or feathers and nothing else!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades to use for wetshaving. Very sharp but also exceptional smooth.</li>
            <li> well the wife doesn,t use them but i do.  excellent blades, they stay sharp for a long time ,  gives you a clean,smooth shave a lot better than the expensive throw aways.  have got heavy whiskers 8 times on one blade so far. i don,t shave everyday 4 days of beard and cut off clean .  well worth the price and seem to be as good if not better than the expensive double edge blades, used to use these in the 60,s.</li>
            <li> Was promised one hundred singled blades. Received one hundred half blades. Am I missing something?</li>
            <li> I decided to try these razors after reading about these various places online. They work great and give a clean and smooth cut, way better than the multi-blade crud. Seller delivered on time at a really low price. Similar blade at my local pharmacy cost $3.00 for 5, these were cost less, but were far better quality.</li>
            <li> Good blades, don&#x27;t irritate my skin. Gets close shave with proper prior skin preparation.</li>
            <li> Great smooth sharp blades.  Have to double check that I put in a blade every time that I change it, so smooth! They last about a week for me, have to use soap or they give me razor burn.  I Paired them with &amp;#34;the blades grim&amp;#34; soap for a wonderful shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never going to use a mach3 ever again!</li>
            <li> These razors are inexpensive, and exactly what I was looking for. Shave great in my Mule R89 razor.  I would recommend this brand to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  Only need to make three passes (with grain, across grain, against grain).</li>
            <li> Quality I expect from Gillette and should last me quite a while. Made in Russia !</li>
            <li> These are my new Go-To blade.  I rank them up there with Sharks.  Prefer them slightly to Astra&#x27;s and Red Personna&#x27;s. Well worth trying.</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent.  These are as good as Astra, Derby, or Wilkinson blades.  I have used one blade so far, and I got the smoothest shave I have had in a while without any irritation.  These must be well made.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple DE blades and found these seem to work really well for me. They are very sharp and are pretty forgiving. When I tested out several different blades I narrowed my top 2 down to these and the Feather blades. The Feather blades seemed to be a hair sharper but were less forgiving and did not last as long. Don&#x27;t get me wrong these blades are extremely sharp I can cut through 5 days worth of growth will ease, no tugging at all. Another small difference is the Feather blades come with a blade bank built into the container vs these that are in a cardboard box but are individually wrapped unlike the Feather. If you are concerned with the type of container being used this is worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current set up:&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated&lt;br /&gt;Colonel Conk 920 Silver Tip Badger Brush with black Handle&lt;br /&gt;Proraso Pre-Shave Cream, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol&lt;br /&gt;Proraso Shaving Cream, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol</li>
            <li> I have onlu used them a few times and so far they have been very good, more to come on these.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;I have one of the stainless steel Feather razors. (reviewed elsewhere) After extensive testing, for my  skin/  beard combo, I get a better shave with these than the Feather blades - not because the Silver Blues  are sharper than the Feathers - they are not - but they are rather more forgiving - less nicks and cuts due to operator error (to which I am prone - think I have ADD or something)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in the spirit of &amp;#34;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34;  or &amp;#34;if you ain&#x27;t bleeding, don&#x27;t change the razor blade brand&amp;#34; I am sticking with these.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette</li>
            <li> The best there is! Smooth shave and lasting sharp edges.</li>
            <li> These are great. Razor sharp shaving efficiency at a very reasonable price. (I can use a new razor every day. Good stuff).</li>
            <li> Wow super fast shipping, and was exactly as described. No issues with anything, smoothest experience I have had.</li>
            <li> Love these blades! Perfect for my face and the best Ive tried! sharp but not to sharp, Great for me but they may not be for you, everyone has a blade that works for them you just gotta find witch one it is.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I have used.  I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but for me these just work.  Sharp and no nicks.</li>
            <li> Great blades. Last along time and stay sharp</li>
            <li> I have been using a merkur 38C razor for the past 6 years and this blade works the best with my razor and my sensitive skin. Great close (BBS) shave no irritation!</li>
            <li> Got these as part of a sample pack. Tried all blades and these were definitely the best blades of the bunch for me. Smooth, sharp, and very comfortable. Gives a great shave every time and I can use one blade for five days without any significant drop off in blade performance. I highly recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> Spectacular blades at a reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve tried several dozen different brands by now and the GSB is still my favorite modern blade.  Those who are only familiar with the mediocre Derby blade or the horrendously overpriced Merkur will be in for a treat with this blade.  Nearly as sharp as the Feather, much, much smoother, and longer lasting.  What more could you ask for?  Because of its smoothness, those accustomed to using too much pressure with lesser blades may find themselves getting a rough shave on the first try.  Try to use less pressure than normal.  I am one of those who thinks lots of blades seem more alike than not, but the first time I used the GSB was a revelation.  It really felt as if there was no blade in the razor. Towards the end of the shave it got so comfortable that I forgot myself and went over one dangerous spot one time too many -- and then I got a quick nick to remind me that yes, Virginia, GSBs can cut you.  Frankly the only modern blade I&#x27;ve found to be comparable is the 7 O&#x27;Clock (Blue) Super Platinum from Russia (*not* the 7 O&#x27;Clock Black from India which is sharp but a bit rougher).  And if you like Astra, these are like the super turbocharged version from the same factory in St. Petersburg.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on those overpriced ten packs of  German blades just because you have a German razor.  Get yourself a really great blade and save money as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ironic that Gillette, the brand that created the overpriced marketing solution that is cartridge razors, still produces the best safety razors around.  At 22 cents a blade (at present), these are dirt cheap (for reference, Gillette Pro Fusion cost around $4 each and last just as long).  Japanese-made Feathers are clearly sharper but these are smoother.  If you don&#x27;t have as gentle a hand as the aptly named Feathers require, these won&#x27;t cut you up.  It feels like rubbing a smooth piece of metal on your face rather than a razor blade, but gets a close shave (not AS close as Feathers).  If you hadn&#x27;t noticed, I also like Feathers for their baby smooth shave, but they&#x27;ve cut and irritated me one too many times while the Gillettes never have, and I switched to safety razors for the comfort, not necessarily a better shave (although I got that too).  For a sufficiently smooth, and entirely irritantless, shave, they get 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people all reference their razors, but it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with a safety razor.  My recommendation would be: Use shaving soap.  It&#x27;s a lot slipperier than shaving cream and thus smoother/less irritating/fewer nicks.</li>
            <li> I have probably tried every DE razor blade in the world. It does seem to be a fact that each blade reacts differently to each person.  So trial and error is the name of the game.  That said, I find these to be smoother, sharper, and superior to any other blade.  Feathers may be sharper... But these are much smoother.</li>
            <li> They blades are sharp and smooth. I get good shaves out of them.</li>
            <li> Great blades, smoother than Astras for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good blade. Nice sharpness. I&#x27;ve found them to be good for about 3 shaves. I have a rotation with 2 Merkurs an Edwin Jagger and a Gillette Fatboy procured from my father and it works well with all of them. The wax/glue on the corners is a pain in the ass to scrape off every three days but the blade it&#x27;s self is very good.</li>
            <li> These blades work better for me than any other and I have tried them all.  Worth a shot if you haven&#x27;t tried them.</li>
            <li> Not a sharp as most other DE blades also the cardboard box does not dispense one at a time once you open it they all want to come out and no place for the old blades. The package is the only reason I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great blades; work better than my platinum blades</li>
            <li> I typically use Feather because of the sharpness they provide, however, I always felt that feather is sort of not well made. and their blade had microscopic serrated edges or something. I accidentally bumped into these and I can right away tell of the much higher quality product here. I will not be returning to Feather any time soon (if ever).</li>
            <li> Best blades I have used to date.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth for shaving and doing line ups. Also good for designs to give it that extra clean look.</li>
            <li> I have used these for excellent shaves. I prefer PolSilvers or Personna MedPreps but these give 3-4 consistent, close shaves without nicks, scrapes or cuts if my face is properly lathered. Cheaper than plastic disposables</li>
            <li> The silver blues are sharp blades and my personal favorites.  A much better buy than feathers or personna medical grade blades. The price is just right on these.  Using a Jagger, these blades provide me with a comfortable shave for up to 5 uses.  I get nervous going any more past that.</li>
            <li> These are sharp blades with good wear characteristics. I have to shave every day because my whiskers are thick and grow quickly. The blades are lasting about a week. At twenty cent per blade, the cost savings are tremendous over multi-blade disposables. I am also achieving a closer shave. I was lucky enough to have kept my shaver. As I relearned my first day, it is much easier to nick your skin shaving by this method. By taking greater care, I have not repeated my mistakes. I will not go back to the expense of the multiple blade disposables if possible.</li>
            <li> I just started using these, but they&#x27;re my new favorite blade. Much sharper than blades by Merkur / Derby / etc., and much smoother than Feathers. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used several blades in my safety razor and these are the best balance of sharp and smooth that I have found. I often switch between these and Feather blades. The Feathers are sharper, but leave my face feeling a little raw. These blades are my go-to based on performance and cost.</li>
            <li> I can get as close of a shave with these blades as I can with feather blades, but with less irritation. These blades optimally combine sharpness and shaving uniformity.</li>
            <li> Very good razors. Not as good as platinum or Swiss blues but still awesome.</li>
            <li> 5 to 6 Great shaves , with the same blade before I even begin to start feeling any tugging. I only get 2 shaves out of Astra&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Gave to my dad as a gift and they&#x27;re his favorite blade.  He prefers them over many much more expensive blades due to the smooth and close, irritation free shave.  I&#x27;ve used them a few times and feel that they&#x27;re a fine shaver, and I feel they shave as well as my persona israeli or shark stainless.  Will have to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use Feather blades, tried Gillette Blue and few others because I want to have alternative blades so I can change my daily routine. I like this blade it has gone into my blade rotation and I like the price.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t what we expected.</li>
            <li> My favorite DE blades so far!  They give me less irritation and tug even after a long weekend of no shaving.  I have sensitive skin and really thick whiskers but these blades do the trick.  A word of caution though is I&#x27;ve found them to be very unforgiving.  I&#x27;ve gone to cutting myself way more often from being careless so I have to shave slower now to avoid that.</li>
            <li> This is the only double edge blade that fits my shaver and gives me a clean close shave without cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Randell</li>
