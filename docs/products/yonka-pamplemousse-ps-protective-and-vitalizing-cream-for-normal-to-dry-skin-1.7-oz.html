            <li>This product smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I stopped once I was on my own, but got burned by the cheaper drugstore products along the way (not literally).  </li>
            <li>has a nice smell but leaves my face irritated.</li>
            <li>And the texture of the moisturizer was nice.</li>
            <li>The Best Light yet super mouisturizing face crem I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love Yonka products and have used them since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>My face now feels and looks silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the Yonka Pamplemousse and I am a repeat purchaser.</li>
            <li>I love everything and anything that I have every tried from Yonka.</li>
            <li>enjoyed the smell, it was citrus like...</li>
            <li>my skin feel fresh and bright...</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love yonka just not this product</li>
            <li>It cleared up quickly leaving a clearer and more radiant me!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it if you are willing to pay for it, and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>YonKa has the best line of moisturizers - my face never feels dry - even in winter - my lines are nicely filled in -</li>
            <li>The aroma is refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>great product - need more time to see long term results.</li>
            <li>But when I put it on, it is so light that my face felt as if I didn&#x27;t put any moisturizer on.  </li>
            <li>my favourite face cream - use it daily and love it - order it often and was pleased to be able to get it through you</li>
            <li>This stuff is pricey, but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>This is my special gift to her.</li>
            <li>It actually feels good to use now during summer.</li>
            <li>This product smells great, but it&#x27;s a little too strong on the fruity side.  </li>
            <li>After doing some research this product was one of the recommended moisturizers for dry skin, and based on good reviews, I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I got an amazing facial at a spa that used these products, so I decided to take the plunge and get them for myself.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but completely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy and gross, smells nice but not fragrant, and when combined with a good face wash, keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product if you have normal skin and would like to use it as a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice (citrus), but does not leave my face feeling moisturized for long.  </li>
            <li>I have clear flake free skin now and don&#x27;t use make up as much.</li>
            <li>Wish I could get my money back as I was only able to use it a couple of times!</li>
            <li>Moisturizing, but very perfume-y.</li>
            <li>It really freshens your complexion.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and sensitive and most products don&#x27;t improve my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products, just go to their website to read about which one is for you because not every moisturizer is for anyone.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with combination skin.  </li>
            <li>In the past I have used Clinique, Oil of Olay, and various other creams, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d recommend more natural brands for less money.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and periodically try other similiar moisturizers, I really find that Yonka Products work as well as products that cost 3 or 4 times more.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this is the way to go !</li>
            <li>my skin is soft - a product I will use forever as it has proven itself to me!</li>
            <li>It has a subtle clarifying agent to minimize clogged pores and leaves my skin looking revived and feeling ultra clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>dont recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling literally like silk, and is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to scent, stay away.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that gets really dry in places, yet I still get pimples.</li>
            <li>I did notice this last time that my face was breaking out and it occurred to me that this product is pretty heavy</li>
            <li>I have since found other web sites which have products without parabens and other skin irritants, and they state that using products with too many fruit acids is hard on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I have sensitive skin, which suddenly seemed to get very dry in the t-zone, and the reviews of this cream indicated it worked well for dry, sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> I have extremely Irish/English skin and this lotion adds moisture and brightness to my clear complextion without causing my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive, so I&#x27;m still using it about 2x a week, and rotating in my older brand.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so dry this winter, that I was searching for a moisturizer that actually works, and doesn&#x27;t require a mortgage to pay for it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy the products that spas try to push on you when you get a facial, but this stuff just works, and a little goes a pretty long way.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, not thin either.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> However, after putting it on in the morning, then applying my makeup, the skin on my nose and surrounding area and forehead were still dry, and you could see the flaking skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this every morning on my dry skin and it helps to balance out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry combination skin.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I typically use during day and night unless my skin needs a little extra at which time I use a Yonka heavier moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using Yonka for eleven years; I refuse to use any other product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this early this year during winter time because my skin felt dry, and I needed some heavier moisturizer for the dry cold air.  </li>
            <li> I feel I am loosing half of the ingredients in my sink instead of my face.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do very well against the cold air.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this moisturizer a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive for the amount</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my at-home experience has been beyond disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It is disappointing to have a product that comes out as water.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> They must have changed the formula, I am very disappointed with this product</li>

            <li> I love Yonka products and have used them since I was a teenager.  I stopped once I was on my own, but got burned by the cheaper drugstore products along the way (not literally).  I got a rash on my face from Neutrogena and immediately went back to Yonka.  It cleared up quickly leaving a clearer and more radiant me!  I highly recommend these products, just go to their website to read about which one is for you because not every moisturizer is for anyone.  Then come back here and get a bit of money knocked off your product.  It&#x27;s worth it if you are willing to pay for it, and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> The best for moisture I have ever found...it beats the Winter dryness I get when nothing else does...it smells great too!</li>
            <li> has a nice smell but leaves my face irritated. dont recommend for sensitive skin. i&#x27;d recommend more natural brands for less money.</li>
            <li> The Best Light yet super mouisturizing face crem I have ever used. I have sensitive skin that gets really dry in places, yet I still get pimples. This cream goes on light and is perfect for day. It leaves my skin feeling literally like silk, and is not heavy at all. I keep a tube in my purse to mouisturize while flying, and it is great for that. In the past I have used Clinique, Oil of Olay, and various other creams, but this one is by far the best. Great for under lots of makeup too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Yonka for eleven years; I refuse to use any other product. It is a bit pricey, but completely worth the investment. The Pamplemousse is the perfect light weight lotion to add to the Yonka regiment. I have extremely Irish/English skin and this lotion adds moisture and brightness to my clear complextion without causing my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this cream and has been using for years. This is my special gift to her.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive and most products don&#x27;t improve my skin. I have been using Yonka  Pamplemoose for one week and love it! My face now feels and looks silky and healthy. I am amazed at how well it works!!</li>
            <li> I love the Yonka Pamplemousse and I am a repeat purchaser. I did notice this last time that my face was breaking out and it occurred to me that this product is pretty heavy and I eased off to only applying it before bed and that stopped the breakouts. But if your skin is parched, this is your lotion!</li>
            <li> this product works great, it was recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and love it ! If you have sensitive skin this is the way to go !</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love everything and anything that I have every tried from Yonka. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but it&#x27;s a little too strong on the fruity side.  I bought it because I have sensitive skin, which suddenly seemed to get very dry in the t-zone, and the reviews of this cream indicated it worked well for dry, sensitive skin.  However, after putting it on in the morning, then applying my makeup, the skin on my nose and surrounding area and forehead were still dry, and you could see the flaking skin.  I have since found other web sites which have products without parabens and other skin irritants, and they state that using products with too many fruit acids is hard on sensitive skin.  If I had known that, I would never have purchased this product.  Wish I could get my money back as I was only able to use it a couple of times!</li>
            <li> The pamplemousse was something I had heard about in forums for a while now, and I wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the smell, it was citrus like... And the texture of the moisturizer was nice. Not too thick, not thin either.&lt;br /&gt;Made my skin feel fresh and bright... I would recommend this product, wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive for the amount you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it did last me quite a while, however, I use Aveeno as well, my staple...</li>
            <li> My skin has been so dry this winter, that I was searching for a moisturizer that actually works, and doesn&#x27;t require a mortgage to pay for it.  This stuff is amazing!  It feels like silk on your skin, and it smells wonderful.  It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect moisturizer and compliments Yonka serum so well. I typically use during day and night unless my skin needs a little extra at which time I use a Yonka heavier moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> Good product moisturizers well will order again no drastic results but skin feels good I have dryer skin so this fits bill</li>
            <li> Just applying this is a soothing, spa-like experience. The aroma is refreshing and clean. I use this every morning on my dry skin and it helps to balance out my skin. I use it either under my makeup or instead of makeup.</li>
            <li> OMG! I am in love with this product.  I have dry combination skin. I use my clarasonic mia to cleanse then I apply this all over. It has a subtle clarifying agent to minimize clogged pores and leaves my skin looking revived and feeling ultra clean and fresh. It does not leave my skin dry. Try their eye cream too, it depuffs your eyes in minutes!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and periodically try other similiar moisturizers, I really find that Yonka Products work as well as products that cost 3 or 4 times more.  Travels well but needs to be used within the expiration time recommended.</li>
            <li> my favourite face cream - use it daily and love it - order it often and was pleased to be able to get it through you</li>
            <li> I got an amazing facial at a spa that used these products, so I decided to take the plunge and get them for myself.  Unfortunately my at-home experience has been beyond disappointing.  This moisturizer is separated into an oil and a cream.  I have to shake it and squeeze it before I use it to get it to blend together.  It smells nice (citrus), but does not leave my face feeling moisturized for long.  In fact, I feel like my skin has gotten a bit scaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive, so I&#x27;m still using it about 2x a week, and rotating in my older brand.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, but very perfume-y. If you are sensitive to scent, stay away.</li>
            <li> great product - need more time to see long term results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this early this year during winter time because my skin felt dry, and I needed some heavier moisturizer for the dry cold air.  After doing some research this product was one of the recommended moisturizers for dry skin, and based on good reviews, I purchased it.  But when I put it on, it is so light that my face felt as if I didn&#x27;t put any moisturizer on.  It didn&#x27;t do very well against the cold air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product if you have normal skin and would like to use it as a light moisturizer.  It actually feels good to use now during summer.</li>
            <li> Its a good product but it just isnt for me. It makes me feel oily after i put it on and the essential oils in it over power my nose and my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey, but it&#x27;s so worth it! It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy and gross, smells nice but not fragrant, and when combined with a good face wash, keeps my skin clear. I don&#x27;t usually buy the products that spas try to push on you when you get a facial, but this stuff just works, and a little goes a pretty long way.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my face feel! I highly recommend it for anyone with combination skin.  Definitely a great face cream!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It really freshens your complexion. I must have.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. Not only that it actually rehydrated my skin without giving me shiny spotty skin like some products do. I have clear flake free skin now and don&#x27;t use make up as much.</li>
            <li> YonKa has the best line of moisturizers - my face never feels dry - even in winter - my lines are nicely filled in - my skin is soft - a product I will use forever as it has proven itself to me!</li>
            <li> I have noticed this product tends to separate.  It is disappointing to have a product that comes out as water. I feel I am loosing half of the ingredients in my sink instead of my face. Love yonka just not this product</li>
            <li> Used this moisturizer a few years ago.  Doesn&#x27;t seem the same.  Not as moisturizing as before.  They must have changed the formula, I am very disappointed with this product</li>
    </ol>
