            <li>It makes my hair beautiful and it also smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li>If you want something for the day, I would recommend Moroccan oil or Aveda&#x27;s Brilliant Emollient Finishing Gloss (which is also an oil).</li>
            <li>This also works great if you combine it with Nourish &amp; Shine.</li>
            <li>This product smells great; however, didn&#x27;t provide great shine to my hair which is relaxed.  </li>
            <li>It does not make my hair oily, it has a lemon scent that smells great.</li>

            <li>I LOVE this!!</li>
            <li>It also keeps moisture in, has a great smell, and leaves a good shine/sheen to the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Jane Carter for a couple years now &amp; this is really great for adding shine and adding a great refreshing scent to hair.</li>
            <li>Now that I have been using thicker oils instead, I realize what a good product this serum is.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with Jane&#x27;s scalp serum.</li>

            <li>BUT my boyfriend really liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I think the thing I like most about this product is that it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>Helps reduce breakage very well....and smells great!  </li>
            <li>This product has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>The serum sure does smell nice, but the consistancy is like water.</li>
            <li>The thing I like best is the fact it is all natural and the smell.</li>
            <li>It smells good and helps smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>Works really great, nongreasy, but very strong citrusy smell at first.</li>
            <li>The improvement was not temporary or superficial (as is the result with most hair care products).</li>
            <li>or more correctly I RETAINED my hair growth (you don&#x27;t use it on the scalp</li>
            <li>I do not recommend using this product more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I felt like this worked better to prevent split ends.</li>
            <li>makes your hair look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my scalp feel.</li>
            <li>I love it and love the smell.  </li>
            <li>It shines and makes my hair appear more healthy.</li>
            <li>I have Bought it for many times.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love natrual products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if this stuff works and for the price, I should be able to tell.  </li>
            <li>Great product love it and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My hair likes this product I also love the smell and others keep trying to take this from me because they too enjoy this product get it</li>
            <li>have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I have 4b pressed hair and it drank it up without weighing it down and had shine, bounce and great smell!  </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and could never use any silicone or frizzies product.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and use this product twice a week.</li>
            <li>As far as everything else- this product is VERY lightweight and it gave my hair incredible shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I needed to spend 25.00 to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>If you really want this to workits best, use it regularly.   </li>
            <li>My hair has been in great condition for a long time now, and this is part of my at home regimen.</li>
            <li>and he thought it smelled lemony and clean.</li>
            <li>Since using it I&#x27;ve had a lot less breakage and my hair has greatly improved elasticity.</li>
            <li>The scent is really strong and can be overpowering if you use too much.</li>
            <li>but the lemony smell is so strong you really cant wear this during the day.</li>
            <li>I only need 2 or 3 drops and my hair is shiny, smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is DEFINITELY WORTH</li>
            <li>I would say its worth it if you were looking for something on the cheaper end to put in your hair at night and wash out in the morning.</li>
            <li>I use this product on my hair about once every other week thats how good it is.</li>
            <li>She figured that it works on someone who is newly bald and not on Mr. Clean.</li>
            <li>I have been supplementing with another oil, therefore not using this as consistently.</li>
            <li>When I used this before (and noticed much better results), this was just about the only product I used on my hair besides shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>to use only 1-2 drops as more will cause the hair to feel oily.</li>
            <li>I use this daily on my hair and love  this product.</li>
            <li>The overall smell of this serum is a blend of citrus and strong florals.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light, never weighs my hair down whatsoever and it is light and floral.</li>
            <li>The floral notes are much lighter..  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t pick up as much of the floral notes as I did</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>Also, I realized that during the time when I was using this serum my hair did GROW much faster-</li>
            <li>When my hair was much healthier (pre-highlights)</li>
            <li>This really helped then.   </li>
            <li>If your hair is really damaged-</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Althouh I paid over $20 at Whole Foods....</li>
            <li>Great marketing, poor results.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li>Really, don&#x27;t see the purpose of this product.  </li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing for my hair breakage.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t necessarily offensive, but its super strong and you would not want to be out in public like that.</li>
            <li>I found no benefit to my hair (other than the lovely smell) and I have been using it for around 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>This will really help if your hair is dry, minimally chemically treated, and in decent to good condition.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh the hair down like most hair oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Although more expensive, they smell amazing and last forever.</li>
            <li>In the month or two that I used this serum the condition of my normally frizzy, baby-fine, damaged, and</li>
            <li>Bought a third bottle, noticed didn&#x27;t smell strong, looked at the ingredients, and they removed geranium essential oil!</li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I am a white woman, and it works really well for me--although I think that originally it was made for Black women.</li>
            <li>This product is weightless so my hair doesnt feel heavy after application and my hair is &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I was having to get frequent trims (every 3 weeks) to keep my hair at shoulder length.   </li>
            <li>The smell is satisfactory and is not a heavy oil.  </li>
            <li>It has NO DIMETHICONE or silicone (which, according to some, are bad for hair and defeating the purpose of healthy hair if used regularly) like many serums for shine and moisture.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product is a bit strong, but a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li>I am still transitioning to natural hair and need all the help I can get to bring some life back to these strands.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never broken any other bottles in my bathroom- ever.)</li>
            <li>~ Now that I want longer hair (and highlights have recked my hair so that I won&#x27;t be retaining much growth) I am putting away my other oils and going to get another bottle of this</li>

            <li> minus the overgreased factor.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I did keratin smoothing treatments (every 2-3 months) and traditional relaxers (a few times a year).</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In other words- CONSISTENCY HELPS.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I thought that it was due to stress.  </li>
            <li> By doing what it claims (and what I believe it did) and penetrating the hair cortex, it moisturized my hair without weighing it down, banished fly-aways, and prevented split ends and breakage.    </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have course black hair and have found that adding oils has made it shiny and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> my hair is not a full 2\\&quot; longer.</li>
            <li> This little bottle packs a punch.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This nourishing serum was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Now it is FRAGRANT- not strong.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> Also: this is not a magic bullet for split ends.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product has help my hair</li>
            <li> not sure if I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I am still getting a lot of split ends, despite this product, because split ends are just what happen when your hair is unhealthy.</li>
            <li> you want be sorry.</li>
            <li> It is very thin glass.</li>
            <li> Although the smell is stronger than I would like, it is not as bad as one reviewer wrote and it does not smell like a cleaning product.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to smell like anything else you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I happen to hate the smell of geranium oil.</li>
            <li> If you can handle the smell (which isnt horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair stylist suggested that I should use this product to prevent the massive shedding that was happening to my hair. This product is weightless so my hair doesnt feel heavy after application and my hair is &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; and smooth. The only problem I have is the smell. I cant help but feel like my head smells like lemon pledge. I will use up the product because I paid for it but will not order another. If you can handle the smell (which isnt horrible but I prefer that my hair not smell like orange and lemon), then purchase the product.</li>
            <li> 10/19/11* Bought a third bottle, noticed didn&#x27;t smell strong, looked at the ingredients, and they removed geranium essential oil! They replaced with grapefruit. Now it is FRAGRANT- not strong. The floral notes are much lighter..  ~May no longer apply:  Although the smell is stronger than I would like, it is not as bad as one reviewer wrote and it does not smell like a cleaning product. It is almost entirely essential oils and essential oils have a strong smell. One of the ingredients is geranium oil and I happen to hate the smell of geranium oil. The overall smell of this serum is a blend of citrus and strong florals.  BUT my boyfriend really liked the smell. He didn&#x27;t pick up as much of the floral notes as I did and he thought it smelled lemony and clean. The smell does dissipate after a while.~    As far as everything else- this product is VERY lightweight and it gave my hair incredible shine. It absorbs very well. My hair drank this stuff up.  It has NO DIMETHICONE or silicone (which, according to some, are bad for hair and defeating the purpose of healthy hair if used regularly) like many serums for shine and moisture. In the month or two that I used this serum the condition of my normally frizzy, baby-fine, damaged, and dry hair improved. The improvement was not temporary or superficial (as is the result with most hair care products). By doing what it claims (and what I believe it did) and penetrating the hair cortex, it moisturized my hair without weighing it down, banished fly-aways, and prevented split ends and breakage.    Now that I have been using thicker oils instead, I realize what a good product this serum is. It makes all the difference in the moisture of the hair- minus the overgreased factor. Just apply it to the ends if you are concerned about getting too greased up.     *UPDATE*  *Be careful with the bottle. Mine broke when I dropped it on my bathroom floor. It is very thin glass. (I&#x27;ve never broken any other bottles in my bathroom- ever.)*   Also, I realized that during the time when I was using this serum my hair did GROW much faster- or more correctly I RETAINED my hair growth (you don&#x27;t use it on the scalp, it&#x27;s not rogaine- it&#x27;s for moisture). My hair was thicker and I was having to get frequent trims (every 3 weeks) to keep my hair at shoulder length.   This is a product that is very different from thicker oils. There is no comparison. This product is DEFINITELY WORTH A TRY if you are trying to grow your hair and have damage/dryness (or if you just have damage/dryness).   ~ Now that I want longer hair (and highlights have recked my hair so that I won&#x27;t be retaining much growth) I am putting away my other oils and going to get another bottle of this stuff.~  1/2/12  Yet another update:  I do not recommend using this product more than once a day. It will make your hair greasy, although your hair will absorb the excess in about a day. I recommend using it only at night, only on the ends of your hair. You won&#x27;t feel like you smell like lemons/grapefruit when you leave the house, and you won&#x27;t overdo it and get flat, greasy hair.   Also: this is not a magic bullet for split ends. When my hair was much healthier (pre-highlights) I felt like this worked better to prevent split ends. I am still getting a lot of split ends, despite this product, because split ends are just what happen when your hair is unhealthy. Pre-highlights I did keratin smoothing treatments (every 2-3 months) and traditional relaxers (a few times a year). This really helped then.   Regarding retaining growth: My hair is growing but I am still having trouble retaining the length. I have 2 inch \\&quot;roots\\&quot; showing but my hair is not a full 2\\&quot; longer. I have been supplementing with another oil, therefore not using this as consistently. When I used this before (and noticed much better results), this was just about the only product I used on my hair besides shampoo and conditioner. In other words- CONSISTENCY HELPS. If you really want this to workits best, use it regularly.   THE POINT: This will really help if your hair is dry, minimally chemically treated, and in decent to good condition. If your hair is really damaged- this product may not save you- but it&#x27;s likely that nothing but time and trims will.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!! and it smells heavenly!! makes your hair look and feel healthy. it is a must have in my opinion! Love it</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product! Since using it I&#x27;ve had a lot less breakage and my hair has greatly improved elasticity. The scent is really strong and can be overpowering if you use too much. Definitely stick to the one or two suggested drops. They go a long, long way. This also works great if you combine it with Nourish &amp; Shine. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is a bit strong, but a little goes a very long way.  I used just two drops with the Nourish n&#x27; shine and noticed a big difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my scalp feel.</li>
            <li> Althouh I paid over $20 at Whole Foods....I love it and love the smell.  I have 4b pressed hair and it drank it up without weighing it down and had shine, bounce and great smell!  I will by it from Amazon from now on!</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and could never use any silicone or frizzies product. This stuff is awesome, it&#x27;s light, never weighs my hair down whatsoever and it is light and floral. I only need 2 or 3 drops and my hair is shiny, smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This product smells great; however, didn&#x27;t provide great shine to my hair which is relaxed.  I have been very pleased with Jane&#x27;s scalp serum.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair about once every other week thats how good it is. It shines and makes my hair appear more healthy. It does not make my hair oily, it has a lemon scent that smells great. I learned about this product after a beautician used it on my hair and i&#x27;ve been using it every sense.</li>
            <li> This serum works well on wet hair or dry. It also keeps moisture in, has a great smell, and leaves a good shine/sheen to the hair.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The serum sure does smell nice, but the consistancy is like water. I found no benefit to my hair (other than the lovely smell) and I have been using it for around 2-3 months. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Great marketing, poor results. I will NOT be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This little bottle packs a punch. The thing I like best is the fact it is all natural and the smell. It brightens up my mornings when I use it. I have also noticed a texture difference on my ends by the second day of use.</li>
            <li> This product has a very strong smell. It smells like a lemon cleaning product.  Gross!!  I stopped using it because my hair smelled like cleaning products and everyone could smell it whenever i went anywhere</li>
            <li> I think the thing I like most about this product is that it smells really good.  Other than that, it&#x27;s eh.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  i use it everyday and my hair is soft and shiny.  the difference before the use of this product is like night and day.</li>
            <li> My hair likes this product I also love the smell and others keep trying to take this from me because they too enjoy this product get it you want be sorry.</li>
            <li> My hair fell out while I was in Kandahar, Afghanistan.  My wife thought that it was due to old age.  I thought that it was due to stress.  My wife used this solution and it grew back by 90%.  She figured that it works on someone who is newly bald and not on Mr. Clean.</li>
            <li> I have Bought it for many times. Helpful for hair. Not feel oil after apply the product. Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and use this product twice a week. It does not weigh the hair down like most hair oil.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product has help my hair I really don&#x27;t see a difference I doubt if I will order again.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce breakage very well....and smells great!  I keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> When you mix this with Jane Carter Nourish and Shine it works wonders for your hair, especially for dryness. My hair pattern is 4C</li>
            <li> It makes my hair beautiful and it also smells wonderful!  I highly recommend it.  I am a white woman, and it works really well for me--although I think that originally it was made for Black women.</li>
            <li> Really, don&#x27;t see the purpose of this product.  Does absolutely nothing for my hair breakage.  This nourishing serum was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product love it and super fast shipping. Will shop here again</li>
            <li> I always purchase this hair serum.  It&#x27;s light and I just apply it to the ends of my hair and along the hairline.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this serum because I believe it works.  My hair has been in great condition for a long time now, and this is part of my at home regimen.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a week.  I love the smell.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  It is packed with esstional oils which is great. I love natrual products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I needed to spend 25.00 to get free shipping. What a waste of my hard earned money.  Directions states couple of drops but I don&#x27;t see how that would work on various hair lengths.  My hair is appox six to seven inches in length so I use about ten drops but I don&#x27;t see benefits</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this stuff works and for the price, I should be able to tell.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this Hair Nourishing Serum because essential oils are supposed to help with stimulating hair growth.  I just use it on my edges.  The smell is satisfactory and is not a heavy oil.  I have seen some results, but I also alternate this oil with lavender and pomegranate.</li>
            <li> I havent used this product for long but I can see a healthier difference in my hair. I am still transitioning to natural hair and need all the help I can get to bring some life back to these strands. It is a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. The smell is not quite what I was expecting either, since the grapefruit is so concentrated it almost smells like urine....not sure if I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I&#x27;ve only been using  this product for less than a week and already notice an improved in my hair.  I follow her instructions as she suggested on her demo video(janecartersolutions.com)--- to use only 1-2 drops as more will cause the hair to feel oily.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my hair and love  this product. It smells good and helps smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jane Carter for a couple years now &amp; this is really great for adding shine and adding a great refreshing scent to hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have course black hair and have found that adding oils has made it shiny and less frizzy. This product does that but the lemony smell is so strong you really cant wear this during the day. The smell isn&#x27;t necessarily offensive, but its super strong and you would not want to be out in public like that. I would say its worth it if you were looking for something on the cheaper end to put in your hair at night and wash out in the morning. If you want something for the day, I would recommend Moroccan oil or Aveda&#x27;s Brilliant Emollient Finishing Gloss (which is also an oil). Although more expensive, they smell amazing and last forever.</li>
            <li> Works really great, nongreasy, but very strong citrusy smell at first. If you want your hair to smell like anything else you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
