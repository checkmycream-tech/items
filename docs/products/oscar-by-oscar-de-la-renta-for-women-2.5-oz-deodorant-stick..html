            <li>Not bad, but it smells like a camphor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a fragrance that I love combined with a deodorant stick that keeps the underarm dry.</li>
            <li>It smells so clean and fresh and those brown arm pit stains.....</li>
            <li>BUT I powered through, and it smells completely different and AMAZING on.</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This is an ok deodorant but smells like old lady.</li>
            <li>This product is surprisingly effect as well a nice touch when layering the fragrance with the other products of the same scent.</li>
            <li>Received it right away that was definetely a plus</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>Was weary on the $4 price for this deodorant as my deodorant for gucci and the similar cost $30+, but my mom seems to like them and when I opened them they smelled pretty nice.</li>

            <li> Initially, this smelled like an old lady when I opened the deodorant</li>
            <li> To me, it is better than the regular Secret, Dove, etc...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn this particular perfume before, so I&#x27;m not sure how similar the deodorant is.  </li>
            <li> Secret and all the other deodorant&#x27;s available at the grocery store/CVS didn&#x27;t work that well by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It works all day long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got one that has been sitting for a long time, or</li>
            <li> Also stick was dry and crumbly.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have a hard time finding it when I need a new one.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t interfere with any cologne you may wear and it keeps you dry!  </li>
            <li> Although it is a little pricey, it does last a lot longer than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s rough as Lava bar soap.</li>
            <li> fragrance is not much like the perfume.</li>
            <li> Also it produced the results that I expected from a deodorant.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I have shopped many times on amazon and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just a little of each.  </li>
            <li> The stick itself is not &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but it goes on as if the stick is dried out (stale), too old for use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> i just wish it will last a long time so that i won&#x27;t have to pay another crazy shipping fee all over again.</li>
            <li> In fact it has very little fragrance at all and within a few minutes there is no fragrance at all (or at least this is what is happening with the stick</li>
            <li> I truly dislike the late round container as they have changed the formula.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is hard as a brick.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this deodorant. It works all day long. I&#x27;ve had this deodorant over  6 months and I&#x27;m still using it. You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Did not keep me dry and scent was a tad overwhelming. Also stick was dry and crumbly. Will be going back to Donna Karan Cashmere Mist Antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Excellent, i have been using this deodorant for over 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;Got it for a great price with amazon.</li>
            <li> Just like one would buy in the department stores</li>
            <li> The smell is so bad. It reminds my of old ladies and old age homes.</li>
            <li> Only DO I use, love it. Smells good and can be used with sensitive skin where most store brands irritate.</li>
            <li> Latest delivery of deodorant, not satisfactory. Just opened and it&#x27;s rough as Lava bar soap. No creamy texture. Tried shaving top but no change.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it protects even in the hot Texas summers.</li>
            <li> Wonderful except it stains.</li>
            <li> Smell good..got it for my wife and she loves it. Good thing was it qualifies for prime..,! Came very fast and would get this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Love it.  This is my second order and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a fragrance that I love combined with a deodorant stick that keeps the underarm dry. I will always use this brand for further purchases.</li>
            <li> Was weary on the $4 price for this deodorant as my deodorant for gucci and the similar cost $30+, but my mom seems to like them and when I opened them they smelled pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. My wife love it</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, great product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star!..horrible smell! Smells like cheap old lady perfume. I smelled it when it arrived, didn&#x27;t like smell but thought mayb will b better when I put on, omg no, overwhelming Stronger smell of cheap old lady perfume!!  I threw in garbage!! Usually reading others reviews on here, I&#x27;ve been good buying, but this time there was good reviews, and omg it stinks!!</li>
            <li> I recomend this product to everyone. I have usedthis product for twenty years. I switch once in awhile to another. You cannot find this product anywhere for this price. It is exactly the same as your fine department stores. It will last forever. THE BEST</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful, overbearing scent. Would not recommend for women.&lt;br /&gt;Why does my review have to be any longer? The above is all i have to say.</li>
            <li> If you like Oscar fragrance you&#x27;ll probably like the deodorant. I used it a long long time ago and am happy to be able to get it again at a good price. It works well and smells beautiful!</li>
            <li> Initially, this smelled like an old lady when I opened the deodorant and I feared I had made a really silly $20 deodorant mistake…. BUT I powered through, and it smells completely different and AMAZING on. I love this now and can&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a wonderful calming scent provides great all day protection doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes,goes on easy not dry I have worn this from as early as 6AM until 5Pm and still had great protection .I will see this summer how well it holds up in the heat and humidity so far I really like it and hope it performs just as well this summer.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used. Highly recommend. I had bought 3 of them.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! I have used all of Oscar De La Renta since 1980 I have tried to change but always go back I  worked in cosmetic&#x27;s Dept. for 20 years &amp; Oscar is still the best. I get so many compliments even after 23 years.</li>
            <li> Greatest deodorant combining an anti-perspirant in one formula. I have used it for years. Very hard to find</li>
            <li> Great Scent, buying again</li>
            <li> It smells awesome. Fast delivery and I bought 3. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is surprisingly effect as well a nice touch when layering the fragrance with the other products of the same scent.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, smells great, lasts all day.  This is better than my RX I have! Completely Excellent product.  A!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I truly dislike the late round container as they have changed the formula.  I smell worse than a man.  I loved the oval and used it for 40 years.  What happened?</li>
            <li> Have been using this product since it arrived on the market and will not use anything else.  It has a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the Oscar De La Renta fragrance, first of all.......so, the fragrance compliments my cologne/perfume. I have difficulty finding an antiperspirant/deodorant that truly works, this one does the job! No wetness, a light fragrance, and no perspiration! I cannot beat a deal like that! The price is also great.</li>
            <li> this is a very reliable deorderant it smells great also all day with great protectionI would definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> My GF loved it... She ordered some two more :)</li>
            <li> I have worn Oscar for years.  I bought this because I thought it would be great to have Oscar deodorant.  This is for the layered days when you layer your scent . . . deodorant, powder, lotion, and cologne.  Just a little of each.  This stuff is hard as a brick.  Well, not quite but you get the idea.  Does not go on smooth at all.  I don&#x27;t know if I got one that has been sitting for a long time, or what.  I still use it but I can&#x27;t lie - the stuff is hard.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong for me...</li>
            <li> Have use this product for years and would not change.  Not only is this deoderant wonderful it does not stain clothing as cheaper ones do.</li>
            <li> I KEEP BUYING THIS DEODORANT OVER AND OVER. HAVENT USE ANOTHER ONE SINCE I GOT THIS 3 YEARS AGO! IT DOES THE JOB, SMELLS SOO NICE AND CLEAN AND ALSO, HAS CLEAN MY SKIN SOMEHOW, LOVE IT! I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the scent!</li>
            <li> Not bad, but it smells like a camphor.</li>
            <li> A delightful fragrance.  The Oscar de la Renta Antiperspirant Stick for Women surprisingly works.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Grest items n fast shipping</li>
            <li> smells good and last a long time</li>
            <li> did not like the smell and don&#x27;t recommend it for hot weather. Received it right away that was definetely a plus</li>
            <li> got my Oscar deodorant today love it go&#x27;s on smooth smell really good love it&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product since the 80&#x27;s but haven&#x27;t bought any in 10 years still smell as good as the first day I used it</li>
            <li> It does not go on well. The stick itself is not &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but it goes on as if the stick is dried out (stale), too old for use.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not much like the perfume. In fact it has very little fragrance at all and within a few minutes there is no fragrance at all (or at least this is what is happening with the stick I bought).&lt;br /&gt;If Oscar should make this into a roll on or spray I will try it, but the stick NEVER again.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not only does this work well, it smells great and is so gentle on your skin.  I have bought four and used four of this product and would recommend to all women.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and it is by far the most effective. I try others from time to time just to see if I can reduce this expense but I always come back. Although it is a little pricey, it does last a lot longer than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant!  Works all day and smells like perfume.  I&#x27;ve never worn this particular perfume before, so I&#x27;m not sure how similar the deodorant is.  Bought this particular one on amazon because it was basically the only one I could find.  Living in the Florida heat and working in outside sales; I&#x27;m in and out of the heat and a/c all day.  Secret and all the other deodorant&#x27;s available at the grocery store/CVS didn&#x27;t work that well by the end of the day.  This one still smells great at 9pm!</li>
            <li> Wow!  It smells so nice</li>
            <li> love love this deodorant  for many years fast delivery!</li>
            <li> S nice to have a deodorant not conflict with my perfume.  This is just perfect, not too overpowering and it works too!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great!  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with any cologne you may wear and it keeps you dry!  It also doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes and in Arizona with temperatures in the 100&#x27;s, it&#x27;s definitely needed!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant.  It&#x27;s nice.  Not too greasy.  Light.  No caking.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will stay with it for a while.  To me, it is better than the regular Secret, Dove, etc...</li>
            <li> I spend a little more than on a store brand but it lasts much longer and smellsike my perfume-Oscar of course! I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Oh what a great find!!! I have a nose that I call a &amp;#34;super smelly&amp;#34; and I can smell everything a mile away. Was looking for the best deodorant forever. Never tried the classic Oscar perfume but was pleasantly suprised with the smell and how well it held up in California heat. Bought it in June and it January now and I still have 1/4 of it left and that&#x27;s with daily use!!!!. Yes, it is pricier but you do safe  money in a long run. Does leave a bit of white marks on darker clothes but rub it together and let it &amp;#34;set in&amp;#34; for about 10 minutes before putting clothes on. Good luck!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have loved the Oscar De La Renta scent since it come out. The deodorant has a quieter &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34;. Like it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even know that they made this!!  :-)</li>
            <li> This is probably the most expensive deodorant i&#x27;ve ever had. And its not because of its own price, more so because of the shipping. It costs only almost $10 but the shipping was $39. However, since i cant find anything like this in our country, i thought, what the hell. When it was delivered, i had to pay another $14 to the delivery guy. Because its DHL. But whatever, the smell is divine. It smells like perfume. My sister has a sensitive nose and often times, she could smell and identify every kind of deodorant anyone has... she could tell if its Secret or Nivea... but this one... and she finds it unhygienic. But this one, she says it&#x27;s like perfume. She said she&#x27;d have a hard time guessing that its deodorant she&#x27;s smelling after all. The scent is lovely... i just wish it will last a long time so that i won&#x27;t have to pay another crazy shipping fee all over again.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even have a faint smell of Oscar De La Renta, just glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell, smells like my grandmother...</li>
            <li> Too strong. I usually love to wear Oscar but this deodorant scent is overpowering.</li>
            <li> Estoy feliz! Hac&amp;iacute;a algunos a&amp;ntilde;os buscaba esta fragancia y la consegu&amp;iacute; no solo en perfume sino tambi&amp;eacute;n en desodorante. Doble sorpresa. Y todo a tirmpo y a un excelente precio.&lt;br /&gt;Ddelidddddi</li>
            <li> love every think about it</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I had used it before, and liked the fragrance .  Also it produced the results that I expected from a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant stick for years.  Sometimes I have a hard time finding it when I need a new one.  The order arrived in a timely fashion and I am delighted with the supplier and the product!</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a nice fragrance and is very effective in controlling odor.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheap alternative to Donna Karan&#x27;s Cashmere Mist deodorant. This is an ok deodorant but smells like old lady.</li>
            <li> Perfume just fine!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been usung this deodorant for years. The sales women at the time told me to try it and promised I would&#x27;nt be disappointed. She was right. It smells so clean and fresh and those brown arm pit stains.....don&#x27;t exist..&lt;br /&gt;I have shopped many times on amazon and have never been disappointed. Thanks Amazon!</li>
