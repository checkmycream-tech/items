            <li>bottom horizontal portion is 19.5&amp;#34;W x 30&amp;#34;L (where it&#x27;s touching</li>
            <li>Look around for a more reliable shipper.</li>
            <li>I would be very happy to do business with this seller in the future.</li>
            <li>Most of the time i can sleep without this pillow</li>
            <li>But this did not help at bedtime and that is where I spend most hours.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife cause she was in lots of pain and seeing the Chiropractor about once a month sometimes more.  </li>
            <li>Just love it............</li>
            <li>Ordered this to help with my back pain and it works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok so so better than nothing.</li>
            <li>It is a better grade of foam than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I needed to sleep with my legs up and most of the wedges were 8 inches</li>
            <li>glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So $74.74 plus $24.52 is $99.26 for that price I have looked around and the quality of pillow that I have found is a lot better.</li>
            <li>So before you put this pillow in your cart just look around, you will find something a lot better.</li>
            <li>The overall comfort is wonderful...</li>
            <li>, most covers have smooth edges.</li>
            <li>Cover comes off easily for washing.</li>
            <li>and is easy to sleep with through the night.</li>
            <li>but this worked fine.</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;8 with a 32\\&quot; inseam and my legs fit fine on this.</li>
            <li>Because of it being so comfortable I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is firm and angled perfectly at the knee area.</li>
            <li>I got this for her to be comfortable and well-supported  as she kept her legs elevated.  </li>
            <li>Great for anyone with leg or back problems.  </li>
            <li>80% pain relief is sure worth it.</li>
            <li>This wedge is quite high, and excellent if you need to have your legs lifted from the bed, or if you need a &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; bolster for a massage client, or a massage client who will also need work on their feet, and your table is set low.  </li>
            <li>Neither one provided the correct height, the proper angle or the support I needed for a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome pillow if you have a low back injury and need to relieve the pressure while you sleep.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick easy ordering and shipping.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will, very rare nowadays.</li>
            <li>The first 2 wedges now have been claimed by the cats!</li>
            <li>this Hermell Products FW4020 Elevating Leg Rest&#x27;s cover is made of soft material, the foam is solid and very comfortable!!</li>
            <li>This was much better than a soft booster I purchased from Linen &amp; Things, and then returning it.&lt;br /&gt;The 10\\</li>
            <li>My butt lays on the bed right where the pillow starts and</li>
            <li>my knee bend goes right at the angle in the pillow.</li>
            <li>this one is just the right height for this tall</li>
            <li>they couldn&#x27;t even get that right.</li>
            <li>However, the shipping charges seemed to be extreemly high for the light weight being shipped.</li>
            <li>It makes positioning while sleeping very comfortable, decreases pressure to my lower back and opens up my chest relaxing my shoulders.</li>
            <li>It was definitely so much better than piling pillows to attain  proper elevation.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it is designed to do.  </li>
            <li>My one problem is I&#x27;d like to be able to order extra pillowcases for it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunate, as the size and shape are perfect.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed and well worth your money</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a big person, you&#x27;ll find your legs slip off pretty easy.</li>
            <li>love this pillow, I&#x27;m going to have it for a very long time.</li>
            <li>but I certainly did not.</li>
            <li>Used one of these for my TKR recovery, add some ice and really helpful.</li>
            <li>but it costs too much money.</li>
            <li>It is very firm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very practical but, for me, it&#x27;s a bit high</li>
            <li>I really like my new leg elevator.</li>
            <li>The foam is very stiff so no worry of sagging and the removable cover is nice so it can be washed.</li>
            <li>&quot; High at Amazon,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this bolster.  </li>
            <li>The other thing that surprised me was the UPS driver wanted $24.52 more because I live in Toronto.</li>
            <li>Elevator is solid and stays pretty much where you put it if you don&#x27;t move around alot.</li>
            <li>This was wide enough so my legs didn&#x27;t slip off and light enough to reposition easily.</li>
            <li>provided the right angle for my legs to be positioned above my heart, supported my thighs and legs (no drop offs at the ankle!)</li>
            <li>I first used it at my physical therapist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>My back pain due to Sciatica is now a lot better.</li>
            <li>and it is large enough to prop up both my legs together.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is the cover is made with really slippery fabricate.  </li>
            <li>had developed edema and this booster, along with water piles cured the temporary condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With this one you can either put your legs on the incline and take some of the pressure off your lower back, or, because it&#x27;s tall, turn it around and put your legs up at a right angle and take all of the pressure off your lower back.</li>
            <li>so I returned it  2 or 3 days later after obtaining the return authorization from the seller, Soymedical, and paid $40.06 for returning it back,  Amazon reimbursed me $40.06 for the shipping fees,  but the Soymedical ONLY refunded me the $60 rather than $94, which is what I paid for originally.    </li>
            <li>I have always been able to relieve my back pain, due to a compressed nerve in lower back, by lying on floor and placing legs on chair.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you have back or leg pain.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this leg elevator as a key to treatment for edema</li>
            <li>if  there is no other alternative&lt;br /&gt;Then  </li>
            <li>Due to a logging accident I have a fractured right leg and a crushed left leg.</li>

            <li> if  there is no other alternative&lt;br /&gt;Then  </li>
            <li> Due to a logging accident I have a fractured right leg and a crushed left leg.</li>
            <li> It also helped my back stay flat.</li>
            <li> A little high</li>
            <li> Works well and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It should last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I finally caved and decided to get an actual leg pillow, since it&#x27;s something I use everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s a dark almost navy blue</li>
            <li> It cleans easily, is very firm (but not absolutely rigid) and is wide enough to have both legs on it to lessen the strain on the back.  </li>
            <li> They feel so much better  and aren&#x27;t painful anymore</li>
            <li> but when my back starts giving me trouble i need something to relieve the pain</li>
            <li> Had to use two, and then they were too wide.</li>
            <li> A few months later, my mother-in-law (her daughter) hurt her ankle and she used this as well.  </li>
            <li> the material is quite firm and 2 years later is still holding up well.</li>
            <li> Elevating Leg Rest for ONLY $43 less than the half price of Leg Elevator at 10\\</li>
            <li> I needed this product for my swollen foot due to humidity and my MS.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other wedges that sink and don&#x27;t support your legs.</li>
            <li> or less-</li>
            <li> Soymedical has a poor customer service as well, I called them 888-336-2624 at their regular business hour</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using the Leg Elevator, while sleeping at night, the swelling has subsided and the medication has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I find the pillow to firm.</li>
            <li> This wedge is foam and firm.  </li>

            <li> Due to a logging accident I have a fractured right leg and a crushed left leg. I have to keep both elevated as much as possible. This &amp;#34;wedge&amp;#34; works perfect in bed as well as on the recliner.</li>
            <li> I have lymphedema in my legs and have been using stacked piles of pillows to elevate them for the fast few years. I finally caved and decided to get an actual leg pillow, since it&#x27;s something I use everyday. This pillow does exactly what I need and is just great! Here&#x27;s some things about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a dark almost navy blue&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s very firm, so holds its shape well.&lt;br /&gt;-The slanted portion is 19.5&amp;#34;W x 14&amp;#34;L (where you thighs go)&lt;br /&gt;-The top horizontal portion is 19.5&amp;#34;W x 21.5&amp;#34;L (where your calves/feet go)&lt;br /&gt;-The bottom horizontal portion is 19.5&amp;#34;W x 30&amp;#34;L (where it&#x27;s touching the bed)&lt;br /&gt;-It is 10&amp;#34; tall&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and it fits me great. My butt lays on the bed right where the pillow starts and my knee bend goes right at the angle in the pillow. My feet don&#x27;t hang off the end.&lt;br /&gt;-To help keep it from sliding around on the bed I actually put it under the fitted sheet, so the sheet keeps it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this pillow, I&#x27;m going to have it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this Leg Elevator at 10\\&quot; High at Amazon, after I received it, found out that the cover is made of poor quality of material, very hard and rough and uncomfortable when touch it by the skin. so I returned it  2 or 3 days later after obtaining the return authorization from the seller, Soymedical, and paid $40.06 for returning it back,  Amazon reimbursed me $40.06 for the shipping fees,  but the Soymedical ONLY refunded me the $60 rather than $94, which is what I paid for originally.    DON&#x27;T ever buy this poor quality leg elevator!! It is very uncomfortable to leg! It is made of poor quality of material for the cover, a mkind of nylon material! Soymedical has a poor customer service as well, I called them 888-336-2624 at their regular business hour, it&#x27;s all the voice recording from the answering machine, no one has ever answered my call!    I bought Hermell Products FW4020 Elevating Leg Rest for ONLY $43 less than the half price of Leg Elevator at 10\\&quot; High at Amazon, this Hermell Products FW4020 Elevating Leg Rest&#x27;s cover is made of soft material, the foam is solid and very comfortable!!</li>
            <li> This purchase was for a terminal cancer patient with extreemly swollen legs, ankles and feet.  The condition was not improving with medication.  After a few weeks of using the Leg Elevator, while sleeping at night, the swelling has subsided and the medication has been discontinued.  We are very pleased with the purchase.  However, the shipping charges seemed to be extreemly high for the light weight being shipped.</li>
            <li> This was wide enough so my legs didn&#x27;t slip off and light enough to reposition easily. Cover comes off easily for washing.</li>
            <li> The product well made good quality; would have given a 5 rating except for shipping. Slow sevice and very expensive. Probably will not use this company again. Look around for a more reliable shipper.</li>
            <li> This is just what it looks like and works great , I had surgery and this was just what I needed to keep my legs up and it may have helped my back also</li>
            <li> The Leg elevator we bought from Amazon is very good- it stays in place and is so helpful. It has improved my husband&#x27;s leg circulation. He recently had knee replacement surgery in both legs. A stack of pillows hardly worked- the pillows did not stay in place.</li>
            <li> I really like my new leg elevator. It makes positioning while sleeping very comfortable, decreases pressure to my lower back and opens up my chest relaxing my shoulders. I used one during physical therapy and now have one to use at home. Thanks for the quick easy ordering and shipping. I would be very happy to do business with this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that affects my lower back such that I have stiffness and severe pain.  This leg elevator/pillow helps to relieve pressure off my lower back and it is large enough to prop up both my legs together.  I recommend this product for anyone with lower back pain or circulation issues.</li>
            <li> Great product for those in need of foot elevation.  I first used it at my physical therapist&#x27;s office.  Because of it being so comfortable I made this purchase.  It was definitely so much better than piling pillows to attain  proper elevation.  My purpose was to keep blood clots in the leg at bay when sleeping at night, as well as when relaxing during the day.  It is firm and angled perfectly at the knee area.</li>
            <li> This works great and is comfortable.  Elevator is solid and stays pretty much where you put it if you don&#x27;t move around alot. Could use a handle for easier transport, but something could be created.</li>
            <li> I needed this product for my swollen foot due to humidity and my MS.  It worked wonders, I used to use pillows and always had difficulty.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Most of the time i can sleep without this pillow but when my back starts giving me trouble i need something to relieve the pain so i can sleep.  This is an awesome pillow if you have a low back injury and need to relieve the pressure while you sleep.  Good quality and great design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cover. I especially like the rubbered edges, most covers have smooth edges. The rubbered edges helps to keep your phone in your pocket. This cover makes me happy just looking at the daisies. I would recommend this cover to anyone.</li>
            <li> This leg elevator is very firm. It won&#x27;t change shape and it serves its purpose. My back pain due to Sciatica is now a lot better.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is designed to do.  My only issue is the cover is made with really slippery fabricate.  If you&#x27;re a big person, you&#x27;ll find your legs slip off pretty easy.</li>
            <li> much bigger than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve recovered from dislocating my ankle, I still whip this thing out every now and then when I have pain in my legs or back.</li>
            <li> about 2/3 of what the doctor ordered. I am a big man, and my legs lie wider than this foam cushion.  One leg was always falling off. Had to use two, and then they were too wide. Eventually had to order a custom piece.</li>
            <li> I have always been able to relieve my back pain, due to a compressed nerve in lower back, by lying on floor and placing legs on chair.  But this did not help at bedtime and that is where I spend most hours.  The leg elevator gives me the same results in bed.  I am 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and this size was a perfect fit.  Product is well made.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Does exactly what it says it will, very rare nowadays. My one problem is I&#x27;d like to be able to order extra pillowcases for it. Perhaps company will use this review to offer replacement cases!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife cause she was in lots of pain and seeing the Chiropractor about once a month sometimes more.  Since I have been using this item now for the past 6 months I have not had to go see the Chirop. and feel great. No lower back pain and hip pain.  Just love it............ Great investment</li>
            <li> Bought this Leg Elevator to use when I had a broken ankle. Works well and is long lasting. I still use it occasionally two years later.</li>
            <li> very practical but, for me, it&#x27;s a bit high</li>
            <li> I suffer from a severe case of edema in my lower legs that actualy required hospitalization.  Since then I have used this pillow to help with that condition and it has been very comfortable with the perfect firmness and elevation.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to help with my back pain and it works great! A little high but I think the 6\\&quot; would be to low for me. An 8\\&quot; would be perfect(hint,hint to makers) I am 5&#x27;8 with a 32\\&quot; inseam and my legs fit fine on this. I have plenty of room and my feet do not hang off the end, like in the pic. That guy must have 36 or 38\\&quot; legs.  Unfortunately, I am a mover when I sleep, so I start with it and when I wake up it&#x27;s on the floor. The foam is very stiff so no worry of sagging and the removable cover is nice so it can be washed. I would highly recommend this product if you have back or leg pain. I think I will order another for my dad.</li>
            <li> Yep, it&#x27;s a cushion. Not all that complicated. Getting the memory foam is crucial for orthopedic uses. With this one you can either put your legs on the incline and take some of the pressure off your lower back, or, because it&#x27;s tall, turn it around and put your legs up at a right angle and take all of the pressure off your lower back. It&#x27;s just a matter of deciding whether to look partially or completely ridiculous while you&#x27;re lying in bed.</li>
            <li> I found that this cushion did not have any give to it at all, which made it uncomfortable. Unfortunate, as the size and shape are perfect.</li>
            <li> Not only does this help with elevating sore feet and ankles, but you can use this to perform ankle and feet exercises. This is great for anyone recovering from foot and ankle injuries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok so so better than nothing.The bottom line for me is.&#x27;...........&lt;br /&gt;Go check out adjustable bed frames and mattress  if  there is no other alternative&lt;br /&gt;Then  the elevated pillow works  and that is what we want when we need to elevate our  legs&lt;br /&gt;For. Various reasons.  ........ so  it&#x27;s a good buy.hope you enjoy it !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Used one of these for my TKR recovery, add some ice and really helpful. Sleeping on my back was always a problem but this worked fine. Recommended</li>
            <li> I like the leg elevator but it costs too much money. I also had to pay for shipping. It was my decision and if I had a do over I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The leg elevator arrived 2 days before the anticipated date.  It is a better grade of foam than I anticipated.  It should last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This was much better than a soft booster I purchased from Linen &amp; Things, and then returning it.&lt;br /&gt;The 10\\&quot; height was perfect, and the slope was just right.&lt;br /&gt;I had developed edema and this booster, along with water piles cured the temporary condition.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this leg elevator as a key to treatment for edema</li>
            <li> I needed to sleep with my legs up and most of the wedges were 8 inches or less- this one is just the right height for this tall lady- glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I got this last year for my grandmother-in-law when she broke her foot.  She has a two-story home and was restricted to the couch on her bottom floor.  I got this for her to be comfortable and well-supported  as she kept her legs elevated.  She swears this helped her.  A few months later, my mother-in-law (her daughter) hurt her ankle and she used this as well.  It cleans easily, is very firm (but not absolutely rigid) and is wide enough to have both legs on it to lessen the strain on the back.  I&#x27;m very happy I got this.</li>
            <li> When I received this leg elevator I tried it and couldn&#x27;t believe the change in my legs. They feel so much better  and aren&#x27;t painful anymore I had been propping up my legs with couch pillows too nothing seemed to work. At night I  no longer have to prop my legs at a 45 degree angle against the wall.The pillow is a therapy quality pillow. It is very firm.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 14inch and it fits me perfectly. I love it.</li>
            <li> I find the pillow to firm. It cuts off the flow of blood in the back of your legs. The cover is very thin and rough not 100% cotton, for a pillow this price they couldn&#x27;t even get that right. The other thing that surprised me was the UPS driver wanted $24.52 more because I live in Toronto. So $74.74 plus $24.52 is $99.26 for that price I have looked around and the quality of pillow that I have found is a lot better. So before you put this pillow in your cart just look around, you will find something a lot better.</li>
            <li> I suffer with swollen legs/ water retention. This wedge is foam and firm.  Once I got my legs up they stayed in place!  Unlike other wedges that sink and don&#x27;t support your legs. It also helped my back stay flat. Very comfortable! Also comes with a Terry cloth cover that can be removed and washed! PERFECT!</li>
            <li> This wedge is quite high, and excellent if you need to have your legs lifted from the bed, or if you need a &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; bolster for a massage client, or a massage client who will also need work on their feet, and your table is set low.  It will allow the height you need without having to lift the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this bolster.  It is made well.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone with leg or back problems.  My husband sleeps with it and it helps prevent swelling of his ankles.</li>
            <li> Bought this for husband whom suffers from painful feet and swelling.  Since using this pillow he doesn&#x27;t wake up in middle of night with feet pain.  Very well constructed and well worth your money</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my husband because he has quite a few problems with sore feet and legs.  He does like this and will use it when he goes to bed at night or even if he is just laying in bed watching television.  I would purchase again if I needed another one in the future.  the material is quite firm and 2 years later is still holding up well.</li>
            <li> It was a year of morning misery until I found this - which was triggered by getting relief while in an MRI with my legs positioned somewhat like this. Sure makes the bed look weird but 80% pain relief is sure worth it. Great cost/benefit ratio!</li>
            <li> This is the third &amp;#34;wedge&amp;#34; I have purchased over a period of 6 months. The first 2 wedges now have been claimed by the cats! They may like them but I certainly did not. Neither one provided the correct height, the proper angle or the support I needed for a good night&#x27;s sleep.The height of the Leg Elevator wedge was perfect. The overall comfort is wonderful...provided the right angle for my legs to be positioned above my heart, supported my thighs and legs (no drop offs at the ankle!) and is easy to sleep with through the night. Woke up with no swelling, no back pain. THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> This item has been helpful when my husband&#x27;s legs have to be elevated... seems to be well mad and firm.</li>
