            <li> The only bad thing is when I take it out on occasion it tangles in my hair, but other than that the product is amazing!</li>
            <li> That being said, I do use them a lot, about 3- 4 times / week for the last few weeks and they still look brand new.</li>
            <li> They had a slight synthetic smell when I first got them but airing them out overnight and spritzing with a little hairspray solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I will say that when I ordered these, I had doubts about the color I had chosen (chocolate brown to dark blonde) since my hair has the ombre effect</li>
            <li> Just be careful and brush them gently so as not to pull them apart.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe I bought this for approximately $30 (bought 2 of them).</li>
            <li> However, if you want to wear this once in a while when you go out, don&#x27;t buy it, it does not worth the money.</li>
            <li> You can watch some videos on YouTube and found out how to put them in upside down to create up-dos and buns etc.  </li>
            <li> (Obviously all synthetic extensions WILL have a scent, no doubt about it) but it is not a strong repulsive scent (at least for me it wasn&#x27;t, but based upon other reviews i&#x27;ve read about this product, they have said otherwise)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even even tell that they are on the only thin</li>
            <li> Bc when I got it looked very little hair .</li>
            <li> The hair got tangled the next day and smelled really bad.</li>
            <li> It is worse than doll hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this hair piece ...looses shape after I wear it</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t was it look in the picture very dark and had a bad smell.</li>
            <li> In this case, don&#x27;t even pay for this fake Barbie hair.</li>
            <li> Very thin and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m un sadified with this hair piece :(</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!</li>

            <li> Cute I can&#x27;t even even tell that they are on the only thin is that I can&#x27;t give 5 stars is Bc it has a strong plastic smell but It went away after I used Bc I sprayed perfume on me and it caught my smell oh and if you brush it it will appear to have more volume Bc when I got it looked very little hair . And it don&#x27;t shed either it appears very weak but its not if your gentle like you would with your own hair ðŸ’•</li>
            <li> Love it !!!! Would buy again !!! Got many complements !!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this! It is worse than doll hair. Instantly tangled and mangled upon touch. Horrible!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, hair exactly like described, very well made, looks real.</li>
            <li> Looks great! Feels Great!!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this hair piece ...looses shape after I wear it and I could not brush it because it becomes corse and un natural ... Loved the color ! I want my money back ! I&#x27;m un sadified with this hair piece :(</li>
            <li> I really love these clip in extensions.  I bought two of them and wear one lower and one higher up on my head for added volume.  They blend well with my hair and are really quick to put in and take out.  I use them much more often than my other extensions which are a set of 7 or 8 clips of human hair.  These are just more convenient.  They had a slight synthetic smell when I first got them but airing them out overnight and spritzing with a little hairspray solved the problem.

I haven&#x27;t noticed too many of the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; falling out or coming loose but I am pretty gentle with them.  That being said, I do use them a lot, about 3- 4 times / week for the last few weeks and they still look brand new.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t was it look in the picture very dark and had a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Pretty look, but hair felt and smelled like doll hair. Very thin and shiny. Would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The perfect color for my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it for graduation and very dissatisfied. The hair got tangled the next day and smelled really bad. I really can&#x27;t believe I bought this for approximately $30 (bought 2 of them). if you are going to wear it for a special occasion and just for once, I guess it&#x27;d pass. However, if you want to wear this once in a while when you go out, don&#x27;t buy it, it does not worth the money. The synthetic hair i bought which came weeks later was waaaay better and way cheaper. You could find better ones than this one.</li>
            <li> As everyone says, it does have smell of chemicals but I sprayed perfume all over and waited for couple days and now it smells like my perfume :) The quality is okay. If you are someone who will always be wearing them day to day basis, splurge on something better quality, but I am happy with mine since I will only be wearing mine for night outs or something. Also I got 2 of them. One is not enough I think.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my sister for her prom. The ombrÃ© is really nice but it&#x27;s way more blonde than the pic. So if you don&#x27;t want drastic then these aren&#x27;t for you. They felt very soft. They are synthetic and they are cheap but for a fun night out, you can&#x27;t beat the price! I will be buying more for other occasions. Don&#x27;t expect remy extensions and you&#x27;ll be really happy!</li>
            <li> Extensions came in before the estimated arrival date. I will say that when I ordered these, I had doubts about the color I had chosen (chocolate brown to dark blonde) since my hair has the ombre effect but the shades are different. As I took them out of the bag, I was surprised at the amount of hair the wefts contained (I ordered 2 just in case each had minimal strands of hair). Each weft has a definite good amount, have lovely and perfect color shades, and were of soft and silky texture. Since they&#x27;re synthetic, they do have a scent (Obviously all synthetic extensions WILL have a scent, no doubt about it) but it is not a strong repulsive scent (at least for me it wasn&#x27;t, but based upon other reviews i&#x27;ve read about this product, they have said otherwise) (Tip: A wash can help get rid of it). Honestly, for the price I paid, it was a pretty great offer.! I am truly satisfied.</li>
