            <li>I love that it has a dropper.  </li>
            <li>It makes it so much more convenient than trying to pour it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have for many years grown lavender and purchased lavender scented items before.</li>
            <li>To my palate it smells like a cheap laundry detergent, not something that you would want to sweeten the smell of your house or rub on your body or use in any kind of beauty product.</li>
            <li>but I do know I love this smell.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love lavender oil for its many purposes</li>
            <li>but this has so many more uses.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this oil.</li>
            <li>I really love this Lavender Oil.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>there are so many uses for this oil</li>
            <li>and it has many uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more when needed</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, I use it with my moisturizer</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, put a few drops on tissue/paper towel and put by my pillow for a good restful nights sleep.</li>
            <li>I have never used Lavender essentional oil but after trying this out I do truly love it.the calming effect</li>
            <li>Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>Makes getting in bed more satisfying.</li>
            <li>I have a stressful life and was told diffusing lavender would make me sleep better and have a calmer environment.</li>
            <li>Bug repellant and relieves itching better than anything.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out for many more uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dropper did break during shipping, but I&#x27;m still able to use the oil without issue.</li>
            <li>me, lavender is a calming, soothing yet refreshing floral scent.</li>
            <li>I use it in many ways to make bath / body products.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢</li>
            <li>I make lye soap, but you could add it to a glycerin melt &amp; pour soap for a lovely gift.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢</li>
            <li>it will release the Lavender scent even more.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is strong but not overpowering like some of them are, and the eye dropper it comes with makes it so easy to use in a diffuser, in a bath, on your skin, or for making your own homemade oil blend.</li>
            <li>I ordered through a  special deal to try it and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It was very strong and very powerful.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the oil is very light and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>This Lavender oil smells amazing - sweet, herbal, flowery and</li>
            <li>It makes my whole house smell great and the bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li>It sure is a great way to clear up acne spots/marks.</li>
            <li>Very strong in bottle so to get a true scent you should add a drop to wrist or anywhere and then smell.  </li>
            <li>it has a very good scent that last.</li>
            <li>This one smells more like those cheap imitation-lavender scented fragrances.</li>
            <li>Use it at night in a diffuser to help relax myself and my wife to sleep more soundly.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh, feels great on skin, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This is the most fabulous lavender oil I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to use my Lavender oil sparingly because this Best 100% Natural Premium Lavender Oil is a good price for the big 4 oz.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that this oil did perform as I&#x27;d hoped it would for everything that I&#x27;ve used it for thus far.</li>
            <li>Perfect product to use for my soap making and other bath &amp; body</li>
            <li>It is so easy.</li>
            <li>Strong scent to the oil</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like strong odors and this was the answer.</li>
            <li>I am usually pretty forgiving about these things, and I know you get what you pay for, but honestly this product smells like cat pee.</li>
            <li>I previously bought the peppermint oil for my wife when she gets migraines and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is very potent but the dropper which is glasses broke when it shipped other than that it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Lavender Oil from Pure Body Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li>It is a huge bottle with a dropper</li>
            <li>and this is a 4oz bottle which is huge and</li>
            <li>It did smell like a combination of 10year-old cheap soap and chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Great Lavender Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that I can get lavender oil for so much cheaper</li>
            <li>If you enjoy Lavender than this will not disappoint.</li>
            <li>So smooth and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I love this lavender not only does it makes your house smell good but</li>
            <li>It smells really good and the dropper is great!So far I am liking this brand.</li>
            <li>I love that it came with a dropper as it makes getting the right amount of drops into my diffuser.</li>
            <li>This oil also originates from Bulgaria in case your wondering.i love the smell of this brand, I used it right away to refresh my carpet after cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have used lavender for years to help with my migraines, and I think this product will prove very useful.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this oil, it is perfect for almost all your lavender oil needs, and for anyone who would be using it on a very regular basis like I do, the bottle is huge and comes completely full, so it will be sure to last you a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I was definitely excited when I was given the opportunity to review this product for free for testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li>dark bottle is great for keeping the oil fresh, and the dropper is a nice plus that is often not included.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to feel about this when I first opened the bottle.</li>
            <li>so when I was asked to take a sample in return for my review I was excited.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for my aromatherapy diffuser because this helps my son sleep</li>
            <li>Great quality, great price, bigger bottle than expected.</li>
            <li>I love being able to smell lavender all through my house which actually makes me feel more relaxed specially since I&#x27;ve just moved.</li>
            <li>Cuts: put a drop on a cut to stop bleeding clean wound, and kill bacteria.</li>
            <li>The scent is such a pleasant one as well.</li>
            <li>This scent is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered and would again from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li>But I love the fact that it is pure oil and no fillers.</li>
            <li>then I jump right on it!</li>
            <li>I received this Pure Body Naturals Lavender Essential Oil at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but this is 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li>Not only is it high quality, but it is perfect for anyone who is just getting into oils, or who is a seasoned user of them.</li>
            <li>So many products that claim to be lavender donâ€™t have the true scent â€“ but this one really does.</li>
            <li>i put this into my cool mist humidifier</li>
            <li>This oil does not smell like true lavender.</li>
            <li>did receive the product at a reduced price for which I agreed to give my complete and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I wound up falling asleep for 2 hours in the afternoon and it was a really good deep sleep.</li>
            <li>and I feel I sleep a lot better and through the whole night.</li>
            <li>I love lavender oil becasue you can do so much with it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE Lavender oil, I use it for many things, including putting a drop on a homemade wet wash cloth and throwing it in the dryer, using it with a carrier oil on burns and cuts, and even even diffusing it to help bring calmness to my home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will fill your whole bathroom with a lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt; I also use this for my migraines which I suffer from a lot.</li>
            <li>Like the other oils I&#x27;ve received that are this brand, I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality!  </li>
            <li>Super scent that holds for hours.  </li>
            <li>Lavender oil has many uses, but that&#x27;s mainly what I use it for.</li>
            <li>Super floral like a funeral home....</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Potent to say the least and the price for this quantity is great.  </li>
            <li>This particular oil is so versatile which is another reason I love it.</li>
            <li>I love using the lavender oil right before I get ready to go to bed.</li>
            <li>and it worked better than other popular companies.</li>
            <li>does anyone know how to get a new one sent to me?&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise 5 stars:)</li>
            <li>They are not as strong as some of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products, seem to be diluted, but work very well.  </li>
            <li>I use Lavender daily for so many different things, so this was a great price for how much you get!</li>
            <li>and this always helps me feel calm</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS FABULOUS AND REALLY HELPS TO RELAX ME TO SLEEP EASIER.  </li>
            <li>so I try to create a calm environment and this stuff was just what I needed.</li>
            <li>house gets a fresh smell and a few of my guests have already commented on the great smell in the house.</li>
            <li>smell soft and I love it</li>
            <li>Really nice quality lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it so far.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly came as packaging described but does not smell much like lavender it smells of sweet chemicals.</li>
            <li>What is good about this particular brand it is is that the only ingredient on the label is Lavender.</li>
            <li>I did receive this at a lower cost/free for my opinion but I am leaving this review true to the heart and leave this positive review because it rightfully deserves it.</li>
            <li>Not as good as other brands</li>
            <li>so u can ad just the right amount and the smell</li>
            <li>: It comes in a very large size.</li>
            <li>This is a product I will buy again - I&#x27;m using up the whole bottle right now, but next time I order, I&#x27;m going to use it to make my own cleaning products.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice like pure Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>The odor isn&#x27;t as strong when you use it directly as it is in the bottle so be warned of that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said it was as strong as YL&#x27;s (and there&#x27;s is the strongest that we&#x27;ve tried so far, but the prices are bananas).</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>It is very strong (in a good way) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have age spots that u will use it on to see what happens.this oil is really good pure not watered down</li>
            <li>This came on time, well sealed and the product I ordered exactly.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I can have exact count of drops for blends.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS ESSENTIAL OIL.</li>
            <li>love that it comes with a regular cap and a glass dropper.</li>
            <li>and it really does help!</li>
            <li>I am a total beginner and have no way of knowing if this true 100% genuine therapeutic grade oil as claimed</li>
            <li>and I can get this cheaper, get more, and get the same quality.</li>
            <li>Very aromatic!</li>
            <li>favorite way to use Lavender oil is in a roll-on that is mixed with a carrier oil.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>and my house smelled so pretty.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops and this makes the bars smell so good.</li>
            <li>This oil is strongly scented, pure, and natural.</li>
            <li>The smell will linger and your house and vacuum smell better.  </li>
            <li>The large bottle is a great value and will last several months, much longer than the 0.5 oz.</li>
            <li>Pure Body is now my favorite brand for essential oils.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite essential oils - I diffuse it pretty much every night and it helps me sleep.</li>
            <li>Big bottle - it really works magic on skin burns.  </li>
            <li>My house is being blasted right now and filling up with this wonderful scent, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I received the bottle of Pure Body Naturals Lavender Essential Oil, I started reading the label and discovering all of the other great uses.</li>
            <li>making sleep come peacefully, quickly and naturally.</li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals captured and preserved the calming and relaxing property of nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just a large amount of with no health benefits for me.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to using in a soap or lotion to judge if it is pure as advertised</li>
            <li>So I was pretty happy to see that, since I will only use essential oils that only contain what theh are suppose to.</li>
            <li>It is pleasant, but is different from my other lavender oils.  </li>
            <li>The dropper is really appreciated.</li>
            <li>i also put it into my bath for a very relaxing bath..</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very perfumey.</li>
            <li>Although I did put too much on my husbands pillow</li>
            <li>I really wish you hadn&#x27;t asked for my review</li>
            <li>really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like them.  </li>
            <li>buy again, the oil is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is very fragrant.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>but it really does.</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage which I had a feeling</li>
            <li>Really, I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>I just add in about 10 drops and my whole house smells like lavender.</li>
            <li>Waking up refreshed and ready for the day.</li>
            <li>and this one the scent stuck around much longer.</li>
            <li>Scent an eye pillow â€“ very restful scent&lt;</li>
            <li>it is a concentrated oil - use sparingly until you get used to how much you need.</li>
            <li>, itâ€™s the real deal.</li>
            <li>So this really helps alleviate the pain for me.</li>
            <li>Gentle steam and aroma, I am very content with this oil</li>
            <li>This Lavender essential oil works beautifully in aiding in relaxation especially after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>So far they have done pretty good as far as calming down some.</li>
            <li>They have true sweet Lavender smell, with none of the camphor smell of some of the other types.</li>
            <li>Being that this was such a huge bottle at a great price, I was skeptical, but went for it anyway.</li>
            <li>It was much larger than expected which is terrific and come which a great dropper for ease of application.</li>
            <li>This smells like true lavender essential oil and comes with a glass dropper.</li>
            <li>This is really a large bottle and being so concentrated it will go very far.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from migraines all my life, i have tried multiple medications and seen many different doctors!</li>
            <li>The smell of lavender for this product is very natural and close to the real thing.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a great natural way to calm your crazy kids, try this Lavender Oil from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a high quality lavender oil.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>I like that its pure and natural.</li>
            <li>That little experiment started my love for lavender.</li>
            <li>I have recently entered the realm of essential oils and this so far is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I love that it is not too over powering yet long lasting.</li>
            <li>The smell was long lasting,I tried this oil on a few things,I used it for my DIY Body Scrubs that I make my skin loved this oil it stayed with me.i also used it in this recipe for my hair also,this oil</li>
            <li>The smell is actually offensive and it smells far from true lavender.</li>
            <li>I use Lavender everyday, it is literally one of my favorite oils to use.</li>
            <li>Good value, I bought 3 and one arrived with a broken stopper.</li>
            <li>I have two large aromatherapy units and I filled each with 2 oz (and a little water).</li>
            <li>LIVE N LEARN.</li>
            <li>so I was in need of a new one.</li>
            <li>Where I live we have a lot of lavender plants in the area and the smell of this product is very close, if not the same, to the real lavender plants.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used essential oil much</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that the lavender did work well</li>
            <li>First off I am new to the essential oils</li>
            <li>it makes my skin soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>the aroma of lavender is exactly what I have been searching for recently.  </li>
            <li>so the accidents and dog smell can get a little strong.  </li>
            <li>Or I like to put some on my temples,this method may be a little too strong for you</li>
            <li>I am still pretty new to essential oils and have been ordering tons of oils to try out in my diffuser and when I saw this Lavender Essential Oil by Pure Body Naturals</li>
            <li>I bought this Pure Body Naturals Lavender Essential Oil to use in my oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>The smell is not as strong as other lavender essential oils I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it everyday by diffusion.</li>
            <li>I am planning on putting some on my dogs blanket as the fourth of July approaches as she gets very nervous with the fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is by far the strangest smelling lavender I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li>It is so natural and</li>
            <li>This one bottle of lavender oil is going to last forever for me, even with how much I use it.</li>
            <li>I use the oil frequently for headache relief.  </li>
            <li>I use lavender oil in so much around my house that I decided to buy a big bottle.  </li>
            <li>But what I recommend the most is to either put a few drops on your pillow before bed or like a tissue, rag, etc by your bedside that is soaked with a few drops of the lavender oil and it will completely ease your mind and calm your thoughts and mind/body</li>
            <li>recommend this lavender oil to anyone looking for Natural oil that does what it says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the oil to make a natural deodorizer and cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will be surprised how far this bottle will go.</li>
            <li>I have 4 total and they are really a hit.</li>
            <li>Store in a cool dark place ( I use the refrigerator).</li>
            <li>highly recommend this oil for anyone looking for larger bottles of lavender and those people wanting something pure and natural for their essential oil use.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My favorite use is after a long day to drop a few drops into my bath water...</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty big and definitely will last me for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>It is a rather large bottle so it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product from this company especially if you lie essential</li>
            <li>I bought this one because of it&#x27;s great reviews and the last two nights I&#x27;ve tried the same amount 6-7 drops in the diffuser and can barely smell it...very disappointing.</li>
            <li>This is a huge amount because with lavender you really only need a few drops so this should last you awhile!</li>
            <li>ALWAYS USED YOUNG LIVING ESSENTIAL OILS.  </li>
            <li>The oil definitely is nothing compared to young living oils</li>
            <li>bottles which often sell for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li>She gets very nervous and anxious, especially with loud noises and any high pitched sounds.  </li>
            <li>I also used this as an air freshener,you simply place a few drops into the toilet paper roll (1 filled up dropper) and spread it all around</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve used plant therapy in my diffuser and it smelled up my whole main level....</li>
            <li>It lasts so much longer than other things I have tried.</li>
            <li>seems very diluted by some other oil.</li>
            <li>I was not at all disappointed in this lavender oil as the smell is just pure amazing.</li>

            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> on my temple for stress, and so many more things.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, so many uses.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has a dropper.  </li>
            <li> It makes it so much more convenient than trying to pour it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have for many years grown lavender and purchased lavender scented items before.</li>
            <li> To my palate it smells like a cheap laundry detergent, not something that you would want to sweeten the smell of your house or rub on your body or use in any kind of beauty product.</li>
            <li> but I do know I love this smell.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love lavender oil for its many purposes</li>
            <li> but this has so many more uses.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil.</li>
            <li> I really love this Lavender Oil.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> there are so many uses for this oil</li>
            <li> and it has many uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more when needed</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, I use it with my moisturizer</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, put a few drops on tissue/paper towel and put by my pillow for a good restful nights sleep.</li>
            <li> I have never used Lavender essentional oil but after trying this out I do truly love it.the calming effect</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  </li>
            <li> Makes getting in bed more satisfying.</li>
            <li> I have a stressful life and was told diffusing lavender would make me sleep better and have a calmer environment.</li>
            <li> Bug repellant and relieves itching better than anything.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out for many more uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dropper did break during shipping, but I&#x27;m still able to use the oil without issue.</li>
            <li> me, lavender is a calming, soothing yet refreshing floral scent.</li>
            <li> I use it in many ways to make bath / body products.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢</li>
            <li> I make lye soap, but you could add it to a glycerin melt &amp; pour soap for a lovely gift.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢</li>
            <li> it will release the Lavender scent even more.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is strong but not overpowering like some of them are, and the eye dropper it comes with makes it so easy to use in a diffuser, in a bath, on your skin, or for making your own homemade oil blend.</li>
            <li> I ordered through a  special deal to try it and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It was very strong and very powerful.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the oil is very light and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> This Lavender oil smells amazing - sweet, herbal, flowery and</li>
            <li> It makes my whole house smell great and the bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> It sure is a great way to clear up acne spots/marks.</li>
            <li> Very strong in bottle so to get a true scent you should add a drop to wrist or anywhere and then smell.  </li>
            <li> it has a very good scent that last.</li>
            <li> This one smells more like those cheap imitation-lavender scented fragrances.</li>
            <li> Use it at night in a diffuser to help relax myself and my wife to sleep more soundly.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, feels great on skin, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is the most fabulous lavender oil I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to use my Lavender oil sparingly because this Best 100% Natural Premium Lavender Oil is a good price for the big 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that this oil did perform as I&#x27;d hoped it would for everything that I&#x27;ve used it for thus far.</li>
            <li> Perfect product to use for my soap making and other bath &amp; body</li>
            <li> It is so easy.</li>
            <li> Strong scent to the oil</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like strong odors and this was the answer.</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty forgiving about these things, and I know you get what you pay for, but honestly this product smells like cat pee.</li>
            <li> I previously bought the peppermint oil for my wife when she gets migraines and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is very potent but the dropper which is glasses broke when it shipped other than that it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this Lavender Oil from Pure Body Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a huge bottle with a dropper</li>
            <li> and this is a 4oz bottle which is huge and</li>
            <li> It did smell like a combination of 10year-old cheap soap and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Great Lavender Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that I can get lavender oil for so much cheaper</li>
            <li> If you enjoy Lavender than this will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> So smooth and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love this lavender not only does it makes your house smell good but</li>
            <li> It smells really good and the dropper is great!So far I am liking this brand.</li>
            <li> I love that it came with a dropper as it makes getting the right amount of drops into my diffuser.</li>
            <li> This oil also originates from Bulgaria in case your wondering.i love the smell of this brand, I used it right away to refresh my carpet after cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have used lavender for years to help with my migraines, and I think this product will prove very useful.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this oil, it is perfect for almost all your lavender oil needs, and for anyone who would be using it on a very regular basis like I do, the bottle is huge and comes completely full, so it will be sure to last you a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I was definitely excited when I was given the opportunity to review this product for free for testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> dark bottle is great for keeping the oil fresh, and the dropper is a nice plus that is often not included.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to feel about this when I first opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> so when I was asked to take a sample in return for my review I was excited.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my aromatherapy diffuser because this helps my son sleep</li>
            <li> Great quality, great price, bigger bottle than expected.</li>
            <li> I love being able to smell lavender all through my house which actually makes me feel more relaxed specially since I&#x27;ve just moved.</li>
            <li> Cuts: put a drop on a cut to stop bleeding clean wound, and kill bacteria.</li>
            <li> The scent is such a pleasant one as well.</li>
            <li> This scent is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered and would again from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li> But I love the fact that it is pure oil and no fillers.</li>
            <li> then I jump right on it!</li>
            <li> I received this Pure Body Naturals Lavender Essential Oil at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but this is 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Not only is it high quality, but it is perfect for anyone who is just getting into oils, or who is a seasoned user of them.</li>
            <li> So many products that claim to be lavender donâ€™t have the true scent â€“ but this one really does.</li>
            <li> i put this into my cool mist humidifier</li>
            <li> This oil does not smell like true lavender.</li>
            <li> did receive the product at a reduced price for which I agreed to give my complete and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I wound up falling asleep for 2 hours in the afternoon and it was a really good deep sleep.</li>
            <li> and I feel I sleep a lot better and through the whole night.</li>
            <li> I love lavender oil becasue you can do so much with it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE Lavender oil, I use it for many things, including putting a drop on a homemade wet wash cloth and throwing it in the dryer, using it with a carrier oil on burns and cuts, and even even diffusing it to help bring calmness to my home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will fill your whole bathroom with a lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt; I also use this for my migraines which I suffer from a lot.</li>
            <li> Like the other oils I&#x27;ve received that are this brand, I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality!  </li>
            <li> Super scent that holds for hours.  </li>
            <li> Lavender oil has many uses, but that&#x27;s mainly what I use it for.</li>
            <li> Super floral like a funeral home....</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Potent to say the least and the price for this quantity is great.  </li>
            <li> This particular oil is so versatile which is another reason I love it.</li>
            <li> I love using the lavender oil right before I get ready to go to bed.</li>
            <li> and it worked better than other popular companies.</li>
            <li> does anyone know how to get a new one sent to me?&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise 5 stars:)</li>
            <li> They are not as strong as some of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products, seem to be diluted, but work very well.  </li>
            <li> I use Lavender daily for so many different things, so this was a great price for how much you get!</li>
            <li> and this always helps me feel calm</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS FABULOUS AND REALLY HELPS TO RELAX ME TO SLEEP EASIER.  </li>
            <li> so I try to create a calm environment and this stuff was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> house gets a fresh smell and a few of my guests have already commented on the great smell in the house.</li>
            <li> smell soft and I love it</li>
            <li> Really nice quality lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it so far.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly came as packaging described but does not smell much like lavender it smells of sweet chemicals.</li>
            <li> What is good about this particular brand it is is that the only ingredient on the label is Lavender.</li>
            <li> I did receive this at a lower cost/free for my opinion but I am leaving this review true to the heart and leave this positive review because it rightfully deserves it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as other brands</li>
            <li> so u can ad just the right amount and the smell</li>
            <li> : It comes in a very large size.</li>
            <li> This is a product I will buy again - I&#x27;m using up the whole bottle right now, but next time I order, I&#x27;m going to use it to make my own cleaning products.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice like pure Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> The odor isn&#x27;t as strong when you use it directly as it is in the bottle so be warned of that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She said it was as strong as YL&#x27;s (and there&#x27;s is the strongest that we&#x27;ve tried so far, but the prices are bananas).</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> It is very strong (in a good way) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have age spots that u will use it on to see what happens.this oil is really good pure not watered down</li>
            <li> This came on time, well sealed and the product I ordered exactly.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I can have exact count of drops for blends.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ESSENTIAL OIL.</li>
            <li> love that it comes with a regular cap and a glass dropper.</li>
            <li> and it really does help!</li>
            <li> I am a total beginner and have no way of knowing if this true 100% genuine therapeutic grade oil as claimed</li>
            <li> and I can get this cheaper, get more, and get the same quality.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic!</li>
            <li> favorite way to use Lavender oil is in a roll-on that is mixed with a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> and my house smelled so pretty.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops and this makes the bars smell so good.</li>
            <li> This oil is strongly scented, pure, and natural.</li>
            <li> The smell will linger and your house and vacuum smell better.  </li>
            <li> The large bottle is a great value and will last several months, much longer than the 0.5 oz.</li>
            <li> Pure Body is now my favorite brand for essential oils.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite essential oils - I diffuse it pretty much every night and it helps me sleep.</li>
            <li> Big bottle - it really works magic on skin burns.  </li>
            <li> My house is being blasted right now and filling up with this wonderful scent, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle of Pure Body Naturals Lavender Essential Oil, I started reading the label and discovering all of the other great uses.</li>
            <li> making sleep come peacefully, quickly and naturally.</li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals captured and preserved the calming and relaxing property of nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just a large amount of with no health benefits for me.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using in a soap or lotion to judge if it is pure as advertised</li>
            <li> So I was pretty happy to see that, since I will only use essential oils that only contain what theh are suppose to.</li>
            <li> It is pleasant, but is different from my other lavender oils.  </li>
            <li> The dropper is really appreciated.</li>
            <li> i also put it into my bath for a very relaxing bath..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very perfumey.</li>
            <li> Although I did put too much on my husbands pillow</li>
            <li> I really wish you hadn&#x27;t asked for my review</li>
            <li> really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like them.  </li>
            <li> buy again, the oil is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil is very fragrant.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> but it really does.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage which I had a feeling</li>
            <li> Really, I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> I just add in about 10 drops and my whole house smells like lavender.</li>
            <li> Waking up refreshed and ready for the day.</li>
            <li> and this one the scent stuck around much longer.</li>
            <li> Scent an eye pillow â€“ very restful scent&lt;</li>
            <li> it is a concentrated oil - use sparingly until you get used to how much you need.</li>
            <li> , itâ€™s the real deal.</li>
            <li> So this really helps alleviate the pain for me.</li>
            <li> Gentle steam and aroma, I am very content with this oil</li>
            <li> This Lavender essential oil works beautifully in aiding in relaxation especially after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> So far they have done pretty good as far as calming down some.</li>
            <li> They have true sweet Lavender smell, with none of the camphor smell of some of the other types.</li>
            <li> Being that this was such a huge bottle at a great price, I was skeptical, but went for it anyway.</li>
            <li> It was much larger than expected which is terrific and come which a great dropper for ease of application.</li>
            <li> This smells like true lavender essential oil and comes with a glass dropper.</li>
            <li> This is really a large bottle and being so concentrated it will go very far.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from migraines all my life, i have tried multiple medications and seen many different doctors!</li>
            <li> The smell of lavender for this product is very natural and close to the real thing.  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a great natural way to calm your crazy kids, try this Lavender Oil from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this company.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a high quality lavender oil.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> I like that its pure and natural.</li>
            <li> That little experiment started my love for lavender.</li>
            <li> I have recently entered the realm of essential oils and this so far is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I love that it is not too over powering yet long lasting.</li>
            <li> The smell was long lasting,I tried this oil on a few things,I used it for my DIY Body Scrubs that I make my skin loved this oil it stayed with me.i also used it in this recipe for my hair also,this oil</li>
            <li> The smell is actually offensive and it smells far from true lavender.</li>
            <li> I use Lavender everyday, it is literally one of my favorite oils to use.</li>
            <li> Good value, I bought 3 and one arrived with a broken stopper.</li>
            <li> I have two large aromatherapy units and I filled each with 2 oz (and a little water).</li>
            <li> LIVE N LEARN.</li>
            <li> so I was in need of a new one.</li>
            <li> Where I live we have a lot of lavender plants in the area and the smell of this product is very close, if not the same, to the real lavender plants.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used essential oil much</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that the lavender did work well</li>
            <li> First off I am new to the essential oils</li>
            <li> it makes my skin soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> the aroma of lavender is exactly what I have been searching for recently.  </li>
            <li> so the accidents and dog smell can get a little strong.  </li>
            <li> Or I like to put some on my temples,this method may be a little too strong for you</li>
            <li> I am still pretty new to essential oils and have been ordering tons of oils to try out in my diffuser and when I saw this Lavender Essential Oil by Pure Body Naturals</li>
            <li> I bought this Pure Body Naturals Lavender Essential Oil to use in my oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as strong as other lavender essential oils I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it everyday by diffusion.</li>
            <li> I am planning on putting some on my dogs blanket as the fourth of July approaches as she gets very nervous with the fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is by far the strangest smelling lavender I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> It is so natural and</li>
            <li> This one bottle of lavender oil is going to last forever for me, even with how much I use it.</li>
            <li> I use the oil frequently for headache relief.  </li>
            <li> I use lavender oil in so much around my house that I decided to buy a big bottle.  </li>
            <li> But what I recommend the most is to either put a few drops on your pillow before bed or like a tissue, rag, etc by your bedside that is soaked with a few drops of the lavender oil and it will completely ease your mind and calm your thoughts and mind/body</li>
            <li> recommend this lavender oil to anyone looking for Natural oil that does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil to make a natural deodorizer and cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will be surprised how far this bottle will go.</li>
            <li> I have 4 total and they are really a hit.</li>
            <li> Store in a cool dark place ( I use the refrigerator).</li>
            <li> highly recommend this oil for anyone looking for larger bottles of lavender and those people wanting something pure and natural for their essential oil use.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My favorite use is after a long day to drop a few drops into my bath water...</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty big and definitely will last me for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> It is a rather large bottle so it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product from this company especially if you lie essential</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of it&#x27;s great reviews and the last two nights I&#x27;ve tried the same amount 6-7 drops in the diffuser and can barely smell it...very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is a huge amount because with lavender you really only need a few drops so this should last you awhile!</li>
            <li> ALWAYS USED YOUNG LIVING ESSENTIAL OILS.  </li>
            <li> The oil definitely is nothing compared to young living oils</li>
            <li> bottles which often sell for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li> She gets very nervous and anxious, especially with loud noises and any high pitched sounds.  </li>
            <li> I also used this as an air freshener,you simply place a few drops into the toilet paper roll (1 filled up dropper) and spread it all around</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used plant therapy in my diffuser and it smelled up my whole main level....</li>
            <li> It lasts so much longer than other things I have tried.</li>
            <li> seems very diluted by some other oil.</li>
            <li> I was not at all disappointed in this lavender oil as the smell is just pure amazing.</li>
            <li> My kids need to calm down and slow down, shake the attitude and just be calm.</li>
            <li> i come back about 6-8 hours later and vacuum it up and the smell and spot are gone.</li>
            <li> Will be adding to my personal care products, using in the bath, in oil diffusers, on my vacuum cleaner bags, in sachets for my pillow to help with sleep.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who are just getting into oils, the bottle has simple and clear directions for uses and how to apply (which a lot of the other oils don&#x27;t come with).</li>
            <li> He went from tense to calm, he seemed to sleep longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got extremely high anxiety, and a few drops of this on my temples and wrists helps to ease my nerves, which has been helpful in aiding my weaning from medications.</li>
            <li> But not sure if it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Place it on the toilet paper holder and anytime you or your guests pull some out</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops to  get that calming effects promised by the lavender scent, and the scent a decent amount of time, unlike other oils I have used where the scent disappears within five minutes.</li>
            <li> The skunk and other creatures outside our bedroom window in middle of the night were driving him nuts and his barking and growling waking us up.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely cure him but it seemed to have a little calming effect.</li>
            <li> It came with a lid that was heat shrink sealed and included a long dropper.</li>
            <li> A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY FOR MY PURPOSES.  </li>
            <li> Even add a few drops to an old cloth and add to your wash.</li>
            <li> While sometimes it may not completely get rid of my head aches  </li>
            <li> Minor burns: put a couple drops to decrease pain and swelling.</li>
            <li> , it relaxes you after a long day at work</li>
            <li> This is not pure essential oil.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like other, for example french, lavender oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like to blend it with other essential oils that I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lavender essential oils that did not keep scent very long</li>
            <li> There are countless uses for lavender such as relaxation, body aches and pains, sunburns...just to name a few.</li>
            <li> Only need a very small amount as it is very fragrant and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> will last a long time as a few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Stick with small bottles.foes not smell like lavender oil I have had so much better in small bottles lately.</li>
            <li> Or larger bottles are Watered down.</li>
            <li> Rubbing a little bit of this oil on my hands and then on her back and legs appears to stop her anxiety.  </li>
            <li> I guess the quantity would be a positive, however due to the product being mediocre its even more annoying to have such a giant supply of it.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops in a diffuser I have and there is a slight fragrance in the air; enough to notice but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to find out other uses for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to its other uses as I use this exclusively in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> did use it in my son&#x27;s bath the other night when he was having a bit of a meltdown (he is 2).</li>
            <li> I place a drop on my pillows every other night</li>
            <li> Smaller bottles I ordered in the past didn&#x27;t have the dropper.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they have cut it with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Choosing a quality essential oil is always a gamble, especially when ordering online, as you&#x27;re unable to physically feel or smell the oil.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to be as concentrated as other lavender oils that I have tried, although it feels like lavender oil on the skin and the fragrance is concentrated.  </li>
            <li> Earlier today I had a pretty bad headache going on; nausea and all.</li>
            <li> and I usually add essential oils instead of harsh perfumes.</li>
            <li> and he calmed down and slept .</li>
            <li> I ordered the lavender oil and was not let down at all.</li>
            <li> This has calmed him down and he sleeps through the night.  </li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this purchase, gentle and subtle enough for a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> I have been buying NOW Lavender oil for years and decided to try this one because it was slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> Arrived with the glass dropper snapped in half.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight spicy, mediciny smell.  </li>
            <li> I make my own lotions and beauty products (due to a horrible sulfate allergy).</li>
            <li> , so I rubbed a little into my temples and it lessened the pain in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> You just put a little on a washcloth and put it with your dog.</li>
            <li> I do feel that this helped ease my headache off a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is 100% pure and contains no fillers or artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste when pouring</li>
            <li> Use a few drops to freshen a bathroom</li>
            <li> It smells lovely!A few drops here and there</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my hand and inhale.</li>
            <li> This had a very slight smell of lavendar.</li>
            <li> I use lavender oil for my anxiety, rubbing a small diluted quantity on my writs and also in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> I decided to use just a small drop and test it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what was going on there</li>
            <li> Other products I have purchased had an unnatural scent or an extremely weak scent.  </li>
            <li> I usually put on some relaxing music and this helps with my anxiety.</li>
            <li> No more messing with keeping the dropper separate.  </li>
            <li> I usually either put a drop or two on my wrists or neck and massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li> If your not sure which lavender oil to purchase-get this one PERIOD.</li>
            <li> but it did leave behind a slightly salty odor.</li>
            <li> I rubbed some lavender oil on my temples and just inhaled and exhaled slowly.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to put a drop on my temples and my neck because I have been having horrible neck and upper back pain too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I have really bad cracking heels and I have been massaging this lavender oil into the cracking areas for about 4 days now and they are starting to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glass dropper was broken when I got it as well.</li>
            <li> However, dropper arrived broken....</li>
            <li> Put two drops with one drop Peppermint oil in my defuser &amp; it is great.(Only thing dropper was broken upon arrivel.)</li>
            <li> The dropper it came with was broken.</li>
            <li> Glass dropper was broken and unusable.</li>
            <li> it was broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> The other reason I like lavender is that bed bugs hate it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch or</li>
            <li> I am sorry</li>
            <li> Glass dropper arrived broken, might need to use plastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I just can&#x27;t appreciate the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Since middle school up to know I have terrible migraines.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> I am a very poor sleeper at night</li>
            <li> and I just learned that it helps alleviate migraine which my son also suffers from.</li>
            <li> My house needed some freshening, badly.</li>
            <li> I received it today, had a bad headache</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so so so bad....</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> disappointed..</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate bugs and no one is immune from getting bugs in their home.  </li>
            <li> I hate to say it</li>
            <li> Worst idea ever.</li>
            <li> Awful!!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Oil smells AWFUL, nothing like lavender.</li>
            <li> but there are some nasty people in the world and bugs out</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Both products I bought of this brand smelled awful.</li>
            <li> Absolutely HORRIBLE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love love love! This lavender oil is fantastic! It is working great as a partner with my tea tree oil. I received this in return for my opinion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used essential oil much but I&#x27;ve always wanted to buy them.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to get this one.  This is my 2nd essential oil and I&#x27;m happy to get this lavender.  I just love the smell of this and this always helps me feel calm and it does relieve my stress.  I also try to use this for sleeping.  It comes in a big enough bottle that will last me for a while and it also comes with a dropper.  I can&#x27;t wait to find out other uses for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  This product was bought at a promotional price for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> love this product ,used it on a rash and it helped it alot</li>
            <li> I am sorry but I have to be honest with products I try, this lavender oil it&#x27;s not the best, I can not lie, I&#x27;ve tried different brands and I cannot even recommend it.  Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> This came on time, well sealed and the product I ordered exactly. It came with a lid that was heat shrink sealed and included a long dropper. It smelled great, no complaints. This is really a large bottle and being so concentrated it will go very far. It also rubs in well without leaving your skin feeling greasy. I did receive a discount for the review and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered and would again from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like other, for example french, lavender oils I&#x27;ve tried. This one smells more like those cheap imitation-lavender scented fragrances. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last when diffused in the air. Finally, nowhere on the bottle does it say &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; though it does say that in the description on the amazon website.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong at first, I put it in my warmer to make the house smell good and did a wonderful job. I also used it whe i gave my husband a back rub. He went from tense to calm, he seemed to sleep longer. I love the smell. I also used it on my grandson. He was fighting his sleep and rubbed his feet with it and he calmed down and slept . I RECEIVED THIS  PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Smells Heavenly.  Great Price &amp; shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This Lavender oil smells amazing - sweet, herbal, flowery and it&#x27;s not overpowering.  I enjoy it everyday by diffusion. I like to blend it with other essential oils that I have. The dropper is really appreciated. Pure Body Naturals captured and preserved the calming and relaxing property of nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at discounted price.</li>
            <li> I use this in a diffuser mixed with water.  The smell of lavender for this product is very natural and close to the real thing.  Where I live we have a lot of lavender plants in the area and the smell of this product is very close, if not the same, to the real lavender plants.  I add about 15 drops to the water in diffuser and it lasts about 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house gets a fresh smell and a few of my guests have already commented on the great smell in the house.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. LAVENDERS CAN ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SMELLS BUT THIS IS A &amp;#34;TRUE&amp;#34; LAVENDER SMELL TO ME. (WELL ATLEAST THE SCENT OF LAVENDER THAT I LIKE.) YOU CAN LITERALLY USE LAVENDER FOR JUST ABOUT ANYTHING, WHICH I DO. SO I GOT THE BI BOTTLE AND I FELL IT WAS A REALLY GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.  In the past I&#x27;ve used plant therapy in my diffuser and it smelled up my whole main level....I bought this one because of it&#x27;s great reviews and the last two nights I&#x27;ve tried the same amount 6-7 drops in the diffuser and can barely smell it...very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as strong as other lavender essential oils I have purchased. Glass dropper was broken when I got it as well.</li>
            <li> I have recently entered the realm of essential oils and this so far is my favorite scent. I use a few drops in a diffuser I have and there is a slight fragrance in the air; enough to notice but not overpowering. I cannot attest to its other uses as I use this exclusively in my diffuser.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I use this product in a oil diffuser.I love the smell it outs out.I use it in my basement also to detour spiders.I have noticed a big diffrence since I began using this in the amount of spiders present</li>
            <li> what an awesome deal!!</li>
            <li> Great oil.  Use it at night in a diffuser to help relax myself and my wife to sleep more soundly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> i received this product at a promotional price to give my honest opinion..i put this into my cool mist humidifier and i really love the smell of this product..i also put it into my bath for a very relaxing bath..i love it!!!..very nice and relaxing!</li>
            <li> I love the lavender oil I received I used it for massaging my husband and it has a nice smell and it gives him relaxation! I also used it for my skin it makes my skin soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> This lavender oil is wonderful! I ordered through a  special deal to try it and share my honest opinion. It is a rather large bottle so it will last you a long time. I use lavender oil for my anxiety, rubbing a small diluted quantity on my writs and also in my diffuser. this oil is pure and smells wonderful . I also use it diluted on coconut oil for my massages and for burns and scars, and is working wonders for those. I love that comes with a dropper so I don&#x27;t waste when pouring and I can have exact count of drops for blends.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions and beauty products (due to a horrible sulfate allergy). Lavender is one of the key oils that I use in the recipes. I wasn&#x27;t sure how to feel about this when I first opened the bottle. It was very strong and very powerful. I decided to use just a small drop and test it. I was very surprised that the lavender did work well and it worked better than other popular companies. The odor isn&#x27;t as strong when you use it directly as it is in the bottle so be warned of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use it in my son&#x27;s bath the other night when he was having a bit of a meltdown (he is 2). It worked great but it did leave behind a slightly salty odor. I&#x27;m not sure what was going on there and if that was the oil or our water system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this oil for anyone looking for larger bottles of lavender and those people wanting something pure and natural for their essential oil use.</li>
            <li> Pure Body is now my favorite brand for essential oils. I previously bought the peppermint oil for my wife when she gets migraines and it worked perfectly. She said it was as strong as YL&#x27;s (and there&#x27;s is the strongest that we&#x27;ve tried so far, but the prices are bananas). I ordered the lavender oil and was not let down at all. I will buy all of the different essential oils that they make so we have a variety for our diffusers. Highly recommend this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Excellent! Smells fresh, feels great on skin, fast delivery! Recommended!</li>
            <li> Does not smell like Lavender... AT ALL!!! I have been buying NOW Lavender oil for years and decided to try this one because it was slightly cheaper. Worst idea ever. This stuff smells like turpentine oil.</li>
            <li> This Lavender essential oil works beautifully in aiding in relaxation especially after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this essential oil in a promotion for testing and review.  We like to use in a&lt;br /&gt;diffuser at bedtime. It smells wonderful and comes in a generous sized bottle.</li>
            <li> Good value, I bought 3 and one arrived with a broken stopper. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great product! Glass dropper arrived broken, might need to use plastic!</li>
            <li> It is very potent but the dropper which is glasses broke when it shipped other than that it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, smells great. However, dropper arrived broken....does anyone know how to get a new one sent to me?&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise 5 stars:)</li>
            <li> Love this.Put two drops with one drop Peppermint oil in my defuser &amp; it is great.(Only thing dropper was broken upon arrivel.) Wonderful Company &amp; service.Thanks.</li>
            <li> 1. The glass dropper was delivered broken.&lt;br /&gt;2.  If this is supposed to be 100% lavender oil then I&#x27;m the Pope.  I grow several varieties of lavender and the concoction that was sent to me smelled like none of them.  It did smell like a combination of 10year-old cheap soap and chemicals.  Awful!!!! I want my money back!</li>
            <li> This is not pure essential oil. Smells like chemicals</li>
            <li> I use this for my dog.  She gets very nervous and anxious, especially with loud noises and any high pitched sounds.  Rubbing a little bit of this oil on my hands and then on her back and legs appears to stop her anxiety.  Only need a very small amount as it is very fragrant and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Protect from mosquitoes</li>
            <li> This oil does not do anything for me.  I read reviews and thought that it would help my headaches like the one from another brand did.  I do not smell any lavender, no therapeutic affect with this oil just a large amount of with no health benefits for me.</li>
            <li> NO FRAGRANCE.  A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY FOR MY PURPOSES.  LIVE N LEARN.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use when making my own soap.  The soap smells really nice and the scent lingers for awhile but is not over powering.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ESSENTIAL OIL. IT SMELLS FABULOUS AND REALLY HELPS TO RELAX ME TO SLEEP EASIER.  I&#x27;VE ALWAYS USED YOUNG LIVING ESSENTIAL OILS.  THIS IS JUST AS GOOD IN MY OPINION.</li>
            <li> not as good of a smell as what I had</li>
            <li> Very perfumey. This oil does not smell like true lavender. It smells a lot like laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> Great Lavender Essential Oil.  Super scent that holds for hours.  Very strong in bottle so to get a true scent you should add a drop to wrist or anywhere and then smell.  Will be adding to my personal care products, using in the bath, in oil diffusers, on my vacuum cleaner bags, in sachets for my pillow to help with sleep.  on my temple for stress, and so many more things.  Even add a few drops to an old cloth and add to your wash. I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> First off I am new to the essential oils so when I was asked to take a sample in return for my review I was excited. It is a huge bottle with a dropper so u can ad just the right amount and the smell is awesome.  Although I did put too much on my husbands pillow so he had to wake me up to see what he was smelling lol. But I love the fact that it is pure oil and no fillers. Can&#x27;t wait to put in my candles and bath soaps!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, so many uses.  It instantly reduced stress when applied to temples, relieved insect bite itch.  Great for relaxation before bed.  I apply to back of hands before bed and get dual use as it helps with age spots on hands.  Nice big bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and a great price.  Use in my diffuser. On my pillows.  On my body.  Just great stuff all around.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. I use it in our diffusers throughout the house. Lavender oil has many uses, but that&#x27;s mainly what I use it for.</li>
            <li> Arrived with the glass dropper snapped in half.  Otherwise, the oil is very light and absorbs easily.  The scent is subtle and not overpowering.  I have used lavender for years to help with my migraines, and I think this product will prove very useful.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful.  I love that it has a dropper.  After research I used a diluted drop on my doggie!s back, just below neck.  The skunk and other creatures outside our bedroom window in middle of the night were driving him nuts and his barking and growling waking us up.  This has calmed him down and he sleeps through the night.  I use it on my ice pack for my neck in the evening.  So, relaxing.  This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I really wish you hadn&#x27;t asked for my review but here it is... Product arrived quickly came as packaging described but does not smell much like lavender it smells of sweet chemicals. I will not be purchasing this product again</li>
            <li> When I got this item the dropper was shattered.........the dust day I received this I waterboarding a migraine, so I rubbed a little into my temples and it lessened the pain in about 10 minutes. I can deal with the migraine if I can get the edge off the pain and this helped me</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Years ago, a holistic veterinarian recommended lavender essential oil for my dog for separation anxiety. You just put a little on a washcloth and put it with your dog. It does help. It didn&#x27;t completely cure him but it seemed to have a little calming effect. That little experiment started my love for lavender. It smells beautiful. I had the opportunity to try this out at a discounted price and I jumped at the chance. The timing of its arrival was impeccable. My house needed some freshening, badly. I have two large aromatherapy units and I filled each with 2 oz (and a little water). My house is being blasted right now and filling up with this wonderful scent, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My dogs like it too (I have two dogs now). This is a product I will buy again - I&#x27;m using up the whole bottle right now, but next time I order, I&#x27;m going to use it to make my own cleaning products. Very nice!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I love that it is not too over powering yet long lasting. I add it to my wax warmers when the wax starts to lose its scent and this stuff really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I found out that the scent of lavender is supposed to be calming for dogs. I have three and sometimes they don&#x27;t get along so I try to create a calm environment and this stuff was just what I needed. It lasts so much longer than other things I have tried. I am planning on putting some on my dogs blanket as the fourth of July approaches as she gets very nervous with the fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes with a regular cap and a glass dropper. It makes it so much more convenient than trying to pour it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the product at a reduced price for which I agreed to give my complete and honest opinion. This review is based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from migraines all my life, i have tried multiple medications and seen many different doctors! My migraines have gotten to the point where i could take tylenol or excedrin like candy because they wouldnt touch it.  I heard everyone talking about essential oils and decided i would give them a try.  I have been using this lavender oil for a while now and it really does help! I have been putting in the bath with me to help reduce stress and relax! While sometimes it may not completely get rid of my head aches  it lessens the pain greatly! I received this product at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion. If your like me your should give it a try!</li>
            <li> This had a very slight smell of lavendar. The quality was not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> The oil definitely is nothing compared to young living oils but it does the trick. The dropper it came with was broken.</li>
            <li> I never tried lavender oil before. I received it today, had a bad headache so I decided to put a drop on my temples and my neck because I have been having horrible neck and upper back pain too. I wound up falling asleep for 2 hours in the afternoon and it was a really good deep sleep. I am a very poor sleeper at night so I cant wait to try it before I go to bed at night. I also did not realize all the ways you can use the oil. I like the smell of it too</li>
            <li> This brand of oil&#x27;s are good.  I really like them.  They are not as strong as some of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products, seem to be diluted, but work very well.  For the cost, I will purchase these oils again</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again, the oil is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Dropper included is handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I just can&#x27;t appreciate the smell of this product. I have for many years grown lavender and purchased lavender scented items before. This is by far the strangest smelling lavender I have ever encountered. To my palate it smells like a cheap laundry detergent, not something that you would want to sweeten the smell of your house or rub on your body or use in any kind of beauty product. Within one hour of receiving I had to exorcize my house of the packaging, the product, then shower to wash any residue from my skin. Hours later my home is still smelling like a whore house laundry.</li>
            <li> This oil is TERRIBLE! It smells like perfumed urinal. Gave me a headache. I&#x27;m returning it. Thank you Amazon for taking it back!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the good stuff. From Bulgaria and everything. It&#x27;s potent but it smells great. I place a drop on my pillows every other night</li>
            <li> I am beginning to try out essential oils. This oil is very fragrant. I am a total beginner and have no way of knowing if this true 100% genuine therapeutic grade oil as claimed but I do know I love this smell. Only one thing though the lavender fragrance only last about 20 minutes or so. That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t give 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Lavender is the only scent that helps me relax. I love it</li>
            <li> Works very well. Good quality</li>
            <li> I absolutely love lavender oil for its many purposes so whenever I find a deal and can buy it then I jump right on it! This is a huge amount because with lavender you really only need a few drops so this should last you awhile! I&#x27;d highly recommend this product from this company especially if you lie essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received this item for testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the most fabulous lavender oil I have ever purchased.  The scent is heavenly and I will definitely purchase this again.  It is so natural and the aroma of lavender is exactly what I have been searching for recently.  Other products I have purchased had an unnatural scent or an extremely weak scent.  This is perfection at its very best.</li>
            <li> Beautiful oil - smells wonderful fresh and pure!</li>
            <li> I love using the lavender oil right before I get ready to go to bed. I wasn&#x27;t a believer that it would help relax you but it really does. I leave my diffuser on all night and I feel I sleep a lot better and through the whole night. The scent is such a pleasant one as well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Lavender is an essential component of the oil blend I use to alleviate allergy symptoms. This oil is strongly scented, pure, and natural. The large bottle is a great value and will last several months, much longer than the 0.5 oz. bottles which often sell for nearly the same price. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Best lavender oil. I originally purchased this for my aromatherapy diffuser because this helps my son sleep but this has so many more uses. First of all it smells awesome. It helps with anxiety which my oldest son and myself suffer from. Its great to use for massages and I just learned that it helps alleviate migraine which my son also suffers from. I like that its pure and natural. I absolutely love this oil. I was definitely excited when I was given the opportunity to review this product for free for testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> I received this oil today,and I immediately put if to use,First thing ,the smell I loved it.The smell was long lasting,I tried this oil on a few things,I used it for my DIY Body Scrubs that I make my skin loved this oil it stayed with me.i also used it in this recipe for my hair also,this oil no one should be without it.I used it on my skin I have age spots that u will use it on to see what happens.this oil is really good pure not watered down it has a very good scent that last.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li> I really love this Lavender Oil. Not only is it high quality, but it is perfect for anyone who is just getting into oils, or who is a seasoned user of them. The lavender scent is strong but not overpowering like some of them are, and the eye dropper it comes with makes it so easy to use in a diffuser, in a bath, on your skin, or for making your own homemade oil blend. For those of you who are just getting into oils, the bottle has simple and clear directions for uses and how to apply (which a lot of the other oils don&#x27;t come with). This one bottle of lavender oil is going to last forever for me, even with how much I use it. It only takes a few drops to  get that calming effects promised by the lavender scent, and the scent a decent amount of time, unlike other oils I have used where the scent disappears within five minutes. I highly recommended this oil, it is perfect for almost all your lavender oil needs, and for anyone who would be using it on a very regular basis like I do, the bottle is huge and comes completely full, so it will be sure to last you a good amount of time. product was given for the intent of review.</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil is fantastic. It makes my whole house smell great and the bottle is HUGE. Will purchase again when its gone!</li>
            <li> Smells really nice like pure Essential Oil. Blot test left an oil mark. This could be the type of Essential oil that does that. Looking forward to using in a soap or lotion to judge if it is pure as advertised</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage which I had a feeling it might be because the price was too good to be true.....This stuff smells so so so bad.... Super floral like a funeral home.... The smell is actually offensive and it smells far from true lavender.</li>
            <li> Glass dropper was broken and unusable. Oil smells AWFUL, nothing like lavender. I guess the quantity would be a positive, however due to the product being mediocre its even more annoying to have such a giant supply of it. Not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but based on the reviews either these people paid nothing for it or I just did not receive the same product.</li>
            <li> This smells so good!  I use lavender oil in my diffuser, my handmade soaps, and with a carrier oil for anxiety. I just put water and a few drops in my diffuser and within a short while my whole house smells like lavender. I usually put on some relaxing music and this helps with my anxiety. I have never tried this brand before but saw the discounted price and decided to give it a try and this is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;  This lavender oil also works great when I&#x27;m making my homemade soaps.  Just a few drops and this makes the bars smell so good. I also make liquid laundry soap and I usually add essential oils instead of harsh perfumes. I used to spend a ton on the well known essential oils that charge you an arm and a leg for 15mL but this works just as well and smells just as nice. It&#x27;s nice to know that I can get lavender oil for so much cheaper and this is a 4oz bottle which is huge and will last a long time as a few drops goes a long way. Overall, this has an excellent scent, no additives, works great in my diffuser and I can get this cheaper, get more, and get the same quality. I would recommend if you are looking to save money on essential oils.</li>
            <li> Really, I like it a lot.  The glass dropper didn&#x27;t make it, though  - understandably.  I use the oil frequently for headache relief.  Work very well.</li>
            <li> I love lavender oil becasue you can do so much with it.  I use it a lot because I have a dog and a puppy so the accidents and dog smell can get a little strong.  I learned how to make my own carpet deodorizer with it.  It is so easy. Save a Parmesan cheese container to use for storage and shakage.  :) mix 2 cups of each baking soda and 20 Mule team Borax laundry detergent (powder) in a Ziploc bag or a non plastic mixing bowl. Add 20-30 drops of lavender oil and mix.  I prefer the bag because all you have to do is shake it. put in your container for use anytime you like.  If the puppy has an accident on the carpet I cover the area generously with the power and allow the powder to suck up the urine.  i come back about 6-8 hours later and vacuum it up and the smell and spot are gone. The smell will linger and your house and vacuum smell better.  The other reason I like lavender is that bed bugs hate it. I hate bugs and no one is immune from getting bugs in their home.  I hate to say it but there are some nasty people in the world and bugs out number us lol Why not stack the deck in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a high quality lavender oil. It is 100% pure and contains no fillers or artificial ingredients. there are so many uses for this oil and it is so good for you I hope you try it.  I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I am still pretty new to essential oils and have been ordering tons of oils to try out in my diffuser and when I saw this Lavender Essential Oil by Pure Body Naturals I just had to get it since Lavender is one of my favorite scents! I was not at all disappointed in this lavender oil as the smell is just pure amazing. The bottle is pretty big and definitely will last me for quite awhile. I love that it came with a dropper as it makes getting the right amount of drops into my diffuser. I use anywhere between 3-5 drops at a time depending on my mood. I love being able to smell lavender all through my house which actually makes me feel more relaxed specially since I&#x27;ve just moved. This lavender oil also helps me sleep at night since I suffer from insomnia. I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Horrible. Stick with small bottles.foes not smell like lavender oil I have had so much better in small bottles lately. Maybe it&#x27;s the heat? Or larger bottles are Watered down. Trust me I use them all the time &amp; have health issues &amp; know my oils etc</li>
            <li> I have been collecting essential oils to combat colds, germs, bugs and attitudes. So when I was offered this Lavender Oil from Pure Body Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. I have put lavender oil on the kids blankets and sides of pillows, as well as on the couches. My kids need to calm down and slow down, shake the attitude and just be calm. So far they have done pretty good as far as calming down some. So if you are looking for a great natural way to calm your crazy kids, try this Lavender Oil from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li> I diffuse essential oils and make salves, lotions, lip balms and etc. The Lavender oil I have been buying is more expensive and it is only a 15ml bottle. Now I don&#x27;t have to use my Lavender oil sparingly because this Best 100% Natural Premium Lavender Oil is a good price for the big 4 oz. bottle. Lavender Oil is an oil that is a must have in your home and it has many uses. It is a great sleep aid: I make a sleep salve that I put on the bottom of my feet to help me sleep at night. Put a drop on a bee sting or insect bite to stop the itching and swelling. Minor burns: put a couple drops to decrease pain and swelling. Cuts: put a drop on a cut to stop bleeding clean wound, and kill bacteria. The list goes on that is why I will never be without Lavender oil and this brand. You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Well packaged and shipped promptly.  I use lavender oil in so much around my house that I decided to buy a big bottle.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  Smaller bottles I ordered in the past didn&#x27;t have the dropper.  Makes measuring so much easier for me (not so messy).  And it smells wonderful, too.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Will be purchasing more when needed</li>
            <li> I think it helps relax me.  Using as part of bedtime routine</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty forgiving about these things, and I know you get what you pay for, but honestly this product smells like cat pee. Maybe they have cut it with other ingredients. I buy lavender essential oil all the time for my business of making bath and body products. I know what it is supposed to smell like.  Both products I bought of this brand smelled awful. Bad quality. dissapointed</li>
            <li> It sure is a great way to clear up acne spots/marks. This really has helped me and I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, I use it with my moisturizer and I feel refreshed,  thank you very much</li>
            <li> Love that it came with a glass dropper that can screw into the bottle for a permanent lid! No more messing with keeping the dropper separate.  I use Lavender daily for so many different things, so this was a great price for how much you get! I use it to make linen sprays and homemade sunscreen. Very aromatic!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have a very strong smell. Very light. soapy smell. seems very diluted by some other oil.</li>
            <li> the sent is very strong. You need just about three drops in a cotton ball to put on your pillow and help you sleep.</li>
            <li> A good price for a very good oil</li>
            <li> I have tried several lavender oils. This scent is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, put a few drops on tissue/paper towel and put by my pillow for a good restful nights sleep.</li>
            <li> Must buy! Perfect for skin and anxiety issues! Must buy! Great price! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Great quality, great price, bigger bottle than expected.</li>
            <li> This is not lavender.</li>
            <li> disappointed.. i luv the smell of lavender but this just isnt it..i mix it with my argon oil and face and body cream but it just doenst give me the scent i expected.i will probably try another scent  til i get one to my liking.</li>
            <li> Seems to be an excellent value. Nice smell. I like that it came with a separate glass dropper. I&#x27;ll re-order this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE Lavender oil, I use it for many things, including putting a drop on a homemade wet wash cloth and throwing it in the dryer, using it with a carrier oil on burns and cuts, and even even diffusing it to help bring calmness to my home.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite way to use Lavender oil is in a roll-on that is mixed with a carrier oil. I rub it across the forehead, and on the back of my neck. Works great when I have a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: It comes in a very large size. Brown bottle, with a glass dipper.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Mine was not packaged well at all when it was shipped and the dropper was busted. I however have an extra dropper so I am not worried about it. Amazon packed it so it is NOT the sellers fault. I just thought I should mention it however.&lt;br /&gt;I received this discounted  for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Not soothing actually burned a bit when I applied to  temple&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have never used Lavender essentional oil but after trying this out I do truly love it.the calming effect it has is wonderful and smells divine. I usually either put a drop or two on my wrists or neck and massage it into my skin. But what I recommend the most is to either put a few drops on your pillow before bed or like a tissue, rag, etc by your bedside that is soaked with a few drops of the lavender oil and it will completely ease your mind and calm your thoughts and mind/body making sleep come peacefully, quickly and naturally. This can also be used in an oil diffuser which I have no tried yet but heard it works wonderfully. I did receive this at a lower cost/free for my opinion but I am leaving this review true to the heart and leave this positive review because it rightfully deserves it. If your not sure which lavender oil to purchase-get this one PERIOD. Also I forgot to mention how big the bottle was. It was much larger than expected which is terrific and come which a great dropper for ease of application.</li>
            <li> Big bottle - it really works magic on skin burns.  Lulls me to sleep when I spray it on my pillow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. But not sure if it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells great and works wonderfully in my diffuser each night to lull me to sleep and keep me asleep.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Relaxing, but still waiting to fall asleep! great value.  Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product!</li>
            <li> I love this lavender not only does it makes your house smell good but its good for stress, it relaxes you after a long day at work</li>
            <li> This oil is calming and fragrant.  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  No gimmicks or extras, just the oil itself and how it makes you feel when you use it.</li>
            <li> The glass dropped that came with it was broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as other brands</li>
            <li> Great sent when you hit the sheets. Makes getting in bed more satisfying.</li>
            <li> I bought this Pure Body Naturals Lavender Essential Oil to use in my oil diffuser. I just add in about 10 drops and my whole house smells like lavender. It is very strong (in a good way) and a little goes a long way. The bottle is 4 oz. which will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I received the bottle of Pure Body Naturals Lavender Essential Oil, I started reading the label and discovering all of the other great uses. To start with this oil can be a remedy for headaches. Earlier today I had a pretty bad headache going on; nausea and all. I rubbed some lavender oil on my temples and just inhaled and exhaled slowly. I do feel that this helped ease my headache off a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I have really bad cracking heels and I have been massaging this lavender oil into the cracking areas for about 4 days now and they are starting to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this lavender oil to anyone looking for Natural oil that does what it says. I received this Pure Body Naturals Lavender Essential Oil at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but this is 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I use this for my son&#x27;s bath. It smells great and dosent irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described. It is a great product with a wonderful smell. I have a stressful life and was told diffusing lavender would make me sleep better and have a calmer environment. This product did just that. Thank you for making a great product!</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with this oil. The scent is wonderful and I have been getting great sleep. Waking up refreshed and ready for the day.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it for almost everything! And this is a great company with great service.</li>
            <li> applied at night has relaxing effect</li>
            <li> smell soft and I love it</li>
            <li> Bug repellant and relieves itching better than anything.</li>
            <li> Excellent high quality product.  Potent to say the least and the price for this quantity is great.  If you enjoy Lavender than this will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I want this on hand at all times</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be be disappointed. This is my favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> Lavender essential oil is a must have in the arsenal of any essential oil user. There are countless uses for lavender such as relaxation, body aches and pains, sunburns...just to name a few. Choosing a quality essential oil is always a gamble, especially when ordering online, as you&#x27;re unable to physically feel or smell the oil. Being that this was such a huge bottle at a great price, I was skeptical, but went for it anyway. I am happy to report that this oil did perform as I&#x27;d hoped it would for everything that I&#x27;ve used it for thus far. My favorite use is after a long day to drop a few drops into my bath water...I find the effects to be similar to that of Epson salts as it relaxes my body and eases my muscles. It&#x27;s also excellent for massages being that it&#x27;s a natural anti inflammatory. I&#x27;ve got extremely high anxiety, and a few drops of this on my temples and wrists helps to ease my nerves, which has been helpful in aiding my weaning from medications. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this oil and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out for many more uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item discounted for evaluation</li>
            <li> So smooth and relaxing. I&#x27;ve tried other lavender essential oils that did not keep scent very long and this one the scent stuck around much longer. I have used it in my homemade baby wipes and I&#x27;ve used it as a air freshener on a cotton ball in my bathroom.The bottle is a good size with a glass dropper it will take me awhile to go through this bottle. You can not go wrong with this purchase, gentle and subtle enough for a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> Really nice quality lavender essential oil. This comes in a big 4 ounce bottle. This smells like true lavender essential oil and comes with a glass dropper. I&#x27;ve been using the oil to make a natural deodorizer and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Like the other oils I&#x27;ve received that are this brand, I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality!  Strong scent to the oil, it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it so far.  The dropper did break during shipping, but I&#x27;m still able to use the oil without issue.</li>
            <li> For years I have been growing lavender. Over the years I have probably grown 50 varieties of lavender. Of all the varieties, the Angustifolias are the sweetest scent. They have true sweet Lavender smell, with none of the camphor smell of some of the other types. When I realized this was made from 100% Angustifolia variety, I was delighted! So many products that claim to be lavender donâ€™t have the true scent â€“ but this one really does. Perfect product to use for my soap making and other bath &amp; body products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, lavender is a calming, soothing yet refreshing floral scent. I use it in many ways to make bath / body products.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Add to almond, jojoba, grape seed or fractionated coconut oil for a massage. Choose oil based on your preference â€“ lavender will be the scent you smell.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Add to coconut oil as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Freshen up potpourri â€“ freshen up lavender sachets&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Use a few drops to freshen a bathroom&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Use with aroma therapy diffuser&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Use it in soap making â€“ I like to use it alone or combine with rose or rosemary scents as well. I make lye soap, but you could add it to a glycerin melt &amp; pour soap for a lovely gift.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Scent an eye pillow â€“ very restful scent&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Mix with Epsom salt to make a bath salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark bottle is great for keeping the oil fresh, and the dropper is a nice plus that is often not included. Store in a cool dark place ( I use the refrigerator). Remember - it is a concentrated oil - use sparingly until you get used to how much you need. You will be surprised how far this bottle will go. Lovely smell, good value, itâ€™s the real deal. I purchased at a discount in exchange for writing an unbiased review.  Delighted with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I recently ran out of my Big 4oz Lavender oil so I was in need of a new one.I use Lavender everyday, it is literally one of my favorite oils to use.So I was definitely happy to get this in.In comes in a 4oz with dropper.What is good about this particular brand it is is that the only ingredient on the label is Lavender.So I was pretty happy to see that, since I will only use essential oils that only contain what theh are suppose to.This oil also originates from Bulgaria in case your wondering.i love the smell of this brand, I used it right away to refresh my carpet after cleaning.It smells lovely!A few drops here and there and my house smelled so pretty.I also used this as an air freshener,you simply place a few drops into the toilet paper roll (1 filled up dropper) and spread it all around or you can sinply leave it like it is without spreading.Place it on the toilet paper holder and anytime you or your guests pull some out it will release the Lavender scent even more.If you never tried this you definitely should.It will fill your whole bathroom with a lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt; I also use this for my migraines which I suffer from a lot.Since middle school up to know I have terrible migraines.So this really helps alleviate the pain for me.I put a few drops in my hand and inhale.Or I like to put some on my temples,this method may be a little too strong for you so you might want to dilute it with coconut oil.This particular oil is so versatile which is another reason I love it.It definitely will last me longer than my smaller 15ml bottles.It smells really good and the dropper is great!So far I am liking this brand.Sample was provided to me at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I am using this oil undilluted as well as in a diffuser.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to be as concentrated as other lavender oils that I have tried, although it feels like lavender oil on the skin and the fragrance is concentrated.  It has a slight spicy, mediciny smell.  It is pleasant, but is different from my other lavender oils.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Great oil. This is the best on amazon.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend. Great quality. Smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lavender oil for years and this smells nothing like it should.  Absolutely HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and not to overbearing</li>
            <li> My purchased arrived on time and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but it clouds up in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Like the glass dropper. Makes it easier to count drops when adding to carrier oils.</li>
            <li> This is put into all diffusiors in my house. I have 4 total and they are really a hit. My husband doesn&#x27;t like strong odors and this was the answer. Gentle steam and aroma, I am very content with this oil and I am almost out</li>
            <li> Best oil ever it helped me with my anxiety and insomnia!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite essential oils - I diffuse it pretty much every night and it helps me sleep.</li>
