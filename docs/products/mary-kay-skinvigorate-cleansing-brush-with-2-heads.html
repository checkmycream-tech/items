            <li>and it is worth what I paid for it especially compared to other cleansing brushes out there.</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old, have dry, sensitive skin, so I was apprehensive in using a product like this.  </li>
            <li>Given the old rule that the older you are the less makeup you should use</li>
            <li>It takes a little while to show results, but after a while it really works.</li>

            <li> A little abrasive on the high power mode...</li>
            <li> The only problem it is not strong enough even in its highest speed, but it might needs new batteries.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the Clarisonic Mia which left my sensitive skin dry and tight.</li>
            <li> There have been none since I started using this brush daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> But at least in terms of this particular item, it has two speeds and it rotates in circles (vs. vibrating like other similar products</li>
            <li> and i just dust a little bare minerals foundation powder on and</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, very dry</li>
            <li> Have been using it every other day.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t measure up to other cleansing brushes.</li>
            <li> But is die for few month of used, I&#x27;d hope this brush will last for little longer</li>
            <li> This was a chap imitation of a cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth what I paid for</li>
            <li> I think it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a few months now</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all makeup left behind.</li>
            <li> These sorts of things always seemed gimmicky to me</li>
            <li> I like this, but it stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> also if you are already broken out...</li>
            <li> Also according to Mary Kay this is an illegal Sale.</li>

            <li> Really leave skin clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different cleansing brushes and have to admit this was my favorite. It is definitely the best bang for your buck. The two speeds are great to change up on different areas of your face. I use clean n clear cleanser with it. My faces feels fresh and clean and my cheeks are extremely soft. Always apply moisturizer afterwards! I&#x27;ve noticed my pores have gotten much smaller and my face looks prettier without makeup than it did before. It&#x27;s a definite must have.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a few months now and I do not know how I lived without it before. My face has never been cleaner or clearer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I love it!! It takes a little while to show results, but after a while it really works.</li>
            <li> LOVE HOW REFRESHED SKIN FEELS AFTER USE.</li>
            <li> Not water proof and rusts inside... not quality internals after token apart.. 0 stars if possible. worked good for about a month... my recomendaci&amp;oacute;n is getting the Olay x pro...</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It makes my skin feel and look so great! I have very sensitive skin and this helps a lot. I will be buying more from this seller. Very nicely packaged and everything!</li>
            <li> This item was shipped fast and I am very happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it worked when I got it, but a month later and it has already stopped working!!! Changed batteries but it still doesn&#x27;t work 👎🏻😞</li>

            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  I think it is a little pricey but so is everything Mary Kay</li>
            <li> This product died after a month and could not be revived.  I bought a ToiletTree replacement and am much happier.</li>
            <li> the brush is pretty much what I expected.  it is very easy to use and works great so far.  I do use it in the shower as well although I do not submerge it.  and it is worth what I paid for it especially compared to other cleansing brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing brush which makes my skin more flourish.  The only problem it is not strong enough even in its highest speed, but it might needs new batteries. My hubby loves it too.</li>
            <li> Work the money!!!  Helps keep my skin clean and smoother.  The vendor got the product to me quickly and perfectly.</li>
            <li> So much better than just using your hands. It feels amazing on your face and you can tell it works!</li>
            <li> this is the softest cleansing brush ever great buy!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i would recommened to any one Mary Kay has wonderful products</li>
            <li> My skins feels awesome. Looks and feels clean. The brush head is soft so you can use this morning and night with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin but it still makes me feels clean after I use it. I simply love it!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone! I have dry skin, very dry and my face looks amazing since using this brush for 6 weeks. It is finally smooth after never being smooth my whole life. I use my own kind of face wash but use Mary Kay moisturizer on my face. I&#x27;m 35 and have had acne breakouts since I was 19. There have been none since I started using this brush daily or every other day. I am replacing the batteries any day now but this will be the first time. Super price too. I paid $29 and got free shipping. My friend is a Mary Kay rep and hers sell for $50 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> Cheap, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is perfectly good for me</li>
            <li> works pretty well but could use a bigger brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth what I paid for</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, but not what I tought I was expecting ultrasonic device, according to some internet reviews but this is only a (nice) spinning brush like Olay&#x27;s ($ 15) or many other far much less expensive option. Keep it tought to avoid shipping fees and hassle.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing brush.  I am 66 years old, have dry, sensitive skin, so I was apprehensive in using a product like this.  I cannot use scrubs or peels, but this works great for me.  I use it at night every other day and it leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This brush is gentle but thorough and not real expensive. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Have been using it every other day.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel smooth. Gets rid of all makeup left behind. Only takes a minute to use.</li>
            <li> This was a chap imitation of a cleansing brush.  The bristles don&#x27;t measure up to other cleansing brushes. The mechanics of the motor seem cheaply made as well</li>
            <li> New and a very good price too.</li>
            <li> Nice size for travel.  Works well</li>
            <li> Not that great - it stopped working mid-cycle and then was fine the next time, and the next time it stopped again. Maybe just a defective one? Hmmm. All I know is that I refuse to pay $200 for a Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> I did like this, but made the mistake of leaving it in my shower. Water leaked in and ruined the batteries. Sooo it doesn&#x27;t work now.  I guess my fault, but I hadn&#x27;t read anything advising not to do this.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! My face is SO soft and I have noticed a better complexion over all. I would recommend this product to anybody!</li>
            <li> Good product for the prize</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas present  from my husband through a representative.  Amazon is cheaper, but I want to help out another woman making a living.  She treated me to a sample of the microdermabrasion timewise 1, 2, 3 sample and gift wrapped it too to make it easier on my old man.  LOL.  Well, the combination of that brush and those products has totally evened out my skin tone.  Im 51 and had blotchy spots and some old sun damage and I can tell you that the tone of my skin is even now.  Skin feels very smooth.  These sorts of things always seemed gimmicky to me but I feel it is totally worthwhile and i just dust a little bare minerals foundation powder on and my skin looks good.  I used to have to slather on foundation.  Given the old rule that the older you are the less makeup you should use I feel like I am going in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I will have to add an update after I&#x27;ve had it for a month but I just received it today from amazon.com and it&#x27;s exceeded my expectations.  I do not have anything to compare it to as this is the first skin brush I&#x27;ve ever utilized.  But at least in terms of this particular item, it has two speeds and it rotates in circles (vs. vibrating like other similar products and I find the circular motion much more beneficial).  I find it to be VERY quiet.  The brushes are soft but not too soft.  It comes with directions on ideal usage for your face.  It is very light and has a matt feel to the outside which is nice as you can easily grip it and it won&#x27;t slide around like it might if it had a glossy finish to it.  It looks really nice, too.  I would highly recommend this as a purchase for someone looking for an affordable, quality battery operated cleansing brush for your face.  It also does come with the necessary batteries to set it up the first time which is also nice!  It also comes with two extra heads which I believe should be replaced every 3 months or so if used daily.</li>
            <li> Love it! A little abrasive on the high power mode... Maybe I just need to get used to using a brush?</li>
            <li> I like this, but it stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> great job my skin feels smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> Works great and seems to get my skin very clean without irritation.</li>
            <li> I love Love love this product, my face is smoother and the skin tone has evened out, however you should really purchase directly from a Mary Kay Consultant, that way they can assure you that it is a BRAND NEW product. Also according to Mary Kay this is an illegal Sale. I just want everyone to have the opportunity of having their own Consultant that can assure the products they are given are brand new!!!!</li>
