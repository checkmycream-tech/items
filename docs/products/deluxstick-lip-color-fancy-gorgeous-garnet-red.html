            <li> Beautiful!!! It&#x27;s perfect for my skin tone!!! Reba and Brett has outdone themselves!!! Can&#x27;t wait for more colors!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice color, should match most skin tones.  Nice and light and does not smell like a lot of lipsticks out there do. Feels good on but it&#x27;s not as perminent as it&#x27;s made out to be.  It&#x27;s advertised as a gloss/stain, but not seeing the stain part of it.</li>
            <li> This goes on light and it works all day. I would get more of this it the best one out there</li>
            <li> Excellent color and texture.  Loving it !!</li>

            <li> I was so excited when I found out Reba was teaming with Brett on a lipstick!!! I love that it&#x27;s smooth and creamy. Perfect color!!! Can&#x27;t wait for more!!!&lt;br /&gt;I made a video on it here: https://youtu.be/u6tmaJyEMVg</li>
            <li> Excellent service and quick delivery...love the product...stays on long and the color gives off a soft glow!</li>
            <li> Seller excellent. I like the color and texture of the lipstick. However, each time I use it, a bit of it breaks off and I get a big &amp;#34;blob&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s quite soft.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Loved the color and the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Can&#x27;t wait for more colors!!!</li>

            <li> Absolutely love. So soft and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Color was not as expected. It was a dull brick red.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick--best I&#x27;ve ever found!  I actually don&#x27;t use makeup because of skin irritation, etc.  So happy to find this lipstick.  It does not irritate  and stays on quite a long while.  I do not wear it daily--as I don&#x27;t wear makeup - but love it when I do use it.  It is now the only lipstick I have</li>
            <li> I love this!! It smells good and it can be worn at anytime. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Nice color, but does not last long.</li>
            <li> I was loving this lipstick and would have given it 5 stars until today.  It seems that every time I apply it, it breaks apart and I get a blob of it on my lips.  It has been wonderful until today.  Not sure what the problem is.  I love the color and own both colors that Reba has but I am not sure if I want to spend the money on the next one if it is going to be doing the same thing.</li>
            <li> Leave it to Reba and Brett to hit a homerun again! This is not tested on animals, the color is great and it goes on so smooth. Great product!</li>
