    <ol>
            <li>This the perfect shade of gray!  </li>
            <li>Finally, a really perfect eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect color!!</li>
            <li>Perfect match for my salt and pepper hair color.</li>
            <li>It is just perfect.  </li>
            <li>This one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product!  </li>
            <li>The gray goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li>Also great for brows, of course.</li>
            <li>The color is great, however.</li>
            <li>Great color for salt &amp; pepper hair also.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy, though.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;d be happier if it were a bit lighter, I&#x27;ve learned to adjust my pressure to get a good color.  </li>
            <li>Love the pencil!</li>
            <li>I have already ordered two more, in case they get discontinued!</li>
            <li>Its a decent pencil, the color is perfect for me</li>
            <li>Also, great light color for light complexion.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought 2 pencils because shipping from Korea takes forever.</li>
            <li>I am ordering 2 more today as I seem to have the knack for</li>
            <li>I love this product and have re-ordered more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he was pleased also.</li>
            <li>Where I work, it can get quite warm and I sweat primarily on my head and forehead.  </li>
            <li>I still have eyebrows at the end of the day :)</li>
            <li>The angled tip makes it easy to apply to my brows and the brush corrects any mistakes I might make.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, stays on</li>
            <li>Other than that, which doesn&#x27;t matter to me at all, the pencil makes a great color on my eyebrows, light gray, which goes well with my silver hair.</li>
            <li>something right off the market!</li>
            <li>I have silver/grey hair and like many women my age very skimpy brows.  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural--much better than the browns on me.</li>
            <li>This is a very good neutral eyebrow pencil; I just wish it went on a little bit more smoothly with a little more intensity of color.</li>
            <li>It really stays on and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are not inexpensive but worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a  local distributor.</li>
            <li>-&lt;br /&gt;NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I thought Maybelline&#x27;s was the best (charcoal grey), but this beats theirs by a long shot!</li>
            <li>It is handy to have the brush right there in the same implement!</li>
            <li>it was pretty waxy, and I didn&#x27;t think I would like that.  </li>
            <li>Also, possibly the waxiness was mostly on the surface, because I really don&#x27;t notice it now.  </li>
            <li>Very high tech eyebrow pencil with brush attachment.</li>
            <li>The perfect soft grey to go with my, mostly white, long curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMille.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I&#x27;m softening a spot with the brush, too much will come off and I have to do it again.</li>
            <li>Brand New, love the dark charcoal with my gray hair, looks like I have real eyebrows again!</li>
            <li>While the staying power of this pencil is pretty good (I have really dry skin and have to slather on plenty of moisturizer before applying), the color is not quite as dark as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised the first I wore.  </li>
            <li>Clever pencils with brushes at the end.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a true grey pencil and it is more black.  </li>
            <li>It arrives fast, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>It is a very soft, almost too creamy eyebrow twist-up style pencil.  </li>
            <li>This looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Then I follow with a fine black line at lash roots.</li>
            <li>I have had difficulty finding a nice, soft gray pencil that is firm enough to draw nice, thin strokes for my brows.  </li>
            <li>You can have it light, as I prefer, or darker, just by how much you put on and how hard you press while you are putting it on.  </li>
            <li>Most grey eyebrow makeup is too dark as is anything in the brown family and blonds</li>
            <li>I only have 1/2 eyebrow on 1 side and this really blends in.</li>
            <li>I have spent a fortune looking for the right shade to match my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have silvery salt &amp; pepper hair, so the light taupe or blond eye brow make up shades are too brown to look right and black is far too harsh.  </li>
            <li>Because of previous experience with &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; eyebrow pencils, I expected it would be too dark, but it turns out lightness or darkness is easily controlled through the application.  </li>

            <li> At long last...</li>
            <li> , this medium grey works quite well.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get here because it comes from Germany.  </li>
            <li> I need something in a Lighter grey.</li>
            <li> Not too soft or hard.</li>
            <li> NOT AS WATERPROOF AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than I expected - about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not too dark.</li>
            <li> If you get any little clumps, the brush end works them out.</li>
            <li> Picture is a little deceiving; you get just one pencil.</li>
            <li> The powder might be a little easier to control.</li>
            <li> Usually eyebrow pencil has to be reapplied after dancing, due to all the rubbing on your partner.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had a really difficult time finding a pencil that would do what this one does.</li>
            <li> That was disappointing.</li>

            <li> I have silver/grey hair and like many women my age very skimpy brows.  Most grey eyebrow makeup is too dark as is anything in the brown family and blonds tend to red, this medium grey works quite well.  Glad I bought 2 pencils because shipping from Korea takes forever.</li>
            <li> These are not inexpensive but worth the money.  The gray goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li> This the perfect shade of gray!  I thought Maybelline&#x27;s was the best (charcoal grey), but this beats theirs by a long shot!</li>
            <li> I love the color, but the consistency is a bit clumpy and difficult to get the color on.</li>
            <li> Finally! The perfect soft grey to go with my, mostly white, long curls. The angled tip makes it easy to apply to my brows and the brush corrects any mistakes I might make. I am ordering 2 more today as I seem to have the knack for&lt;br /&gt;loving something right off the market!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have re-ordered more.  It takes a long time to get here because it comes from Germany.  It would be nice to have a  local distributor.</li>

In addition, the point is fairly dull and there isn&#x27;t really any way to sharpen it, which makes control a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> Sigh. At long last...I have found my coveted gray brow color and will no longer have caterpillar brows. I can go out of the house now. I can mingle with the in crowds. I&#x27;m ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMille.</li>
            <li> Its a decent pencil, the color is perfect for me but it is not waterproof. That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Clever pencils with brushes at the end. Also, great light color for light complexion.</li>
            <li> NOT AS WATERPROOF AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> This is a perfect color!! Love the pencil!</li>
            <li> Not too soft or hard. If you get any little clumps, the brush end works them out. Looks very natural--much better than the browns on me. I ordered 8/20, and it came 8/29! Picture is a little deceiving; you get just one pencil. I like to put it over eyeshadow primer, as a shadow-type eyeliner. Then I follow with a fine black line at lash roots. Also great for brows, of course. I want to try a gray powder and see which I prefer. The powder might be a little easier to control. Sometimes when I&#x27;m softening a spot with the brush, too much will come off and I have to do it again. This is a good buy, though. It arrives fast, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune looking for the right shade to match my hair.  I had to purchase from China!</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised the first I wore.  The eyebrow pencil did not rub all on anything, and did&#x27;nt worry about it rubbing off while I was dancing.  Usually eyebrow pencil has to be reapplied after dancing, due to all the rubbing on your partner.  I&#x27;m sure he was pleased also.</li>
            <li> I do not like the color at all. I will not be using it.</li>
            <li> It is a very soft, almost too creamy eyebrow twist-up style pencil.  The color is great, however.</li>
            <li> Perfect match for my salt and pepper hair color.</li>
            <li> It is just perfect.  It blends well with my mainly white and some iron gray hair.  It is handy to have the brush right there in the same implement!</li>
            <li> Very high tech eyebrow pencil with brush attachment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find gray for eyebrows.  Although I&#x27;d be happier if it were a bit lighter, I&#x27;ve learned to adjust my pressure to get a good color.  Where I work, it can get quite warm and I sweat primarily on my head and forehead.  No problem!  I still have eyebrows at the end of the day :)</li>
            <li> This is a very good neutral eyebrow pencil; I just wish it went on a little bit more smoothly with a little more intensity of color.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than I expected - about 3 weeks.  Packaged well, and came intact. Brand New, love the dark charcoal with my gray hair, looks like I have real eyebrows again!</li>
            <li> This looks very natural. I only have 1/2 eyebrow on 1 side and this really blends in. Great color for salt &amp; pepper hair also. Not too dark. Perfection!!!</li>
            <li> I have silvery salt &amp; pepper hair, so the light taupe or blond eye brow make up shades are too brown to look right and black is far too harsh.  I have had difficulty finding a nice, soft gray pencil that is firm enough to draw nice, thin strokes for my brows.  This one is perfect.  I have already ordered two more, in case they get discontinued!</li>
            <li> WAY OVERPRICED !!!!&lt;br /&gt;WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN -&lt;br /&gt;NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> This was a surprise to me.  Because of previous experience with &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; eyebrow pencils, I expected it would be too dark, but it turns out lightness or darkness is easily controlled through the application.  You can have it light, as I prefer, or darker, just by how much you put on and how hard you press while you are putting it on.  Another surprise relates, I think, to the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; aspect.  I noticed immediately it was pretty waxy, and I didn&#x27;t think I would like that.  However, I realized that the waxiness might be necessary to help make it waterproof.  Also, possibly the waxiness was mostly on the surface, because I really don&#x27;t notice it now.  It may or may not actually be waterproof.  I use plain water on a washcloth on my face before I use my makeup remover, and the eyebrow makeup comes off before I use the remover.  That may be a function of using the washcloth--maybe it wipes it off.  So I can&#x27;t address that feature.  Other than that, which doesn&#x27;t matter to me at all, the pencil makes a great color on my eyebrows, light gray, which goes well with my silver hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It really stays on and is easy to use.</li>
