            <li>Really good product!</li>
            <li>It worked great.  </li>
            <li>This did that great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to those pore strips.  </li>
            <li>Great Mask.  </li>
            <li>I have heard great things about this product.  </li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t great for me.</li>
            <li>but it did a great job on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>No joke, this mask did not remove ANY of my blackheads, whereas Biore strips do a great job.  </li>
            <li>My expectations were greatly exceeded.</li>
            <li>Give it time and you will be happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and works great.</li>
            <li>great product.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is it does smell good!</li>
            <li>My skin is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff was amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it smells nice and works well!</li>
            <li>how many days you should leave in between to use it again so you must give it your best shot.</li>
            <li>The good news is I think I hacked this routine to make it better: the Leonie mask works best if you use it in COMBINATION with a clay or mud mask.</li>
            <li>I, too, received a coupon for 50% off if I posted a good review...</li>
            <li>cleans out my pores really good.</li>
            <li>loved it.  </li>
            <li>so, good for you.</li>
            <li>I got it on time and in good condition</li>
            <li>I have realized now why some people give it good reviews</li>
            <li>The best part of this mask is that it is so fun to peel off!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great,</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product, great for removing blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>much better than Biore Strips, great alternative to what I get a Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product and will be ordering more when I start to run out.</li>
            <li>The best way to start the peeling process is to smile or scrunch your face.</li>
            <li>I am ordering more!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Much better than Biore pore strips!</li>
            <li>purchased it and i absolutely love !</li>
            <li>Completely in love with this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The first day of using this product I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Ok!</li>
            <li>smooth and does the job - great product</li>
            <li>Not as effective as others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels good, is effective for helping to get rid of flaky skins and makes my pimples feel better.</li>
            <li>If you just spread it over your skin without massaging it in its not as effective.</li>
            <li>skin feels nice afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the quite as effective as biore strips even after leaving it on your fase for and hour.</li>
            <li>I liked using this blackhead peel off mask.</li>
            <li>This mask also has a nice scent, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at a loss for why this has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>All in all I am very satisfied and CANNOT WAIT to try it out on my face after my chemical peel is done peeling &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It arrived on the day it was supposed to and was very effective in making my face feel clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Removes almost everything, and its very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it a couple of times, I can honestly say it‚Äôs better than the Boscia one.</li>
            <li>Warm water and a packet of gelatin works much more efficiently.</li>
            <li>I liked the satisfying pullling sensation when I peeled it off.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the more effective it is.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>Any residual mask was easily removed with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell really strongly but smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I just apply a nice layer on my face and wait about 20 min, and easily peel it off, leaving a nice cool freshing feeling on my face as well the easy painless removal of blackheads!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Retin-A and Proactiv off and on for about five years to handle them, but am always looking to go one better.    </li>
            <li>So, my recommendation is to start with this wacky Leonie mask.</li>
            <li>If it dries your skin out, well...you can&#x27;t have everything. :-)</li>
            <li>My uploaded photo definitely isn&#x27;t as elegant as their stock photos, but it works as promised :)</li>
            <li>Love its name üíúüíúüíúüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç</li>
            <li>okay most of the time, but sometimes they can inflame my my skin.</li>
            <li>It felt great and my pores look much improved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Biore strips before and they&#x27;ve worked better than this product (pulls out a lot of my blackheads).</li>
            <li>Just okay...</li>
            <li>I honestly love it.  </li>
            <li>Its OK...</li>
            <li>Needs to pull more out of pores.</li>
            <li>I seriously am in love with it.</li>
            <li>Biore nose strips do better</li>
            <li>work better.  </li>
            <li>the better my face felt afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this shiz again for sure.</li>
            <li>Works better then anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your face well before applying.</li>
            <li>Guys and girls give it a chance and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of beauty products for the removal of blackheads , some worked ok , some didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>This is just okay.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite face treatment.</li>
            <li>If I had more time for a skincare routine, I&#x27;d use it after I shower.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it in the morning and at night for better results.</li>
            <li>Lovely masque.</li>
            <li>It works okay.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a skin peel more then</li>
            <li>product does not pull many blackheads out of my skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I have blackheads, like most people, around my nose and on my chin.</li>
            <li>Love the feeling of my face.</li>
            <li>Pore strips are way better.</li>
            <li>but if you just want to try a nice face peel this one is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I do know that it leaves her skin feeling very clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>FYI-I have experienced this kind of reaction from nail salon odors at a hair salon once and then again years later from nail salon odors that had migrated into an adjacent chiropractic office.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how smooth and bright my skin looked after the first use.</li>
            <li>But COOL!  </li>
            <li>the pores on my nose get clogged easily.  </li>
            <li>product goes on easily and comes off okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes, I easily peeled this mask off of my face</li>
            <li>The order came very quick.</li>
            <li>removed blackheads easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and tear off.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and to remove.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>So strong that one night my sister asked what that smell was</li>
            <li>Works better than those competitor&#x27;s pore strips and you get many more uses out of the tube since you control how much product to use each time.</li>
            <li>I love this product very easy and can do my whole face at one time as opposed 2 giving sections at a time.</li>
            <li>so I have some very fine wrinkles on my forehead and on my smile lines.</li>
            <li>I have used many Blackhead removers in the past and this is the best to date.</li>
            <li>Awesome product had a black head that would not go away</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s fine because the job it did was fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I noticed a huge difference even after just one use.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is a HUGE plus for me).</li>
            <li>When you hold it up to the light you can see stuff that you didn&#x27;t realize was sitting in your skin.  </li>
            <li>She had the baby smooth skin she should have.</li>
            <li>She liked it so much she tried it on me</li>
            <li>Great at removing blackheads and impurities while not hurting your wallet at the same time!</li>
            <li>After using this it was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>My nose has never been so blackhead free.</li>
            <li>It feels really sticky, and peels off nicely.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>He primarily uses Proactive + products which when used twice a day, help to keep his breakouts under control.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It is great for the whole family and really does pull embedded dirt out of pores.  </li>
            <li>So far though, not quite as good as strips for removing blackheads -</li>
            <li>This resulted in my skin becoming super congested and breaking out.</li>
            <li>The mask doesn&#x27;t lift as many sebum plugs as one reviewer stated but it works great for removing all other dirt and grime on my face.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your face first and then apply with a fingertip.  </li>
            <li>It works best if you take the time to massage it into your skin in small sections.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s fun to peel off!</li>
            <li>When using this mask, those wrinkles lines are significantly diminished.</li>
            <li>Works ok, definitely does not remove most blackheads, just top layer of dry/dead skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different masks and this one works the best by far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a striking black color, kind of entertaining.  </li>
            <li>think that the only reason this product has lots of good reviews is because they put an offer in the box, bribing you to leave good feedback in exchange to a significant discount on a 2nd bottle (50% I think) if you order again.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about trying this</li>
            <li>So I was super excited when I came across this item</li>
            <li>masks go, I&#x27;ve had better for a much cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The whole family is using this product and we love it.</li>
            <li>For me, the more i used the easier it was to peel off as one whole mask and</li>
            <li>The only way I would love this product more is if it was paraben free.</li>
            <li>so i have no reason to leave a good review for 50% of my next purchase</li>
            <li>work nearly as well as the bore nose strips, but its a nice alternative to use every now and then.</li>
            <li>Left over residue can be easily removed with warm water.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Gives skin a clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>No offensive smell, easy clean up and really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>It is super sticky and doesn&#x27;t come off in one pull...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it does really, but it feels nice and isn&#x27;t drying at all.  </li>
            <li>even though it dries quickly, I didn&#x27;t mind leaving it on longer.</li>
            <li>WARNING-Noxious odor akin to nail salon glue or super elastic bubble plastic (from 1970s).</li>
            <li>Dries really quick, also.</li>
            <li>I think a warm shower with gentle exfoliation has been as effective as other methods (like an exfoliating mask.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is Black in Color though LOL</li>
            <li>SUPER fun to peel</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it leaves my face feeling amazingly smooth and really dries up oil quickly on my face.</li>
            <li>but I must say it makes my skin feel very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The results are pretty similar (brightened skin, removes blackheads) but this one dries much faster, smells better but most importantly</li>
            <li>BUT it is not so effective in deep cleaning for blackheads.</li>
            <li>You can make fun of me</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin that breaks out from most products.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural, so hopefully it&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li>It is fun to peel off the mask and then see all the stuff it&#x27;s pulled out.</li>
            <li>The blackheads were still somewhat visible, but after using this they were completely easy to cover up using my normal powder foundation.</li>
            <li>It definitely works, but the Biore strips seemed to clean out my pores better.</li>
            <li>I threw it right in the trash.</li>
            <li>Which makes sense right</li>
            <li>The blackhead removal was noticiable right after the peel off.</li>
            <li>Not messy at all if you apply it properly with your own finger, came off easily.</li>
            <li>Paper towel needed) and you need a some what large amount for full coverage.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best blackhead remover ever, other will imitate but will not get near this product.</li>
            <li>This isnt that great for those of you who have really deep blackheads, because, to remove around 30% of your blackheads you should frist put some water heat to your face to open up the pores and then apply the mask.</li>
            <li>Oh - the mask peeled off easily and there was no pain (I&#x27;m also quite sensitive to pain if that gives you an idea.)</li>
            <li>it a try because of the positive reviews on Amazon, and this mask is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>You have to spread it on pretty quick as it dries fairly fast.</li>
            <li>For me, this was the perfect balance of a strong enough product to really work but not too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But after my first time using it</li>
            <li>It actually cleaned better than anything ever has.    </li>
            <li>This mask does make my skin feel soft and smooth after using</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was able to peel off the layer of flaky skin that has appeared on my face after the wintry weather, but not enough to pull off the hairs.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my nose and followed the instructions exactly and when I removed the film after the required time it basically did nothing.  </li>
            <li>Overall the product is pretty cool &amp; smooth going on.  </li>
            <li>but if your skin is oily and needs a deep cleaning keep looking for a better product.</li>
            <li>and it worked really well!</li>
            <li>will definitely be purchasing this again. :)</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping that it would work better than Biore pore strips, which work well for me but only come in strips</li>
            <li>It arrived yesterday, and I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This was the first peel off mask i have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>It was my first time using it.</li>
            <li>i showered with hot water, and even steamed my face afterwards to be sure my pores were open.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it , it took two applications to do the job.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this product!</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t mind too much!</li>
            <li>Peeled off okay, but did not remove skin cells and blackheads like regular ol&#x27; gelatin.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>and I had much, much softer skin!</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty intense, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but it works really well!</li>
            <li>I just tried it for the first time and my face is softer looking</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a change right away</li>
            <li>My face feels clean, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to peel off (warm washcloth does the trick with the little pieces left over).  </li>
            <li>If your skin is stubborn like mine it will be rosy and clean and nearly blackhead-free.    </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s strong enough to pull out most of the tiny ones people are having.  </li>
            <li>But a small price to pay in my opinion as it works fairly well and is not expensive.</li>
            <li>makes your skin feel super soft!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after reading a positive review on a beauty blog.  </li>
            <li>It brings some blackheads closer to the surface (after I wash my face, I find that removing them requires less pressure), but the product does not on its own remove all of them.     </li>
            <li>First, the product should include clearer instructions - I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I can apply this mask on a wet face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any black heads, but was effective in removing surface oils and &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;, but not the oils in my nose or cheek areas.</li>
            <li>A strong smell of what can only be described of as burnt plastic until it dries.  </li>
            <li>I put it on pretty thick and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as the Biore to pull out your blackheads if you have a lot of it and the deep ones.  </li>
            <li>and then it largely pulls out peach fuzz that no one saw and doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling very clean and soft!</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li>: you don‚Äôt need to put a whole lot for it to work.</li>
            <li>I Couldn&#x27;t believe how much blackheads this removes from my nose,</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the company customer service contacted me asking for a feed back</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>but I expected it to work better.</li>
            <li>product goes on face well and dries fast...</li>
            <li>This product worked very well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not so much that I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, and it really cleans my pores.</li>
            <li>said and cleansed my face beforehand, but this did absolutely nothing to my blackheads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are really trying to pull out blackheads</li>
            <li>and it really did the trick.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to really remove blackheads</li>
            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>and it really does help your skin out.</li>
            <li>It goes on, dries, and peels off -- but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for blackheads.</li>
            <li>Maybe mine are just really stubborn?</li>
            <li>I find you need to put a heavy dose of the Boscia one for it to be effective</li>
            <li>I should have thought of that on my own, but next time I will definitely try that.  </li>
            <li>Dried quickly and peel off was easy.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting more regarding removal of my blackheads after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it&#x27;s said to be better than biore or any other strips.</li>
            <li>This is better than the Biore where it has vitamin and other stuffs that makes your skin a lot smoother..</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would clean my pores without making them bigger.  </li>
            <li>(apparently some parts of my face are too warm to keep it from ever drying--it stays wet and sticky and has to be rolled off with my fingers)</li>
            <li>It washes off your finger easily with soap and water, but once on the face it takes about 20-30minutes to fully dry without using a fan or heater to assist.</li>
            <li>Within 10 minutes it is dry and you can peel off easily.  </li>
            <li>Once dry it peels off quite easy, and yet still manages to grab &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; on your skin that does NOT belong there.</li>
            <li>Just a dab goes a long way, and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Not sure how I feel about that, so I&#x27;ll be honest.     </li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my husbands back because it&#x27;s FULL of blackheads.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product overall.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry at all, and removed a huge amount.</li>
            <li>a black head remover, I&#x27;m gonna say that pore strips are much more efficient</li>
            <li>I love walking around with a black mask on.</li>
            <li>Love the black mash a lot, but it doesnt work.</li>
            <li>I do think it does a decent job of clearing the pores.  </li>
            <li>The blackhead remover left my skin clear and blackhead free.</li>
            <li>Until my mid-30s, I thought my acne problems had been confined to a couple of rounds of Accutane in high school.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of its high rated customer reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>you need to do is clean your face and dry it off and rub this product where you need it.</li>
            <li>I used it on clean dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will try to write another review once I have used this product a few more times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be a life long user unless something better comes along.</li>
            <li>As a college kid, I break out a lot from eating spicy food, and normally that results in blackheads.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have enough product on to pull off when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li>I like it only because it&#x27;s convenient to put on, wish it was strong enough to pull out my pesky blackheads.</li>
            <li>I am used to the Biore strips, which you can actually see work (it will pull the blackheads right out of your skin</li>
            <li>( so excited I spent $26).</li>
            <li>I have tried just about everything to remove the blackheads on my nose and figured it was just something I was going to have to live with until my friend tried it and told me about it.</li>
            <li>but you live</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent peel away mask, but it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s advertised to do, and quite frankly as far as peel away</li>
            <li>I gave this product three stars mostly because, although it cleans the skin and generally cleans out the pores, it doesn&#x27;t remove black heads as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also black and hard to clean up as it kind of sticks to everything.</li>
            <li>I tried following it with the Proactiv Refining Mask (a white clay thing with sulfer), and the combo cleaned better than either one of them individually.</li>
            <li>I have used it different ways without washing my face , after a hot bath , and afterwashing my face</li>
            <li>This product does not work well at all, and was a complete wast of money!</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of peel-off mask, they are fun to use and much easier to remove than traditional masks.</li>
            <li>I used my Leonie blackhead remover mask for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>Got this as an alternative to using the comedone extractor for blackhead removal.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 uses in the span of two weeks: twice the first week the item arrived and once the second week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many blackhead removing products before in the past and nothing has ever come close to how well Leonie Blackhead remover peel off</li>
            <li>This time he took a shower first to open up his pores but still didn&#x27;t pull out anything.</li>
            <li>Once the allotted time has passed, it was dry and easy to peel off  starting on the jaw line and peeling upward.</li>
            <li>Biore pore strips trimmed down to fit in areas (like under the nose)</li>
            <li>have use it probably 4 times (full face) and still have almost the entire bottle left.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; fun to peel off, but it didn&#x27;t really leave my skin any clearer and didn&#x27;t remove any black heads</li>
            <li>I have had large pores and sebum buildup my entire life</li>
            <li>In two treatments her pores were clear and minimized.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to clear skin.</li>
            <li>After taking the mask off, use a cotton ball to swipe the lotion(toner) onto your face as exfoliation, and it makes your skin feel so soft, like a mini spa</li>
            <li>just wow.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>it did not eally remove  as much the blackheads as I want, especially on my nose.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this mask and how well it works.  </li>
            <li>do not waste your money this product did bot  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it and if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>,I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for making a product that actually works for blackheads.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Wow this works as advertised.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and finicky-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old</li>
            <li>I cannot discern what ingredient is so offensive, but I developed a headache and decided to return it rather than risk another exposure.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, expecially if you use it only on problem areas the bottle will last.</li>
            <li>This mask is fun, it looks crazy but feels nice.  </li>
            <li>You will feel a slight coolness on the skin along with mild tightness.</li>
            <li>I could see his blackheads and dead skin come off right away!</li>
            <li>Only using this for the 2nd time and so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Though it has not removed any of my blackheads, it has left a black residue in pores that were clean.  </li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t decide whether it wants to be dry or oily.</li>
            <li>Left my skin VERY soft, and did remove peachfuz</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first two tries with only removal of some flaky skin and what little tiny fine hairs I have, the blackheads remained.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, but takes a little longer than I would prefer to dry.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a little splurge to have around when you want to scare your boyfriend when he gets home.</li>
            <li>For some masks, it&#x27;s too thin/fragile to peel off in one sheet, or it feels like it never dried properly</li>
            <li>I can actually see all the gunk on the mask after removing it (like in those old Biore commercials).</li>
            <li>This product is gentle enough that we used it on our 8 year old daughter who had some icky pores from not washing her face right and always playing outside in the dirt.</li>
            <li>I think that it has grabbed more blackheads each time - perhaps it had to clear away the the little hairs and dead skin in the first few uses?  </li>
            <li>After using the mask for the first time this week, not all, but some of the embedded black heads are gone.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too hard to clean off, but I&#x27;d still use just one finger to apply.</li>
            <li>The burning sensation lasts for the first few minutes.</li>
            <li>I am completely positive that this is just glue mixed with black latex paint.</li>
            <li>It really helps remove black heads and diminish the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li>I really like that this product is black.</li>
            <li>You‚Äôll know when it‚Äôs ready to peel off when it feels tight.</li>
            <li>I originally thought this was the black stuff that turned a white by pulling out the black heads/white heads.</li>
            <li>I am very active and work many late hours as a 911 - system EMT</li>
            <li>First, cost per use is way lower for this - a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>After using I have no more blackheads and my skin is very soft!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A very good product that I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> All in all, a very good product, and</li>

            <li> Really good product!</li>
            <li> It worked great.  </li>
            <li> This did that great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to those pore strips.  </li>
            <li> Great Mask.  </li>
            <li> I have heard great things about this product.  </li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t great for me.</li>
            <li> but it did a great job on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> No joke, this mask did not remove ANY of my blackheads, whereas Biore strips do a great job.  </li>
            <li> My expectations were greatly exceeded.</li>
            <li> Give it time and you will be happy with the results.  </li>

            <li> This stuff was amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it smells nice and works well!</li>
            <li> how many days you should leave in between to use it again so you must give it your best shot.</li>
            <li> The good news is I think I hacked this routine to make it better: the Leonie mask works best if you use it in COMBINATION with a clay or mud mask.</li>
            <li> I, too, received a coupon for 50% off if I posted a good review...</li>
            <li> cleans out my pores really good.</li>
            <li> loved it.  </li>
            <li> so, good for you.</li>
            <li> I got it on time and in good condition</li>
            <li> I have realized now why some people give it good reviews</li>
            <li> The best part of this mask is that it is so fun to peel off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great,</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great for removing blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> much better than Biore Strips, great alternative to what I get a Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product and will be ordering more when I start to run out.</li>
            <li> The best way to start the peeling process is to smile or scrunch your face.</li>
            <li> I am ordering more!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Much better than Biore pore strips!</li>
            <li> purchased it and i absolutely love !</li>
            <li> Completely in love with this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The first day of using this product I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Ok!</li>
            <li> smooth and does the job - great product</li>
            <li> Not as effective as others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels good, is effective for helping to get rid of flaky skins and makes my pimples feel better.</li>
            <li> If you just spread it over your skin without massaging it in its not as effective.</li>
            <li> skin feels nice afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the quite as effective as biore strips even after leaving it on your fase for and hour.</li>
            <li> I liked using this blackhead peel off mask.</li>
            <li> This mask also has a nice scent, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at a loss for why this has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> All in all I am very satisfied and CANNOT WAIT to try it out on my face after my chemical peel is done peeling &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It arrived on the day it was supposed to and was very effective in making my face feel clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Removes almost everything, and its very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it a couple of times, I can honestly say it‚Äôs better than the Boscia one.</li>
            <li> Warm water and a packet of gelatin works much more efficiently.</li>
            <li> I liked the satisfying pullling sensation when I peeled it off.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the more effective it is.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> Any residual mask was easily removed with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell really strongly but smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I just apply a nice layer on my face and wait about 20 min, and easily peel it off, leaving a nice cool freshing feeling on my face as well the easy painless removal of blackheads!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Retin-A and Proactiv off and on for about five years to handle them, but am always looking to go one better.    </li>
            <li> So, my recommendation is to start with this wacky Leonie mask.</li>
            <li> If it dries your skin out, well...you can&#x27;t have everything. :-)</li>
            <li> My uploaded photo definitely isn&#x27;t as elegant as their stock photos, but it works as promised :)</li>
            <li> Love its name üíúüíúüíúüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç</li>
            <li> okay most of the time, but sometimes they can inflame my my skin.</li>
            <li> It felt great and my pores look much improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Biore strips before and they&#x27;ve worked better than this product (pulls out a lot of my blackheads).</li>
            <li> Just okay...</li>
            <li> I honestly love it.  </li>
            <li> Its OK...</li>
            <li> Needs to pull more out of pores.</li>
            <li> I seriously am in love with it.</li>
            <li> Biore nose strips do better</li>
            <li> work better.  </li>
            <li> the better my face felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy this shiz again for sure.</li>
            <li> Works better then anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your face well before applying.</li>
            <li> Guys and girls give it a chance and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of beauty products for the removal of blackheads , some worked ok , some didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This is just okay.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite face treatment.</li>
            <li> If I had more time for a skincare routine, I&#x27;d use it after I shower.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it in the morning and at night for better results.</li>
            <li> Lovely masque.</li>
            <li> It works okay.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a skin peel more then</li>
            <li> product does not pull many blackheads out of my skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads, like most people, around my nose and on my chin.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of my face.</li>
            <li> Pore strips are way better.</li>
            <li> but if you just want to try a nice face peel this one is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I do know that it leaves her skin feeling very clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> FYI-I have experienced this kind of reaction from nail salon odors at a hair salon once and then again years later from nail salon odors that had migrated into an adjacent chiropractic office.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how smooth and bright my skin looked after the first use.</li>
            <li> But COOL!  </li>
            <li> the pores on my nose get clogged easily.  </li>
            <li> product goes on easily and comes off okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes, I easily peeled this mask off of my face</li>
            <li> The order came very quick.</li>
            <li> removed blackheads easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and tear off.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and to remove.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> So strong that one night my sister asked what that smell was</li>
            <li> Works better than those competitor&#x27;s pore strips and you get many more uses out of the tube since you control how much product to use each time.</li>
            <li> I love this product very easy and can do my whole face at one time as opposed 2 giving sections at a time.</li>
            <li> so I have some very fine wrinkles on my forehead and on my smile lines.</li>
            <li> I have used many Blackhead removers in the past and this is the best to date.</li>
            <li> Awesome product had a black head that would not go away</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s fine because the job it did was fantastic.</li>
            <li> but I noticed a huge difference even after just one use.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is a HUGE plus for me).</li>
            <li> When you hold it up to the light you can see stuff that you didn&#x27;t realize was sitting in your skin.  </li>
            <li> She had the baby smooth skin she should have.</li>
            <li> She liked it so much she tried it on me</li>
            <li> Great at removing blackheads and impurities while not hurting your wallet at the same time!</li>
            <li> After using this it was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> My nose has never been so blackhead free.</li>
            <li> It feels really sticky, and peels off nicely.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> He primarily uses Proactive + products which when used twice a day, help to keep his breakouts under control.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It is great for the whole family and really does pull embedded dirt out of pores.  </li>
            <li> So far though, not quite as good as strips for removing blackheads -</li>
            <li> This resulted in my skin becoming super congested and breaking out.</li>
            <li> The mask doesn&#x27;t lift as many sebum plugs as one reviewer stated but it works great for removing all other dirt and grime on my face.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your face first and then apply with a fingertip.  </li>
            <li> It works best if you take the time to massage it into your skin in small sections.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s fun to peel off!</li>
            <li> When using this mask, those wrinkles lines are significantly diminished.</li>
            <li> Works ok, definitely does not remove most blackheads, just top layer of dry/dead skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different masks and this one works the best by far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a striking black color, kind of entertaining.  </li>
            <li> think that the only reason this product has lots of good reviews is because they put an offer in the box, bribing you to leave good feedback in exchange to a significant discount on a 2nd bottle (50% I think) if you order again.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about trying this</li>
            <li> So I was super excited when I came across this item</li>
            <li> masks go, I&#x27;ve had better for a much cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The whole family is using this product and we love it.</li>
            <li> For me, the more i used the easier it was to peel off as one whole mask and</li>
            <li> The only way I would love this product more is if it was paraben free.</li>
            <li> so i have no reason to leave a good review for 50% of my next purchase</li>
            <li> work nearly as well as the bore nose strips, but its a nice alternative to use every now and then.</li>
            <li> Left over residue can be easily removed with warm water.</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Gives skin a clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> No offensive smell, easy clean up and really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It is super sticky and doesn&#x27;t come off in one pull...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it does really, but it feels nice and isn&#x27;t drying at all.  </li>
            <li> even though it dries quickly, I didn&#x27;t mind leaving it on longer.</li>
            <li> WARNING-Noxious odor akin to nail salon glue or super elastic bubble plastic (from 1970s).</li>
            <li> Dries really quick, also.</li>
            <li> I think a warm shower with gentle exfoliation has been as effective as other methods (like an exfoliating mask.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is Black in Color though LOL</li>
            <li> SUPER fun to peel</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it leaves my face feeling amazingly smooth and really dries up oil quickly on my face.</li>
            <li> but I must say it makes my skin feel very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> The results are pretty similar (brightened skin, removes blackheads) but this one dries much faster, smells better but most importantly</li>
            <li> BUT it is not so effective in deep cleaning for blackheads.</li>
            <li> You can make fun of me</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin that breaks out from most products.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural, so hopefully it&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li> It is fun to peel off the mask and then see all the stuff it&#x27;s pulled out.</li>
            <li> The blackheads were still somewhat visible, but after using this they were completely easy to cover up using my normal powder foundation.</li>
            <li> It definitely works, but the Biore strips seemed to clean out my pores better.</li>
            <li> I threw it right in the trash.</li>
            <li> Which makes sense right</li>
            <li> The blackhead removal was noticiable right after the peel off.</li>
            <li> Not messy at all if you apply it properly with your own finger, came off easily.</li>
            <li> Paper towel needed) and you need a some what large amount for full coverage.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blackhead remover ever, other will imitate but will not get near this product.</li>
            <li> This isnt that great for those of you who have really deep blackheads, because, to remove around 30% of your blackheads you should frist put some water heat to your face to open up the pores and then apply the mask.</li>
            <li> Oh - the mask peeled off easily and there was no pain (I&#x27;m also quite sensitive to pain if that gives you an idea.)</li>
            <li> it a try because of the positive reviews on Amazon, and this mask is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> You have to spread it on pretty quick as it dries fairly fast.</li>
            <li> For me, this was the perfect balance of a strong enough product to really work but not too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But after my first time using it</li>
            <li> It actually cleaned better than anything ever has.    </li>
            <li> This mask does make my skin feel soft and smooth after using</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was able to peel off the layer of flaky skin that has appeared on my face after the wintry weather, but not enough to pull off the hairs.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my nose and followed the instructions exactly and when I removed the film after the required time it basically did nothing.  </li>
            <li> Overall the product is pretty cool &amp; smooth going on.  </li>
            <li> but if your skin is oily and needs a deep cleaning keep looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> and it worked really well!</li>
            <li> will definitely be purchasing this again. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping that it would work better than Biore pore strips, which work well for me but only come in strips</li>
            <li> It arrived yesterday, and I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> This was the first peel off mask i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> It was my first time using it.</li>
            <li> i showered with hot water, and even steamed my face afterwards to be sure my pores were open.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it , it took two applications to do the job.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this product!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t mind too much!</li>
            <li> Peeled off okay, but did not remove skin cells and blackheads like regular ol&#x27; gelatin.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> and I had much, much softer skin!</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty intense, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> but it works really well!</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time and my face is softer looking</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a change right away</li>
            <li> My face feels clean, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to peel off (warm washcloth does the trick with the little pieces left over).  </li>
            <li> If your skin is stubborn like mine it will be rosy and clean and nearly blackhead-free.    </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s strong enough to pull out most of the tiny ones people are having.  </li>
            <li> But a small price to pay in my opinion as it works fairly well and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel super soft!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading a positive review on a beauty blog.  </li>
            <li> It brings some blackheads closer to the surface (after I wash my face, I find that removing them requires less pressure), but the product does not on its own remove all of them.     </li>
            <li> First, the product should include clearer instructions - I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I can apply this mask on a wet face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any black heads, but was effective in removing surface oils and &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;, but not the oils in my nose or cheek areas.</li>
            <li> A strong smell of what can only be described of as burnt plastic until it dries.  </li>
            <li> I put it on pretty thick and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as the Biore to pull out your blackheads if you have a lot of it and the deep ones.  </li>
            <li> and then it largely pulls out peach fuzz that no one saw and doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling very clean and soft!</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li> : you don‚Äôt need to put a whole lot for it to work.</li>
            <li> I Couldn&#x27;t believe how much blackheads this removes from my nose,</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the company customer service contacted me asking for a feed back</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> but I expected it to work better.</li>
            <li> product goes on face well and dries fast...</li>
            <li> This product worked very well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not so much that I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, and it really cleans my pores.</li>
            <li> said and cleansed my face beforehand, but this did absolutely nothing to my blackheads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are really trying to pull out blackheads</li>
            <li> and it really did the trick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to really remove blackheads</li>
            <li> works really well.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> and it really does help your skin out.</li>
            <li> It goes on, dries, and peels off -- but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for blackheads.</li>
            <li> Maybe mine are just really stubborn?</li>
            <li> I find you need to put a heavy dose of the Boscia one for it to be effective</li>
            <li> I should have thought of that on my own, but next time I will definitely try that.  </li>
            <li> Dried quickly and peel off was easy.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting more regarding removal of my blackheads after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s said to be better than biore or any other strips.</li>
            <li> This is better than the Biore where it has vitamin and other stuffs that makes your skin a lot smoother..</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would clean my pores without making them bigger.  </li>
            <li> (apparently some parts of my face are too warm to keep it from ever drying--it stays wet and sticky and has to be rolled off with my fingers)</li>
            <li> It washes off your finger easily with soap and water, but once on the face it takes about 20-30minutes to fully dry without using a fan or heater to assist.</li>
            <li> Within 10 minutes it is dry and you can peel off easily.  </li>
            <li> Once dry it peels off quite easy, and yet still manages to grab &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; on your skin that does NOT belong there.</li>
            <li> Just a dab goes a long way, and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about that, so I&#x27;ll be honest.     </li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my husbands back because it&#x27;s FULL of blackheads.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product overall.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry at all, and removed a huge amount.</li>
            <li> a black head remover, I&#x27;m gonna say that pore strips are much more efficient</li>
            <li> I love walking around with a black mask on.</li>
            <li> Love the black mash a lot, but it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> I do think it does a decent job of clearing the pores.  </li>
            <li> The blackhead remover left my skin clear and blackhead free.</li>
            <li> Until my mid-30s, I thought my acne problems had been confined to a couple of rounds of Accutane in high school.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of its high rated customer reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> you need to do is clean your face and dry it off and rub this product where you need it.</li>
            <li> I used it on clean dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will try to write another review once I have used this product a few more times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be a life long user unless something better comes along.</li>
            <li> As a college kid, I break out a lot from eating spicy food, and normally that results in blackheads.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have enough product on to pull off when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> I like it only because it&#x27;s convenient to put on, wish it was strong enough to pull out my pesky blackheads.</li>
            <li> I am used to the Biore strips, which you can actually see work (it will pull the blackheads right out of your skin</li>
            <li> ( so excited I spent $26).</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything to remove the blackheads on my nose and figured it was just something I was going to have to live with until my friend tried it and told me about it.</li>
            <li> but you live</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent peel away mask, but it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s advertised to do, and quite frankly as far as peel away</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars mostly because, although it cleans the skin and generally cleans out the pores, it doesn&#x27;t remove black heads as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also black and hard to clean up as it kind of sticks to everything.</li>
            <li> I tried following it with the Proactiv Refining Mask (a white clay thing with sulfer), and the combo cleaned better than either one of them individually.</li>
            <li> I have used it different ways without washing my face , after a hot bath , and afterwashing my face</li>
            <li> This product does not work well at all, and was a complete wast of money!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of peel-off mask, they are fun to use and much easier to remove than traditional masks.</li>
            <li> I used my Leonie blackhead remover mask for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> Got this as an alternative to using the comedone extractor for blackhead removal.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 uses in the span of two weeks: twice the first week the item arrived and once the second week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many blackhead removing products before in the past and nothing has ever come close to how well Leonie Blackhead remover peel off</li>
            <li> This time he took a shower first to open up his pores but still didn&#x27;t pull out anything.</li>
            <li> Once the allotted time has passed, it was dry and easy to peel off  starting on the jaw line and peeling upward.</li>
            <li> Biore pore strips trimmed down to fit in areas (like under the nose)</li>
            <li> have use it probably 4 times (full face) and still have almost the entire bottle left.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; fun to peel off, but it didn&#x27;t really leave my skin any clearer and didn&#x27;t remove any black heads</li>
            <li> I have had large pores and sebum buildup my entire life</li>
            <li> In two treatments her pores were clear and minimized.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to clear skin.</li>
            <li> After taking the mask off, use a cotton ball to swipe the lotion(toner) onto your face as exfoliation, and it makes your skin feel so soft, like a mini spa</li>
            <li> just wow.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> it did not eally remove  as much the blackheads as I want, especially on my nose.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this mask and how well it works.  </li>
            <li> do not waste your money this product did bot  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it and if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> ,I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot for making a product that actually works for blackheads.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Wow this works as advertised.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and finicky-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old</li>
            <li> I cannot discern what ingredient is so offensive, but I developed a headache and decided to return it rather than risk another exposure.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, expecially if you use it only on problem areas the bottle will last.</li>
            <li> This mask is fun, it looks crazy but feels nice.  </li>
            <li> You will feel a slight coolness on the skin along with mild tightness.</li>
            <li> I could see his blackheads and dead skin come off right away!</li>
            <li> Only using this for the 2nd time and so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Though it has not removed any of my blackheads, it has left a black residue in pores that were clean.  </li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t decide whether it wants to be dry or oily.</li>
            <li> Left my skin VERY soft, and did remove peachfuz</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first two tries with only removal of some flaky skin and what little tiny fine hairs I have, the blackheads remained.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, but takes a little longer than I would prefer to dry.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a little splurge to have around when you want to scare your boyfriend when he gets home.</li>
            <li> For some masks, it&#x27;s too thin/fragile to peel off in one sheet, or it feels like it never dried properly</li>
            <li> I can actually see all the gunk on the mask after removing it (like in those old Biore commercials).</li>
            <li> This product is gentle enough that we used it on our 8 year old daughter who had some icky pores from not washing her face right and always playing outside in the dirt.</li>
            <li> I think that it has grabbed more blackheads each time - perhaps it had to clear away the the little hairs and dead skin in the first few uses?  </li>
            <li> After using the mask for the first time this week, not all, but some of the embedded black heads are gone.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too hard to clean off, but I&#x27;d still use just one finger to apply.</li>
            <li> The burning sensation lasts for the first few minutes.</li>
            <li> I am completely positive that this is just glue mixed with black latex paint.</li>
            <li> It really helps remove black heads and diminish the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> I really like that this product is black.</li>
            <li> You‚Äôll know when it‚Äôs ready to peel off when it feels tight.</li>
            <li> I originally thought this was the black stuff that turned a white by pulling out the black heads/white heads.</li>
            <li> I am very active and work many late hours as a 911 - system EMT</li>
            <li> First, cost per use is way lower for this - a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> After using I have no more blackheads and my skin is very soft!!!</li>
            <li> The other thing is that this mask is kind of expensive, but so are biore strips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong enough to pull out blackheads but adequate enough to pull out the little white fuzz.</li>
            <li> and when I use this in combination with some other skin products, my skin dries out, but that&#x27;s easily fixed with some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a lie i used the product for a month and decided to stop using it to see if any new black head would have been formed</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well for blackheads, but it did make my skin soft and pulled off the dead skin and little hairs.</li>
            <li> Nope, smear this mask on in a thin layer, but thick enough you can&#x27;t see your skin through it, and it peels off in one nice large sheet (with small pieces around the edge, but that&#x27;s ok).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always battled acne, especially due to all the garden work I do, and working in a greasy fast food restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must not keep it on long enough because I have never peeled the mask off.  </li>
            <li> I take a hot shower and then apply a thick coating to my nose,</li>
            <li> It leaves my sensitive skin a little tingly and red, but that goes away after washing.</li>
            <li> However, this was not a major issue and the product worked</li>
            <li> Wish they could make this clear instead of black.</li>
            <li> The only thing it has removed is dry skin.</li>
            <li> (I use it on my nose only) and wait for it to dry, then peel off.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly to remove a few blackhead I have on my nose, I did everything as per instruction but it din&#x27;t work,I do have a rash and dry face now.</li>
            <li> but it just simply was not strong enough for me apparently.</li>
            <li> I have tried nose strips and other facial mask countless times and never found a product like this!</li>
            <li> It maybe due to different skin&#x27;s nature of different people.</li>
            <li> but I do my best to make the terrible aspects of it less obvious.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t used it for long, so I don&#x27;t know how it will perform over time.</li>
            <li> I have gone so long without using anything like this</li>
            <li> takes about 15 different pulls before you get it off and when your done you need to get the rest off with a wet wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> It tends to dry fast in your hands (hard to wash off when still moist.</li>
            <li> which were present before starting the Proactive products less than a month ago.</li>
            <li> Second, there are other properties to the mask which nourish the skin.  </li>
            <li> One bottle goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> The one downside is that I&#x27;m prone to dry skin</li>
            <li> I have combination skin: oily nose with dry cheeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I learned from the service rep that this product should be applied on a dry face.  </li>
            <li> but it seemed to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I have about 100 blackheads on my nose and didn&#x27;t see a single one of them removed.</li>
            <li> I used this product as per the instruction and it couldn&#x27;t remove a single blackhead from my face.</li>
            <li> This product does not pull out even a single blackhead.  </li>
            <li> I actually found it really similar to other black peel away masks that I&#x27;ve had before, like the TrueBlue line that Bath and Body Works carries.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because it&#x27;s so different from anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry and then peeling is rough.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a pore type strip that was black - they are big in Asia.</li>
            <li> Be careful removing this mask...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a hassle getting it off my fingers, and you do want to get it off your fingers as soon as you are done applying the mask because the wet product stuck to your fingers</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars because sometimes it feels like its too thin or something, its not pulling as much as I would want it to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve left it on about 20 minutes or so, until it is all the way dried.  </li>
            <li> It definitely removes dead skin, leaving my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t have spent my money if i had known that it wouldn&#x27;t work on my face type.</li>
            <li> do not eel it off in the sink; when the pieces get wet, they tick (</li>
            <li> I used it after cleaning my face with African soap, dried and applied.</li>
            <li> Curiously, the product also FEELS like the superelastic bubble plastic and forms a stretchy plastic film on skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove those stubborn blackheads as stated on the bottle; instead it removes dead skin and those white fuzz as mentioned by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t reach for this product often because it is rather a hassle getting all the little bits of black off the face, especially closer to the hairline.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> 34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I did exactly what the instructions sad.</li>
            <li> It also made no difference for me other than to add a rash to my face.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to cover other areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did as the instructions and other reviewers</li>
            <li> When I first opened this product I was skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> and although I have only been using it for a few treatments, I can definately notice a difference!</li>
            <li> I myself have been doing the every other day application</li>
            <li> I stopped using prescription acne treatments this year due to health concerns and skin irritation.</li>
            <li> It feels okay going on--kind of like latex paint, which is weird and vaguely exciting--but it takes a while to dry</li>
            <li> My pores are hardly noticeable, especially on my nose.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $26.00 I paid.</li>
            <li> It does a good job without a nasty smell.</li>
            <li> and she was in the room down the hall.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about it working due to the price which is a little</li>
            <li> but I am wasting much less with the Leonie one.  </li>
            <li> I typically use Biore pore strips</li>
            <li> I tried this out with an open mind, and the mask just simply has no &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; and is unable to remove blackheads.  </li>
            <li> However, as a black head remover, it didn&#x27;t get the majority.</li>
            <li> A face &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; should not be black.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this mask because he had some black heads on his cheeks, forehead, and chin which would not go away and</li>
            <li> This is not a quick solution to skin problems</li>
            <li> but if you give it time to work (have used half the bottle)</li>
            <li> I prefer strips over this as this makes a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a MESS to use.  </li>
            <li> I apply it thickly, let it dry 30-45 min, then peel from the bottom up.</li>
            <li> agree that you can see (and feel) the mask pull out some little hairs, but I would say it does grab blackheads, too.  </li>
            <li> Just remove a little little bit.</li>
            <li> I have not applied the product since as it was basically a waste of time.</li>
            <li> This is comparable to a peel off mask I received as a gift from someone who visited Korea a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> After I cleanse my skin, I apply it on my nose and in 15 minutes, I peel it off after it has been dried.  </li>
            <li> It took twenty minutes of scubbing to remove this trash, trust me don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now.  </li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t felt dried out after use but does feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still blackheads left behind, but flaky skin and hairs pulled instead.  </li>
            <li> did like that it pulls off dead skin cells and leaves my skin smoother feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t offset the burning sensation and the lack of removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I used this the blackheads on my nose made my skin not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> remove any of blackhead!&lt;br /&gt;just waste of money...</li>
            <li> Not comfortable and doesn&#x27;t even remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, blakcheads still there, used every 3 days for 3 total uses to see if I got results, skin is in worse condition than ever</li>
            <li> Also getting the remnants of the mask off was a bit of a pain and messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but I get used to it</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of the price and small size of the tube</li>
            <li> The tube is small, order two to start.</li>
            <li> But its no magic.</li>
            <li> Pulls of blackheads and dead skin!</li>
            <li> Your not able to see what comes off your face.  </li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time today and I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to let him know that it was a complete flop.</li>
            <li> The instructions are very poor as you don&#x27;t know for how long you should leave this on your face or</li>
            <li> I am a die hard biore nose strips kinda gal, and even after using this product two or three times now i am still a hard core biore nose strip fan.</li>
            <li> but at least I know it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> It comes out thick like hair color and stains like it to.</li>
            <li> The only real trouble I had was getting it out of the bottle as it seemed a bit difficult to squeeze out!</li>
            <li> I tried the showering then applying after a couple of minutes and applying it to an unprepared face (dirty) but no clear visible results.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to start peeling once it is dried.  </li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s fairly messy when applying and difficult to get off your hands.</li>
            <li> Decided to give this item a try after reading the reviews, boy am I sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> disappointment they said it stops other blackheads from forming but</li>
            <li> i disappointed does&#x27;t remove black heads and is extremely messy</li>
            <li> The only down side is that there is a horrible perfume type smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst product ever, , I even got the additional revised instructional e-mail.</li>
            <li> If I could rate it any worse I would.</li>
            <li> I like this idea of this mask, and I hate spending money on Biore strips, but this mask simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t base my review on how well this works because I only used it once.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, the bottle was broken and spilled alap over my carpet.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but thought I would try this product and see how it worked.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it didn&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical</li>
            <li> /&gt;Awfully expensive to not work.  </li>
            <li> Which is a sad because the price, with people still buying it, suggests it lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> i bought this product its a disappointment</li>
            <li> and so said so than the filthy blackheads retained and its very frustrating</li>
            <li> Not so bad, but definately not miraculous</li>
            <li> I think it was a bad use of money</li>
            <li> Hurts so bad when you tear it off.</li>
            <li> He said it wasn&#x27;t painful pulling the mask off either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>

            <li> A friend of mine told me about this stuff and I was eager to try it. I was skeptical at first because it&#x27;s so different from anything I&#x27;ve tried before. But after my first time using it I was hooked! I&#x27;ve always had problems with blackheads and this is the only thing that&#x27;s ever helped. It really works. The more you use it the more effective it is. The one downside is that I&#x27;m prone to dry skin and when I use this in combination with some other skin products, my skin dries out, but that&#x27;s easily fixed with some moisturizer. The best part of this mask is that it is so fun to peel off!</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and used it last night.  It worked great.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and the pores on my nose get clogged easily.  I wanted something that would clean my pores without making them bigger.  This did that great.  I am going to buy some for my mother.  You will need to hide for 20 minutes from your spouse so they don&#x27;t take a picture of you and post it on FB.  Make sure you have enough product on to pull off when it&#x27;s dry.  If you can see skin, it&#x27;s not enough.  I will try to write another review once I have used this product a few more times.</li>
            <li> smooth and does the job - great product</li>
            <li> Be careful removing this mask...</li>
            <li> It works alright, It&#x27;s no miracle. I prefer strips over this as this makes a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> I, too, received a coupon for 50% off if I posted a good review... Not sure how I feel about that, so I&#x27;ll be honest.     Until my mid-30s, I thought my acne problems had been confined to a couple of rounds of Accutane in high school. Then a heap of work stress created a lot of stubborn breakouts with ongoing blackheads on my chin and nose. I&#x27;ve been using Retin-A and Proactiv off and on for about five years to handle them, but am always looking to go one better.    I have tried this Leonie mask three times. It feels okay going on--kind of like latex paint, which is weird and vaguely exciting--but it takes a while to dry (apparently some parts of my face are too warm to keep it from ever drying--it stays wet and sticky and has to be rolled off with my fingers) and then it largely pulls out peach fuzz that no one saw and doesn&#x27;t matter. It brings some blackheads closer to the surface (after I wash my face, I find that removing them requires less pressure), but the product does not on its own remove all of them.     The good news is I think I hacked this routine to make it better: the Leonie mask works best if you use it in COMBINATION with a clay or mud mask. I tried following it with the Proactiv Refining Mask (a white clay thing with sulfer), and the combo cleaned better than either one of them individually. It actually cleaned better than anything ever has.    So, my recommendation is to start with this wacky Leonie mask. Peel it off and wash your face afterwards (no need for fancy soap, or scrubbing). Then immediately put on a clay or mud mask to pull out what remains. If your skin is stubborn like mine it will be rosy and clean and nearly blackhead-free.    If it dries your skin out, well...you can&#x27;t have everything. :-)</li>
            <li> Only using this for the 2nd time and so far, I really like it. Would definitely purchase again. My uploaded photo definitely isn&#x27;t as elegant as their stock photos, but it works as promised :)</li>
            <li> This mask is what I&#x27;ve been waiting for. It&#x27;s gentle yet gets the job done. I feel like my skin is glowing now! I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but thought I would try this product and see how it worked.  I am ordering more!  My skin has never felt or looked cleaner or softer.  A miracle.  It has been a couple of days now and I can see that I need to reuse.  The tube is small, order two to start. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Works like the Clearasil we bought in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This mask works so well. It really gets dead skin off too.It also softens the skin. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as the reviews I had read. I have used it different ways without washing my face , after a hot bath , and afterwashing my face it has not removed any blackheads. The only thing it has removed is dry skin.</li>
            <li> This mask does make my skin feel soft and smooth after using but I was expecting more regarding removal of my blackheads after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> This product does not work well at all, and was a complete wast of money!</li>
            <li> This isnt that great for those of you who have really deep blackheads, because, to remove around 30% of your blackheads you should frist put some water heat to your face to open up the pores and then apply the mask. I do like how it does eliminates some blackheads, and a lot of whiteheads. But its no magic.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Worked perfectly! My skin is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love its name üíúüíúüíúüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç</li>
            <li> I have combination skin: oily nose with dry cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was able to peel off the layer of flaky skin that has appeared on my face after the wintry weather, but not enough to pull off the hairs. However, I recommend do not get it into your hair. For some masks, it&#x27;s too thin/fragile to peel off in one sheet, or it feels like it never dried properly and you have to rub it off. Nope, smear this mask on in a thin layer, but thick enough you can&#x27;t see your skin through it, and it peels off in one nice large sheet (with small pieces around the edge, but that&#x27;s ok).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good, is effective for helping to get rid of flaky skins and makes my pimples feel better. After taking the mask off, use a cotton ball to swipe the lotion(toner) onto your face as exfoliation, and it makes your skin feel so soft, like a mini spa treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it smells nice and works well!</li>
            <li> whoahhh! this mask hurts when you take it off! You&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t actually remove blackheads.  I applied it to my nose and followed the instructions exactly and when I removed the film after the required time it basically did nothing.  I have not applied the product since as it was basically a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of peel-off mask, they are fun to use and much easier to remove than traditional masks. I read on a blog that this mask is similar to the Boscia Luminizing Mask I used to buy at Sephora so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a couple of times, I can honestly say it‚Äôs better than the Boscia one. The results are pretty similar (brightened skin, removes blackheads) but this one dries much faster, smells better but most importantly: you don‚Äôt need to put a whole lot for it to work. I find you need to put a heavy dose of the Boscia one for it to be effective but I am wasting much less with the Leonie one.  A+</li>
            <li> Not so bad, but definately not miraculous</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars mostly because, although it cleans the skin and generally cleans out the pores, it doesn&#x27;t remove black heads as advertised. I actually found it really similar to other black peel away masks that I&#x27;ve had before, like the TrueBlue line that Bath and Body Works carries. It&#x27;s a decent peel away mask, but it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s advertised to do, and quite frankly as far as peel away masks go, I&#x27;ve had better for a much cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a black head remover, I&#x27;m gonna say that pore strips are much more efficient</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where to start! I&#x27;ve used Biore strips for years and they work okay most of the time, but sometimes they can inflame my my skin. I bought this product because it&#x27;s said to be better than biore or any other strips. I haven&#x27;t used it on me yet (I just got it in the mail tonight and I did a chemical peel earlier); however, I used it on my husband. BOY OH BOY is it ever awesome! I could see his blackheads and dead skin come off right away! He said it wasn&#x27;t painful pulling the mask off either. The only downside to this product is that it takes some elbow grease to squeeze it out of the tube and seems as if it might run out after using it a handful of times. I had to have my husband help me squeeze the tube to get it out onto my finger. It washes off your finger easily with soap and water, but once on the face it takes about 20-30minutes to fully dry without using a fan or heater to assist. Maybe a blowdryer or fan would help with that? The other thing is that this mask is kind of expensive, but so are biore strips. I think Elmer&#x27;s glue might work just like this mask too. All in all I am very satisfied and CANNOT WAIT to try it out on my face after my chemical peel is done peeling &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This the best blackhead remover I tried. Much better than Biore pore strips! I Couldn&#x27;t believe how much blackheads this removes from my nose, just wow.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I was really hoping it would. I tried a couple of times and neither worked. Not worth the $26.00 I paid. Returned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no miracle product, but it&#x27;s the best cleansing mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ll definitely be a life long user unless something better comes along.</li>
            <li> This is comparable to a peel off mask I received as a gift from someone who visited Korea a few years ago.  I have always been looking for a replacement.  I really like this mask.  After I cleanse my skin, I apply it on my nose and in 15 minutes, I peel it off after it has been dried.  When you hold it up to the light you can see stuff that you didn&#x27;t realize was sitting in your skin.  Yuck!  But COOL!  Smells lovely and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to those pore strips.  It is great for the whole family and really does pull embedded dirt out of pores.  Make sure you wash your face first and then apply with a fingertip.  Within 10 minutes it is dry and you can peel off easily.  Gives skin a clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I used my Leonie blackhead remover mask for the first time last night. It felt great and my pores look much improved. I look forward to regular use which I think will make a difference in the size of my pores and the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong enough to pull out blackheads but adequate enough to pull out the little white fuzz. I like it only because it&#x27;s convenient to put on, wish it was strong enough to pull out my pesky blackheads. I even pre-steam my face and deep cleaned it beforehand to loosen all the deep blackheads. I&#x27;ve used the Biore strips before and they&#x27;ve worked better than this product (pulls out a lot of my blackheads).</li>
            <li> It did not work. I did exactly what the instructions sad. Stick to regular nose strips. Not a fan at all</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this is not for you.  It also made no difference for me other than to add a rash to my face.  it&#x27;s been 5 days and it hasn&#x27;t gone away either.</li>
            <li> Just okay... it did not eally remove  as much the blackheads as I want, especially on my nose. The good thing is it does smell good!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading a positive review on a beauty blog.  First, the product should include clearer instructions - I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I can apply this mask on a wet face.  Fortunately, the company customer service contacted me asking for a feed back and I learned from the service rep that this product should be applied on a dry face.  I do think it does a decent job of clearing the pores.  But I don&#x27;t reach for this product often because it is rather a hassle getting all the little bits of black off the face, especially closer to the hairline.  It&#x27;s also a hassle getting it off my fingers, and you do want to get it off your fingers as soon as you are done applying the mask because the wet product stuck to your fingers will transfer to whatever you touch, e.g., towels and clothes.  Wish they could make this clear instead of black.</li>
            <li> The whole family is using this product and we love it. It really helps remove black heads and diminish the appearance of pores. This product is gentle enough that we used it on our 8 year old daughter who had some icky pores from not washing her face right and always playing outside in the dirt. In two treatments her pores were clear and minimized. She had the baby smooth skin she should have. We try to use it once a week as maintenance. Will definitely reorder. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> works very well. cleans out my pores really good. as per description. gave it 4 stars because sometimes it feels like its too thin or something, its not pulling as much as I would want it to.</li>
            <li> It is awesome!  I honestly love it.  Great Mask.  It is Black in Color though LOL so I scared the daylights outta my kids!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. I am a big fan of Biore strips. I have heard great things about this product.  Unfortunately for me, it didn&#x27;t work that well.  It definitely works, but the Biore strips seemed to clean out my pores better. Overall the product is pretty cool &amp; smooth going on.  I&#x27;m sure it works great, just wasn&#x27;t great for me.</li>
            <li> Its OK...but I expected it to work better. Tube contains a lot of product...product goes on face well and dries fast...BUT it is not so effective in deep cleaning for blackheads. Needs to pull more out of pores. It may work on some skin but if your skin is oily and needs a deep cleaning keep looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> I have tried nose strips and other facial mask countless times and never found a product like this! I was nervous about it working due to the price which is a little steep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need to do is clean your face and dry it off and rub this product where you need it. Wait about 30 minutes and peel it off. You won&#x27;t believe what comes off your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this mask and how well it works.  I typically use Biore pore strips and I do like them, but the fact that this works on your entire face is a bonus.  No offensive smell, easy clean up and really gets the job done.  Today I received tips via email from the seller, one of which was to steam your face beforehand for optimal results.  I should have thought of that on my own, but next time I will definitely try that.  A very good product that I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well. She liked it so much she tried it on me and it worked really well!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst product ever, , I even got the additional revised instructional e-mail. It took twenty minutes of scubbing to remove this trash, trust me don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Its like the drying agent never was added to this batch. If I could rate it any worse I would. Total garbage.</li>
            <li> disappointment they said it stops other blackheads from forming but that&#x27;s a lie i used the product for a month and decided to stop using it to see if any new black head would have been formed and so said so than the filthy blackheads retained and its very frustrating i regret i bought this product its a disappointment</li>
            <li> purchased it and i absolutely love ! will definitely be purchasing this again. :)</li>
            <li> Got this as an alternative to using the comedone extractor for blackhead removal.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 uses in the span of two weeks: twice the first week the item arrived and once the second week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on easily and comes off okay.&lt;br /&gt;If you get bits and pieces stuck on your face, it&#x27;ll take another washing of the face to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove those stubborn blackheads as stated on the bottle; instead it removes dead skin and those white fuzz as mentioned by other reviewers. Also I found that it dries out my skin a bit after removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes there&#x27;s a scent when applying the mask, it&#x27;s not floral, nor is it paint thinner... Can&#x27;t pin point it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m mixed about the product. Given the result, will not reorder after this bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now.  Each time, I tried various ways of preparing my pores for the application..... I think a warm shower with gentle exfoliation has been as effective as other methods (like an exfoliating mask.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that you can see (and feel) the mask pull out some little hairs, but I would say it does grab blackheads, too.  I think that it has grabbed more blackheads each time - perhaps it had to clear away the the little hairs and dead skin in the first few uses?  I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve left it on about 20 minutes or so, until it is all the way dried.  It definitely removes dead skin, leaving my skin smoother.  So far though, not quite as good as strips for removing blackheads - but it has two advantages.  First, cost per use is way lower for this - a little bit goes a long way.  Second, there are other properties to the mask which nourish the skin.  My face hasn&#x27;t felt dried out after use but does feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a striking black color, kind of entertaining.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but I get used to it and it&#x27;s not so much that I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have used many blackhead removing products before in the past and nothing has ever come close to how well Leonie Blackhead remover peel off mask does. I am very satisfied with this product. I have always battled acne, especially due to all the garden work I do, and working in a greasy fast food restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very easy to apply. Just a dab goes a long way, and it goes on smoothly. Once dry it peels off quite easy, and yet still manages to grab &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; on your skin that does NOT belong there. I have never come across a product quite like this one and I plan to be using it regularly from now on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of its high rated customer reviews on Amazon. However, the product doesn&#x27;t seem working well on me. It maybe due to different skin&#x27;s nature of different people. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> After trying this product, I will never go without. I have tried just about everything to remove the blackheads on my nose and figured it was just something I was going to have to live with until my friend tried it and told me about it. I admit I was skeptical but I noticed a huge difference even after just one use. I personally only use it on my nose because I feel that&#x27;s all I need but it works for all over face too, even going beyond blackhead removal, it just gives an overall glow of the skin. I recommend this to everyone. I seriously am in love with it.</li>
            <li> Completely in love with this! I use it once a week, and it really cleans my pores. Really good product!</li>
            <li> do not waste your money this product did bot  remove any of my blackheads and actually made my cheeks red</li>
            <li> As a college kid, I break out a lot from eating spicy food, and normally that results in blackheads. I always had a problem with blackheads cause it hurts, well with this item it kinda saves the pain. I just apply a nice layer on my face and wait about 20 min, and easily peel it off, leaving a nice cool freshing feeling on my face as well the easy painless removal of blackheads!</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t work at all.I bought this product mainly to remove a few blackhead I have on my nose, I did everything as per instruction but it din&#x27;t work,I do have a rash and dry face now.Also it was very painful to remove from my face.The instructions are very poor as you don&#x27;t know for how long you should leave this on your face or how many days you should leave in between to use it again so you must give it your best shot.I don&#x27;t recommend it and if you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t even try it thinking that it will work for you,I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter is using this mask. It does a good job without a nasty smell. She hasn&#x27;t used it for long, so I don&#x27;t know how it will perform over time. I do know that it leaves her skin feeling very clean and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have used many Blackhead removers in the past and this is the best to date. Removes almost everything, and its very easy to apply. One bottle goes a very long way. Great at removing blackheads and impurities while not hurting your wallet at the same time!</li>
            <li> not that impressive... Biore nose strips do better</li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that there is NO MIRACLE CURE.... this product actually did pull a lot of the blackheads out. We will continue using.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping that it would work better than Biore pore strips, which work well for me but only come in strips and I wanted to cover other areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first two tries with only removal of some flaky skin and what little tiny fine hairs I have, the blackheads remained.  Then I tried steaming my face and tried product again.  Still blackheads left behind, but flaky skin and hairs pulled instead.  I have steamed my face longer and again have used the product, still same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say...  It is difficult to start peeling once it is dried.  I feel like I am digging at my skin to get a section to peel started.  It BURNS when I initially put it on.  The burning sensation lasts for the first few minutes. A strong smell of what can only be described of as burnt plastic until it dries.  Though it has not removed any of my blackheads, it has left a black residue in pores that were clean.  Must scrub off my face again to get product residue off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that it pulls off dead skin cells and leaves my skin smoother feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t offset the burning sensation and the lack of removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awfully expensive to not work.  Biore pore strips trimmed down to fit in areas (like under the nose) work better.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It arrived yesterday, and I used it for the first time. I&#x27;m amazed with the results. Not messy at all if you apply it properly with your own finger, came off easily. The mast had all the blackheads on it when it came off. Strongly recommended. Definitely buying again. Thanks a lot for making a product that actually works for blackheads.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do so well getting rid of the blackheads on my nose but it did a great job on my cheeks and chin. My skin was instantly brighter and my pores looked smaller.</li>
            <li> This was the first peel off mask i have ever used. I have a blackhead problem on my nose and chin and have since puberty. I did as the instructions and other reviewers said and cleansed my face beforehand, but this did absolutely nothing to my blackheads. They are still there and as stubborn as before. This pulled virtually nothing out of my pores whatsoever. Which is a sad because the price, with people still buying it, suggests it lives up to the hype. Sadly, this did not work for me. It did, however make my face softer and brightened it up for the day. Not a total loss but i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am a die hard biore nose strips kinda gal, and even after using this product two or three times now i am still a hard core biore nose strip fan. Leonie face mask has yet to actually remove any blackheads of mine. HOWEVER, it leaves my face feeling amazingly smooth and really dries up oil quickly on my face. So for what it is intended to do it doesn&#x27;t work well for me, i did notice that the website says you don&#x27;t have to use a lot &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;. For me, the more i used the easier it was to peel off as one whole mask and the better my face felt afterwards. When you are pulling it off it does, like a lot of face peels, hurt a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are really trying to pull out blackheads but if you just want to try a nice face peel this one is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads around my nose from oily skin and in my cheeks, I used to use Biore but it seemed to dry my skin out. So I was looking for a alternative. I decided to try this stuff out and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for blackheads. Worth the price, expecially if you use it only on problem areas the bottle will last. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry at all, and removed a huge amount. I&#x27;d buy this shiz again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the peel-off mask I&#x27;ve been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a try because of the positive reviews on Amazon, and this mask is worth every penny. After 20 minutes, I easily peeled this mask off of my face and I could see and feel the difference. For me, this was the perfect balance of a strong enough product to really work but not too harsh for my sensitive skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different masks and this one works the best by far.</li>
            <li> Before I used this the blackheads on my nose made my skin not smooth at all. After using this it was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. The blackheads were still somewhat visible, but after using this they were completely easy to cover up using my normal powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Works better then anything else I have tried. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This product really works! Make sure you wash your face well before applying. It works best if you take the time to massage it into your skin in small sections. This helps to work it into your pores and remove the dead skin cells when it‚Äôs ready to be peeled off. If you just spread it over your skin without massaging it in its not as effective. I put it on pretty thick and it smells good too. You‚Äôll know when it‚Äôs ready to peel off when it feels tight. I love it!</li>
            <li> It works great. It removed 80% of blackheads. It was my first time using it. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The order came very quick. The blackhead remover left my skin clear and blackhead free. Looking forward to clear skin.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t remove my blackheads at all. i showered with hot water, and even steamed my face afterwards to be sure my pores were open. And have seen no difference. Given that my skin has gotten softer and smoother but my blackheads are all still there. i wouldn&#x27;t have spent my money if i had known that it wouldn&#x27;t work on my face type. a bit disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Wow this works as advertised. I have gone so long without using anything like this I figured what the heck I&#x27;ll give it a shot (as a guy that is saying something) and it really did the trick. Guys and girls give it a chance and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this product I was skeptical about it. I&#x27;ve used a lot of beauty products for the removal of blackheads , some worked ok , some didn&#x27;t work at all. This product works! The first time I used it , it took two applications to do the job. But that&#x27;s fine because the job it did was fantastic. My nose has never been so blackhead free. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Did not like it. It pulled everything off my face except for the blackheads. I threw it right in the trash.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this product! I have had large pores and sebum buildup my entire life and although I have only been using it for a few treatments, I can definately notice a difference! Just use it as directed and moisturize afterward and you will notice the change. I myself have been doing the every other day application and I am very happy with the results and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is a HUGE plus for me). Try it out -  plus it&#x27;s fun to peel off!</li>
            <li> It feels really sticky, and peels off nicely.  skin feels nice afterwards.  I would use it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great for removing blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Much much better than Biore Strips, great alternative to what I get a Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This ACTUALLY removes blackheads and sebum plugs from my skin! I stopped using prescription acne treatments this year due to health concerns and skin irritation. This resulted in my skin becoming super congested and breaking out. I always had 1-5 pustules on my face; as soon as one healed, another would appear. Since I started using this mask once a week (and following up by washing my face and applying thyme tincture after the mask), my skin has cleared and I now just have 1 or 2 whiteheads occasionally. I can actually see all the gunk on the mask after removing it (like in those old Biore commercials). I apply it thickly, let it dry 30-45 min, then peel from the bottom up. It leaves my sensitive skin a little tingly and red, but that goes away after washing. The only way I would love this product more is if it was paraben free.</li>
            <li> I am really very impressed with this product! It arrived on the day it was supposed to and was very effective in making my face feel clean and I could see the dirt it had removed. All in all, a very good product, and I would definitely recommend it! The only real trouble I had was getting it out of the bottle as it seemed a bit difficult to squeeze out! However, this was not a major issue and the product worked well so I didn&#x27;t mind too much!</li>
            <li> This is just okay. Not my favorite face treatment. It doesn&#x27;t seem to really remove blackheads that well. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Peeled off okay, but did not remove skin cells and blackheads like regular ol&#x27; gelatin.  Warm water and a packet of gelatin works much more efficiently.</li>
            <li> I must not keep it on long enough because I have never peeled the mask off.  I have to wash it off.  I have tried keeping it on for over 20 minutes and it does not just peel away.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well for blackheads, but it did make my skin soft and pulled off the dead skin and little hairs. Kinda pricey. It looks like a lot until you start applying it and realize it&#x27;s not. Not a bad product overall. I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the quite as effective as biore strips even after leaving it on your fase for and hour. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin but I didn&#x27;t like this product. I tried the showering then applying after a couple of minutes and applying it to an unprepared face (dirty) but no clear visible results. I think it was a bad use of money but at least I know it&#x27;s not for me. I originally thought this was the black stuff that turned a white by pulling out the black heads/white heads. It tends to dry fast in your hands (hard to wash off when still moist. Paper towel needed) and you need a some what large amount for full coverage. Anyway, it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all.  Not even in the same ballpark as Biore strips.  I tried this out with an open mind, and the mask just simply has no &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; and is unable to remove blackheads.  No joke, this mask did not remove ANY of my blackheads, whereas Biore strips do a great job.  I like this idea of this mask, and I hate spending money on Biore strips, but this mask simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> works really well. skin looked clearer and brighter. removed blackheads easily. would recommend for men and women</li>
            <li> Overrated with all the reviews on amazon couldn&#x27;t wait to receive this product but boy was i disappointed does&#x27;t remove black heads and is extremely messy will never purchase again and feel as though reviews about this product where misleading i will never purchase again so i have no reason to leave a good review for 50% of my next purchase</li>
            <li> This product works so well! My skin is sensitive and finicky-it can&#x27;t decide whether it wants to be dry or oily. Since using the blackhead remover it has improved my skin overall-visibly reducing pore size and greasiness. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a MESS to use.  I threw it out after one use. Awful!! Made my pores BIGGER!! Sorry!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t base my review on how well this works because I only used it once. If I had more time for a skincare routine, I&#x27;d use it after I shower. It comes out thick like hair color and stains like it to. I liked the satisfying pullling sensation when I peeled it off. Warning- do not eel it off in the sink; when the pieces get wet, they tick (and like I said, stain). I had to use a scrub brush to get it off.</li>
            <li> Hurts so bad when you tear it off. Don&#x27;t feel like my pores are unclogged. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t remove any of blackhead!&lt;br /&gt;just waste of money...</li>
            <li> loved it.  best mask ever.  does a great job !</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this product. It smells and feels like chemicals.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry and then peeling is rough. Not comfortable and doesn&#x27;t even remove blackheads. It&#x27;s also black and hard to clean up as it kind of sticks to everything.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about trying this but it just simply was not strong enough for me apparently. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a pore type strip that was black - they are big in Asia. Which makes sense right - you want to see that the product worked after you peel it off. This is a goop type product that you squeeze out, place where you want (I use it on my nose only) and wait for it to dry, then peel off. It dries pretty quickly and is easy to remove. The only down side is that there is a horrible perfume type smell. So strong that one night my sister asked what that smell was and she was in the room down the hall. But a small price to pay in my opinion as it works fairly well and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks! Best face mask I&#x27;ve ever used! Pulls of blackheads and dead skin! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! I recommend using it in the morning and at night for better results.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads</li>
            <li> I like it, but didn&#x27;t remove all the impurities I had hoped for. I don&#x27;t have any black heads, but was effective in removing surface oils and &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;, but not the oils in my nose or cheek areas.</li>
            <li> I am completely positive that this is just glue mixed with black latex paint. Even though there are ingredients listed on the internet, the product itself did not come with them. It did, however, come with a promise that I&#x27;d get 50% off the next bottle if I posted a glowing review on Amazon. Sketchy as hell.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Works better than those competitor&#x27;s pore strips and you get many more uses out of the tube since you control how much product to use each time.</li>
            <li> BF got it for me to try. We both tried it at the same time and it did not pull out anything for either one of us. We both have combination skin and blackheads on the nose.  He tried it again a second time. This time he took a shower first to open up his pores but still didn&#x27;t pull out anything.</li>
            <li> Lovely masque. Left my face feeling very clean and soft!</li>
            <li> The first day of using this product I was very impressed. I used it after cleaning my face with African soap, dried and applied. The blackhead removal was noticiable right after the peel off. Works really well. Dried quickly and peel off was easy. Left over residue can be easily removed with warm water. This will be my acne treatment combination from now on. I&#x27;ll use the mask 3 days a week.</li>
            <li> im a dude and it really does help your skin out. i work construction and use it once every week and i don&#x27;t break out anymore. btw don&#x27;t get on your hair ouch</li>
            <li> My face feels clean, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to peel off (warm washcloth does the trick with the little pieces left over).  However, as a black head remover, it didn&#x27;t get the majority.</li>
            <li> I have persistent and stubborn sebum plugs and oily/acne prone skin, especially during my period. The mask doesn&#x27;t lift as many sebum plugs as one reviewer stated but it works great for removing all other dirt and grime on my face. I don&#x27;t have blackheads so I can&#x27;t comment on that but my skin is smoother and brighter after each use. I am very active and work many late hours as a 911 - system EMT so I use the mask about three times a week in combination with my mud mask regime. I&#x27;m 32 years old so I have some very fine wrinkles on my forehead and on my smile lines. When using this mask, those wrinkles lines are significantly diminished. I&#x27;m happy with the product and will be ordering more when I start to run out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, blakcheads still there, used every 3 days for 3 total uses to see if I got results, skin is in worse condition than ever</li>
            <li> It works okay.  Easy to use and tear off.</li>
            <li> A face &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; should not be black.  Your not able to see what comes off your face.  I prefer a skin peel more then a peel off mask.  It is super sticky and doesn&#x27;t come off in one pull... takes about 15 different pulls before you get it off and when your done you need to get the rest off with a wet wash cloth.  Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who is 13 and having acne issues. He primarily uses Proactive + products which when used twice a day, help to keep his breakouts under control. I purchased this mask because he had some black heads on his cheeks, forehead, and chin which would not go away and which were present before starting the Proactive products less than a month ago. After using the mask for the first time this week, not all, but some of the embedded black heads are gone. I am so happy! We plan to use it 2 to 3 times a week as is directed to hopefully eliminate the stubborn blackheads. I did not notice any smell but it is a bit tacky/sticky. You have to spread it on pretty quick as it dries fairly fast. Once the allotted time has passed, it was dry and easy to peel off  starting on the jaw line and peeling upward. Any residual mask was easily removed with a warm wash cloth. I will be purchasing this product again one his current tube is used up.</li>
            <li> You need this. No moisturizer or lotion can do what this mask does! My expectations were greatly exceeded. It only took 15 minutes and I had much, much softer skin! Plus all of my blackheads were GONE! Oh - the mask peeled off easily and there was no pain (I&#x27;m also quite sensitive to pain if that gives you an idea.)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Easy to apply and to remove. After using I have no more blackheads and my skin is very soft!!!</li>
            <li> Left my skin VERY soft, and did remove peachfuz i didnt realize was there!!! It did remove blackheads, but i think next time i use the product i will steam my face bfore hand!  I  like it!!</li>
            <li> This is not a quick solution to skin problems but I must say it makes my skin feel very smooth and soft.  Didn&#x27;t see much of a change right away but if you give it time to work (have used half the bottle) you will see a change.  Give it time and you will be happy with the results.  It&#x27;s not a one time miracle in a bottle but it will do the job!  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel super soft! love it!</li>
            <li> Product works well overall however it&#x27;s fairly messy when applying and difficult to get off your hands. Wish the product was thicker and less...gooey.</li>
            <li> I have about 100 blackheads on my nose and didn&#x27;t see a single one of them removed. scrubs gets about 10% of them and strips get about 10% of them. Even heated face and scrubbed to loosen but did nothing.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blackhead remover ever, other will imitate but will not get near this product. Thinking of buying this mask just go for it, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am a man. Yes, I have terrible skin. You can make fun of me but I do my best to make the terrible aspects of it less obvious. So, that is what made me buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not pull many blackheads out of my skin. It may work for you in that capacity and i so, good for you. It did reduce the size of some of the pores on my nose. That&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> This mask is fun, it looks crazy but feels nice.  It doesn&#x27;t smell really strongly but smells nice.  I don&#x27;t know how much it does really, but it feels nice and isn&#x27;t drying at all.  I enjoy it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty intense, but it is worth it. The best way to start the peeling process is to smile or scrunch your face. Great product!</li>
            <li> Ok! So I was super excited when I came across this item ( so excited I spent $26). I have blackheads, like most people, around my nose and on my chin. I hate it!! Decided to give this item a try after reading the reviews, boy am I sorry I wasted my money. I got it on time and in good condition but IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tried it for the first time today and I am disappointed. It took nothing off my face, all I saw on the mask when I peeled it off was some downy hair. My husband told me not to buy it because it would not work. I am afraid to let him know that it was a complete flop. Wish I had listen but you live and you learn. Take my advice and hold on to your money. I have realized now why some people give it good reviews ( they get 50% off their next purchase). I have no intention of buying it again so I won&#x27;t lie to you. IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of the price and small size of the tube but it works really well! I just tried it for the first time and my face is softer looking like I just left the spa. My pores are hardly noticeable, especially on my nose. I have really sensitive skin that breaks out from most products. The ingredients are natural, so hopefully it&#x27;ll be okay. I would definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> This product is a big rip off. I used this product as per the instruction and it couldn&#x27;t remove a single blackhead from my face.Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product very easy and can do my whole face at one time as opposed 2 giving sections at a time. Love the feeling of my face. I would recommend with 5 stars</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Smells great and works great. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Pore strips are way better.</li>
            <li> It goes on, dries, and peels off -- but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for blackheads. Maybe mine are just really stubborn?</li>
            <li> I liked using this blackhead peel off mask. It is fun to peel off the mask and then see all the stuff it&#x27;s pulled out. This mask also has a nice scent, so even though it dries quickly, I didn&#x27;t mind leaving it on longer. It isn&#x27;t too hard to clean off, but I&#x27;d still use just one finger to apply.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my husbands back because it&#x27;s FULL of blackheads. This stuff was amazing! We both looked at it up close with a flashlight after and you could literally see every pore with junk in it afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all for removing blackheads.</li>
            <li> This product simply does not work. I am used to the Biore strips, which you can actually see work (it will pull the blackheads right out of your skin and you can see them on the strip).  This product does not pull out even a single blackhead.  I take a hot shower and then apply a thick coating to my nose, wait 30 minutes, then peel off. I dont think the mask adheres strongly enough to the skin/blackheads to actually remove the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the only reason this product has lots of good reviews is because they put an offer in the box, bribing you to leave good feedback in exchange to a significant discount on a 2nd bottle (50% I think) if you order again.</li>
            <li> This is the best peel off mask I have ever used for blackheads. I was amazed how smooth and bright my skin looked after the first use. I used it on clean dry skin. You will feel a slight coolness on the skin along with mild tightness. It all goes away after the mask dries. Avoid your hairline during application  to get a perfect peel off. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, the bottle was broken and spilled alap over my carpet.</li>
            <li> WARNING-Noxious odor akin to nail salon glue or super elastic bubble plastic (from 1970s). Curiously, the product also FEELS like the superelastic bubble plastic and forms a stretchy plastic film on skin. I cannot discern what ingredient is so offensive, but I developed a headache and decided to return it rather than risk another exposure. FYI-I have experienced this kind of reaction from nail salon odors at a hair salon once and then again years later from nail salon odors that had migrated into an adjacent chiropractic office. I have been told it is the nail glue to which I reacted badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw--pore clarifying property definitely inferior to the nose strips we find on retail shelves. Inside package is a 50% off discount for next purchase in exchange for a review on Amazon. Guess mine will not qualify.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at a loss for why this has so many good reviews.  It&#x27; fun to peel off, but it didn&#x27;t really leave my skin any clearer and didn&#x27;t remove any black heads (yes, I was expecting something like a biore result all over - this wasn&#x27;t even close).  Also getting the remnants of the mask off was a bit of a pain and messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says BUT every time I used it one or two or three pimples showed up. I gave it to my sister.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Did not work.</li>
            <li> I really like that this product is black. You can see what it pulls from your skin. Dries really quick, also.</li>
            <li> I love walking around with a black mask on. It&#x27;s easy to use, but takes a little longer than I would prefer to dry. SUPER fun to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the bore nose strips, but its a nice alternative to use every now and then. Brightens the skin up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have use it probably 4 times (full face) and still have almost the entire bottle left. I think it&#x27;s worth a little splurge to have around when you want to scare your boyfriend when he gets home.</li>
            <li> Love the black mash a lot, but it doesnt work. Not hurt at all like somebody said. Just remove a little little bit. Not good.</li>
            <li> Awesome product had a black head that would not go away I used it twice and now it&#x27;s gone will buy again</li>
            <li> great product.  It&#x27;s not as strong as the Biore to pull out your blackheads if you have a lot of it and the deep ones.  But it&#x27;s strong enough to pull out most of the tiny ones people are having.  This is better than the Biore where it has vitamin and other stuffs that makes your skin a lot smoother..</li>
            <li> Works ok, definitely does not remove most blackheads, just top layer of dry/dead skin. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend</li>
