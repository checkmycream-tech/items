            <li> Loved it!  Perfect fit and got here a week before expected, so happy with my order</li>
            <li> Rhinestones have fallen out over time. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for long term use.</li>
            <li> Still useful but arrived with ear detached and few rhinestones fell off. Able to glue. No customer problems. Took a while shipping didn&#x27;t want to return.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this head band. We would recommend this to others. shipping takes a few weeks be patient. thanks</li>
            <li> I had to remember that I got what I paid for. The price was quite low as is the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> One of the ears was half off. Very upset. I was so looking forward to these. But I guess the reviews were rigt. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> They look sooooooo cute! oh my goodnesss everytime I wear them I get compliments on how cute they are! They still hasn&#x27;t broke, that&#x27;s a plus. Although I don&#x27;t use them that much because they give me headaches but that&#x27;s just me. Any hair accessory gives me headaches. BUT they are cute!! Loved them!</li>
            <li> My daughter saw these in a taylor swift video &amp; HAD to have them. Even tho delivery said 28+ days to deliver, it arrived in about a wk. she LOVES it! To say the least! Well made, sturdy, rhinestones in tack and secure. Will absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these. they came super quick and are so comfortable!!! Definitely a must for all who love them plus the price is fantastic</li>
            <li> I love to wear this with my wigs and it&#x27;ll still say on! it&#x27;s very cute and secure as well!</li>
            <li> I bought some sexy cat ears head band for myself,  my daughters,  my grand  daughter. All our friends, wanted one  !!! They love the pearls sexy cat ear girl head band. Send me five please.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after two wears :(</li>
            <li> Not what I thought they were going to be. I guess thats on me instead of AllBeauty&#x27;s. They are very good if you like this design, though.</li>
            <li> It is really cute but it&#x27;s kind of dangerous. There should be plastic pieces on the ends of the headband because they are sharp and can dig into your head. Wearing it for a prolonged time can give you a headache and it took forever to arrive. Soft cloth or plastic pieces on the ends would probably make it wearable!</li>
            <li> Gave toy sister as a gift and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to finally receive...seriously like a month and a half. But, my daughter loves it and wears it all the time. She&#x27;s had it a while now and I&#x27;m impressed that it hasn&#x27;t lost any of the gems.</li>
            <li> I ordered this headband for my sister and  both of the cat ears was not attached to the band, when I took it out of the package. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS ITEM!! it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
            <li> Broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but as soon as I took them out of the package a joint busted and broke . Still wearable but I wouldn&#x27;t consider high quality , gonna figure a way to fix it</li>
            <li> It came Brocken the gem was loose in the bag and didn&#x27;t even fit correctly in the spot for it!</li>
