            <li>It cleans the skin amazingly well.</li>
            <li>You can use your own soap, which is quite a savings.  </li>
            <li>this is by far, the best one out there.</li>
            <li>It carries a great refund warranty, if you don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the price, so what have you to lose - that was my thinking when I purchased it...</li>
            <li>Love this- reason gave it four is because wish I would&#x27;ve invested in the model with more speeds.</li>
            <li>and this makes me feel better about the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I love the magnetic charger.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that you can use it in the shower, this is where I wash my face most mornings</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the refreshing gel cleanser included in the kit hydrates and smooths the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I am definitely glad I made this investment.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this device.</li>
            <li>I love this gadget.</li>
            <li>cheeks are now extremely smooth, my complexion on my forehead has cleared up!</li>
            <li>This product has done what it said it would do and more.  </li>
            <li>I love it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Love the waterproof-ness.</li>
            <li>so it was nice to be able to get more use out of it than I originally planned.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean and seems durable.</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t felt so clean for... ever!  </li>
            <li>Happy with this product :) First, it seems very durable, like it would not break on me easily.</li>
            <li>The brush is really easy to change</li>
            <li>You can pick the type of brush head you want, it&#x27;s extremely easy to clean, I love using it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Easy to charge and use.</li>
            <li>my skin breaks out easily, and keeping my skin cleaner seems to help.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference in the way my face felt and how my products worked.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic Mia is a great tool to add to your daily maintenance routine.</li>
            <li>I used to have a face scrub regimen once a week, but this has replaced it and made the work more fun.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>I also got free shipping</li>
            <li>However I can&#x27;t give it a perfect 5 only because I really don&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin, or acne</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time without having to charge, turns off when your cycle is done, vibrates with a varying number of pulses to tell you that the battery is running lower, and works great in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is an investment, but I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li>when I clean the brush head off I take it off the unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then when I clean it with my hands in the shower.</li>
            <li>However after using the Clarisonic and swiping my face, the cotton ball comes clean.  </li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Cool magnetic charger, it stays charged for weeks.</li>
            <li>Similar to an electric toothbrush, the device is easy to use and cleans effectively.  </li>
            <li>I use my own organic facial cleansing products and they work fine with the Mia.</li>
            <li>That being said, I am now pregnant with my 4th child and hormones have wreaked havoc on my face.</li>
            <li>I recently began using it and could not be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This system carries a higher price tag than the others I&#x27;ve tried, but the efficient performance difference is far greater than the price difference!  </li>
            <li>:) i might have to buy a new brush though</li>
            <li>and my skin is clear, much more balanced and not irritated at all.  </li>
            <li>Fresh smelling cleanser - NOT greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>I can use my normal face cleansing product with it, rather than having to buy a special one from the company.</li>
            <li>After the first couple of weeks, I noticed that my skin looked smoother</li>
            <li>The system can be used once, or twice a day, I found the deep cleaning most beneficial at the end of my day.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it 2 times daily for a month and my prominent pores are disappearing</li>
            <li>fits in hand better and still uses the same brushes.</li>
            <li>so it  like going to my local store but better because it was delivered to my door.  </li>
            <li>If it does break you out, thats most likely bcuz all the dirt is coming out of the skin.</li>
            <li>Fine lines seem softer, major \\&quot;character lines\\&quot; are still in residence-- can&#x27;t expect miracles.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to wear much makeup.</li>
            <li>This improved my skin tone and texture SO much.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think that a product that costs so much would have a longer battery life.</li>
            <li>I first heard of this product from my older sister but put off buying one because of the cost, and my skin is normally pretty clear.</li>
            <li>The power of this product definitely surprised me, and even though my skin was a little irritated at first, it became super smooth in no time.</li>
            <li>I think they suggest a gentle cream cleanser, and I would reiterate that suggestion because even the gentle brush is powerful and a grainy, scrubbing cleanser isn&#x27;t necessary in congruence with this product.</li>
            <li>inner brush vibrates or pulsates very fast on the skin, although you do not feel it really.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised at how fast I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>You skin will thank you for its new Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li>I have large pores with lots of icky whiteheads sticking out of it but after using this thing my skin definitely feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>, I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has not removed everything, but again that may be because I only use the gentle brush.</li>
            <li>and I really like this slightly smaller size,</li>
            <li>Skin with no dead cells to slough off looks brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li>bcuz my skin is sensitive to lotiony/oily products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not sure if the Clarisonic is the cause, but after that it was fine.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and each charge lasts for at least 20 uses.</li>
            <li>I usually use an astringent after I clean my face and marvel at the amount of dirt still clinging to my skin.  </li>
            <li>it did dry my forehead a little bit, but Im personally fine with that</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clear, soft with little effort in terms of time--my skin has not looked this decent for a decade.</li>
            <li>My face is noticably smoother and not only do I have fewer blemishes, the ones I do have are smaller and go away twice as quickly as they previously did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mid-50 and have dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I had like couple extra break-outs, the first few days.</li>

            <li> I have combination skin, oily in some areas and dry in others, also I tend to get irritated on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I only use it once a week but for the last few months it was still functioning</li>
            <li> I do not like to get it totally wet</li>
            <li> It is not too rough on my skin at all</li>
            <li> I got replacement brushes also, the grey for me and the green acne control for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I broke down and got this after I went to a spa</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for less than 2 years and the battery already died out.</li>
            <li> This was broken, but unfortunately I gave it as a gift at Christmas last year, having purchased it earlier in the year, and couldn&#x27;t send it back.</li>
            <li> Eventually it just stopped working after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now</li>
            <li> i read quite a few reviews.</li>
            <li> Do not push it hard on your skin, just flush otherwise</li>
            <li> I was breaking out badly on my cheeks and chin and a bit on my forehead and so far the clarisonic has help stop my breakouts and</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers mentioned that it&#x27;s common to break out the 1st week of use -</li>
            <li> I have had troubled skin since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> came four days late and brush looks and felt used... :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;People said they broke out for a few weeks because of all the dirt and grim, but I never did, so have hope on this one.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might cause break outs, but</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but now, I even travel with it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The Clarisonic Mia is a great tool to add to your daily maintenance routine. It is easy to use and each charge lasts for at least 20 uses. I have used this producty for about a month and I saw the difference in my face after the second use! I was a bit surprised at how fast I noticed a difference. My skin looked brighter and the pimples that I had began to disappear. My pores also looked tighter. After the first couple of weeks, I noticed that my skin looked smoother and I didn&#x27;t need to wear much makeup. I use my own organic facial cleansing products and they work fine with the Mia. It has now become part of my regular hygiene routine. It&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this- reason gave it four is because wish I would&#x27;ve invested in the model with more speeds. The Mia is perfectly sized.</li>
            <li> This was broken, but unfortunately I gave it as a gift at Christmas last year, having purchased it earlier in the year, and couldn&#x27;t send it back.</li>
            <li> This improved my skin tone and texture SO much.  I have had troubled skin since I was a teenager and this makes me feel better about the appearance of my skin.  I use it every morning and night and I saw a difference within a couple days of use.  The brush is really easy to change and I love the magnetic charger.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous cleansing systems over the years...this is by far, the best one out there. You can pick the type of brush head you want, it&#x27;s extremely easy to clean, I love using it in the shower.  You can use your own soap, which is quite a savings.  The system can be used once, or twice a day, I found the deep cleaning most beneficial at the end of my day.  This system carries a higher price tag than the others I&#x27;ve tried, but the efficient performance difference is far greater than the price difference!  It carries a great refund warranty, if you don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the price, so what have you to lose - that was my thinking when I purchased it... I am so very happy that I went for it!</li>
            <li> I bought a mia almost one year ago and the results are amazing. I used it twice a day with all of my prescription face wash/toner/moisturizer ect... I think they suggest a gentle cream cleanser, and I would reiterate that suggestion because even the gentle brush is powerful and a grainy, scrubbing cleanser isn&#x27;t necessary in congruence with this product. Side note, I do have very sensitive skin so personally I would not use the other brushes because even the gentle brush was a little harsh in the beginning. The power of this product definitely surprised me, and even though my skin was a little irritated at first, it became super smooth in no time. It has not removed everything, but again that may be because I only use the gentle brush. It lasts a long time without having to charge, turns off when your cycle is done, vibrates with a varying number of pulses to tell you that the battery is running lower, and works great in the shower. I will never go anywhere without this thing!</li>
            <li> I first heard of this product from my older sister but put off buying one because of the cost, and my skin is normally pretty clear. That being said, I am now pregnant with my 4th child and hormones have wreaked havoc on my face. I broke down and got this after I went to a spa and they used it on my face. I like that I can use my normal face cleansing product with it, rather than having to buy a special one from the company. An added bonus is that you can use it in the shower, this is where I wash my face most mornings so it was nice to be able to get more use out of it than I originally planned. It seems to keep a charge well. My face is noticably smoother and not only do I have fewer blemishes, the ones I do have are smaller and go away twice as quickly as they previously did. It is also very easy to clean and seems durable. This is an investment, but I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Easy to charge and use.Leaves skin clear, soft with little effort in terms of time--my skin has not looked this decent for a decade.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for six months at skin care products.  I&#x27;m 40 and going through a mid-life event I suppose so am concerned with aging.  I weighted getting the Olay brush, but after reading the reviews for both and comparisons I went ahead and splurged on the Clarisonic and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inner brush vibrates or pulsates very fast on the skin, although you do not feel it really.  The outer bristles do not move, but they contain the splatter from the inner brush.  It has a one minute auto stop, so you scrub your face in a circular motion for one minute.  Do not push it hard on your skin, just flush otherwise the unit will not work properly.  I do not like to get it totally wet though because I want it to last, so I use it in the shower but I use is away from the water and when I clean the brush head off I take it off the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My face hasn&#x27;t felt so clean for... ever!  I got replacement brushes also, the grey for me and the green acne control for my daughter.  She loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People said they broke out for a few weeks because of all the dirt and grim, but I never did, so have hope on this one.</li>
            <li> I received the Mia as a gift months ago.  I recently began using it and could not be more satisfied.  Similar to an electric toothbrush, the device is easy to use and cleans effectively.  The rotating brush has a therapeutic massaging sensation to my skin.  No hassle charger, simple maintenance.  I find the refreshing gel cleanser included in the kit hydrates and smooths the appearance of my skin.  I used to have a face scrub regimen once a week, but this has replaced it and made the work more fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d looked at the Clarisonic Mia for quite a while.  I&#x27;ve used a sonic toothbrush for years-- dental hygienist is always happy with my teeth.  In spite of the price (which had held me back for quite a while) I went ahead and ordered.  I&#x27;m mid-50 and have dry and sensitive skin.  It is not too rough on my skin at all and I use it twice a day.  The texture of my skin improved within a week.  Now, it&#x27;s smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.  I was afraid it might cause break outs, but no. Fine lines seem softer, major \\&quot;character lines\\&quot; are still in residence-- can&#x27;t expect miracles.  You skin will thank you for its new Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> Update: I&#x27;ve had this for less than 2 years and the battery already died out. I only use it once a week but for the last few months it was still functioning I would have to charge it every week. Eventually it just stopped working after a few seconds. You&#x27;d think that a product that costs so much would have a longer battery life. Such a disappointment. I probably won&#x27;t buy another Clarisonic product anymore.    I have large pores with lots of icky whiteheads sticking out of it but after using this thing my skin definitely feels smooth and clean. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my pore size but I am definitely glad I made this investment.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have combination skin, oily in some areas and dry in others, also I tend to get irritated on my cheeks.  I use this product twice a day and my skin is clear, much more balanced and not irritated at all.  I LOVE this device.</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference in the way my face felt and how my products worked. My husband said I looked amazingly younger</li>
            <li> I love this gadget. I have been using it 2 times daily for a month and my prominent pores are disappearing and my face is smoother.</li>
            <li> came four days late and brush looks and felt used... :( however packaged well with samples and the item itself is still good :) i might have to buy a new brush though</li>
            <li> The clarasonic brush works perfectly. However I can&#x27;t give it a perfect 5 only because I really don&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin, or acne then when I clean it with my hands in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is my second Clarisonic and I really like this slightly smaller size, fits in hand better and still uses the same brushes.</li>
            <li> My face has never been clearer. It&#x27;s like a mini-facial every day! I recommended it to my boss and he bought one also and loves it. We definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like it. My skin is so smooth. I only use it every other day b/c it dries my skin. I  used a thicker moisturizer on those days. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in removing blackheads or correcting sun damage but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve stopped using exfoliator.  I use it on my neck too.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed my clarisonic. I was breaking out badly on my cheeks and chin and a bit on my forehead and so far the clarisonic has help stop my breakouts and my acne scars are fading. The texture of my skin is improving as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now and I don&#x27;t think it does anymore than a washcloth and soap.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic lives up to the hype!  I usually use an astringent after I clean my face and marvel at the amount of dirt still clinging to my skin.  However after using the Clarisonic and swiping my face, the cotton ball comes clean.  I am amazed.  I also like that it turns off automatically after 1 minute.  I burned thru two Olay face cleaners because I left them running.  I also got free shipping so it  like going to my local store but better because it was delivered to my door.  A good buy!</li>
            <li> Love the clarisonic i have worked for clinique cosmetics for 3 years and this a great product to add to your skin care system!</li>
            <li> well before i made my purchase i read quite a few reviews. at the point of purchase i knew what to expect. it has met my expectations. my skin breaks out easily, and keeping my skin cleaner seems to help. i would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife... these are her words....\\&quot;My cheeks are now extremely smooth, my complexion on my forehead has cleared up! This product has done what it said it would do and more.  I love it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product makes exfoliating obsolete. It cleans the skin amazingly well. I was very skeptical but now, I even travel with it. Skin with no dead cells to slough off looks brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product :) First, it seems very durable, like it would not break on me easily. Love the waterproof-ness. Cool magnetic charger, it stays charged for weeks. Fresh smelling cleanser - NOT greasy/oily. it did dry my forehead a little bit, but Im personally fine with that bcuz my skin is sensitive to lotiony/oily products.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it really deep cleans my skin and it is smoother. Some reviewers mentioned that it&#x27;s common to break out the 1st week of use - I had like couple extra break-outs, the first few days. Not sure if the Clarisonic is the cause, but after that it was fine. If it does break you out, thats most likely bcuz all the dirt is coming out of the skin.</li>
