            <li>Thanks for the prompt delivery and excellent packaging.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest here</li>

            <li>and it fits nicely in her locker.&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>

            <li>The case itself is really a nice size.</li>
            <li>The case was nice and the makeup</li>
            <li>unless of course you just want a nice portable case.</li>
            <li>The closing pieces have always worked, none of the box is breaking, and it fits almost all of what I own if I stack it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>the make up is decent at VERY best</li>
            <li>is a good product, it recoemindo, just have to be sure of the size or appropriate measures according to what you want.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping everything in the plastic holders as it makes everything very easy to find.</li>
            <li>I love all the blushes and eyeshadows the most!</li>
            <li>Its nice and holds most of my stuff.</li>

            <li>My Daughter has more make-up than anyone I know.</li>
            <li>Many colours and many lipsticks, many applicators</li>
            <li>I will most definately order Shany products again.  </li>
            <li>The makeup is ok.  </li>
            <li>Would be the perfect gift for any female in the world.</li>
            <li>they stay on ok.</li>
            <li>It is her favorite Holiday gift.  </li>
            <li>Could have done with out the nail polish and had more eye shadow and lipstick</li>
            <li>The make up is nice and fabulous.</li>
            <li>I love make up.</li>
            <li>The rest are OK.</li>
            <li>i love the eyeshadow&#x27;s in it the most.</li>
            <li>This train case is stunning.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get them</li>
            <li>all sorts of makeup most ladies</li>
            <li>Kit is okay.</li>
            <li>the case was ok</li>
            <li>There are so many make up colors to choose from and combintaions</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter for Christmas, as she&#x27;s heading into that age where she&#x27;s enjoying experimenting with makeup at home.</li>
            <li>She was also able to decorate the box somewhat with markers.</li>
            <li>I love the silver case it is cute.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow and blusher pallots are cute and I&#x27;ve been using them as well.</li>
            <li>all though, i would buy again. :)</li>
            <li>The case was ok</li>
            <li>I does hold alot but it is not the most stylist.</li>
            <li>Would be the perfect gift for any female in the world.</li>
            <li>i love the case.</li>
            <li>it rocks, for everyone else, ask in 10 years :)  </li>
            <li>and she is able to carry it around to friends houses or with her to Grandma&#x27;s house</li>
            <li>okay....</li>
            <li>When I contacted Amazon, I received a refund and was able to keep the makeup....</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup inside, most of it is garbage unless you plan on giving it to a child to play with.</li>
            <li>then layers of powder on top</li>
            <li>and i agree with most reviews on here.</li>
            <li>Needs better shipping protection.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the cosmetics assortment that came with the set.  </li>
            <li>If you do, most things would have to be in compact sizes.</li>
            <li>I love the eyeshadows that provide lots of color with subtlety.  </li>
            <li>Love the nail polish.</li>
            <li>Came in a great metal box, very durable.</li>
            <li>But the shipping could of been alots better When I opened the train case 2 of my eye shadows were broke not usable</li>
            <li>Better quality make up than the cheaper sets at the drug stores.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love the make up</li>
            <li>but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the case.</li>
            <li>its nothing over the top</li>
            <li>The colors are super hot, and perfect, light colors for a beginner.</li>
            <li>She loves it, she now travels with the very nice, silver box and ready to make up anyone...</li>
            <li>they are pretty good quality for the price, and they come with sizable amounts of each product.</li>
            <li>Its a great kit for anyone who is new to makeup or.</li>
            <li>I also love to do others&#x27; makeup, so having a wide variety of makeup comes in handy!!!</li>
            <li>Love the box...love the blush, they are just right, and eyeshadow&#x27;s are nice....</li>
            <li>Very cool case, ample selection of eye shades.  </li>
            <li>makeup is OK,  brushes are CHEAP</li>
            <li>i love love love this set, just the box alone is worth the money.</li>
            <li>For an 11 year old, this is great, and it holds her make-up collection.</li>
            <li>At the ages of 8 and 9 they are becoming divas.</li>
            <li>the bag is very practical and good presentation.</li>
            <li>really got it for the  case because of all the reviews that were so good  </li>
            <li>a reasonable good price for a lot of make up.</li>
            <li>box really looks good.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the case!</li>
            <li>This is so cool to have!</li>
            <li>but i got this as a gift to for someone and they loved it, great for little girls ages 8-13</li>
            <li>easily fade or wear off, I found an&lt;br /&gt;excellent solution to the problem, and&lt;br</li>
            <li>carry and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, has potential to be a great product.</li>
            <li>Would easily say I got what I paid for, though it is not quite what you</li>
            <li>The case isn&#x27;t bulky and everything is easily kept together.</li>
            <li>He arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>The make-up is good with a nice case but it is much smaller than the picture makes it look.</li>
            <li>Not the best makeup, but good enough with enough variety for practice.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty and the case is nice.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy and opens and closes easily and feels secure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The case itself is fine for me.</li>
            <li>Wow this is so awesome, what a great idea to put makeup a little suit case!</li>
            <li>Super good price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Made well and the make up is perfect for any little girls.</li>
            <li>but I thought I would pay more to return then what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit what I need to fit in there.  </li>
            <li>Cheap make up, cheap containers.</li>
            <li>its got everything you can possibly need to doll up in one great box</li>
            <li>If you are a makeup artist and need a case to fit alot of your makeup in then you will not want it.</li>
            <li>am very happy with the products I received from SHANY; however, a few notes of change that I wish to share are:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Great for a teen or make up lover.</li>
            <li>This is a  fantastic make up kit</li>
            <li>Cheap makeup and case.</li>
            <li>If you filled it up you would be lost....</li>
            <li>It would be a great item for the extra makeup case or the portable make case, Linda W.</li>
            <li>All My things fit in it which is a plus.</li>
            <li>and i would definitely recommend to everyone, its also a great gift idea.</li>
            <li>Eyeshadows also go on light and do not blend well.  </li>
            <li>Great for just starting out makeup wearers.</li>
            <li>Great for personal use or for gifts.</li>
            <li>It was enjoy to the fulliest.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old loved this product she took every thing of her Christmas list for it</li>
            <li>It came in good shape and with Prime shipping and she loves the nail polish so far.</li>
            <li>, the lesson learned is this is good value if you plan to buy it for young or preteen girls to play with.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to worry because I had everything right there in one spot :)</li>
            <li>My teenager loves it and found it very useful.  </li>
            <li>this is a big help i do recommend this and the case very nicely made</li>
            <li>The quality of the items is amazing, and you get so much for such a good price.</li>
            <li>She was so excited because it had everything.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this with the intentions for the case.  </li>
            <li>but I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>To start off, I originally bought this for the case and the makeup was just going to be an \\&quot;added bonus\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She wasn&#x27;t overly excited about it</li>
            <li>it comes with makes it fun to try out!</li>
            <li>I was able to give most of them away, but I admit I love the eyeshadow colors, so as long as I use a primer</li>
            <li>The product was for a special gift.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that came in good condition was the case.</li>
            <li>But they seem to be good enough.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice box with a complete set of make up and tools.</li>
            <li>As a young girl, she was thrilled to receive a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; make up set.  </li>
            <li>rest is all cheap makeup worth a dollar.</li>
            <li>The case is solid and the make-up looks to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>THIS MAKE UP CASE WAS SO COOL</li>
            <li>BUT STILL COOL</li>
            <li>Just the right size to fit in my suitcase and holds everything I need.</li>
            <li>Great cosmetics and the case is extremely well made and durable.</li>
            <li>the locks broke off quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional entertainer and need a trunk case to keep the makeup contained safely during travels without spilling in my bag, but don&#x27;t need the huge sized wheeled cases with a billion compartments.  </li>
            <li>It is the right size for holding a good amount of cosmetics but is not so big that you feel clunky carrying it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>But then again it was pretty cheap</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic makeup kits,it is worth to own it, it is actually smaller than what i thought before</li>
            <li>nice in the photo, but once you unpack the colors from it, I don&#x27;t see how you would keep them seperated in the box, which is not only 1/4 full.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only are the shadows and everything else inside this case amazing but the travel case itself is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case is very sturdy and is fabulous for keeping everything organized.  </li>
            <li>This was not $42 dollar worth of make up</li>
            <li>The case is easily my favorite part - so professional looking, yet durable.</li>
            <li>, the makeup is fun to play with.</li>
            <li>Totally came in handy last weekend when I had to rush out of town for a spontaneous road trip.</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>But it is nice for traveling and carrying your personal items.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the case is all that&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>I received some colors that I normally wouldn&#x27;t purchase for myself, only to find out that I really liked them!</li>
            <li>arrived in perfect condition and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li>(Colors may vary, e.g., we did not get the rose red nail vanish like in Amazon&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Nice box, but its smaller than it appears and the eyeshadows came busted....</li>
            <li>I love these cases for travel because my soft makeup bags get smashed along with everything in it.  </li>
            <li>i like this makeup box and the makeup inside is good,and got the right stuff what i was  looking for</li>
            <li>This right here will do the trick</li>
            <li>She started using it right away and loves the colors.</li>
            <li>The first set did come with some of the makeup broken but they were very happy to replace it for me.</li>
            <li>A college or High School Student could also find this set very useful.</li>
            <li>I should have just paid a little more for a better quality makeup case.  </li>
            <li>very good product , it was what I expected , I recommend hundred percent, I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>the product was for a birthday gift and the person who was present was very happy because I wanted for a few days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with all the items, and the train case was much higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>Overall good first kit for my 9 ear old.</li>
            <li>I love the makeup, it works very well with a makeup brush and the array of color was great, but I do wish the case came with a larger mirror than what was provided with the little plastic</li>
            <li>More colors of eye shadow than I&#x27;m likely to use.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll like it;)</li>
            <li>Overall the case was okay.</li>
            <li>but it anit the lip liner broke when i first took off the lid and the mirror is flimsy</li>
            <li>I love all the colors iside this train case that will last for years to come.</li>
            <li>It can be used for many different things even after the makeup is all used up.</li>
            <li>This kit was exactly what she was looking for and she likes to take it with her</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed was the box.</li>
            <li>Overall recommended to people who don&#x27;t use top brands</li>
            <li>Very convenient size with the hottest items you&#x27;ll need!</li>
            <li>She loved it and uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li>The colors inside are pretty decent!</li>
            <li>The makeup is good but not top quality.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of colors for all skin tones and makes &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; around with different colors easy.  </li>
            <li>I love sets like this because I can try various colors and when I find which ones I prefer I can order the full size when necessary.  </li>
            <li>This case is nice for younger girls just starting out but for older women, you may want something more sturdy and bigger to carry all the necessities.</li>
            <li>Nice little case, lots of colors.  </li>
            <li>I love every single thing about this kit!</li>
            <li>I got this for a gift for my daughter and she loves it, she keeps all of her makeup in it and the colors in the case were really nice and has used a little of everything which is unusual.</li>
            <li>and she loves it thanks again</li>
            <li>I really like this and came as described.</li>
            <li>And the manufacturer really should have included a reorder form for when something runs out or additional items.</li>
            <li>, it is light and solid.  </li>
            <li>The 1 star is for fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Much.  </li>
            <li>It looks much beter on the picture.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s either changed or no one else has ever had a  real make-up</li>
            <li>Lipstick, eye makeup, the whole works.</li>
            <li>Pro who just wants to expand there collection.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3 because it did not come with everything, and really it cost way to much for something that looks like you could get for 10$ at a pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a modern, quality feel.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Really upset about this product</li>
            <li>whole kit is actually very convenient</li>
            <li>The delivery of this product was very timely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She wants to start wearing make-up and dressing a bit nicer for school.</li>
            <li>but i do really like the nail polish, though its not the colors pictured in the shot.</li>
            <li>Everything was included and would have been a great purchase if all the powders weren&#x27;t broken and everywhere.</li>
            <li>again thanks</li>
            <li>DIDN&#x27;T WANT MAKE UP, I REALLY BROUGHT IT.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>i purchased this for a make up class, wanted something in bulk for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Product with modern design and options for all occasions.</li>
            <li>The case is nice and can be used for several different things though.  </li>
            <li>I DO NOT recommend buying this product for this price when there are so many other places you can buy a make-up kit.</li>
            <li>i love this case, not only is small and compact it store a decent amount of makeup when im traveling, its very light weight</li>
            <li>i could see it being a good starter kit for someone learning but not for a serious person.</li>
            <li>i bought this as a bday gift for my 12 year old daughter and it shipped very fast condition of the product</li>
            <li>good morning, is to wait too long to receive the goods but this came with shadows games, other as if they were used.</li>
            <li>There was only one eye shadow that had shifted out of the case, but it was not bad.</li>
            <li>The box was a little big but works well in putting my GOOD makeup in for travel.</li>
            <li>its my new train case!</li>
            <li>it looks like cheap crap you would purchase at dollar general!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>if i wanted this for anything really more then the case then this would have got less stars.</li>
            <li>Decent case.  </li>
            <li>The case is okay, if you are using it for only your personal makeup products.</li>
            <li>It is so cute, yet so simple and definitely works well to hold your makeup.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this better is if it had cover sized mirror attached to the inner cover.  </li>
            <li>Only gave it 4stars because it would be better if it were a tad bit bigger with maybe pullout compartment.</li>
            <li>recommend highly</li>
            <li>she not in to the high price makeup</li>
            <li>The products seems to be also of a high quality</li>
            <li>High recommend.</li>
            <li>The nail polish is nice just hard to remove.</li>
            <li>so well, i guess the box is the only thing in this product worth the 20 bucks...</li>
            <li>Also, the brushes that were supposed to be on the inside top of the product were completely missing.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly smaller than what I had envisioned but as previously stated it fits nicely in her school locker</li>
            <li>I wanted something kind of medium sized to travel with and this is just too small!  </li>
            <li>and no they don&#x27;t wear it in public, but a gilrs gotta play right ?</li>
            <li>I got this for someone who wanted new eye shadows and a makeup carrying case.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and has been practicing new techniques since she has received.  </li>
            <li>The nail polishes are not the same ones in the very first picture (block shape) with the red, tan, light pink and metallic color.</li>
            <li>the case is nice and you can use it for your make up, but the make up that comes with the case is NOT good.</li>
            <li>8 year old Granddaughter loves this!</li>
            <li>I feel like a professional!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s clearly well made, plus</li>
            <li>Cheap, tiny products, came in package with some pots crushed.</li>
            <li>The picture looks like there was more included, not much there for the 30.00 I spent on it.  </li>
            <li>The make up was complete and in tact.</li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have no hesitation recommending this to anyone who has a busy morning schedule.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my almost 13 year old niece, she lives in another state</li>
            <li>I really wanted a case that wasn&#x27;t too big since I don&#x27;t have a ton of makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides, it looked compact and complete</li>
            <li>Bought this as a &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; make up set for Christmas for my 9 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I would think any adult who likes to use a variety of colors and products would like this as well.</li>
            <li>As an adult, would I use this?</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for a young girl.</li>
            <li>, the lipstick is all clear no matter what shades you get, and the brush is soft but falls apart as you start to use it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was pleasantly surprised with the nail polish.</li>
            <li>My husband fixed that for me.  </li>
            <li>and it was really old and wanted a replace</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my niece - she really like it especially since she is in Cosmology School.</li>
            <li>It comes with an complete eyeshadow makeup beauty case.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 21 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>it was old and dryed out.</li>
            <li>It looked like someone sent an old used one.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for an 8 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Much smaller,items where damaged, overall would not recommend.  </li>
            <li>and I also got her a set of professional brushes.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old niece squealed over this.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest utilizing better packaging for this product for shipment as the person who it was intended for would not enjoy it in its current state.</li>
            <li>The make up case has enough room for all my other additions such as foundation, concealer, tweezers, eye brow stencils, mascara, toe &amp; finger nails, and a lot more.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, Price was right, Was as expected!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really not a problem for an individual to use versus if you were using it to do makeup you may run out quickly.</li>
            <li>All of the make up colors look about right, only the packaging is wrong and there is writing on it that says Magic Color.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the aluminum case is \\&quot;aluminum\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was however surprised by the size, I was expecting the case to be a bit bigger</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old daughter as a starting off kit.</li>
            <li>One coat, for the ones I received, were the actual colors and so far has lasted on my toes for about a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is for my 14 year old granddaughter, who is just starting to experiment with make-up.</li>
            <li>I think  you can get a better kit on your retailer, the colors and quality are nice but not awesome, I think you receive a little bit less than you pay for....</li>
            <li>I think the price was reasonable since I was looking for a case in other stores and online.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow was broken and smelled like dead cat, the blush spreaded all over my entire face when I was out at my very important work meeting, the lip blams (such as: lipgloss, lipstick) was very gooey and smelled like my mother</li>
            <li>I really like this little case of cosmetics.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is really great.</li>
            <li> Happy holidays,</li>
            <li> everything is great...</li>

            <li> I love the train case, but the cosmetics themselves aren&#x27;t very good quality.</li>
            <li> Lipstick colors are too bright.  </li>
            <li> the make up isnt as bright as it looks</li>
            <li> I did not like the eye shadows because they are not as good</li>
            <li> What happened to paying a fair price for good quality merchandise?  </li>
            <li> This makes a good starter kit.</li>
            <li> She loved it.</li>

            <li> These were gifts for my grandchildren which they we thrilled.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the prompt delivery and excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest here</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although they aren&#x27;t those which have&lt;br /&gt;been made under popular brands and they</li>

            <li> and it fits nicely in her locker.&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>

            <li> unless of course you just want a nice portable case.</li>
            <li> The closing pieces have always worked, none of the box is breaking, and it fits almost all of what I own if I stack it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> the make up is decent at VERY best</li>
            <li> is a good product, it recoemindo, just have to be sure of the size or appropriate measures according to what you want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping everything in the plastic holders as it makes everything very easy to find.</li>

            <li> So if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking at it is definitely a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> My Daughter has more make-up than anyone I know.</li>
            <li> Many colours and many lipsticks, many applicators</li>
            <li> I will most definately order Shany products again.  </li>
            <li> The makeup is ok.  </li>
            <li> Would be the perfect gift for any female in the world.</li>
            <li> they stay on ok.</li>
            <li> It is her favorite Holiday gift.  </li>
            <li> Could have done with out the nail polish and had more eye shadow and lipstick</li>
            <li> The make up is nice and fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love make up.</li>
            <li> The rest are OK.</li>
            <li> i love the eyeshadow&#x27;s in it the most.</li>
            <li> This train case is stunning.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get them</li>
            <li> all sorts of makeup most ladies</li>
            <li> Kit is okay.</li>
            <li> the case was ok</li>
            <li> There are so many make up colors to choose from and combintaions</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas, as she&#x27;s heading into that age where she&#x27;s enjoying experimenting with makeup at home.</li>
            <li> She was also able to decorate the box somewhat with markers.</li>
            <li> I love the silver case it is cute.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow and blusher pallots are cute and I&#x27;ve been using them as well.</li>
            <li> all though, i would buy again. :)</li>
            <li> The case was ok</li>
            <li> I does hold alot but it is not the most stylist.</li>
            <li> Would be the perfect gift for any female in the world.</li>
            <li> i love the case.</li>
            <li> it rocks, for everyone else, ask in 10 years :)  </li>
            <li> and she is able to carry it around to friends houses or with her to Grandma&#x27;s house</li>
            <li> okay....</li>
            <li> When I contacted Amazon, I received a refund and was able to keep the makeup....</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup inside, most of it is garbage unless you plan on giving it to a child to play with.</li>
            <li> then layers of powder on top</li>
            <li> and i agree with most reviews on here.</li>
            <li> Needs better shipping protection.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the cosmetics assortment that came with the set.  </li>
            <li> If you do, most things would have to be in compact sizes.</li>
            <li> I love the eyeshadows that provide lots of color with subtlety.  </li>
            <li> Love the nail polish.</li>
            <li> Came in a great metal box, very durable.</li>
            <li> But the shipping could of been alots better When I opened the train case 2 of my eye shadows were broke not usable</li>
            <li> Better quality make up than the cheaper sets at the drug stores.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love the make up</li>
            <li> but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the case.</li>
            <li> its nothing over the top</li>
            <li> The colors are super hot, and perfect, light colors for a beginner.</li>
            <li> She loves it, she now travels with the very nice, silver box and ready to make up anyone...</li>
            <li> they are pretty good quality for the price, and they come with sizable amounts of each product.</li>
            <li> Its a great kit for anyone who is new to makeup or.</li>
            <li> I also love to do others&#x27; makeup, so having a wide variety of makeup comes in handy!!!</li>
            <li> Love the box...love the blush, they are just right, and eyeshadow&#x27;s are nice....</li>
            <li> Very cool case, ample selection of eye shades.  </li>
            <li> makeup is OK,  brushes are CHEAP</li>
            <li> i love love love this set, just the box alone is worth the money.</li>
            <li> For an 11 year old, this is great, and it holds her make-up collection.</li>
            <li> At the ages of 8 and 9 they are becoming divas.</li>
            <li> the bag is very practical and good presentation.</li>
            <li> really got it for the  case because of all the reviews that were so good  </li>
            <li> a reasonable good price for a lot of make up.</li>
            <li> box really looks good.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the case!</li>
            <li> This is so cool to have!</li>
            <li> but i got this as a gift to for someone and they loved it, great for little girls ages 8-13</li>
            <li> easily fade or wear off, I found an&lt;br /&gt;excellent solution to the problem, and&lt;br</li>
            <li> carry and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, has potential to be a great product.</li>
            <li> Would easily say I got what I paid for, though it is not quite what you</li>
            <li> The case isn&#x27;t bulky and everything is easily kept together.</li>
            <li> He arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> The make-up is good with a nice case but it is much smaller than the picture makes it look.</li>
            <li> Not the best makeup, but good enough with enough variety for practice.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty and the case is nice.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy and opens and closes easily and feels secure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The case itself is fine for me.</li>
            <li> Wow this is so awesome, what a great idea to put makeup a little suit case!</li>
            <li> Super good price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Made well and the make up is perfect for any little girls.</li>
            <li> but I thought I would pay more to return then what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit what I need to fit in there.  </li>
            <li> Cheap make up, cheap containers.</li>
            <li> its got everything you can possibly need to doll up in one great box</li>
            <li> If you are a makeup artist and need a case to fit alot of your makeup in then you will not want it.</li>
            <li> am very happy with the products I received from SHANY; however, a few notes of change that I wish to share are:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Great for a teen or make up lover.</li>
            <li> This is a  fantastic make up kit</li>
            <li> Cheap makeup and case.</li>
            <li> If you filled it up you would be lost....</li>
            <li> It would be a great item for the extra makeup case or the portable make case, Linda W.</li>
            <li> All My things fit in it which is a plus.</li>
            <li> and i would definitely recommend to everyone, its also a great gift idea.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows also go on light and do not blend well.  </li>
            <li> Great for just starting out makeup wearers.</li>
            <li> Great for personal use or for gifts.</li>
            <li> It was enjoy to the fulliest.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old loved this product she took every thing of her Christmas list for it</li>
            <li> It came in good shape and with Prime shipping and she loves the nail polish so far.</li>
            <li> , the lesson learned is this is good value if you plan to buy it for young or preteen girls to play with.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to worry because I had everything right there in one spot :)</li>
            <li> My teenager loves it and found it very useful.  </li>
            <li> this is a big help i do recommend this and the case very nicely made</li>
            <li> The quality of the items is amazing, and you get so much for such a good price.</li>
            <li> She was so excited because it had everything.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this with the intentions for the case.  </li>
            <li> but I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> To start off, I originally bought this for the case and the makeup was just going to be an \\&quot;added bonus\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She wasn&#x27;t overly excited about it</li>
            <li> it comes with makes it fun to try out!</li>
            <li> I was able to give most of them away, but I admit I love the eyeshadow colors, so as long as I use a primer</li>
            <li> The product was for a special gift.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that came in good condition was the case.</li>
            <li> But they seem to be good enough.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice box with a complete set of make up and tools.</li>
            <li> As a young girl, she was thrilled to receive a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; make up set.  </li>
            <li> rest is all cheap makeup worth a dollar.</li>
            <li> The case is solid and the make-up looks to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> THIS MAKE UP CASE WAS SO COOL</li>
            <li> BUT STILL COOL</li>
            <li> Just the right size to fit in my suitcase and holds everything I need.</li>
            <li> Great cosmetics and the case is extremely well made and durable.</li>
            <li> the locks broke off quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional entertainer and need a trunk case to keep the makeup contained safely during travels without spilling in my bag, but don&#x27;t need the huge sized wheeled cases with a billion compartments.  </li>
            <li> It is the right size for holding a good amount of cosmetics but is not so big that you feel clunky carrying it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> But then again it was pretty cheap</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic makeup kits,it is worth to own it, it is actually smaller than what i thought before</li>
            <li> nice in the photo, but once you unpack the colors from it, I don&#x27;t see how you would keep them seperated in the box, which is not only 1/4 full.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only are the shadows and everything else inside this case amazing but the travel case itself is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is very sturdy and is fabulous for keeping everything organized.  </li>
            <li> This was not $42 dollar worth of make up</li>
            <li> The case is easily my favorite part - so professional looking, yet durable.</li>
            <li> , the makeup is fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Totally came in handy last weekend when I had to rush out of town for a spontaneous road trip.</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> But it is nice for traveling and carrying your personal items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the case is all that&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> I received some colors that I normally wouldn&#x27;t purchase for myself, only to find out that I really liked them!</li>
            <li> arrived in perfect condition and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> (Colors may vary, e.g., we did not get the rose red nail vanish like in Amazon&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice box, but its smaller than it appears and the eyeshadows came busted....</li>
            <li> I love these cases for travel because my soft makeup bags get smashed along with everything in it.  </li>
            <li> i like this makeup box and the makeup inside is good,and got the right stuff what i was  looking for</li>
            <li> This right here will do the trick</li>
            <li> She started using it right away and loves the colors.</li>
            <li> The first set did come with some of the makeup broken but they were very happy to replace it for me.</li>
            <li> A college or High School Student could also find this set very useful.</li>
            <li> I should have just paid a little more for a better quality makeup case.  </li>
            <li> very good product , it was what I expected , I recommend hundred percent, I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> the product was for a birthday gift and the person who was present was very happy because I wanted for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with all the items, and the train case was much higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> Overall good first kit for my 9 ear old.</li>
            <li> I love the makeup, it works very well with a makeup brush and the array of color was great, but I do wish the case came with a larger mirror than what was provided with the little plastic</li>
            <li> More colors of eye shadow than I&#x27;m likely to use.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll like it;)</li>
            <li> Overall the case was okay.</li>
            <li> but it anit the lip liner broke when i first took off the lid and the mirror is flimsy</li>
            <li> I love all the colors iside this train case that will last for years to come.</li>
            <li> It can be used for many different things even after the makeup is all used up.</li>
            <li> This kit was exactly what she was looking for and she likes to take it with her</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed was the box.</li>
            <li> Overall recommended to people who don&#x27;t use top brands</li>
            <li> Very convenient size with the hottest items you&#x27;ll need!</li>
            <li> She loved it and uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> The colors inside are pretty decent!</li>
            <li> The makeup is good but not top quality.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of colors for all skin tones and makes &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; around with different colors easy.  </li>
            <li> I love sets like this because I can try various colors and when I find which ones I prefer I can order the full size when necessary.  </li>
            <li> This case is nice for younger girls just starting out but for older women, you may want something more sturdy and bigger to carry all the necessities.</li>
            <li> Nice little case, lots of colors.  </li>
            <li> I love every single thing about this kit!</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift for my daughter and she loves it, she keeps all of her makeup in it and the colors in the case were really nice and has used a little of everything which is unusual.</li>
            <li> and she loves it thanks again</li>
            <li> I really like this and came as described.</li>
            <li> And the manufacturer really should have included a reorder form for when something runs out or additional items.</li>
            <li> , it is light and solid.  </li>
            <li> The 1 star is for fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Much.  </li>
            <li> It looks much beter on the picture.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s either changed or no one else has ever had a  real make-up</li>
            <li> Lipstick, eye makeup, the whole works.</li>
            <li> Pro who just wants to expand there collection.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 because it did not come with everything, and really it cost way to much for something that looks like you could get for 10$ at a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a modern, quality feel.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Really upset about this product</li>
            <li> whole kit is actually very convenient</li>
            <li> The delivery of this product was very timely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She wants to start wearing make-up and dressing a bit nicer for school.</li>
            <li> but i do really like the nail polish, though its not the colors pictured in the shot.</li>
            <li> Everything was included and would have been a great purchase if all the powders weren&#x27;t broken and everywhere.</li>
            <li> again thanks</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T WANT MAKE UP, I REALLY BROUGHT IT.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> i purchased this for a make up class, wanted something in bulk for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Product with modern design and options for all occasions.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and can be used for several different things though.  </li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend buying this product for this price when there are so many other places you can buy a make-up kit.</li>
            <li> i love this case, not only is small and compact it store a decent amount of makeup when im traveling, its very light weight</li>
            <li> i could see it being a good starter kit for someone learning but not for a serious person.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a bday gift for my 12 year old daughter and it shipped very fast condition of the product</li>
            <li> good morning, is to wait too long to receive the goods but this came with shadows games, other as if they were used.</li>
            <li> There was only one eye shadow that had shifted out of the case, but it was not bad.</li>
            <li> The box was a little big but works well in putting my GOOD makeup in for travel.</li>
            <li> its my new train case!</li>
            <li> it looks like cheap crap you would purchase at dollar general!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> if i wanted this for anything really more then the case then this would have got less stars.</li>
            <li> Decent case.  </li>
            <li> The case is okay, if you are using it for only your personal makeup products.</li>
            <li> It is so cute, yet so simple and definitely works well to hold your makeup.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this better is if it had cover sized mirror attached to the inner cover.  </li>
            <li> Only gave it 4stars because it would be better if it were a tad bit bigger with maybe pullout compartment.</li>
            <li> recommend highly</li>
            <li> she not in to the high price makeup</li>
            <li> The products seems to be also of a high quality</li>
            <li> High recommend.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is nice just hard to remove.</li>
            <li> so well, i guess the box is the only thing in this product worth the 20 bucks...</li>
            <li> Also, the brushes that were supposed to be on the inside top of the product were completely missing.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly smaller than what I had envisioned but as previously stated it fits nicely in her school locker</li>
            <li> I wanted something kind of medium sized to travel with and this is just too small!  </li>
            <li> and no they don&#x27;t wear it in public, but a gilrs gotta play right ?</li>
            <li> I got this for someone who wanted new eye shadows and a makeup carrying case.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and has been practicing new techniques since she has received.  </li>
            <li> The nail polishes are not the same ones in the very first picture (block shape) with the red, tan, light pink and metallic color.</li>
            <li> the case is nice and you can use it for your make up, but the make up that comes with the case is NOT good.</li>
            <li> 8 year old Granddaughter loves this!</li>
            <li> I feel like a professional!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s clearly well made, plus</li>
            <li> Cheap, tiny products, came in package with some pots crushed.</li>
            <li> The picture looks like there was more included, not much there for the 30.00 I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> The make up was complete and in tact.</li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have no hesitation recommending this to anyone who has a busy morning schedule.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my almost 13 year old niece, she lives in another state</li>
            <li> I really wanted a case that wasn&#x27;t too big since I don&#x27;t have a ton of makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides, it looked compact and complete</li>
            <li> Bought this as a &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; make up set for Christmas for my 9 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I would think any adult who likes to use a variety of colors and products would like this as well.</li>
            <li> As an adult, would I use this?</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a young girl.</li>
            <li> , the lipstick is all clear no matter what shades you get, and the brush is soft but falls apart as you start to use it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was pleasantly surprised with the nail polish.</li>
            <li> My husband fixed that for me.  </li>
            <li> and it was really old and wanted a replace</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my niece - she really like it especially since she is in Cosmology School.</li>
            <li> It comes with an complete eyeshadow makeup beauty case.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 21 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> it was old and dryed out.</li>
            <li> It looked like someone sent an old used one.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for an 8 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Much smaller,items where damaged, overall would not recommend.  </li>
            <li> and I also got her a set of professional brushes.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old niece squealed over this.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest utilizing better packaging for this product for shipment as the person who it was intended for would not enjoy it in its current state.</li>
            <li> The make up case has enough room for all my other additions such as foundation, concealer, tweezers, eye brow stencils, mascara, toe &amp; finger nails, and a lot more.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, Price was right, Was as expected!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really not a problem for an individual to use versus if you were using it to do makeup you may run out quickly.</li>
            <li> All of the make up colors look about right, only the packaging is wrong and there is writing on it that says Magic Color.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the aluminum case is \\&quot;aluminum\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was however surprised by the size, I was expecting the case to be a bit bigger</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter as a starting off kit.</li>
            <li> One coat, for the ones I received, were the actual colors and so far has lasted on my toes for about a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is for my 14 year old granddaughter, who is just starting to experiment with make-up.</li>
            <li> I think  you can get a better kit on your retailer, the colors and quality are nice but not awesome, I think you receive a little bit less than you pay for....</li>
            <li> I think the price was reasonable since I was looking for a case in other stores and online.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow was broken and smelled like dead cat, the blush spreaded all over my entire face when I was out at my very important work meeting, the lip blams (such as: lipgloss, lipstick) was very gooey and smelled like my mother</li>
            <li> I really like this little case of cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> This kit has a little bit of everything and a decent variety of colors.</li>
            <li> The mirror is broken, and in the picture the trunk train case looks so nice, with no many make up pieces, but actually, it didn&#x27;t come with all the make up pieces I saw at the picture.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact there is stuff to store my smaller items that usually get lost in my makeup case.</li>
            <li> The lip stick does not have a lot of pigment and it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Overall not as big as I expected</li>
            <li> When the product was received, I opened it and the make-up pieces were found popped out of its plastic interior case display, but luckily nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a male single parent</li>
            <li> The case is big enough to add shampoo, hairspray, brush, comb, other items.  </li>
            <li> Shany Cosmetics Carry All Train Case with Makeup and Reusable Aluminium Case the items were not shany cosmetics but cameo brand , my purchase was receive it a very quick time after purchasing it,the item is of a very poor quality .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, for a little lady (7 and 9 year old)</li>
            <li> It is not really that big at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very sturdy and it&#x27;s alot smaller than I</li>
            <li> you may not want to put them back), the bottom is just empty</li>
            <li> Case is 10\\&quot; long x 6.5\\&quot; wide x 3.5\\&quot; deep.  </li>
            <li> The colors in the case were very nice, but was disappointed how small the kit was overall.  </li>
            <li> The other pictures are what&#x27;s actually in the makeup case.  </li>
            <li> I will be looking forward to other products in the future!</li>
            <li> The eye shadows appear to be a little slightly smaller than the regular sized Palled eye shadows</li>
            <li> Other than that, if you have lots of makeup or bigger</li>
            <li> then you might not have enough room to put in the case with all your other stuff.</li>
            <li> and they are dry.</li>
            <li> , it looks a bit small, but at least you can try the item before committing to buying the full size version.</li>
            <li> these products are made in chiness, are bad, do not paint anything, do not recommend them, how beautiful is the case, are additional products you can get on the street vendors, the pencils are broken when you take out point</li>
            <li> The nail polish are a little sheer</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger, but despite the size, it works for me.  </li>
            <li> The quality was not what I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> When I received it the eye shadow was all crushed up, don&#x27;t know if it was like that when it was shipped or while it was being shipped.</li>
            <li> I just need to be careful with it because it seems that its not that sturdy.</li>
            <li> read the product description carefully.  </li>
            <li> i got two browns a pink and tan</li>
            <li> so I never really got to see what it all looked like or contained</li>
            <li> The blush brushes aren&#x27;t soft and thick and therefore do not pick up and apply blush well.  </li>
            <li> Buy the real deal for teenage or girls who use serious makeup, which makes sense because how can you look like a million bucks with a 19-dollar makeup set?!!</li>
            <li> the product was a lot smaller than i expected , some of the eyeshadows were broken and the case was full of the eyeshadows not happy at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought for niece, and the feedback from her was not a positive one.  </li>
            <li> Just looking at the picture I thought that it would only hold a few things but its like there is master bedroom hidden.</li>
            <li> The make-up is low quality and the case is so small I would not know how to re-use for anything.  </li>
            <li> The box is small when we received the item, the picture on the website makes it look a lot bigger.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The plastic display case for the makeup inside the aluminum case was already warped when the package was received, making me think the package went through extreme heat before being sent</li>
            <li> it is endless on what you could create.</li>
            <li> strange how they got painted though, it would appear I am a heavy sleeper</li>
            <li> and she is not pretty.</li>
            <li> (Never going threw that again NEVER BUY THIS ITEM ONLY IF YOU WANT TO SMELL LIKE DEAD CAT AND GET STICKED TO EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH WITH YOUR FACE!</li>
            <li> This caused them to cover all of the other items(in nail polish among other things).</li>
            <li> shipped extremely well.</li>
            <li> However as other reviews it was not what the picture implies.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s an ok starter set for a little girl, but my daughter was pretty disappointed Christmas morning when she opened it up and half the things inside were broken.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is I found it hard to take the covers off.</li>
            <li> It does come with a lot of colors and average quality makeup.</li>
            <li> So all I can think of is that this is either a knock off shoved into a Shany box and sold as a Shany or the whole kit is wrong.</li>
            <li> The makeup is just not worth it.</li>
            <li> The thing i don&#x27;t like is if you&#x27;re planning to carry it around without all the makeup spilling all over, you have to keep the plastic topper on top and it is annoying to take on and off.</li>
            <li> Most of the eyeshadow would need a black base underneath (to bring out the color) and</li>
            <li> I think Thu is something that you should by for alittle girl who wants to start trying make up but ddoesn&#x27;t want to waste money on the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> but it is having less items as appear on the image&lt;br</li>
            <li> Half the eye shadows came cracked and unusable.</li>
            <li> im not really sure what i expected</li>
            <li> when i open the case there i found a broken nail polish which soiled up the other items in the case</li>
            <li> It has a little of everything.</li>
            <li> Offer a little misleading in relation to the publication of photos, but if it is acceptable, but does not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit like little girl quality to me.</li>
            <li> She gave everything else to her little sis to play makeup</li>
            <li> This is the cutest little case.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t go on very dark.</li>
            <li> The eye and lip pencils do not go on very dark, and so do the lipsticks.  </li>
            <li> It stinks as much as the odor on my face from this makeup item.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with my purchase, It looked alot larger than I thought...</li>
            <li> if you want a set to carry around with you that is not too heavy, i would definitly recomend this set.</li>
            <li> But several of the eyeshadows came broken.  </li>
            <li> (I woke up, and looked like a dead fish)</li>
            <li> This product came with the shadow all broken up - making everything blue inside.  </li>
            <li> I will start with the bad first.</li>
            <li> However, the one we received had several broken pieces, the compacts with mirror were each broken in half.</li>
            <li> The box is very small and with much less in it when you see it in person versus in the picture advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to small.</li>
            <li> I like the small case</li>
            <li> Do not buy unless you are going to give to a small child for play make-up.</li>
            <li> Lots in a small package.</li>
            <li> It is small so its convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li> Small but spacey.</li>
            <li> Mirror box and pencil tips were broken when being removed from elastic bands because elastic bands tightly hold both ends of the double-ended eye and lip pencils, etc., and case is small with little room to wiggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the makeup inside is just not very good at all.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality of makeup at all...gave it to the teens.</li>
            <li> recommended as a gift for teenagers but not suitable for women as official makeup.</li>
            <li> Also the nail polish smell was awful and soo strong.</li>
            <li> The casing is hard and works well.</li>
            <li> The colors are dull and are boring.also</li>
            <li> Aside from the lid that holds the brushes (so hard in fact, once removed</li>
            <li> Not nearly as nice as pictured and items seem trial sized.</li>
            <li> oh well, at least she can&#x27;t get me again till this wears off</li>
            <li> Case is very small.</li>
            <li> Very small case.  </li>
            <li> It has hardly any color and is very hard.</li>
            <li> but my main concern is that  the face powder and i base and one i shadow was broken.</li>
            <li> Not good quality at all.</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD gift as it looks when you see the picture.</li>
            <li> The colors are not bright which I prefer.</li>
            <li> The make-up inside was mostly broken up or crumbled (the shadows for example).  </li>
            <li> The case was broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> It is poor cuality.</li>
            <li> Also some items were broken and the case was damaged.</li>
            <li> Was not happy at all the makeup</li>
            <li> The eye shadow was all broken up when I got it.</li>
            <li> The mirrored makeup case inside the aluminum case had one hinge already broken when I received the package.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Poor cond upon delivery.  </li>
            <li> Eye shadows were broken in the box when opened.  </li>
            <li> Nothing in our kit was broken or out of place.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I haven&#x27;t tried everything in the case, but</li>
            <li> Since we go through phases I didn&#x27;t want to purchase something extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s what wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush is useless.  </li>
            <li> Ive never put any makeup that was this terrible in my entire life.</li>
            <li> was received in very poor condition.it was to be a giftand I could not give it</li>
            <li> My daughter was very disappointed that half the eye shadows were useless.</li>
            <li> I got this in today, I was afraid It would come In broken because all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> It was a disappointment...</li>
            <li> , lipstick fall when it&#x27;s bad, do not shine, not creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Español:</li>
            <li> I felt bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and was disappointed in the quality.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed the case did not have any compartments inside.  </li>
            <li> i was very disappointing please don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on at all unless you have some sort of base on the lid, and even that doesn&#x27;t help the color.</li>
            <li> The lipstick wasn&#x27;t attached at the base, so it falls out.  </li>
            <li> She hated it.  </li>
            <li> so i was very disappointed</li>

            <li> The case is MICRO!  Way smaller than I thought it would be.  I wanted something kind of medium sized to travel with and this is just too small!  The make-up inside was mostly broken up or crumbled (the shadows for example).  Not good quality at all.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a bday gift for my 12 year old daughter and it shipped very fast condition of the product was great and she loves it thanks again</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Every where we go she takes it. The casing is hard and works well. recommend highly</li>
            <li> good morning, is to wait too long to receive the goods but this came with shadows games, other as if they were used. The labial parties, the 2 compartos not work, the boat. The only thing that came in good condition was the case. Inside there was nothing to keep the contents were destroyed. Made a mistake in not taking picture, but I&#x27;m an honest person. I do not recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> This case is nice but a bit flimsy. The makeup inside is NOT Shany its Cameo. I bought this expecting Shany quality and its not. Its nice and holds most of my stuff. I bought it to hold my Shany makeup pallets but it does not. It&#x27;s to small. This case is nice for younger girls just starting out but for older women, you may want something more sturdy and bigger to carry all the necessities.</li>
            <li> I bought this just for the make up case because I needed one. I did not like the eye shadows because they are not as good and they are dry. I threw away the eye liner because it did not work on my eyes. the case is nice and you can use it for your make up, but the make up that comes with the case is NOT good. I think the price was reasonable since I was looking for a case in other stores and online.</li>
            <li> My wife will love this. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very good high quality</li>
            <li> very good product , it was what I expected , I recommend hundred percent, I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with my purchase, It looked alot larger than I thought...makeup that came with it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as nice as pictured and items seem trial sized. Case is very small. Overpriced for what it turns out to be IMO!</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift. She absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and was disappointed in the quality.  One of the eye shadows was shattered and crumbling all over the others.  What happened to paying a fair price for good quality merchandise?  I won&#x27;t order from this brand again.</li>
            <li> This makes a good starter kit.</li>
            <li> Shany Cosmetics Carry All Train Case with Makeup and Reusable Aluminium Case the items were not shany cosmetics but cameo brand , my purchase was receive it a very quick time after purchasing it,the item is of a very poor quality . when i open the case there i found a broken nail polish which soiled up the other items in the case i was very disappointing please don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I comend the makers! The case is beautiful! I bought this for \\&quot;stage MAke-up\\&quot; because i am invloved in theatre, but i might use it for every day also. it is perfect!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it, you need to keep the internal plastic because the items will scramble if not when moving</li>
            <li> I really like this and came as described. The make up case has enough room for all my other additions such as foundation, concealer, tweezers, eye brow stencils, mascara, toe &amp; finger nails, and a lot more. About the only thing was it could have included one or two larger application brushes. And the manufacturer really should have included a reorder form for when something runs out or additional items. They would get more returning customers. More colors of eye shadow than I&#x27;m likely to use. But then again, I like to experiment. I&#x27;m keeping everything in the plastic holders as it makes everything very easy to find.</li>
            <li> Good for the price I got at!</li>
            <li> Bought this a as a birthday gift for a seven-year-old. She loved it. The case is nice and make-up is satisfactory to her. The price was great as well.</li>
            <li> The travel case is very cute. It is spacious enough inside to hold a lot of cosmetics. As it was a gift for someone else, I couldnt check the quality of the make up products. But they seem to be good enough.  All in all, a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the case. But the makeup inside is just not very good at all. They don&#x27;t go on very dark. They don&#x27;t stay on at all unless you have some sort of base on the lid, and even that doesn&#x27;t help the color. I ended up giving them to my brother&#x27;s girlfriend just to get rid of them. I was not impressed. But I would buy it again just for the case! So if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking at it is definitely a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this make up set as a gift for my daughter.  She is learning how to apply make up and I didn&#x27;t want her to use all of my more expensive make up.  She was thrilled with this kit! It has a little of everything. We had no problems from shipping.  The make up was complete and in tact. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My sister in law loves it</li>
            <li> My Daughter has more make-up than anyone I know. She rated this 5 Stars! Now if only I could do something about her Attitude!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product. when it  arrived it was not Shany cosmetic. its Cameo product.  so i was very disappointed</li>
            <li> It is a nice box with a complete set of make up and tools. Many colours and many lipsticks, many applicators</li>
            <li> I really like this little case of cosmetics.  I like the small case, it is light and solid.  I like the smallish size of the cosmetics.  I love sets like this because I can try various colors and when I find which ones I prefer I can order the full size when necessary.  Needless to say I haven&#x27;t tried everything in the case, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I always express how happy I am with Shany, and this is yet another instance.  I will most definately order Shany products again.  In fact, I just ordered another set of magnetic nail polish today.  Thank you to Shany.  I am always very pleased!</li>
            <li> The quality was not what I expected for the price.  The case was broken upon arrival. For the cost I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought several items but this is the one I am dissapointed with.  I wanted to return but I thought I would pay more to return then what it&#x27;s worth. The make-up is low quality and the case is so small I would not know how to re-use for anything.  The picture is decieving.  Do not buy unless you are going to give to a small child for play make-up. Please note:  The 1 star is for fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My teenager loves it and found it very useful.  She aspires to be a make artist one day.  Loves it!</li>
            <li> The case is much smaller than I had pictured.  Much.  It doesn&#x27;t fit what I need to fit in there.  The makeup is ok.  It does come with a lot of colors and average quality makeup.</li>
            <li> Mother loved this ..got it for h4er 86th birthday.  A lot in it and she loved it all</li>
            <li> i gave this one star because for one it wasn&#x27;t as big as i thought it was. Two the brand that is advertised on the display picture and also on The box it came isn&#x27;t the brand that is inside the case. The brand on the box is &amp;#34;cameo&amp;#34; the brand inside the kit is &amp;#34;magic color.&amp;#34; The nail polishes are completely different. The label that is attached to the case says that the nail polish is suppose to be brand named &amp;#34;ML&amp;#34; the brand on the box says &amp;#34;cameo&amp;#34; the inside the kit its &amp;#34;magic color&amp;#34;. What brand i&#x27;m i suppose to have?  i wish i could upload a picture of what received. This was not $42 dollar worth of make up</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful train case filled with lots of make-up. There was only one eye shadow that had shifted out of the case, but it was not bad. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Talk about a bargain! This case literally has everything you will ever need to do your makeup. The quality of the items is amazing, and you get so much for such a good price. The case is easily my favorite part - so professional looking, yet durable. Win/win!</li>
            <li> All your cosmetic/beauty needs in one beautiful and reusable case!! Perfect for traveling. Would be the perfect gift for any female in the world. Colors are beautiful and very high quality!!! Def recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> these products are made in chiness, are bad, do not paint anything, do not recommend them, how beautiful is the case, are additional products you can get on the street vendors, the pencils are broken when you take out point, lipstick fall when it&#x27;s bad, do not shine, not creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Español: Estos productos son hechos en china, son malos, no pintan nada , no los recomiendo, lo bonito es la caja, adicional son productos que puedes conseguir en la calle, a los vendedores ambulantes, los lapices se parten cuando se le sacan punta, los labiales se caen a la hora, es malo, no brilla, no son cremosos</li>
            <li> It looks much beter on the picture. It is poor cuality. I bot it for my wife and she did not like it. I felt bad.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old loved this product she took every thing of her Christmas list for it she thought it was the best thing in the whole world.</li>
            <li> The box is small when we received the item, the picture on the website makes it look a lot bigger.</li>
            <li> These were gifts for my grandchildren which they we thrilled. The charges were for myself and husband which works great. Thank you</li>
            <li> Cheap make up, cheap containers. The carry case was the highest quality item and the locks broke off quickly. Great for beginners or halloween I suppose.</li>
            <li> The makeup was damage. Also some items were broken and the case was damaged. It seems like it was used .</li>
            <li> I have no hesitation recommending this to anyone who has a busy morning schedule. It&#x27;s lightweight, durable and the look of the case is amazing.</li>
            <li> is a good product, it recoemindo, just have to be sure of the size or appropriate measures according to what you want. cheer up and buy whatever you want.</li>
            <li> Great product and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Offer a little misleading in relation to the publication of photos, but if it is acceptable, but does not meet my expectations. recommended as a gift for teenagers but not suitable for women as official makeup. the bag is very practical and good presentation. Thanks for the prompt delivery and excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter to play dress up with her sister around the house but it would be perfect for an adult as well</li>
            <li> met expectations, I recommend this seller</li>
            <li> I love the train case, but the cosmetics themselves aren&#x27;t very good quality. I was able to give most of them away, but I admit I love the eyeshadow colors, so as long as I use a primer they stay on ok.</li>
            <li> todo bien llego rapido cuando lo dijo sin problema volveria a comprar. saludos desde venezuela muy buena la compra .</li>
            <li> Good selection of things.  Decent case.  Overall not as big as I expected but that was a misjudgment on my part</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from a good friend, she thought it was going to be a legit Shany make-up collection like it says on this website and on the box. BUT when I take out the kit and open it everything inside is COMPLETELY different from what is pictured. All of the make up colors look about right, only the packaging is wrong and there is writing on it that says Magic Color. That is not a Shany make-up. So all I can think of is that this is either a knock off shoved into a Shany box and sold as a Shany or the whole kit is wrong. I don&#x27;t know what to think at this point.</li>
            <li> makeup is OK,  brushes are CHEAP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  really got it for the  case because of all the reviews that were so good  HOWEVER  it&#x27;s either changed or no one else has ever had a  real make-up case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; the box is CHEAP  and thin made out of plastic  not metal  horrible</li>
            <li> It is her favorite Holiday gift.  She loves it, she now travels with the very nice, silver box and ready to make up anyone...Could have done with out the nail polish and had more eye shadow and lipstick</li>
            <li> My granddaughter asked for a makeup kit. She was so excited because it had everything. Lipstick, eye makeup, the whole works.</li>
            <li> It everything I wanted and some stuff I didn&#x27;t even know I need. Its a great kit for anyone who is new to makeup or. Pro who just wants to expand there collection.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used make up to attest to quality yet, but my daughter seems happy with it. The thing i don&#x27;t like is if you&#x27;re planning to carry it around without all the makeup spilling all over, you have to keep the plastic topper on top and it is annoying to take on and off.</li>
            <li> I think Thu is something that you should by for alittle girl who wants to start trying make up but ddoesn&#x27;t want to waste money on the expensive stuff. But the case afterwards is a must. The colors are dull and are boring.also all the brushes are low quality.</li>
            <li> This just arrived in my mail today.I thought that the box would be bigger,but I&#x27;m still happy with what I got. The make up is nice and fabulous. I love make up.And when I run out of it I&#x27;m planing on keeping the kit for something else.</li>
            <li> Overall good first kit for my 9 ear old. Let&#x27;s be honest here, you get the quality you pay for, but still my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Was not happy at all the makeup says cameo on it i was under the impression it was shany it looks like cheap crap you would purchase at dollar general!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. I Like the eyeshadows and blushers. The colors are not bright which I prefer. The rest are OK. The most wonderful thing in this product is the BOX. I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this in today, I was afraid It would come In broken because all the bad reviews. The make up is NOT SHANY it is CAMEO. I gave it a 3 because it did not come with everything, and really it cost way to much for something that looks like you could get for 10$ at a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she loved it.</li>
            <li> When the product was received, I opened it and the make-up pieces were found popped out of its plastic interior case display, but luckily nothing was broken. After I had opened the case up and tried to close it, I realize the lid would not close. Apparently, the aluminum case is \\&quot;aluminum\\&quot; so it&#x27;s bent out of shape. The two pieces of the case was not put together evenly, so I have to push it over just go get it to close correctly and clip the latches on before it pops open again.  The nail polishes are not the same ones in the very first picture (block shape) with the red, tan, light pink and metallic color. The lipsticks are different too. The other pictures are what&#x27;s actually in the makeup case.  I originally bought this with the intentions for the case.  I should have just paid a little more for a better quality makeup case.  Other than that, the makeup is fun to play with.</li>
            <li> This makeup broke up during the shipment. Also the nail polish smell was awful and soo strong. I would no recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife she loved it she not in to the high price makeup thank god. The first set did come with some of the makeup broken but they were very happy to replace it for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to practice makeup (me being the guinea pig).  Not the best makeup, but good enough with enough variety for practice.  No allergic reaction and the case is big enough where you can add to the collection.</li>
            <li> i love love love this set, just the box alone is worth the money. i love the eyeshadow&#x27;s in it the most. the coloros are so beautiful. if you want a set to carry around with you that is not too heavy, i would definitly recomend this set. its got everything you can possibly need to doll up in one great box</li>
            <li> a reasonable good price for a lot of make up.</li>
            <li> 8 year old Granddaughter loves this! Super good price with fast shipping. Made well and the make up is perfect for any little girls.</li>
            <li> They are pretty and the case is nice.  My daughter likes it and the make-up goes on well.</li>
            <li> Tiny, when I received it I didn&#x27;t even bother to open it. For $40, this is a joke.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my almost 13 year old niece, she lives in another state so I haven&#x27;t seen it but she said she loves it.</li>
            <li> This train case is stunning. I really wanted a case that wasn&#x27;t too big since I don&#x27;t have a ton of makeup. I love all the blushes and eyeshadows the most! The nail polish are a little sheer so I end up doing 3 coats to get the actual color. The lipstick it came in fit perfectly with my skin tone. Happy I got this for my collection.</li>
            <li> Update: 10/1/12  Totally came in handy last weekend when I had to rush out of town for a spontaneous road trip. I didn&#x27;t have to worry because I had everything right there in one spot :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are the shadows and everything else inside this case amazing but the travel case itself is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking at more expensive ones online and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get them this works great</li>
            <li> This case is very nice. It is the right size for holding a good amount of cosmetics but is not so big that you feel clunky carrying it. I just took it on a weekend trip and it was perfect. Also, it has a modern, quality feel. It is sturdy and opens and closes easily and feels secure. I think you&#x27;ll like it;)</li>
            <li> The make-up in this case has amazing quality.The colors are very pigmented.The color selection is really great.I love how everything fits nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is great for traveling. One of the best products I&#x27;ve bought because the Makeup inside comes in its own indvidiual casing so you can put the items you&#x27;ve used that day in your purse!!</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with this product. It is of the quality of my nieces make up she gets from the dollar store. Really upset about this product</li>
            <li> When I received it the eye shadow was all crushed up, don&#x27;t know if it was like that when it was shipped or while it was being shipped. Waiting for UPS to come and pick it up to send back,</li>
            <li> i love all the eyeshadows in this! i especially love the box. its my new train case! this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Lots in a small package. Made a great gift.</li>
            <li> Upon seeing the product online, I thought&lt;br /&gt;that this kit could be perfect especially&lt;br /&gt;for those who travel a lot and those who&lt;br /&gt;need to be made up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, it looked compact and complete&lt;br /&gt;with all sorts of makeup most ladies need.&lt;br /&gt;When I bought it, the case has truly&lt;br /&gt;exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clearly well made, plus, you could&lt;br /&gt;easily find the make up you need as they&lt;br /&gt;have been arranged and organized well&lt;br /&gt;enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they aren&#x27;t those which have&lt;br /&gt;been made under popular brands and they&lt;br /&gt;may easily fade or wear off, I found an&lt;br /&gt;excellent solution to the problem, and&lt;br /&gt;that is to apply good makeup base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think that the product is&lt;br /&gt;totally worth it. I recommend this to&lt;br /&gt;every girl who constantly need makeup&lt;br /&gt;and also travels a lot at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;The whole kit is actually very convenient&lt;br /&gt;to carry and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; make up set for Christmas for my 9 year old daughter.  It&#x27;s a very nice set with a variety of products in lots of colors.  The case is very sturdy and is fabulous for keeping everything organized.  As a young girl, she was thrilled to receive a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; make up set.  I would think any adult who likes to use a variety of colors and products would like this as well.</li>
            <li> The case is okay, if you are using it for only your personal makeup products. If you are a makeup artist and need a case to fit alot of your makeup in then you will not want it. It is not really that big at all. But it is nice for traveling and carrying your personal items. The makeup its self is horrible. The eye shadow was all broken up when I got it. The lip stick does not have a lot of pigment and it does not last long at all. The makeup is just not worth it. Overall the case was okay.</li>
            <li> Es producto versatil facil de trasladar tiene lo necesario para el maquillaje de las mujeres que quieran estar bellas hoy</li>
            <li> Wife loved it. Was a great gift to give to her, quality is good, and I would buy this for anyone again</li>
            <li> Kit is okay. I just received it so i cannot discuss yet about its longevity. I just need to be careful with it because it seems that its not that sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, has potential to be a great product. However, the one we received had several broken pieces, the compacts with mirror were each broken in half. The lipstick wasn&#x27;t attached at the base, so it falls out.  I think it&#x27;s an ok starter set for a little girl, but my daughter was pretty disappointed Christmas morning when she opened it up and half the things inside were broken.  The case is nice and can be used for several different things though.  I&#x27;d say the case is all that&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> i like this makeup box and the makeup inside is good,and got the right stuff what i was  looking for</li>
            <li> i bought this thinkin it would be great but it anit the lip liner broke when i first took off the lid and the mirror is flimsy it broke after two days didnt like any of the color the case was ok</li>
            <li> The delivery of this product was very timely.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the products I received from SHANY; however, a few notes of change that I wish to share are:&lt;br /&gt;1. The mirrored makeup case inside the aluminum case had one hinge already broken when I received the package.&lt;br /&gt;2. The plastic display case for the makeup inside the aluminum case was already warped when the package was received, making me think the package went through extreme heat before being sent out.&lt;br /&gt;3. I love the makeup, it works very well with a makeup brush and the array of color was great, but I do wish the case came with a larger mirror than what was provided with the little plastic case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order again from SHANY.</li>
            <li> Wow this is so awesome, what a great idea to put makeup a little suit case! Plus all of Shanys make up is great!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the case! It is so cute, yet so simple and definitely works well to hold your makeup. I also love the makeup in the case! I received some colors that I normally wouldn&#x27;t purchase for myself, only to find out that I really liked them! I also love to do others&#x27; makeup, so having a wide variety of makeup comes in handy!!!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors iside this train case that will last for years to come. You could customize the case to your personality. There are so many make up colors to choose from and combintaions it is endless on what you could create. Great for a teen or make up lover.</li>
            <li> the best I could find on this page to give a person who is starting in the fashion world really liked the gift</li>
            <li> item a got probably good.cause i haven&#x27;t use it yet. but my main concern is that  the face powder and i base and one i shadow was broken.</li>
            <li> Cheap, tiny products, came in package with some pots crushed. It is a tiny box-- read the product description carefully.  I could smell the chemicals of the products as well.  Returned this with no hassle.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas, as she&#x27;s heading into that age where she&#x27;s enjoying experimenting with makeup at home. For an 11 year old, this is great, and it holds her make-up collection. She was also able to decorate the box somewhat with markers. As an adult, would I use this? No, probably not. It&#x27;s a bit like little girl quality to me. I&#x27;d sooner buy e.l.f. products for $1-3 a piece, and I&#x27;ll bet I&#x27;d still come out ahead.</li>
            <li> but is not to big I dont like the lipstick colors and some are shadows are broken&lt;br /&gt;come on time</li>
            <li> This is a  fantastic make up kit i am just learning to wear make up and this is a big help i do recommend this and the case very nicely made</li>
            <li> this set is good for travelling for anyone that is always on the move. Especially for the all female who is going to vacation or you are going to do some photo shoot!</li>
            <li> I will start with the bad first. The lipstick seems horrible to me. It has hardly any color and is very hard. Every thing else is great! I love the silver case it is cute. The nail polish is nice just hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality of makeup at all...gave it to the teens. The box was a little big but works well in putting my GOOD makeup in for travel.</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift for my daughter and she loves it, she keeps all of her makeup in it and the colors in the case were really nice and has used a little of everything which is unusual.</li>
            <li> I bought this two of these makeup cases, one for each of my daughters.  Both of them love the variety of colors and the quality of the case is excellent for the cost.  I was however surprised by the size, I was expecting the case to be a bit bigger but I am not disappointed at all.  The case was packed full with products!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the case, not the makeup.  I thought it would be a little bigger, but despite the size, it works for me.  I&#x27;m a professional entertainer and need a trunk case to keep the makeup contained safely during travels without spilling in my bag, but don&#x27;t need the huge sized wheeled cases with a billion compartments.  The only thing that would make this better is if it had cover sized mirror attached to the inner cover.  The eyeshadow and blusher pallots are cute and I&#x27;ve been using them as well.</li>
            <li> I have always loved make up ,I put on a lot even when I&#x27;m at home. I looked at it on amazon ,I&#x27;d like to get it on Christmas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this make up set as a gift for my niece, but I am very disappointed with what I bought. The mirror is broken, and in the picture the trunk train case looks so nice, with no many make up pieces, but actually, it didn&#x27;t come with all the make up pieces I saw at the picture. NOT A GOOD gift as it looks when you see the picture.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with the makeup in this case. It&#x27;s very good quality and lasts all day without running or smudging. I would definately recommend this product to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change would be the case. It&#x27;s not very sturdy and it&#x27;s alot smaller than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all though, i would buy again. :)</li>
            <li> I got this for my niece and she was thrilled to get it.  It came in good shape and with Prime shipping and she loves the nail polish so far.</li>
            <li> Cheap makeup and case. Makeup was disgusting and horrible quality. The case was ok</li>
            <li> Just looking at the picture I thought that it would only hold a few things but its like there is master bedroom hidden. I does hold alot but it is not the most stylist.</li>
            <li> All your cosmetic/beauty needs in one beautiful and reusable case!! Perfect for traveling. Would be the perfect gift for any female in the world. Colors are beautiful and very high quality!!! Def recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> i love the case. It can be used for many different things even after the makeup is all used up. I like the makeup, it looks a bit small, but at least you can try the item before committing to buying the full size version.</li>
            <li> Nice little case, lots of colors.  Would easily say I got what I paid for, though it is not quite what you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations&lt;br /&gt;Displays nice in the photo, but once you unpack the colors from it, I don&#x27;t see how you would keep them seperated in the box, which is not only 1/4 full.  If you filled it up you would be lost....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me to be a glorified lunch box. Aside from the lid that holds the brushes (so hard in fact, once removed you may not want to put them back), the bottom is just empty space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price, the makeup is good so says my daughter.  I can attest to the nail polish being durable and has not seemed to chip from my tonails in over 2 weeks....strange how they got painted though, it would appear I am a heavy sleeper and I thought they would have worn off by now...oh well, at least she can&#x27;t get me again till this wears off lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a male single parent so all &#x27;girly&#x27; stuff reviews I get from them and what I observe myself to physical characteristics...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, for a little lady (7 and 9 year old) it rocks, for everyone else, ask in 10 years :)  and no they don&#x27;t wear it in public, but a gilrs gotta play right ?</li>
            <li> excellent! I am very pleased with this product! I will be looking forward to other products in the future! Thank you</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I just put them in. Dollar for dollar I think they will do the job and they look good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter as a starting off kit. She wants to start wearing make-up and dressing a bit nicer for school. Since we go through phases I didn&#x27;t want to purchase something extremely expensive. This kit was exactly what she was looking for and she likes to take it with her and it fits nicely in her locker.&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived in perfect condition and nothing was broken. It is slightly smaller than what I had envisioned but as previously stated it fits nicely in her school locker and she is able to carry it around to friends houses or with her to Grandma&#x27;s house and it holds everything nicely.</li>
            <li> Poor cond upon delivery.  Eye shadows were broken in the box when opened.  Lipstick colors are too bright.  Thought it was bigger than it was.</li>
            <li> I got this for someone who wanted new eye shadows and a makeup carrying case. The colors were great and it came with complimentary, blush, nail and liner colors. The case itself is really a nice size. The eye shadows appear to be a little slightly smaller than the regular sized Palled eye shadows but that&#x27;s really not a problem for an individual to use versus if you were using it to do makeup you may run out quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a young girl. The variety of colors and the enormous assortment was a giant hit. I bought this item to complement her mother&#x27;s gift to her, a bedroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Bought this a gift for my daughter.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> The case was nice and the makeup okay....But several of the eyeshadows came broken.  When I contacted Amazon, I received a refund and was able to keep the makeup....But it&#x27;s not usable.  My daughter does like the case.</li>
            <li> if i wanted this for anything really more then the case then this would have got less stars. the make up is decent at VERY best and i have used it once and was dissatisfied. i could see it being a good starter kit for someone learning but not for a serious person. unless of course you just want a nice portable case.</li>
            <li> To start off, I originally bought this for the case and the makeup was just going to be an \\&quot;added bonus\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup inside, most of it is garbage unless you plan on giving it to a child to play with. Most of the eyeshadow would need a black base underneath (to bring out the color) and then layers of powder on top, the lipstick is all clear no matter what shades you get, and the brush is soft but falls apart as you start to use it. Also, the mirror broke as soon as I took it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing inside the case that&#x27;s useable are the liners and nail polish. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised with the nail polish. One coat, for the ones I received, were the actual colors and so far has lasted on my toes for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case itself is fine for me. The closing pieces have always worked, none of the box is breaking, and it fits almost all of what I own if I stack it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had the chance to take it back and not buy it I&#x27;d probably spend $10 extra dollars on a nicer case with no added bonuses.</li>
            <li> im not really sure what i expected and i agree with most reviews on here. the make up isnt as bright as it looks but i do really like the nail polish, though its not the colors pictured in the shot. i got two browns a pink and tan but they still look nice.</li>
            <li> Everything was included and would have been a great purchase if all the powders weren&#x27;t broken and everywhere. Needs better shipping protection.</li>
            <li> the product was for a birthday gift and the person who was present was very happy because I wanted for a few days</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a makeup enthusiast and don&#x27;t want anything extravagant this is the kit for you. If you ARE a makeup enthusiast and need a basics travel case this is for you as well. The case isn&#x27;t bulky and everything is easily kept together. This kit has a little bit of everything and a decent variety of colors.</li>
            <li> The case looks great. The products seems to be also of a high quality but they were quite damaged when i opened the box. It was a disappointment... About the package delivery, i was really impressed. He arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Our two Grandaughters lov these. I bought two. At the ages of 8 and 9 they are becoming divas. I loved to se them apply the makeup</li>
            <li> The product was for a special gift.  The colors in the case were very nice, but was disappointed how small the kit was overall.  Good value for what you got.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know the colors in  make up kit do matter. She wasn&#x27;t overly excited about it but she did appreciate my effort</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a MUA, and I take this with me on a job. Super easy and great to use! The variety of stuff you get is just a big plus!</li>
            <li> The aluminum case is very nice.  I was disappointed the case did not have any compartments inside.  My husband fixed that for me.  He went to a hobby shop and bought materials to make compartments in the case,  He would have to explain that process. I was pleased with the cosmetics assortment that came with the set.  This set is one that would be good to have in an office drawer.  A college or High School Student could also find this set very useful.The case is big enough to add shampoo, hairspray, brush, comb, other items.  It would be a great item for the extra makeup case or the portable make case, Linda W.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I like it a lot. Only gave it 4stars because it would be better if it were a tad bit bigger with maybe pullout compartment. Other than that, if you have lots of makeup or bigger things liked powdered makeup then you might not have enough room to put in the case with all your other stuff. But for a nice beginner case it&#x27;s perfect or if you don&#x27;t have lots of makeup. If you do, most things would have to be in compact sizes. But this case STILL rocks!!! Great look and space for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my niece and returned it.  Very small case.  Does not look like the picture. She hated it.  I would give it 0 stars if possible.</li>
            <li> Colors are suitble for my fair skin.  I love the eyeshadows that provide lots of color with subtlety.  I purchased it for the case - I had one and it was really old and wanted a replace, the makeup was just a bonus.  Love the nail polish. This product is a bargain for the quality. The only thing is I found it hard to take the covers off. Have to use a tweezer to pull them out.</li>
            <li> I use the case for my cosmetics but gave the makeup it came with to my granddaughter.  I like the fabric loops on the lid for my pencils and brushes.  Just the right size to fit in my suitcase and holds everything I need.</li>
            <li> good but it is having less items as appear on the image&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the box in which all the items came looks good</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  The case is well made and keeps the makeup neat and organized.  There are a lot of colors for all skin tones and makes &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; around with different colors easy.  My daughter loves it and has been practicing new techniques since she has received.  It is a good starter kit.</li>
            <li> Charity gift for a St. Vincent DePaul Society.  Everyone who saw it loved it.  The pacage arrived on time.  Good.</li>
            <li> It is very  nice product to buy..&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend others to buy it.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for sending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again thanks</li>
            <li> My niece loved this case, I gave it to her for Christmas, she is studying to be a cosmetologist and she wanted to practice, well now she has the tools to do so.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT GIFT FOR A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER WHO&#x27;S A STARTER IN THE MAKEUP WORLD...THAN IT HAS THE REUSABLE CASE WHICH IS ANOTHER PLUS...DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS ONE...</li>
            <li> This is very good case for makeup! I love everything that comes included! All My things fit in it which is a plus. High recommend. Great alternative if you don&#x27;t want to have those stack-able train cases but still want the makeup case look.</li>
            <li> i love this case, not only is small and compact it store a decent amount of makeup when im traveling, its very light weight and i would definitely recommend to everyone, its also a great gift idea.</li>
            <li> Case is 10\\&quot; long x 6.5\\&quot; wide x 3.5\\&quot; deep.  Product comes with 1 case, 32 eyeshadows, 4 lipsticks, 4 nail vanishes, 2 blushers, 1 big blush brush, 1 mini blush brush, 1 eyebrow brush, 1 mirror box, 3 applicators, 1 double-ended lip pencil, and 1 double-ended eye pencil.  (Colors may vary, e.g., we did not get the rose red nail vanish like in Amazon&#x27;s picture.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what wrong with it.  The eye and lip pencils do not go on very dark, and so do the lipsticks.  The blush brushes aren&#x27;t soft and thick and therefore do not pick up and apply blush well.  Eyeshadows also go on light and do not blend well.  The eyebrow brush is useless.  Mirror box and pencil tips were broken when being removed from elastic bands because elastic bands tightly hold both ends of the double-ended eye and lip pencils, etc., and case is small with little room to wiggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought for niece, and the feedback from her was not a positive one.  What can I say?!  I never knew \\&quot;real\\&quot; makeup cost up to hundreds of dollars.  According to my dear niece, the only things that were \\&quot;useable\\&quot; were the applicators.  She gave everything else to her little sis to play makeup with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the lesson learned is this is good value if you plan to buy it for young or preteen girls to play with.  Buy the real deal for teenage or girls who use serious makeup, which makes sense because how can you look like a million bucks with a 19-dollar makeup set?!!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my niece - she really like it especially since she is in Cosmology School.</li>
            <li> the product was a lot smaller than i expected , some of the eyeshadows were broken and the case was full of the eyeshadows not happy at all</li>
            <li> I think  you can get a better kit on your retailer, the colors and quality are nice but not awesome, I think you receive a little bit less than you pay for....some shadows were broke by the way</li>
            <li> This is really great. It comes with an complete eyeshadow makeup beauty case. It is small so its convenient to carry around. It also includes applicator and mirror which is an plus.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed was the box. I liked it a lot! The colors inside are pretty decent! It would be perfect for a girls night out to get all dolled up! Also, I really liked the nail polish colors! Very beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love every single thing about this kit! the polishes, the makeup, the everything! they are pretty good quality for the price, and they come with sizable amounts of each product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 21 year old daughter for Christmas.  She loved it and uses it everyday.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> El estuche de maquillaje  llego a Venezuela en perfectas condiciones, la entrega fue oportuna y segura..lo recomiendo para que las personas puedan comprarlo es bien bello y practico</li>
            <li> Daughter loved it.  Very cool case, ample selection of eye shades.  Great for just starting out makeup wearers.</li>
            <li> This item was horrible. Ive never put any makeup that was this terrible in my entire life. The creator of this piggy item should be ashamed of themself. How dare they think of the idea. It stinks as much as the odor on my face from this makeup item. The eyeshadow was broken and smelled like dead cat, the blush spreaded all over my entire face when I was out at my very important work meeting, the lip blams (such as: lipgloss, lipstick) was very gooey and smelled like my mother and she is not pretty. And the color pencils that go on your lips and eyes kept sticking to my pillow when I was going to sleep because the makeup wasnt coming off before bed time so I had to sleep with it on all night. (I woke up, and looked like a dead fish) My sister got this item and when she was kissing her boyfriend, it got stuck on his face too and they had to go to the hospital. (Never going threw that again NEVER BUY THIS ITEM ONLY IF YOU WANT TO SMELL LIKE DEAD CAT AND GET STICKED TO EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH WITH YOUR FACE! Happy holidays, but I feel like killing the owner who made this item!</li>
            <li> Nice box, but its smaller than it appears and the eyeshadows came busted....so well, i guess the box is the only thing in this product worth the 20 bucks...rest is all cheap makeup worth a dollar.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend as a present. I dont know alot about makeup and she does; the makeup kit is a go. Any guys out there trying to find your girl a gift And she likes makeup? This right here will do the trick</li>
            <li> I received the item quickly and all appears to be in good shape. The case is solid and the make-up looks to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> The makeup is good but not top quality. But then again it was pretty cheap so I&#x27;m not complaining.. Overall recommended to people who don&#x27;t use top brands</li>
            <li> Half the eye shadows came cracked and unusable. The box is very small and with much less in it when you see it in person versus in the picture advertised. I DO NOT recommend buying this product for this price when there are so many other places you can buy a make-up kit. My daughter was very disappointed that half the eye shadows were useless.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She liked the makeup but she loved the case it came in.</li>
            <li> it was old and dryed out. was received in very poor condition.it was to be a giftand I could not give it</li>
            <li> This product came with the shadow all broken up - making everything blue inside.  Also, the brushes that were supposed to be on the inside top of the product were completely missing.  It looked like someone sent an old used one.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The picture looks like there was more included, not much there for the 30.00 I spent on it.  Also case is flimsy.</li>
            <li> buenas noches la compra todo fue muy rapido y sin ningun problama y en excelentes condiciones y llego a tiempo gracias</li>
            <li> Good product, very good condition and presentation. It works in perfect condition. Good choice. Great for personal use or for gifts.</li>
            <li> The contents of this shipment, being the multiple products contained within caused this item to be ruined upon arrival. Multiple of the makeup/beautification products which were shipped within exploded during the shipping process. This caused them to cover all of the other items(in nail polish among other things). I would suggest utilizing better packaging for this product for shipment as the person who it was intended for would not enjoy it in its current state. Unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar product without makeup contents: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058PCTH4/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s02_i01&lt;br /&gt;was shipped extremely well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for an 8 year old for Christmas. Came in a great metal box, very durable. All makeup was in great shape and the colors are fun too.</li>
            <li> This is for my 14 year old granddaughter, who is just starting to experiment with make-up. The colors are super hot, and perfect, light colors for a beginner. I&#x27;m very pleased with all the items, and the train case was much higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> I sent this as a gift so I never really got to see what it all looked like or contained but my cousin who received it said it came on time and she loves it so I rated it five stars.</li>
            <li> Bought this on line and was happy to see it exactly as they described in the website. Very handy, beautiful and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I loved all the make up . But the shipping could of been alots better When I opened the train case 2 of my eye shadows were broke not usable I only give this makeup kit 1 star</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a teenage girl. She loved it and the case is very handy. Better quality make up than the cheaper sets at the drug stores.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage daughter. She loved the eye shadow colors and nail polish. The box keeps everything well organized</li>
            <li> THIS MAKE UP CASE WAS SO COOL I REALLY LOVE IT, JUST WISH MY SISTER WANTED THIS FOR HER BIRTHDAY I BROUGHT THIS FOR HER BIRTHDAY SHE TOLD ME SHE DIDN&#x27;T WANT MAKE UP, I REALLY BROUGHT IT. BUT STILL COOL</li>
            <li> good one.... box really looks good. this is a good item for gifts... i would recommend buying this item.... thanks.</li>
            <li> Was a gift. Hope the person loved it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in time. However as other reviews it was not what the picture implies.  Much smaller,items where damaged, overall would not recommend.  Go to walgeens and buytheir similar product.</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift, they just loved it</li>
            <li> Love the box...love the blush, they are just right, and eyeshadow&#x27;s are nice....everything is great...a good deal...worth it! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the make up but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the case. It has compartments for everything. I really like the fact there is stuff to store my smaller items that usually get lost in my makeup case. Why aren&#x27;t all cases built like this?</li>
            <li> This is the cutest little case. Very convenient size with the hottest items you&#x27;ll need! Small but spacey. The nail polishes are great also. Nice to have so you don&#x27;t have to pack all your makeup when traveling!</li>
            <li> I love these cases for travel because my soft makeup bags get smashed along with everything in it.  This has a collection of neutral shadows which are perfect for every day.</li>
            <li> This is so cool to have! I feel like a professional! The case makes it look like your official and the fact that there is makeup it comes with makes it fun to try out!</li>
            <li> i thought this was going to be bigger but i got this as a gift to for someone and they loved it, great for little girls ages 8-13</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, Price was right, Was as expected! Has everything and more! Would do business again! Great bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> i purchased this for a make up class, wanted something in bulk for a reasonable price. its nothing over the top but it&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece that loves makeup and I also got her a set of professional brushes. She loves that everything is neat and organized. And when she travels, she can just pick up one box and go!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and niece.  They both loved it.  Great cosmetics and the case is extremely well made and durable.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic makeup kits,it is worth to own it, it is actually smaller than what i thought before</li>
            <li> My 13 year old niece squealed over this.  Perfect kit for a teenager or someone who wants to experiment with color.  Nothing in our kit was broken or out of place.  All the girls drooled over this at Christmas.  Great find!</li>
            <li> I order this items to replace one that never got shipped. It was enjoy to the fulliest. She takes the case with her everywhere.</li>
            <li> The make-up is good with a nice case but it is much smaller than the picture makes it look.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She started using it right away and loves the colors.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the quality and variety of colors. Product with modern design and options for all occasions. Especially the nail polish.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Good design, color, quality and style. He covered my expectations resulting a good investment. I recommend this product. -</li>
