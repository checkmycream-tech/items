    <ol>
            <li>I have to say I am impressed by the product.</li>
            <li>Great Price.</li>
            <li>Great product, great Gel.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>No build up  Great hold without the greasy look</li>
            <li>So when I got this on Christmas morning, i showered, and tried it out, and must say I love it!!  </li>
            <li>Very nice hair gel.</li>
            <li>He loved it, and it doesn&#x27;t stink, or no sticky residue or stiffness with all of the great hold.</li>
            <li>I want this to be good</li>
            <li>This gel is good, just not as good as the Suave for Men gel that this replaced.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they would change a good thing.</li>
            <li>The hold is good though and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see this available at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Sure a time saver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years, like the consistency and hold.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask??</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and found this product to be ideal for me as a replacement for Gillette hair gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many others.</li>
            <li>It is a light gel that holds well through out the day without being sticky and washes out very easily.  </li>
            <li>This gel does a pretty good job filling the void.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold and would be a lot better for someone with longer hair.</li>
            <li>The only styling gel that doesn&#x27;t make my hair sweat, Very good product .</li>
            <li>I tried other brands and formulas and Suave Gel works the best without being sticky or that glue feeling.</li>
            <li>I stocked up on the now discontinued Gilette men&#x27;s hair gel as soon as I heard it was no longer going to be available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and does what it says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the available men&#x27;s hair gel products</li>
            <li>However, it is the best that I have currently found on the market for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a good shine on without having porcupine hair and leaves no mess.</li>
            <li>Does the best job and cost the least.  </li>
            <li>not a bad gel for the money</li>
            <li>This gel works just as well and is much cheaper than many high end brands I have used.  </li>
            <li>On a very positive note it doesn&#x27;t make your hair tacky or sticky in high humidity or a light rain.</li>
            <li>I was glad I could buy all these at the same time too.</li>
            <li>There are definitely higher quality hair products out there.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the purchase and will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>It holds well and doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
            <li>It is a wet look, but not over the top.</li>
            <li>It dries fast.</li>
            <li>Everytime I used gel my head would be itching like crazy, but not with this gel, plus you get 4 tubes for a great price!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether it works if you are being charged 4x</li>
            <li>Too much of an aroma and tendency to glop in your hair.  </li>
            <li>If you move around a lot or fuss over your hair much, you may have to apply twice</li>
            <li>and then did not dry quickly or well.  </li>
            <li>This gel is high quality and doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky.</li>
            <li>Will order again in future but with higher hold and shine!</li>
            <li>I am surprised at the level of hold and that it does not leave much residue.</li>
            <li>but it is more of a medium hold (not \\&quot;firm as it is labeled\\&quot;) gel and not something that you would use to say spike your hair.  </li>
            <li>Since running out, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a suitable and affordable replacement.  </li>
            <li>The name says it all it holds firmly and is easy to put your hair up and it stays.</li>
            <li>, it is not sticky, nor does it weigh down your hair, and it has a nice firm hold.</li>
            <li>My hubby insist on using gel in his hair everyday, but it was always the cheap stuff that made his hair sticky and super stiff that I never wanted to touch it.</li>
            <li>I bought this on chance since I usually use the cheap gel in the supermarket.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy as I think it is water-based, but there in lies the problem because it dissolves quicker with heat, normal wear and tear, and constant readjusting.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and after having read other&#x27;s peoples reviews before purchasing the hair gel, they were correct.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy, but does harden a little more than I personally care for.  </li>
            <li>All the other more expensive ones stink so much he&#x27;d never touch them</li>

            <li> I have thick hair with reserved haircut and this keeps it in place very well with a natural look</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price but its not really a professional product.</li>
            <li> it also had a tendency to dry and then look like dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair and just wanted a gel to spike my hair up a little bit.</li>

            <li> With a lot of effort I could get roughly what I was looking for, but it seemed excessive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product I use everyday, thankful I found it!</li>
            <li> This is been the main gel I use, and it doesnt flake or get bad.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something less expensive than the gel I was using, and figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.</li>
            <li> and then one day I found this gel and thought why not, good price can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Not a good solution for styling your hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly, Gillette is no longer selling hair gel and Walmart no longer sells this Suave.  </li>
            <li> I was not terribly impressed by this product.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I want this to be good but it just might have a side effect. I think this stuff has eye erratating components at the end of the day. It may be just me? But my eyes feel like they have fibers from my hair falling in them. Just since I have tried this item.  B.T.</li>
            <li> This gel works just as well and is much cheaper than many high end brands I have used.  It is a light gel that holds well through out the day without being sticky and washes out very easily.  I would have given it five stars but it is more of a medium hold (not \\&quot;firm as it is labeled\\&quot;) gel and not something that you would use to say spike your hair.  I have thick hair with reserved haircut and this keeps it in place very well with a natural look and that is not rigid or plastered down  It does not have that wet look except for an hour or two after applied.  On a very positive note it doesn&#x27;t make your hair tacky or sticky in high humidity or a light rain.</li>
            <li> My hubby insist on using gel in his hair everyday, but it was always the cheap stuff that made his hair sticky and super stiff that I never wanted to touch it. All the other more expensive ones stink so much he&#x27;d never touch them and then one day I found this gel and thought why not, good price can&#x27;t hurt. And I know Suave doesn&#x27;t stink. He loved it, and it doesn&#x27;t stink, or no sticky residue or stiffness with all of the great hold. I was glad I could buy all these at the same time too. Sure a time saver.</li>
            <li> I stocked up on the now discontinued Gilette men&#x27;s hair gel as soon as I heard it was no longer going to be available.  Since running out, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a suitable and affordable replacement.  This gel does a pretty good job filling the void.  It isn&#x27;t too heavy, but does harden a little more than I personally care for.  However, it is the best that I have currently found on the market for a reasonable price.  Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the purchase and will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> The only styling gel that doesn&#x27;t make my hair sweat, Very good product .</li>
            <li> I was looking for something less expensive than the gel I was using, and figured I&#x27;d give this one a try. It holds well and doesn&#x27;t really have a smell. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years, like the consistency and hold.  Only issue, when you take the label off the tube,&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re left with a sticky glue substance that requires &amp;#34;nail polish or alcohol&amp;#34; to remove</li>
            <li> I bought this on chance since I usually use the cheap gel in the supermarket. I am surprised at the level of hold and that it does not leave much residue.</li>
            <li> This gel is high quality and doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky. It&#x27;s cheap and does what it says. What more can you ask??</li>
            <li> I have gone through a lot of diff gels for my hubby and sons.  This one is inexpensive and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of grimy flakys in their hair at the end of the day.  It is a wet look, but not over the top.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands and formulas and Suave Gel works the best without being sticky or that glue feeling.It dries fast.I love Axe products like shampoo and soaps but Axe FAILED at the styling gum.I didn&#x27;t like the feel of using the gum type styling.</li>
            <li> Helps hold what hair I have left in place.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and found this product to be ideal for me as a replacement for Gillette hair gel.  Sadly, Gillette is no longer selling hair gel and Walmart no longer sells this Suave.  I was happy to see this available at Amazon.  It arrived on time and was well-packed.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair gel. I like this gel, it is not sticky, nor does it weigh down your hair, and it has a nice firm hold. Everytime I used gel my head would be itching like crazy, but not with this gel, plus you get 4 tubes for a great price!</li>
            <li> not a bad gel for the money&lt;br /&gt;Charles&lt;br /&gt;Pennsville NJ.</li>
            <li> Great Price. Not the strongest hold. Works well.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas, and I&#x27;m used to using that greasy pomade that takes forever to wash out.  So when I got this on Christmas morning, i showered, and tried it out, and must say I love it!!  I would definitely buy again, Merry Christmas!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and just wanted a gel to spike my hair up a little bit. This gel is not for me though. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold and would be a lot better for someone with longer hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the available men&#x27;s hair gel products but I always come back to this one.  Does the best job and cost the least.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I was not terribly impressed by this product.  It just made my hair wet and then did not dry quickly or well.  it also had a tendency to dry and then look like dandruff.  With a lot of effort I could get roughly what I was looking for, but it seemed excessive.  There are definitely higher quality hair products out there.</li>
            <li> Great product, great Gel. This is been the main gel I use, and it doesnt flake or get bad. Lasts all day., Cant complain for the quality or the price.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether it works if you are being charged 4x its actual price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stay away from overstock deals!</li>
            <li> Too much of an aroma and tendency to glop in your hair.  Can&#x27;t beat the price but its not really a professional product.</li>
            <li> Great product. No build up  Great hold without the greasy look</li>
            <li> I used to use Crew Gel which was 12-14 bucks per tube. I thought I would give this product a try as it is only 3 bucks a tube. I have to say I am impressed by the product. The gel works as well as Crew Jel and 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> The name says it all it holds firmly and is easy to put your hair up and it stays. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It dries earlier than I&#x27;d like it to, it flakes very harshly after you rub your dried head. The hold is good though and the smell is nice. It&#x27;s not too greasy as I think it is water-based, but there in lies the problem because it dissolves quicker with heat, normal wear and tear, and constant readjusting. If you move around a lot or fuss over your hair much, you may have to apply twice</li>
            <li> Not a good solution for styling your hair. I&#x27;ve used many others. The hair gel leaves white in your hair even if you aren&#x27;t overdoing it. Not recommended</li>
            <li> This gel is good, just not as good as the Suave for Men gel that this replaced.  I don&#x27;t know why they would change a good thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product I use everyday, thankful I found it! Will order again in future but with higher hold and shine!</li>
            <li> Expensive but the web is the only place to get it now. Curse you Suave!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and after having read other&#x27;s peoples reviews before purchasing the hair gel, they were correct. It leaves a good shine on without having porcupine hair and leaves no mess.</li>
