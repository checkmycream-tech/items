            <li> I have been wearing this for a week trying to adjust to it but it feels like I have a clothespin on my nose when I wake up in the morning the tope of my nose has been rubbed raw.  This morning it was bleeding. Now I have a bruise on the tip of my nose.</li>

            <li> My puppy chewed the intermediary part...the part between the hose...and the ResMed Swift LT Nasal Pillows (which I bought separately on Amazon.com).

            <li> This is part of a device used for persons with sleep apnea.  It. Is less expensive then ordering from the hospital.

            <li> This is original equipment at a good price. Works great. I saved quite a bit of money and was reimbursed through my flex spending account so that made them tax deductible.</li>
