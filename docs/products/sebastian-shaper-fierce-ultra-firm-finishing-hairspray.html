            <li> Great product, holds great without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> This spray has a natural aand lasting hokd. I consider the spray one of the very best in the market. The onky reason why I did not rate it five stars was due to one spray bottle having a faulty spray cap and not being usable.</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware!!  2 out of 3 cans did not work!  Do not recommend this product from this seller!!</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Sebastian customer for about 15 years. I&#x27;ve run the gamut. Started with regular Shaper then graduated to Shaper Plus. Now &amp; then when available I&#x27;d get a can of Shaper Fierce. Back in the day, it wasn&#x27;t my choice for daily use, just special occasions.  But with the thyroid issues I&#x27;ve been having my hair is totally different.  Fierce will hold in a hurricane and still be soft. Now that&#x27;s what I call amazing! Got problems with humidity? Use Fierce. One less thing to worry about your hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold. I used the reShaper before and it held and smelled nice.&lt;br /&gt;No hold, waste of money and is expensive and doesn&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
            <li> Now I do not have to wait for the semi-annual $9.95 sale at Ulta! Other than the 3 cans being heavily taped, this is the real thing and works just as good as the $18 per can you buy at a regular store.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a hit on the supplier of these, its a hit on the manufacturer. There has not been 1 set of 3 where one of them didn&#x27;t spray well. And I&#x27;ve bought plenty.  I&#x27;ve had to throw 3 not empty cans away over the years that I couldn&#x27;t fix or work with.  Booooo!!!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is as described ... ultra firm.  If you have an up-do, it is great to keep it in place on a windy day.</li>
            <li> Loved the hairspray, but only one can sprays!</li>
