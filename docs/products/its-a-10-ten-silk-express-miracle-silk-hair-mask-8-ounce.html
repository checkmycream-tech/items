            <li> I was very unhappy with the fact that this product arrived without the interior seal and clearly missing a good deal of the product.</li>

            <li> It;s pricey though, so a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> Great product makes my hair manageable!</li>
            <li> Love this! It made my hair feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have really long hair and I use it once a week. Keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Love this product, left my hair silky smove</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week and not straightening my hair like I usually do so it is too soon for me to know the complete results. I can however say that it is at least as good as the original It&#x27;s A Ten Miracle Hair Mask with a wonderful smell. For me both of these products are the best for my unruly frizzy hair. So in the future I will order either one depending on price (if they are the same price) I will go with this one because of the scent.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the fact that this product arrived without the interior seal and clearly missing a good deal of the product. For the money I paid, it should absolutely not have arrived that way.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a youtube review and decided to try it. I mean, who doesn&#x27;t want silky hair, right?  I did a deep condition under the dryer and plastic cap and it made my 4B/C curly hair easier to detangle. It also smelled great. Some may find it strong, like you literally sprayed a Macy&#x27;s fragrance in your hair , but I liked it. It;s pricey though, so a little goes a long way. No need to over-saturate with this one.</li>
            <li> Did not do as it says. Do not shines,  one star for the great scent. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this purchase,  I waisted my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have curly hair and when i leave it in my hair for about 10 minutes and then wash it off and follow up with the leave in my hair looks super shiny, and tamed! My hair is no longer frizzy, and it&#x27;s super smooth! Btw so much cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This has made my hair silky and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair like silk!!!!  Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> great service! love the product</li>
            <li> Love product. Retailer great.</li>
            <li> This is the best!!!!  Love the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice since my purchase and i can say that i am hoping to like it more in the future bc right now i don&#x27;t care much for this purchase which really does sadden me bc its sort of a high end product. Although its not the most expensive I&#x27;ve ever paid for hair products for me &amp; my mom but it is one of the most expensive i have paid and not cared much for. I have many products but no I&#x27;m really not impressed with this at all</li>
            <li> I have really curly long hair. I dyed my hair last summer and it&#x27;s pretty damaged. The first time I used this product I didn&#x27;t feel much difference in my hair but I must not have left it in long enough. The second time I used it I decided to leave it in for a few hours with a shower cap covering my hair and my hair came out soooo soft and nice. I will be purchasing this item again and I&#x27;ll probably end up trying the leave in conditioner to go along with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a amazing product</li>
