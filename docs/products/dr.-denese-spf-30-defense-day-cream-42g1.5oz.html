            <li>I have been using Dr. Denese products because they are good for my skin.  </li>

            <li>addition, as an SPF Sunscreen, this is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>INgredients list is top notch !</li>
            <li>I had high hopes since the ingredients look wonderful.</li>
            <li>Love love love how it blends into your skin tone without leaving a whitey</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and cannot be without it.</li>
            <li>This Dr. Denese SPF 30 Facial Day Cream is perfectly tinted to cover imperfections and provide excellent protection for the face on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tinted moisturizers from Laura Mercier and Philosophy and their formulas are much more emollient and elegant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if your one like myself who use minerals as a foundation, I found this wasn&#x27;t greasy at the end of the day like many on the market.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is a 30 cream because I feel that I am getting the most protection from the sun when wearing this.</li>
            <li>I love this item and have used it for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of tint for me, good sun protection and makes my skin so even and velvety feeling.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST day moisturizer for the summer months or for days spent outdoors.</li>
            <li>Does not become greasy, looks natural, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and provides great protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is surprising how it really does blend into any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of the product being fresh, and thankfully, there is an expiration date stamped on the tube so that you can be sure that the SPF Factor will be able to protect as indicated.</li>
            <li>While I use many, many of the Dr Denese products, this was my first time purchasing the SPF 30 Defense Cream.</li>
            <li>And the packaging is really cheap.</li>
            <li>Product is wonderful-leaves face so smooth.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it wll still feel light.</li>
            <li>This is light enough to not get into any creases, provides great spf coverage, and light moisturization that it doesn&#x27;t bother my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Good discount, since manufacturer no longer offers</li>
            <li>In her experience the contents of the jar dries out to quickly.</li>
            <li>It seemed to get into my facial lines and make them look more prominent.</li>
            <li>Some vendors on Amazon do offer better prices and better selection of size without having to get extra stuff, which I like.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>this is a great product for white people to light skinned black people but if you have the shade of somebody like Gabrielle Union, don&#x27;t bother with this.</li>
            <li>I use it daily as a foundation, making for quick and easy application of make-up: just apply blush and eye make-up, then I&#x27;m out the door.</li>
            <li>And it arrived unbelievably fast!</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my son whose fair skin burns so easily - even with Coppertone Baby SPF 50.&lt;br /&gt;I usually try to get this smaller tube, even though the larger size is more economical.</li>
            <li>But after using the products faithfully for about 6 weeks, I wasn&#x27;t seeing any positive changes to my skin.</li>
            <li>large 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Makes your face look very greasy.</li>
            <li>My first attempt was never processed and I was shipped a new 90-day supply and my credit card</li>
            <li>The tub wants to ben in half and it feels like you&#x27;ll break the top off when you try to open/close it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several years and have never found a product I like more for my facial sun protection.</li>
            <li>sent me a prepaid return label for the new shipment, and said the charge would be refunded to my credit card.</li>
            <li>it leaves a grey cast on you fast and makes you look very ashy.</li>
            <li>The tint subtly evens out skin tones and blends beautifully; however, it takes a few minutes to turn to a matte-like finish.</li>
            <li>No other cream leaves your skin soft and protected and matt.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and wear this every single day for protection.</li>
            <li>But today I noticed the refund came through, minus about $9, which I assume means they are charging me shipping for the order they should never have sent me in the first place due to their error.</li>

            <li> It has a slight tint to the cream but works wonders and makes my face feel soft all day long...</li>
            <li> I have tried other BB &amp; CC creams, but I always end up going back to Dr. Denese,</li>
            <li> Given the thick consistency it is not easy to apply, I also feel a certain amount of grit as if my skin is sloughing off and it leaves a less than natural look, almost ashy</li>

            <li> There are actual little granules in the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so terribly disappointed with this product after reading so many glowing reviews and researching this product line.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub off color like other tinted moisturizers.</li>

            <li> At times I mix it with a little moisturizer for easiest application.  </li>
            <li> I especially didn&#x27;t like the day cream as it is very thick and rubs off on phone, clothes, etc.</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Denese&#x27;s SPF 30 everyday as my day cream and foundation.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake about it, this is not a light moisturizer with a hint of color, this is akin to foundation and it is not moisturizing at all.  </li>
            <li> Regular coverup or base makeup is much too heavy for anyone over 40.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase my cosmetics from Nordstrom&#x27;s where I can try before I buy and return when a product fails to perform.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too frustrated at this point to even call to argue.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> I use Dr. Denese&#x27;s SPF 30 everyday as my day cream and foundation. The coverage is gorgeous, it is silky going on and is not at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It is surprising how it really does blend into any skin tone. I have tried other BB &amp; CC creams, but I always end up going back to Dr. Denese, nothing else seems to come close.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, as an SPF Sunscreen, this is phenomenal! I use this on my son whose fair skin burns so easily - even with Coppertone Baby SPF 50.&lt;br /&gt;I usually try to get this smaller tube, even though the larger size is more economical. I like the idea of the product being fresh, and thankfully, there is an expiration date stamped on the tube so that you can be sure that the SPF Factor will be able to protect as indicated.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST day moisturizer for the summer months or for days spent outdoors.</li>
            <li> Love love love how it blends into your skin tone without leaving a whitey look to your face, for people to know your wearing sunblock or that the shade of the tint wasn&#x27;t a perfect match</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Denese products because they are good for my skin.  I love this stuff and cannot be without it.</li>
            <li> Simply put ! The best !  No other cream leaves your skin soft and protected and matt.  INgredients list is top notch !</li>
            <li> I only use this when we go to the beach. I do like that it is tinted, though it is a bit greasy for me. I def. don&#x27;t get sunburned when I wear this.</li>
            <li> This Dr. Denese SPF 30 Facial Day Cream is perfectly tinted to cover imperfections and provide excellent protection for the face on a daily basis. The tint subtly evens out skin tones and blends beautifully; however, it takes a few minutes to turn to a matte-like finish. At times I mix it with a little moisturizer for easiest application.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several years and have never found a product I like more for my facial sun protection. I use it daily as a foundation, making for quick and easy application of make-up: just apply blush and eye make-up, then I&#x27;m out the door. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> this is a great product for white people to light skinned black people but if you have the shade of somebody like Gabrielle Union, don&#x27;t bother with this. it leaves a grey cast on you fast and makes you look very ashy. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like you are putting paste on your face. Makes your face look very greasy. And the packaging is really cheap. The tub wants to ben in half and it feels like you&#x27;ll break the top off when you try to open/close it.</li>
            <li> I Love this face cream with excellent SPF protection and antiaging peptudes.</li>
            <li> While I use many, many of the Dr Denese products, this was my first time purchasing the SPF 30 Defense Cream. Well, after a couple of days I know I&#x27;ll be reordering this in the larger tube.  I cleanse in the AM, follow with the Pro C Pads and the Wrinkle Rx Moisture Surge Day Cream.  I then apply the SPF 30 Defense Day Cream. Done! It blends into the skin, evens out my skin-tone.  No need for foundation.  Just blush,liner,mascara and I&#x27;m done.  NOTE: Friend of mine said to always get the tube &amp; not the jar.  In her experience the contents of the jar dries out to quickly.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and wear this every single day for protection. It is the best. Does not become greasy, looks natural, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and provides great protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy when applied</li>
            <li> Excellent product which I have been using for three years.  Good discount, since manufacturer no longer offers&lt;br /&gt;the large 4 oz. size.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; including the day cream, facial pads, hydrating serum and night cream. I had high hopes since the ingredients look wonderful. But after using the products faithfully for about 6 weeks, I wasn&#x27;t seeing any positive changes to my skin. In fact, I felt my skin was looking duller. Very disappointed! I especially didn&#x27;t like the day cream as it is very thick and rubs off on phone, clothes, etc. I also didn&#x27;t like the tinting. It seemed to get into my facial lines and make them look more prominent. Then I experienced a glitch with cancelling my autoship. My first attempt was never processed and I was shipped a new 90-day supply and my credit card was charged. I called back and they apologized and cancelled this time, sent me a prepaid return label for the new shipment, and said the charge would be refunded to my credit card. Great! In spite of the inconvenience of having to drive to the UPS store! But today I noticed the refund came through, minus about $9, which I assume means they are charging me shipping for the order they should never have sent me in the first place due to their error. I&#x27;m too frustrated at this point to even call to argue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Although the tube I bought from you seemed different. There are actual little granules in the moisturizer. Which I have never seen in it before.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake about it, this is not a light moisturizer with a hint of color, this is akin to foundation and it is not moisturizing at all.  Given the thick consistency it is not easy to apply, I also feel a certain amount of grit as if my skin is sloughing off and it leaves a less than natural look, almost ashy and I don&#x27;t have dark skin.  I&#x27;ve used tinted moisturizers from Laura Mercier and Philosophy and their formulas are much more emollient and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so terribly disappointed with this product after reading so many glowing reviews and researching this product line.  I am currently reading the doctor&#x27;s book and while I appreciate the science behind her eponymous line versus the unsubstantiated claims from cosmetic companies, this particular product does not meet my expectations.  Since I can&#x27;t return this product and I don&#x27;t wish to throw money away, I&#x27;ve opted to mix it with another SPF moisturizer sans tint.  I will continue to purchase my cosmetics from Nordstrom&#x27;s where I can try before I buy and return when a product fails to perform.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s allot of tinted spfs out there but if your one like myself who use minerals as a foundation, I found this wasn&#x27;t greasy at the end of the day like many on the market.  I have even mixed it with the one from Aveeno.  I used both when I was inbetween ordering the next tube of Dr Denese&#x27;s spf 30, and I don&#x27;t want the Aveeno to go to waste, it works very well.  I will say you can purchase through QVC but the shipping is what gets you.  Some vendors on Amazon do offer better prices and better selection of size without having to get extra stuff, which I like.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;m a repeat buyer</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful-leaves face so smooth. And it arrived unbelievably fast!</li>
            <li> Great coverage without looking or feeling like makeup or sunscreen.  Doesn&#x27;t rub off color like other tinted moisturizers. Delivered quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> This defense day cream is awesome. I am no longer wearing foundation. It has a slight tint to the cream but works wonders and makes my face feel soft all day long... I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and I don&#x27;t like the feel at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best SPF Day Cream that I have worn.  Since I have been using this there are days when I do not even put on makeup.  I like the fact that this is a 30 cream because I feel that I am getting the most protection from the sun when wearing this.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and love it.  Just the right amount of tint for me, good sun protection and makes my skin so even and velvety feeling.  Also no fragrance-love that!</li>
            <li> Although I have used it indoors onle, it feels non-greasy. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up to Florida&#x27;s summer weather. Hopefully it wll still feel light. good coverage to use with and or without foundation</li>
            <li> I love this item and have used it for about 10 years now.  Regular coverup or base makeup is much too heavy for anyone over 40.  This is light enough to not get into any creases, provides great spf coverage, and light moisturization that it doesn&#x27;t bother my acne prone skin.</li>
