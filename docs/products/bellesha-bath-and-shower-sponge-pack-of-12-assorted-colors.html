            <li>This 12 shower sponge pack is a good value.</li>
            <li>would loved to have given these five stars.</li>
            <li>, I feel eleven of these is a fair value.</li>
            <li>These are good.</li>
            <li>It lathers up well in the shower and holds the soap for a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an unbelievably good deal and about a dollar each.  </li>
            <li>, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is a good value and a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the assortment of colors!</li>
            <li>I received this in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are also fairly durable, so you will probably swap these out more because of hygiene concerns than because they are fraying or what have you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all they really liked this pack, and all gave it \\&quot;thumbs up!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I would have liked the option of getting just one color or two...</li>
            <li>These are really nice.  </li>
            <li>They are very cute, soft and the perfect size!</li>
            <li>The price is right, they work great for our B&amp;B, because they are basically throw away, they can keep them if they want.</li>
            <li>These are good colorful shower sponges that lather up nicely.</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy about that.</li>
            <li>The sponges arrived quickly and with a good assortment.</li>
            <li>and it would be the size I think most would prefer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for kids, but not for adults.</li>
            <li>More like a medium.</li>
            <li>So Glad I Read The Reviews And Purchased These.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic deal of sponges!  </li>
            <li>Excellent price makes them relatively disposable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are especially good if you are buying these for several people in your household.</li>
            <li>more like 3&amp;#34;...not 5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and since you can never have too many bath poufs, I figured I&#x27;d check them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a bath puff which won&#x27;t unravel for more than a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They think we are being nice and thoughtful.  </li>
            <li>I love the assortment of colors that comes in this set of shower sponges.</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Whether you call them sponges or poufs or scrubbies, these are pretty good.</li>
            <li>as good as higher priced ones</li>
            <li>They quality is pretty good, and they are priced well.</li>
            <li>These bath sponges are pretty colors and good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>That said, they are great for actually cleaning your skin and do in fact lather up nicely.</li>
            <li>The sponges were fine, except we were expecting more colors, as shown in the image.</li>
            <li>These sponges feel very sturdy, yet soft and are the perfect size.</li>
            <li>I love how refreshed and clean my skin felt after showering with this product.</li>
            <li>these the poof were all a decent size and good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a bad thing that when a guest comes to stay with us we can give them a brand new Shower Sponge of their very own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They first told me that they love their size: they are ideal for hanging onto in the shower and are much easier to deal with than large sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like these just fine, gave a few away with Bath gel as Christmas gifts, people were very happy.</li>
            <li>Good size for little girls and good quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dropping my rating from 2 stars to 1 -- these things are so cheap.</li>
            <li>We think they enjoy trying them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a free product sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was provided a free pack of twelve of these sponges in assorted colors in exchange for a non biased review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They came on time and are very colorful.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a good deal, especially if you can get free shipping.</li>
            <li>These do hold up well when used with shower gels and the cord that easily fits around the wrist is useful for hanging.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to alternate the ones they use, and the sheer number of them makes it easy to discard any that may have overstayed their welcome --</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re dense enough to lather up well, and are a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>The sponge is soft and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>These are smaller than the target .99 cent ones but they are still good quality.</li>
            <li>They fit comfortably in your hand and are easy to maneuver, especially when washing the grand babies.</li>
            <li>The poufs seem to unravel quickly.  </li>
            <li>: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.</li>
            <li>I was hoping these would be a bit smaller than they were, but they were good quality &amp; pretty colors.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>the first sponge is already falling apart quite a lot!</li>
            <li>I have a wife and two daughters who have raved about these colorful bath \\&quot;sponges.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But they liked the colors by themselves, and said that it was their practice to use different sponges rather than one over and over again.</li>
            <li>Right now, I am about 4 weeks into using one of these and it has NOT fallen apart yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size of the sponges is just right.</li>
            <li>Pretty pastels.</li>
            <li>First time I got</li>
            <li>They Are A Bit Smaller Than The Ones Purchased In Most Stores.</li>
            <li>I was initially thinking they may be too small, but they are the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The colors could have been mixed a bit more.</li>
            <li>(The reason I deducted a star).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are much nicer than the dollar ones I have seen locally and the hold rope goes all of the way around making it very sturdy and handy.</li>
            <li>but there were only a few appropriate for the guys in the family, but hey, more for me!</li>
            <li>Not as large as the largest poofs you can buy.</li>
            <li>The website stated large.</li>
            <li>The shower material is tightly woven and nicely made.</li>
            <li>These have held up very well in our household.  </li>
            <li>The quality appears to be good, they are smaller than I had expected though.  </li>
            <li>These are a great price, but they are very small and not very fluffy.</li>
            <li>Was a good price point but not much value if they can&#x27;t be used for very long.</li>
            <li>Good quality, do not fall apart in the shower, stand up to daily use, which cannot be said of quite a few that are in the marketplace.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t come apart like some of the dollar store varieties, and they&#x27;re a decent size</li>
            <li>main downside that I can see is that you may not get 2 of each color.</li>
            <li>this is a decent buy.  </li>
            <li>Not sure just how long they will last yet, but right now, both my wife and daughter are happy with them.</li>
            <li>Outside of that, a pack this size should last you a little while, and so all in all a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>These took much longer to arrive than I had hoped and came from China (which was unexpected based on the product information provided).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the huge rough type.  </li>
            <li>These are smaller than scrubbies I see in the store, but they work fine for sudsing up the entire body.</li>
            <li>They are a normal size, not small as others wrote.</li>
            <li>, I had to order more to assure that I had enough to leave out the pink and purple colors to go with my party theme.</li>
            <li>Since I have discovered that bacteria grow in these over time, in spite of the fact that they dry quickly, I now replace mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are very fun to use and with this many at your disposal, when you unfortunately have one unravel mid-shower, you will have plenty go back-ups.  </li>
            <li>They both like the colors and that they are very soft.</li>
            <li>I know some reviewers have received an odd mix of colors, but mine were fine-- about an even number of each color.</li>
            <li>; is ok for the face, but just a bit small for the body</li>
            <li>The only improvement would be to make them a tad larger for a true Spa experience.</li>
            <li>But under normal use, these should last very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These arent soft, so dont get that impression.</li>
            <li>much nicer ones can be purchased at the local dollar store.</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes them a lot, but my wife wishes they were a bit bigger.</li>
            <li>They are soft colors and can match about any decor.</li>
            <li>They are soft and full and have a thicker than average braided rope loop.</li>
            <li>I find that they are very useful in sloughing off dead skin while showering.</li>
            <li>The size was just right, not too small, but not the large ones.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small, they fit in my palm, which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it bothers others.</li>
            <li>Horribly small and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>this assortment isn&#x27;t as large as you might think, especially if you have several members in your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pack had too many pinks and less (or none) of the other colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li>In py package there was: 1 blue, 1 yellow, 2 green 1 blue and 8 bright pink sponges.</li>
            <li>As a guy, I was hoping for a bit more variety and for it to be not so heavy on the pink</li>
            <li>Two people in the same household surely cannot use the same color scrubbie, can they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the single scrubbies available at my local discount store--which, by the way, I can buy for the same price AND choose my color--these are a little on the small size and are made of more delicate netting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They came out as expected and plus they came really fast...</li>
            <li>These are okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li>At first, there was a slight smell to the product.  </li>
            <li>: They did have a slight odor upon opening the package but after my first shower, the smell went away.</li>
            <li>Too small and wear out too quickly.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using them because they are small enough to put in my back when I travel some place.  </li>
            <li>It is not real noticeable but there is a slight plastic/chemical smell to this product right out of the bag which some people may want to avoid though thankfully once the shower gel is applied it disappears.  </li>

            <li> But they liked the colors by themselves, and said that it was their practice to use different sponges rather than one over and over again.</li>
            <li> Right now, I am about 4 weeks into using one of these and it has NOT fallen apart yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size of the sponges is just right.</li>
            <li> Pretty pastels.</li>
            <li> First time I got</li>
            <li> They Are A Bit Smaller Than The Ones Purchased In Most Stores.</li>
            <li> I was initially thinking they may be too small, but they are the perfect size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The colors could have been mixed a bit more.</li>
            <li> (The reason I deducted a star).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are much nicer than the dollar ones I have seen locally and the hold rope goes all of the way around making it very sturdy and handy.</li>
            <li> but there were only a few appropriate for the guys in the family, but hey, more for me!</li>
            <li> Not as large as the largest poofs you can buy.</li>
            <li> The website stated large.</li>
            <li> The shower material is tightly woven and nicely made.</li>
            <li> These have held up very well in our household.  </li>
            <li> The quality appears to be good, they are smaller than I had expected though.  </li>
            <li> These are a great price, but they are very small and not very fluffy.</li>
            <li> Was a good price point but not much value if they can&#x27;t be used for very long.</li>
            <li> Good quality, do not fall apart in the shower, stand up to daily use, which cannot be said of quite a few that are in the marketplace.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come apart like some of the dollar store varieties, and they&#x27;re a decent size</li>
            <li> main downside that I can see is that you may not get 2 of each color.</li>
            <li> this is a decent buy.  </li>
            <li> Not sure just how long they will last yet, but right now, both my wife and daughter are happy with them.</li>
            <li> Outside of that, a pack this size should last you a little while, and so all in all a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> These took much longer to arrive than I had hoped and came from China (which was unexpected based on the product information provided).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the huge rough type.  </li>
            <li> These are smaller than scrubbies I see in the store, but they work fine for sudsing up the entire body.</li>
            <li> They are a normal size, not small as others wrote.</li>
            <li> , I had to order more to assure that I had enough to leave out the pink and purple colors to go with my party theme.</li>
            <li> Since I have discovered that bacteria grow in these over time, in spite of the fact that they dry quickly, I now replace mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are very fun to use and with this many at your disposal, when you unfortunately have one unravel mid-shower, you will have plenty go back-ups.  </li>
            <li> They both like the colors and that they are very soft.</li>
            <li> I know some reviewers have received an odd mix of colors, but mine were fine-- about an even number of each color.</li>
            <li> ; is ok for the face, but just a bit small for the body</li>
            <li> The only improvement would be to make them a tad larger for a true Spa experience.</li>
            <li> But under normal use, these should last very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These arent soft, so dont get that impression.</li>
            <li> much nicer ones can be purchased at the local dollar store.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes them a lot, but my wife wishes they were a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> They are soft colors and can match about any decor.</li>
            <li> They are soft and full and have a thicker than average braided rope loop.</li>
            <li> I find that they are very useful in sloughing off dead skin while showering.</li>
            <li> The size was just right, not too small, but not the large ones.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small, they fit in my palm, which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it bothers others.</li>
            <li> Horribly small and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> this assortment isn&#x27;t as large as you might think, especially if you have several members in your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pack had too many pinks and less (or none) of the other colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li> In py package there was: 1 blue, 1 yellow, 2 green 1 blue and 8 bright pink sponges.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I was hoping for a bit more variety and for it to be not so heavy on the pink</li>
            <li> Two people in the same household surely cannot use the same color scrubbie, can they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the single scrubbies available at my local discount store--which, by the way, I can buy for the same price AND choose my color--these are a little on the small size and are made of more delicate netting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They came out as expected and plus they came really fast...</li>
            <li> These are okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li> At first, there was a slight smell to the product.  </li>
            <li> : They did have a slight odor upon opening the package but after my first shower, the smell went away.</li>
            <li> Too small and wear out too quickly.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using them because they are small enough to put in my back when I travel some place.  </li>
            <li> It is not real noticeable but there is a slight plastic/chemical smell to this product right out of the bag which some people may want to avoid though thankfully once the shower gel is applied it disappears.  </li>
            <li> These are soft (don&#x27;t feel too &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; like other sponges.  </li>
            <li> So, I have quite a few pink &amp; purple ones if anyone would be interested.</li>
            <li> There were only pink, blue and yellow sponges.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00H3MATM2 QUALITY BLUE BATH AND SHOWER BRUSH WITH LONG HANDLE.</li>
            <li> These were much smaller than I expected -- definitely not your \\&quot;standard\\&quot; size.</li>
            <li> I wanted small bath poufs, but these are miniature, thin and feel very cheap.  </li>
            <li> Of note is that these are a bit smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I should have received two of six colors, but I got eight pink, one blue,</li>

            <li> Going back to regular soaps to cut down trash now.</li>
            <li> puffs not only smaller but less dense.  </li>
            <li> The bag we received contained 6 pink, 4 green, 1 yellow and 1 blue.</li>
            <li> I received 5 pink, 4 blue, 2 yellow, and 1 green.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is, I would have rather paid a few extra bucks for the larger, regular sized poufs than these little pink</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I&#x27;m used too</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I was hoping/ expecting...</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li> Each shower sponge not expected to be this small.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You may want to combine these sponges with this brush, which scrubs a bit harder than these sponges:</li>
            <li> The assorted colors have a lot of pink in my bag.</li>
            <li> There were 3 green, 3 blue, 3 pink, 1 off-white, and 2 orange.</li>
            <li> My bag contained SIX pink, FOUR green and ONE blue pouf.</li>
            <li> I have mostly green puffs, two reds, one blue, one pink......</li>
            <li> (slightly smaller than the ones I&#x27;ve gotten from CVS, but not too small).</li>
            <li> (although other reviewers warned this tended to be the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a complimentary sample so that I could put these through a few tests, and other than the random (instead of two of each color) assortment</li>
            <li> My hands are average in size, and these puffs seem noticeably smaller than what I usually get at Target.  </li>
            <li> However, if you pull hard on them, it is possible to pull them apart.</li>
            <li> Nope,  not worth the time or effort of ordering.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems that previous reviewers had.</li>
            <li> The problem is that my bag only contained eleven poufs... and not a good distribution of colors, I might add.</li>
            <li> assortment came with about half pink, though, meaning it would be hard to assign a color to family members which is how we keep ours separated.</li>
            <li> three green.  </li>
            <li> unraveled with a few uses.</li>
            <li> After a week or so, I had trouble with it unraveling.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that in my assorted bag I didn&#x27;t receive any purple or aqua sponges as are pictured but just the white, yellow, pink and green ones</li>
            <li> They were a little small</li>
            <li> These things are Small.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a bit too small...</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> (Not sure why others are complaining about that.)</li>
            <li> the sponges size is very small.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, these sponges are very small.</li>
            <li> These are very small.</li>
            <li> very small size.  </li>
            <li> Second order was very disappointing ...</li>
            <li> I hate spending big money on these disposable items, so i thought I was getting a bargain.  </li>
            <li> What annoyed me are the colors.</li>
            <li> These are very small!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with second order.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely not impressed with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I guess the color assortment is just random.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out that the sponges are not as sturdy as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> None have fallen apart yet, and they&#x27;re not too scratchy, so that makes a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> These things are Small.  Just know that before biying</li>
            <li> Will fall apart after 5 uses</li>
            <li> The quality appears to be good, they are smaller than I had expected though.  Tie two together and it would be the size I think most would prefer.</li>
            <li> Good buy.  A little smaller than I&#x27;m used too but it does the job!</li>
            <li> These were way smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> the sponges size is very small. It&#x27;s OK for kids, but not for adults.</li>
            <li> The sponges arrived quickly and with a good assortment. There were 3 green, 3 blue, 3 pink, 1 off-white, and 2 orange. The size was just right, not too small, but not the large ones.</li>
            <li> The sponges were fine, except we were expecting more colors, as shown in the image. There were only pink, blue and yellow sponges.</li>
            <li> The price is right, they work great for our B&amp;B, because they are basically throw away, they can keep them if they want.</li>
            <li> The poufs seem to unravel quickly.  Seems wasteful.  Going back to regular soaps to cut down trash now.</li>
            <li> I like these just fine, gave a few away with Bath gel as Christmas gifts, people were very happy. The only improvement would be to make them a tad larger for a true Spa experience. Good quality, do not fall apart in the shower, stand up to daily use, which cannot be said of quite a few that are in the marketplace.</li>
            <li> I got these so I can toss in the garbage each month</li>
            <li> Maybe a bit too small...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems that previous reviewers had. I got all 12 puffs, 2 of each color. They are a normal size, not small as others wrote. (I assume others have bought over-sized puffs before this because these are the same size I always purchase.) I cannot comment on their durability though, as I just got them. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> At about $1.00 a piece, these are a great deal.  Especially if you have a household of kids where you through these a lot.  The product we received came with 6 colors in the bag.  At first, there was a slight smell to the product.  However, that went away after about 15 minutes.  These have held up very well in our household.  They lather up very nicely for the kids.  Of note is that these are a bit smaller than I expected.  Definitely not a deal breaker.  Also, very suitable for gift bags.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. Great baby shower gifts for the guests!!</li>
            <li> Not as large as the largest poofs you can buy. More like a medium. Pretty pastels. A good bulk buy.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received this in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arent soft, so dont get that impression. That said, they are great for actually cleaning your skin and do in fact lather up nicely. They are also fairly durable, so you will probably swap these out more because of hygiene concerns than because they are fraying or what have you. Outside of that, a pack this size should last you a little while, and so all in all a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Whether you call them sponges or poufs or scrubbies, these are pretty good. They don&#x27;t come apart like some of the dollar store varieties, and they&#x27;re a decent size (slightly smaller than the ones I&#x27;ve gotten from CVS, but not too small). I know some reviewers have received an odd mix of colors, but mine were fine-- about an even number of each color. They&#x27;re dense enough to lather up well, and are a good value for the money. I like having extras around for guests and travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these for review.</li>
            <li> If I order a dozen net scrubbies, I expect the assortment to be as shown in the picture. I should have received two of six colors, but I got eight pink, one blue, three green.  I was especially looking forward to the yellow and the periwinkle, and I got none in those colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight pink scrubbies will last me forever! Two people in the same household surely cannot use the same color scrubbie, can they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the single scrubbies available at my local discount store--which, by the way, I can buy for the same price AND choose my color--these are a little on the small size and are made of more delicate netting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not impressed with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from BelleSha.</li>
            <li> These are awful. Smaller than a baseball and not pouffy. I used them to bathe my kids and one of them unraveled with a few uses.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with second order.  First time I got these the poof were all a decent size and good value for the money.  Second order was very disappointing ... puffs not only smaller but less dense.  Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> What A Deal!! They Are A Bit Smaller Than The Ones Purchased In Most Stores. Personally, I Prefer The Smaller Size. Have Put Them Through The Washer, They Don&#x27;t Loosen Or Come Apart. Good Price, Great Quality And Quantity. So Glad I Read The Reviews And Purchased These.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal of sponges!  The colors are very fun to use and with this many at your disposal, when you unfortunately have one unravel mid-shower, you will have plenty go back-ups.  Right now, I am about 4 weeks into using one of these and it has NOT fallen apart yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: They did have a slight odor upon opening the package but after my first shower, the smell went away.</li>
            <li> absolutely excellent. as good as higher priced ones</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t big like the individual ones you can get at Walmart, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, etc. but they are big enough to get the job done. Lots of pinks in the combo pack, if that matters to you. Excellent price makes them relatively disposable.</li>
            <li> I have a wife and two daughters who have raved about these colorful bath \\&quot;sponges.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They first told me that they love their size: they are ideal for hanging onto in the shower and are much easier to deal with than large sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, they said they like the colors and the sheer number of them...it&#x27;s very easy to alternate the ones they use, and the sheer number of them makes it easy to discard any that may have overstayed their welcome -- that&#x27;s my term for it. But they liked the colors by themselves, and said that it was their practice to use different sponges rather than one over and over again. (I&#x27;m inclined to take them at their word for that, and not question.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all they really liked this pack, and all gave it \\&quot;thumbs up!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would be a bit smaller than they were, but they were good quality &amp; pretty colors.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would have liked the option of getting just one color or two...these were used as a shower favor for a boy baby shower &amp; though I needed only 25 or so, I had to order more to assure that I had enough to leave out the pink and purple colors to go with my party theme. So, I have quite a few pink &amp; purple ones if anyone would be interested.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using them because they are small enough to put in my back when I travel some place.  I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> This 12 shower sponge pack is a good value. Perfect for using when travelling, or if you like to replace your shower sponge regularly.&lt;br /&gt;They are especially good if you are buying these for several people in your household. They quality is pretty good, and they are priced well.</li>
            <li> more like 3&amp;#34;...not 5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Each shower sponge not expected to be this small.  AMAZON also will not accept returns...</li>
            <li> These were much smaller than I expected -- definitely not your \\&quot;standard\\&quot; size. If anything, I would call these travel sized. In py package there was: 1 blue, 1 yellow, 2 green 1 blue and 8 bright pink sponges. As a guy, I was hoping for a bit more variety and for it to be not so heavy on the pink (although other reviewers warned this tended to be the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, I would have rather paid a few extra bucks for the larger, regular sized poufs than these little pink ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After just 2 uses (no exaggeration!) the first sponge is already falling apart quite a lot! Unbelievable. I&#x27;m dropping my rating from 2 stars to 1 -- these things are so cheap. I will never buy these again.</li>
            <li> I was asked to review these and since you can never have too many bath poufs, I figured I&#x27;d check them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things aren&#x27;t sponges. I&#x27;m not taking points off for this titling faux pas, but even I, an uncouth and lowly truck driver know the difference between a pouf and a sponge. These things ain&#x27;t sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would loved to have given these five stars. I think they are a five star product. They are soft and full and have a thicker than average braided rope loop. All of these things make for a five star pouf (or sponge, if you&#x27;re BelleSha). The problem is that my bag only contained eleven poufs... and not a good distribution of colors, I might add. My bag contained SIX pink, FOUR green and ONE blue pouf. Even here in Southern Illinois, that adds up to eleven items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I didn&#x27;t pay for my bag of poufs, and quite frankly at $12, I feel eleven of these is a fair value. The thing is, if you tell me I&#x27;m getting 12 poufs and I pay for 12 poufs, then you should give me 12 poufs. And maybe give the same number of each color, too.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as part of my sister&#x27;s favors for her bridal shower. They are very cute, soft and the perfect size! I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Like others have said, these sponges are very small.</li>
            <li> These are a great price, but they are very small and not very fluffy.</li>
            <li> These are good. I give them as gifts.</li>
            <li> pretty small and flimsy. But, there is a dozen of them.</li>
            <li> They were as described. I&#x27;m still looking for a bath puff which won&#x27;t unravel for more than a couple of weeks. 5&amp;#34; is ok for the face, but just a bit small for the body</li>
            <li> They came out as expected and plus they came really fast... Excellent</li>
            <li> The Manufacturer sent these to us to try out and post a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are six different colors (2 each) in the bag.  The sponge is soft and feels nice.  It lathers up well in the shower and holds the soap for a good amount of time.  While we didn&#x27;t need twelve sponges that is what we got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here is a thought we had.  At a $1.00 a sponge it&#x27;s not a bad thing that when a guest comes to stay with us we can give them a brand new Shower Sponge of their very own.  They can pick their color and then if they want take it home with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They think we are being nice and thoughtful.  We think they enjoy trying them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will you use them?</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I was hoping/ expecting...</li>
            <li> These are good colorful shower sponges that lather up nicely. I was impressed with the lather they generated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $1 per sponge, I think it&#x27;s a good deal, especially if you can get free shipping. NOTE: I received a free product sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main downside that I can see is that you may not get 2 of each color. My pack had too many pinks and less (or none) of the other colors. I&#x27;m subtracting 1/2 a star for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to combine these sponges with this brush, which scrubs a bit harder than these sponges: [[ASIN:B00H3MATM2 QUALITY BLUE BATH AND SHOWER BRUSH WITH LONG HANDLE. *1 YEAR GUARANTEE* Long Handled Shower, Body and Exfoliating Brush. Back brush for bath. Hygienic, Durable Plastic. Blue.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 4.5 stars so I&#x27;m rounding up to 5.</li>
            <li> The assorted colors have a lot of pink in my bag. Not a problem but there were only a few appropriate for the guys in the family, but hey, more for me! The shower material is tightly woven and nicely made. These are smaller than scrubbies I see in the store, but they work fine for sudsing up the entire body. This is a good value and a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shower sponges provided for review</li>
            <li> These took much longer to arrive than I had hoped and came from China (which was unexpected based on the product information provided).  I wanted small bath poufs, but these are miniature, thin and feel very cheap.  Granted, they were inexpensive but much nicer ones can be purchased at the local dollar store.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out that the sponges are not as sturdy as I would like them to be. After a week of use, they just fall apart. I give this product a 3 because I did like the variety of colors mine came in. I was pretty happy about that.</li>
            <li> These sponges feel very sturdy, yet soft and are the perfect size. I LOVE the assortment of colors! (Not sure why others are complaining about that.) I find that they are very useful in sloughing off dead skin while showering. They make a perfect gift pack as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work</li>
            <li> At the current unit price of about a $1.00 a sponge this is a decent buy.  I was a little disappointed that in my assorted bag I didn&#x27;t receive any purple or aqua sponges as are pictured but just the white, yellow, pink and green ones so I guess the color assortment is just random. These do hold up well when used with shower gels and the cord that easily fits around the wrist is useful for hanging.  It is not real noticeable but there is a slight plastic/chemical smell to this product right out of the bag which some people may want to avoid though thankfully once the shower gel is applied it disappears.  I was provided a free pack of twelve of these sponges in assorted colors in exchange for a non biased review.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size to use in the shower.  I was initially thinking they may be too small, but they are the perfect size.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Very very tiny poufs.  I hate spending big money on these disposable items, so i thought I was getting a bargain.  Nope,  not worth the time or effort of ordering.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> These are soft (don&#x27;t feel too &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; like other sponges.  They&#x27;re small, they fit in my palm, which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it bothers others.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality!! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter use these and like them. My daughter really likes them a lot, but my wife wishes they were a bit bigger. They both like the colors and that they are very soft. Both of them like using them in the shower and bath, and say they work well for lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors could have been mixed a bit more. The bag we received contained 6 pink, 4 green, 1 yellow and 1 blue. Not sure just how long they will last yet, but right now, both my wife and daughter are happy with them. (4 stars because my wife wishes they were bigger.)</li>
            <li> These bath sponges are pretty colors and good quality for the price. I bought a package of them and gave several away.</li>
            <li> NOT bath/shower sponges.  These are very small!  Perhaps to use on your face?  They&#x27;re not even big enough to bathe my 3yo.  Also, don&#x27;t expect to receive 2 of each color as shown in the picture.  I received 5 pink, 4 blue, 2 yellow, and 1 green.</li>
            <li> The website stated large. These are very small. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did you know you are supposed to get rid of your bath pouf after using it for two months? I used to keep mine till they fell apart! Since I have discovered that bacteria grow in these over time, in spite of the fact that they dry quickly, I now replace mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this assortment isn&#x27;t as large as you might think, especially if you have several members in your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My assortment came with about half pink, though, meaning it would be hard to assign a color to family members which is how we keep ours separated. (The reason I deducted a star).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are much nicer than the dollar ones I have seen locally and the hold rope goes all of the way around making it very sturdy and handy. However, if you pull hard on them, it is possible to pull them apart. But under normal use, these should last very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample so that I could put these through a few tests, and other than the random (instead of two of each color) assortment, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected. These things fall apart with moderate use. Was a good price point but not much value if they can&#x27;t be used for very long.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> They are smaller than expected. What annoyed me are the colors. You don&#x27;t get two sets of the colors pictured. I have mostly green puffs, two reds, one blue, one pink......you get the idea.</li>
            <li> I love the assortment of colors that comes in this set of shower sponges. They are soft colors and can match about any decor. I love how refreshed and clean my skin felt after showering with this product. The size of the sponges is just right. They fit comfortably in your hand and are easy to maneuver, especially when washing the grand babies. They were well made and have lasted a month without coming apart. I will not keep them longer than that for cleanliness reasons, although I wash and rinse them after every use. Every member of the family has a different color.&lt;br /&gt;It is an unbelievably good deal and about a dollar each.  I received this product for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> very small size.  even smaller than i expected.  otherwise these seem well made.  i think they would be best for kids.</li>
            <li> These are okay, but not great.  They are a little smaller than I thought they would be.  My hands are average in size, and these puffs seem noticeably smaller than what I usually get at Target.  After a week or so, I had trouble with it unraveling.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a spa party. Good size for little girls and good quality. Glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> These are smaller than the target .99 cent ones but they are still good quality. I only received 4 different colors. All were in a Ziploc type bag with the company&#x27;s logo on it. These are a great size for my kids which is who I bought them for. Overall, I would buy them again. Just wish they would send all the colors in the picture.</li>
            <li> Would need two or three of them just to bathe properly.</li>
            <li> They were a little small but it did the job!</li>
            <li> Too small and wear out too quickly.</li>
            <li> These are really nice.  I don&#x27;t like the huge rough type.  These are smaller and softer.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;They came on time and are very colorful.  I would definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> Horribly small and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  They are beautiful and a nice quality.</li>
