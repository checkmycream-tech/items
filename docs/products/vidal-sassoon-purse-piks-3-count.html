            <li>This pick goes through his hair easily and painlessly</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re strong and workable.</li>
            <li>sturdy plastic, good quality, nice colors, great price, highly recommend, got as an add on but was still treated as though i spent a lot.</li>
            <li>Works great as a portable emergency afro pick.&lt;br /&gt;You will need a different pick as your primary at-home pick.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>They were cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are light-weight and have a generous handle.&lt;br /&gt;The ends are also comfortably rounded so they don&#x27;t stab your scalp.</li>
            <li>Just easy to comb quickly thru and go.</li>
            <li>They are small, but perfect for the purse or concealing in the hand/pocket for a quick trip to the ladies room.</li>
            <li>These are simple hair picks, they work, as you would imagine and the price was good.</li>
            <li>My two year old grandsons hair makes Shirley Temples look easy!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for getting the knots out of wet hair without too much pulling.</li>
            <li>What exciting can you say about piks?  </li>
            <li>They are worth the price.</li>
            <li>The handle is small but does not interfere with having a good grasp and can easily comb hair.</li>
            <li>Just the right size, I like the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>the teeth are flexible and glide right thru my hair without breaking which is exactly what i wanted on the package</li>
            <li>I used to use, but they work very well, and there are 3 of them!  </li>
            <li>I will speak later on whether a Vidal Sassoon pic is any better than the non descript ones that I bought at the Dollar Store.  </li>
            <li>I love these piks I had went without one for a long time</li>
            <li>it is very sturdy...</li>
            <li>I greatly appreciated the help these combs give.</li>
            <li>then I got my hair cut and really needed one.</li>
            <li>Definitely, not thin.</li>
            <li>Finding a three pack on Amazon made my life a lot easier, haha.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Nice small picks for your purse.  </li>
            <li>and i also like the fact that they are small and can fit right in my pocket.</li>
            <li>The colors might not be as shown so if that really matters that would be my only knock.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I expected, and do the job quite well.  </li>
            <li>These are a bit smaller than the old pik</li>
            <li>Exactly as described - and for less than I could purchase them at the store.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight and an average thickness.</li>

            <li> My hair is straight and an average thickness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to really mess up a pik</li>
            <li> I use a pik in the shower to distribute conditioner through my long hair and this is much too small for that.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected but that was because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size when I was purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I have several other non descript piks that are somewhere in my clothing.  </li>
            <li> I was initially surprised by how small these picks where.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are smaller than the average pick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m set for quite awhile now for only a few dollars.</li>
            <li> so I could have them in other clothes.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use combs like this and had been having trouble finding them in stores.</li>
            <li> The tines will break if dropped hard, or with heavy use/tangles.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too small.</li>
            <li> I think I could use these on a baby doll, a small child, or maybe a pet that enjoys an unorthodox grooming, but not on my head...</li>
            <li> My order come on time and it works well for my small Afro.</li>
            <li> I do not use brushes on my wet hair because it is unhealthy for my hair to do so.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really small but get the job done</li>
            <li> Not the hard plastic</li>
            <li> These were hard to find hair picks.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, wiry hair</li>
            <li> These are very, very small.</li>
            <li> I hate the solid, hard, unmovable picks.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The item was packed well and arrived on time. The item is just as described as works well.</li>
            <li> Smallish but great for quick touch-ups, travel, purse, etc.  Smooth teeth that don&#x27;t grab and pull too!</li>
            <li> Works well...very pleased.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star because it was creased at the edges of the package but despite that i really liked my package just received it in the mail about 20mins ago and now am using it for my afro...it is very sturdy...the teeth are flexible and glide right thru my hair without breaking which is exactly what i wanted on the package its says its best used for curly,wavy or permed hair and i got curly hair and it works well and i also like the fact that they are small and can fit right in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Perfect to carry in your purse with the right amount of flexibility.  Not the hard plastic</li>
            <li> HI, These are easy to hold/nice size..nice colors. Colors were ~ tan/cranberry/slate blue.  They greatly helped untangle my hair. I greatly appreciated the help these combs give. Best wishes.</li>
            <li> These are very, very small. Not what I was expecting. I use a pik in the shower to distribute conditioner through my long hair and this is much too small for that.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer. They&#x27;re too small. Oh well. They were cheap.</li>
            <li> They are small, but perfect for the purse or concealing in the hand/pocket for a quick trip to the ladies room.</li>
            <li> these are the perfect size to carry in your purse!  i can even give them as gifts!  every curly girl needs a good pick!</li>
            <li> Just the right size, I like the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Good head scratcher too!  Has&lt;br /&gt;many uses actually!  Solves my&lt;br /&gt;problem.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking - a 5 star pik?! It&#x27;s not hard to really mess up a pik so let&#x27;s just say the 5 stars stems from how sturdy the piks are (I&#x27;ve encountered some flimsy varieties over the years) and I love how there is an assortment of colors to choose from. I&#x27;m set for quite awhile now for only a few dollars.</li>
            <li> These are a bit smaller than the old pik I used to use, but they work very well, and there are 3 of them!  So, I can have one in&lt;br /&gt;my purse, one in each bathroom.  I don&#x27;t like using combs, and have used a pik for decades, even tho I have fairly short hair.  Just easy to comb quickly thru and go.</li>
            <li> My two year old grandsons hair makes Shirley Temples look easy! It probably was since she had stylists. I do too now. This pick goes through his hair easily and painlessly</li>
            <li> What exciting can you say about piks?  I bought 6 of them. I am a man so I don&#x27;t have a purse. I have several other non descript piks that are somewhere in my clothing.  I bought six more so I could have them in other clothes.  If I still can&#x27;t find a pik when I need one I will buy more pics until I have a pic in every piece of clothing that I own.  I will speak later on whether a Vidal Sassoon pic is any better than the non descript ones that I bought at the Dollar Store.  The look alike, I know that.</li>
            <li> Good find if you are looking for hair picks.</li>
            <li> I was initially surprised by how small these picks where. I think I could use these on a baby doll, a small child, or maybe a pet that enjoys an unorthodox grooming, but not on my head... Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, wiry hair so breaking picks isn&#x27;t out of the norm for me. These picks are great because they slide in and out easy and they&#x27;re strong and workable. The colors might not be as shown so if that really matters that would be my only knock.</li>
            <li> Works great as a portable emergency afro pick.&lt;br /&gt;You will need a different pick as your primary at-home pick.&lt;br /&gt;But when your out and about, and people keep touching your &#x27;fro, this works just fine.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; very portable size. Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> My order come on time and it works well for my small Afro. Will have to order a big one soon.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast delivering.</li>
            <li> These are as advertised...easy to handle and keep in your purse.  The handle is small but does not interfere with having a good grasp and can easily comb hair.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I expected, and do the job quite well.  A good size for the purse or gym bag.</li>
            <li> I love these piks I had went without one for a long time then I got my hair cut and really needed one.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected but that was because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size when I was purchasing it.</li>
            <li> These were hard to find hair picks.  They do the job but are hard/heavy plastic - not malleable in any way.  The tines will break if dropped hard, or with heavy use/tangles.  Size is good.</li>
            <li> Great combs in bright colors to carry with you or use at home.</li>
            <li> Perfect picks and great price.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and an average thickness. Definitely, not thin. I do not use brushes on my wet hair because it is unhealthy for my hair to do so. I use piks and have NO split ends or frazzled hair from being pulled.&lt;br /&gt;The Piks are sturdy but flexible. I hate the solid, hard, unmovable picks. Yes, these are smaller than the average pick. I find them to be the perfect size for me. I have one in my bathroom and 1 in my purse. The third is on standby.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use combs like this and had been having trouble finding them in stores. Finding a three pack on Amazon made my life a lot easier, haha. They work just as you&#x27;d think they would and seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - and for less than I could purchase them at the store.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These are simple hair picks, they work, as you would imagine and the price was good. They are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice small picks for your purse.  Great value!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter what type of &amp;#34;strands&amp;#34; you use these wonderful combs for. We purchased our comb set to use as beaters for weaving projects on our new lap loom and they work PERFECTLY!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, doesn&#x27;t snag yarns, perfect spacing...these practical combs are wonderfully versatile :)</li>
            <li> These piks are flexible but sturdy. They&#x27;re great for getting the knots out of wet hair without too much pulling.</li>
            <li> sturdy plastic, good quality, nice colors, great price, highly recommend, got as an add on but was still treated as though i spent a lot. thanks</li>
            <li> I looked for these in the store with no luck.&lt;br /&gt;I love this piks .&lt;br /&gt;Great size for you purse and travel .&lt;br /&gt;Good Quality too!</li>
            <li> Great price.  I have curly hair and just wanted a simple pick to have in each purse.  These served my needs well.</li>
            <li> One for each of the Grandkids and just the right size!!</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Nice Piks for my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;They are light-weight and have a generous handle.&lt;br /&gt;The ends are also comfortably rounded so they don&#x27;t stab your scalp.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really small but get the job done</li>
            <li> I purchased these to keep in  my purse.  Works great.</li>
