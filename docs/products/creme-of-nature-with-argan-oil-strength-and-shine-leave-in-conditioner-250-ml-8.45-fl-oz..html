            <li>This leave-in is amazing .</li>
            <li>it leaves an amazing smell</li>
            <li>I have been trying to get nice twist outs, and though I wasn&#x27;t aiming for it this time.</li>
            <li>and when I pulled it out my hair it was shiny and the twists were curly and nice.</li>
            <li>but I use this product with the LOC method and it makes my hair feels nice when I use my oil and cream.</li>
            <li>In between, I do my own maintenance.</li>
            <li>(I have very curly hair) and it smells and works great!</li>
            <li>Kind of smells moldy</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells very strong, though that may be the argan oil.</li>
            <li>and immediately it made dentangling my relaxed hair very easy</li>
            <li>A VERY GOOD PRODUCT, IT MAKES ME HAIR VERY MANAGEABLE.</li>
            <li>found this, read the ingredients compared the list to all the rest, the price rocked, the scent was lovely and my hair is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>but I have the compulsion to change my hair color more often than is healthy for my tresses and this stuff is one of those needle in haystack</li>
            <li>Not so many ouches when I have comb his hair.  </li>
            <li>I always do everything I can to keep my hair healthy</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a spray -</li>
            <li>but it does not moisturize like it did when there was more argan oil in the product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the softness of my hair when I apply  this not to mention how deliteful the scent is .</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Light but does the job!</li>
            <li>shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Since there are so many silicones in it, I will NOT be re-purchasing.</li>

            <li>My Stylist uses this product on my hair, and I Love it and would recommend it to anyone to use</li>
            <li>My twistouts have been more defined than they&#x27;d been all winter</li>
            <li>it makes my hair looks and feels healthy</li>
            <li>No split ends and my hair shines :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Great product for natural hair!!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for my grand daughters dry curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I am natural with 4a hair and i love it and it has a great vanilla smell to it as well</li>
            <li>Just spray and brushing is much easier, smells good also</li>
            <li>This is a very nice conditioner and I truly love just spraying it in on a daily basis, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I originally found and bought this item while on vacation, and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply because it&#x27;s a spray.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on, sets in well with no yucky residue.</li>
            <li>I strongly dislike the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Way too strong of a scent for me.</li>
            <li>It may cause a little frizz, but has an excellent aroma.</li>
            <li>Its LIGHT.</li>
            <li>the hair is smooth like glass and retains the hold overnight.  </li>
            <li>Creme of Nature is a fantastic leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and works really well.</li>
            <li>I am hispanic but I am brown skin and have hair texture similar to actress Thandie Newton and this product works great.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a moisturizer, however, it&#x27;s way to light weight for that.</li>
            <li>I spray a good coat on at night and by morning, my hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Keeps frizz away and leaves my hair soft, loved it</li>
            <li>There is no breakage or pulling when I comb through my hair when wet, and boy does this smell good!</li>
            <li>Not as rich as others.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend the hair wrap foam from the argan line, but this 2n1 conditioner is worth the buy!</li>
            <li>For the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been using this to seal my twists and it&#x27;s worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It makes detangling so easy, like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I asked a stylist to recommend a great detangler that is healthy for my relaxed hair and does not have a lot of harsh chemicals in it, and she recommended this.</li>
            <li>My favorite leave in gives my hair a healthy natural shine.</li>
            <li>Love, love this stuff for my natural tresses.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a great product for the price I think that there are better products out there especially for women of color with natural hair.</li>
            <li>it makes it soo soft, manageable and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I loved the product especially the smell and the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>But I did decide not waste product (which means I do kind of like it) and will use it until the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product is a lot for the money and it smells nice and has a lot of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love it because it makes my hair very managable.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair, and it keeps it looking natural and nice.</li>
            <li>Love the whole line for my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been pretty good.</li>
            <li>It has silicones(which is not necessarily bad).</li>
            <li>This spray works awesome, does not weigh my hair down at all, and it&#x27;s a fine mist which I like, and makes my hair soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I did purchase their other leave-in (Perfect 7) which is a little bit more healthy and has a built in heat protectant.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair super moisturized and shiny.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me retain length tremendously, without this</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, smells great, and treats my transitioning (to natural) hair really well.</li>
            <li>and I love the light aroma on top of the other benefits it provides.  </li>
            <li>It also helps me use less shampoo, which is a great thing when your shampoo costs a lot.</li>
            <li>With proper weekly washing and nightly maintenance, my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>I am black and my hair is natural has to be done and this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Its light but moisturizes very well and</li>
            <li>i love this product it makes my hair soft and manageable after washing and it also keeps some moisture in my hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft, which is nice, but then it won&#x27;t take a curl very well.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel; no tangles, fairly soft hair</li>
            <li>I use it whenever I wrap my hair at night and before adding my moisturizer on freshly washed hair to protect against breakage and it&#x27;s been working well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say for this product; I am a 4b to 4c hair texture with very dry hair and this product is helpful because it shows amazing results.</li>
            <li>Buyers should know that this leave-in is largely composed of silicones, so if you&#x27;re trying to avoid putting silicone in your hair, this may not be the right thing to buy.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd bottle and I will be buying more as she uses them up.</li>
            <li>will by more in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my mom for recommending!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s growing pretty fast as well!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat a product that allows me to rock 1 twist out for more multiple days.</li>
            <li>Love it, this is my 3rd bottle of the conditioner, it does not leave your hair greasy looking or yuck feeling ....</li>
            <li>this had a nice smell and wasn&#x27;t oily, i would recommend it to to other people, try it for yourself</li>
            <li>I love using it even when my hair is dry for moisture and sheen.  </li>
            <li>In Conditioner daily, and my hair is again looking strong within 4 weeks time.  </li>
            <li>this not only works well with my dry frizzy hair, it also smells good..  </li>
            <li>Bought a second bottle when my first one ran out, which I rarely do with beauty products!</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive for the value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped it</li>
            <li>This product is very runny.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>Very embarrassing when you&#x27;re out and about.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely would.</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>and it works really well with the Argan oil shampoo and conditioner (also by crème of nature).</li>
            <li>It helps detangle and moisturize very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very conditioning.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, i cannot say enough!  </li>
            <li>its ok not very moisturizing also the bottle was used up in 2 weeks</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE IS VERY AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li>I like the price point, not so much the smell, but it works for me.</li>
            <li>It works very well for my show dogs</li>
            <li>leaves hair nice an fluffy.</li>
            <li>This product is more for wavy hair than curly natural hair, but keeps my hair moisturized because it has the argan oil mixed in.</li>
            <li>: You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this bottle!</li>
            <li>Worked very well on my fine, dry hair.</li>
            <li>Only used it a few times but it smells great and it made my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as a detangler, though it is really good at giving your hair a little daily moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but this really softened the new growth that I had</li>
            <li>I really like this new product</li>
            <li>so I was surprised especially since it&#x27;s often paired up with their sulfate free</li>
            <li>I have had locs for about 7 years and as they got longer and older I was getting some breakage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and hydrates my hair and tames frizz, but the scent has really gotten to me lately.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair out, and it leaves it super soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My natural hair absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used argan oil in different brands before and have always gotten very positive results.</li>
            <li>I feel like all it does is coat your hair with silicone or some other product to make it smooth.</li>
            <li>However, I still think I will be looking for a new Leave in Conditioner as my Liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a lot of new growth</li>
            <li>My hair is super dry and damaged from highlighting and it just wasn&#x27;t that miracle worker I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I have very soft hair</li>
            <li>I use it on a daily basis, right before I comb my hair and find that it helps with tangles and always leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>So I bought this for the first time last year and used it every day until I ran out.</li>
            <li>My hair is relaxed, so after I wash and deep conditioned, I applied this for the first time and the tangles were gone.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Went in a large expensive circle (thinking I would use new fancier products) and went right back around to home :)</li>
            <li>Then I use it however frequently</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t wash it every day, I don&#x27;t often use heat on it, and I like to try different leave in conditioners to really moisturize it, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>and it works wonders with my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this at walgreens and was surprised that it worked so well.</li>
            <li>This also makes my hair soft even when I use it to flatiron.</li>
            <li>It leaves my relaxed 4C hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>I use all organic and natural products</li>
            <li>Also I mist it on my curls to keep them soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I like this product; it doesn&#x27;t really wow me though.</li>
            <li>My daughter wears her hair natural and she has wavy hair, it works well for her.</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner has my hair feeling really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so let&#x27;s see how this works on natural hair...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t cause buildup.</li>
            <li>use it in my relaxed hair and in my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would def buy again.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair feel as soft as cotton.</li>
            <li>I found a stylist to professionally do my relaxers every 2 months.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone who want to have soft shiny hair</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Adds shine to your hair and makes hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I use for my hair vacation month to keep it moisturize, it make my hair feel soft and keep it in its braid while I keep my hair like this for 30 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are NO fly aways and my waves look so nice</li>
            <li>I am a fair haired woman with thin, dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>For instance carol&#x27;s daughter leave in is great but very expensive so my leave in conditioner hunt continues.</li>
            <li>and I use it faithfully before blow drying and prepping for flat ironing, for braid/twist outs, and to keep my real hair moisturized while wearing protective styles such as Senegalese twists, etc.</li>
            <li>This left my hair so soft and took the puffiness out of my roots.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so tired of these companies changing ingredients thinking the customer won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the stores around where I live do not carry the same thing, so I was glad to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>As an African American woman with natural hair,  I had been on the look out for a leave in conditioner that would not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>so simple, got rid of my dry looking hair, it feels super silky and soft without looking oily, greasy and icky.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally just a little dry at the ends with some split ends as well, and this really takes care of it.</li>

            <li> it leaves an amazing smell</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get nice twist outs, and though I wasn&#x27;t aiming for it this time.</li>
            <li> and when I pulled it out my hair it was shiny and the twists were curly and nice.</li>
            <li> but I use this product with the LOC method and it makes my hair feels nice when I use my oil and cream.</li>
            <li> In between, I do my own maintenance.</li>
            <li> (I have very curly hair) and it smells and works great!</li>
            <li> Kind of smells moldy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells very strong, though that may be the argan oil.</li>
            <li> and immediately it made dentangling my relaxed hair very easy</li>
            <li> A VERY GOOD PRODUCT, IT MAKES ME HAIR VERY MANAGEABLE.</li>
            <li> found this, read the ingredients compared the list to all the rest, the price rocked, the scent was lovely and my hair is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> but I have the compulsion to change my hair color more often than is healthy for my tresses and this stuff is one of those needle in haystack</li>
            <li> Not so many ouches when I have comb his hair.  </li>
            <li> I always do everything I can to keep my hair healthy</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a spray -</li>
            <li> but it does not moisturize like it did when there was more argan oil in the product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love the softness of my hair when I apply  this not to mention how deliteful the scent is .</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Light but does the job!</li>
            <li> shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Since there are so many silicones in it, I will NOT be re-purchasing.</li>

            <li> My Stylist uses this product on my hair, and I Love it and would recommend it to anyone to use</li>
            <li> My twistouts have been more defined than they&#x27;d been all winter</li>
            <li> it makes my hair looks and feels healthy</li>
            <li> No split ends and my hair shines :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Great product for natural hair!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for my grand daughters dry curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I am natural with 4a hair and i love it and it has a great vanilla smell to it as well</li>
            <li> Just spray and brushing is much easier, smells good also</li>
            <li> This is a very nice conditioner and I truly love just spraying it in on a daily basis, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I originally found and bought this item while on vacation, and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply because it&#x27;s a spray.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on, sets in well with no yucky residue.</li>
            <li> I strongly dislike the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Way too strong of a scent for me.</li>
            <li> It may cause a little frizz, but has an excellent aroma.</li>
            <li> Its LIGHT.</li>
            <li> the hair is smooth like glass and retains the hold overnight.  </li>
            <li> Creme of Nature is a fantastic leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and works really well.</li>
            <li> I am hispanic but I am brown skin and have hair texture similar to actress Thandie Newton and this product works great.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a moisturizer, however, it&#x27;s way to light weight for that.</li>
            <li> I spray a good coat on at night and by morning, my hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Keeps frizz away and leaves my hair soft, loved it</li>
            <li> There is no breakage or pulling when I comb through my hair when wet, and boy does this smell good!</li>
            <li> Not as rich as others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend the hair wrap foam from the argan line, but this 2n1 conditioner is worth the buy!</li>
            <li> For the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been using this to seal my twists and it&#x27;s worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It makes detangling so easy, like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I asked a stylist to recommend a great detangler that is healthy for my relaxed hair and does not have a lot of harsh chemicals in it, and she recommended this.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in gives my hair a healthy natural shine.</li>
            <li> Love, love this stuff for my natural tresses.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a great product for the price I think that there are better products out there especially for women of color with natural hair.</li>
            <li> it makes it soo soft, manageable and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I loved the product especially the smell and the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> But I did decide not waste product (which means I do kind of like it) and will use it until the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product is a lot for the money and it smells nice and has a lot of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love it because it makes my hair very managable.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and it keeps it looking natural and nice.</li>
            <li> Love the whole line for my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been pretty good.</li>
            <li> It has silicones(which is not necessarily bad).</li>
            <li> This spray works awesome, does not weigh my hair down at all, and it&#x27;s a fine mist which I like, and makes my hair soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I did purchase their other leave-in (Perfect 7) which is a little bit more healthy and has a built in heat protectant.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair super moisturized and shiny.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me retain length tremendously, without this</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, smells great, and treats my transitioning (to natural) hair really well.</li>
            <li> and I love the light aroma on top of the other benefits it provides.  </li>
            <li> It also helps me use less shampoo, which is a great thing when your shampoo costs a lot.</li>
            <li> With proper weekly washing and nightly maintenance, my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I am black and my hair is natural has to be done and this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Its light but moisturizes very well and</li>
            <li> i love this product it makes my hair soft and manageable after washing and it also keeps some moisture in my hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft, which is nice, but then it won&#x27;t take a curl very well.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel; no tangles, fairly soft hair</li>
            <li> I use it whenever I wrap my hair at night and before adding my moisturizer on freshly washed hair to protect against breakage and it&#x27;s been working well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say for this product; I am a 4b to 4c hair texture with very dry hair and this product is helpful because it shows amazing results.</li>
            <li> Buyers should know that this leave-in is largely composed of silicones, so if you&#x27;re trying to avoid putting silicone in your hair, this may not be the right thing to buy.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd bottle and I will be buying more as she uses them up.</li>
            <li> will by more in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my mom for recommending!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s growing pretty fast as well!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat a product that allows me to rock 1 twist out for more multiple days.</li>
            <li> Love it, this is my 3rd bottle of the conditioner, it does not leave your hair greasy looking or yuck feeling ....</li>
            <li> this had a nice smell and wasn&#x27;t oily, i would recommend it to to other people, try it for yourself</li>
            <li> I love using it even when my hair is dry for moisture and sheen.  </li>
            <li> In Conditioner daily, and my hair is again looking strong within 4 weeks time.  </li>
            <li> this not only works well with my dry frizzy hair, it also smells good..  </li>
            <li> Bought a second bottle when my first one ran out, which I rarely do with beauty products!</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive for the value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped it</li>
            <li> This product is very runny.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Very embarrassing when you&#x27;re out and about.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely would.</li>
            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> and it works really well with the Argan oil shampoo and conditioner (also by crème of nature).</li>
            <li> It helps detangle and moisturize very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very conditioning.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, i cannot say enough!  </li>
            <li> its ok not very moisturizing also the bottle was used up in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE IS VERY AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li> I like the price point, not so much the smell, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> It works very well for my show dogs</li>
            <li> leaves hair nice an fluffy.</li>
            <li> This product is more for wavy hair than curly natural hair, but keeps my hair moisturized because it has the argan oil mixed in.</li>
            <li> : You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this bottle!</li>
            <li> Worked very well on my fine, dry hair.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times but it smells great and it made my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as a detangler, though it is really good at giving your hair a little daily moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but this really softened the new growth that I had</li>
            <li> I really like this new product</li>
            <li> so I was surprised especially since it&#x27;s often paired up with their sulfate free</li>
            <li> I have had locs for about 7 years and as they got longer and older I was getting some breakage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and hydrates my hair and tames frizz, but the scent has really gotten to me lately.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair out, and it leaves it super soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My natural hair absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used argan oil in different brands before and have always gotten very positive results.</li>
            <li> I feel like all it does is coat your hair with silicone or some other product to make it smooth.</li>
            <li> However, I still think I will be looking for a new Leave in Conditioner as my Liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of new growth</li>
            <li> My hair is super dry and damaged from highlighting and it just wasn&#x27;t that miracle worker I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I have very soft hair</li>
            <li> I use it on a daily basis, right before I comb my hair and find that it helps with tangles and always leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> So I bought this for the first time last year and used it every day until I ran out.</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed, so after I wash and deep conditioned, I applied this for the first time and the tangles were gone.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Went in a large expensive circle (thinking I would use new fancier products) and went right back around to home :)</li>
            <li> Then I use it however frequently</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t wash it every day, I don&#x27;t often use heat on it, and I like to try different leave in conditioners to really moisturize it, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> and it works wonders with my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this at walgreens and was surprised that it worked so well.</li>
            <li> This also makes my hair soft even when I use it to flatiron.</li>
            <li> It leaves my relaxed 4C hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> I use all organic and natural products</li>
            <li> Also I mist it on my curls to keep them soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I like this product; it doesn&#x27;t really wow me though.</li>
            <li> My daughter wears her hair natural and she has wavy hair, it works well for her.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner has my hair feeling really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> so let&#x27;s see how this works on natural hair...</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t cause buildup.</li>
            <li> use it in my relaxed hair and in my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would def buy again.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair feel as soft as cotton.</li>
            <li> I found a stylist to professionally do my relaxers every 2 months.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who want to have soft shiny hair</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Adds shine to your hair and makes hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I use for my hair vacation month to keep it moisturize, it make my hair feel soft and keep it in its braid while I keep my hair like this for 30 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are NO fly aways and my waves look so nice</li>
            <li> I am a fair haired woman with thin, dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> For instance carol&#x27;s daughter leave in is great but very expensive so my leave in conditioner hunt continues.</li>
            <li> and I use it faithfully before blow drying and prepping for flat ironing, for braid/twist outs, and to keep my real hair moisturized while wearing protective styles such as Senegalese twists, etc.</li>
            <li> This left my hair so soft and took the puffiness out of my roots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so tired of these companies changing ingredients thinking the customer won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the stores around where I live do not carry the same thing, so I was glad to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li> As an African American woman with natural hair,  I had been on the look out for a leave in conditioner that would not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> so simple, got rid of my dry looking hair, it feels super silky and soft without looking oily, greasy and icky.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally just a little dry at the ends with some split ends as well, and this really takes care of it.</li>
            <li> I have long relaxed 4a African American hair.  </li>
            <li> Normally when I wash my hair, I have a little hair in the comb when I comb through my hair using conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m going to blow out and flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought it on a whim at my local Dollar General Store for considerably less though.</li>
            <li> After I blow dry and flat Iron</li>
            <li> Spray it in, brush it over, even if the hair is long, then comb.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it once spraying it throughout my hair and combing through it with a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair, other than make it smell different.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this works.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my hair when dry too.</li>
            <li> It was leaving my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Can be sprayed on dry hair to add shine and body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In fairness, argan oil is the fourth ingredient, not way down on the list as with some argan oil products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put it on wet or dry, at any time of day.</li>
            <li> I use this product on wet and dry hair .</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crude title I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> But it may be because my hair is really damaged and broken off.</li>
            <li> My hair is not straight or wavy is something in between and my hair get frizzy a lot.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to slip on your bathroom floor after applying it.</li>
            <li> When sprayed on wet hair it makes comb through a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Big wide comb then small.</li>
            <li> I feel like which is about every other day.</li>
            <li> I struggle to get even coverage with other oils and conditioners, but not with this.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works on other styling methods</li>
            <li> I used this after washing my hair but my hair was so dry after it air dried.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and that could be the reason.</li>
            <li> On the days when I keep my hair down, I always use this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NO MORE DRY HAIR OR BRAKAGE.</li>
            <li> It is still somewhat weak but it does not look fragile anymore.  </li>
            <li> (I ran out of it), my hair began to break again however, not in little breaks as it did before use but longer hair strand breaks and fewer of them.</li>
            <li> use it nearly everyday for about two weeks after a dye job to replenish my hair and add shine and softness.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s too heavy.  </li>
            <li> keeps hair from getting to dried out between washes</li>
            <li> Also retains the smoothness after heavy exercise.  </li>
            <li> and it was hard to get my hair to lay down when I put my hair up for a ponytail or bun .</li>
            <li> My son and I have thick, course, tight, kinky hair.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow.</li>
            <li> It did however, leave a weird yellow residue whenever you ran your fingers through the hair or tried to comb it.  </li>
            <li> The coating is slick.  </li>
            <li> Within a month my hair changed from thick &amp; lustrous  to brittle and breaking all over my head.  </li>
            <li> I used this during my wash n go and by the time my hair completely dried I was annoyed by the residue.</li>
            <li> I had not experienced this type of problem before.</li>
            <li> Alone I never used it because it makes my hair feel weird.</li>
            <li> However, I must say that it leaves a weird clumpy yellowish residue on my ends.</li>
            <li> AND THE HUMIDITY IS SO BAD</li>
            <li> Like it drips to my face which I find annoying</li>
            <li> For some reason this product did not agree with my hair; it makes it awfully frizzy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So love this product!  This product smells good. Within a month my hair changed from thick &amp; lustrous  to brittle and breaking all over my head.  I had not experienced this type of problem before. I began using Creme of Nature with argan oil- Strength &amp; Shine Leave In Conditioner daily, and my hair is again looking strong within 4 weeks time.  It is still somewhat weak but it does not look fragile anymore.  After not using it for a week or two (I ran out of it), my hair began to break again however, not in little breaks as it did before use but longer hair strand breaks and fewer of them. I can appreciate the improvement, and I plan to continue to use this product.  I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice conditioner and I truly love just spraying it in on a daily basis, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Excelent product!!! give a extra shine for the hair! its amazing!!!!! my hair smeels so good when i use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crude title I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s for sure but this stuff is addictive! I am a fair haired woman with thin, dry and damaged hair. I should lay off the hair dye but I have the compulsion to change my hair color more often than is healthy for my tresses and this stuff is one of those needle in haystack finds.  I purchase it from Walmart and am never without.&lt;br /&gt;I use it nearly everyday for about two weeks after a dye job to replenish my hair and add shine and softness. Then I use it however frequently I feel like which is about every other day. I&#x27;ll put it on wet or dry, at any time of day. It smells delightful and I love it so much I don&#x27;t want to share it!! Everyone should buy this but leave enough for me.</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair.  Silicone are great for moisture retention.  Also has aran oil that holds moisture too.  Incredible shine.  Cheaper at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> My son and I have thick, course, tight, kinky hair.  Plus he is tender headed and this works well for him.  Not so many ouches when I have comb his hair.  Spray it in, brush it over, even if the hair is long, then comb.  Big wide comb then small.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I always do everything I can to keep my hair healthy, I don&#x27;t wash it every day, I don&#x27;t often use heat on it, and I like to try different leave in conditioners to really moisturize it, and this does the trick. My hair is naturally just a little dry at the ends with some split ends as well, and this really takes care of it. I love that it&#x27;s a spray - I struggle to get even coverage with other oils and conditioners, but not with this. I love it!</li>
            <li> My only issue with this product is the size of the bottle.  If I could buy it by the gallon I would. I do a spritz almost every day.  I use this along with oils and my steamer and it works wonders with my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li> I used this after washing my hair but my hair was so dry after it air dried. But it may be because my hair is really damaged and broken off. I didnt like it but I&#x27;m 3 months transitioning and it was hard to get my hair to lay down when I put my hair up for a ponytail or bun . I have a lot of waves at my roots so I spray this on my hair, with the exception of the hair that hangs out. I basically soak my hair with this brush it up like im putting it in a pony tail and tie a scarf around my head. There are NO fly aways and my waves look so nice</li>
            <li> So I bought this for the first time last year and used it every day until I ran out. I loved the product especially the smell and the way it made my hair feel. Went to replace the bottle recently and surprise, surprise the ingredients have changed! Instead of being 4th on the list of ingredients now argan oil is 7th! I&#x27;m so tired of these companies changing ingredients thinking the customer won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference. After using the product this time I still like the product but it does not moisturize like it did when there was more argan oil in the product. Even though it&#x27;s a great product for the price I think that there are better products out there especially for women of color with natural hair. For instance carol&#x27;s daughter leave in is great but very expensive so my leave in conditioner hunt continues. Happy conditioner hunting.</li>
            <li> My hair is not straight or wavy is something in between and my hair get frizzy a lot. I bought this at walgreens and was surprised that it worked so well. I love it</li>
            <li> This product is extremely awesome. I love the softness of my hair when I apply  this not to mention how deliteful the scent is .</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, smells great, and treats my transitioning (to natural) hair really well. I use it when I&#x27;m going to blow out and flat iron my hair and I dont feel the heat!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get nice twist outs, and though I wasn&#x27;t aiming for it this time. I had oil my hair and I just bought this and I sprayed it at the last minute and when I pulled it out my hair it was shiny and the twists were curly and nice. Couldn&#x27;t get that before, so I know this product had a lot to do with it. Love it</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results of this product based on the price. Worked very well on my fine, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I asked a stylist to recommend a great detangler that is healthy for my relaxed hair and does not have a lot of harsh chemicals in it, and she recommended this. I am so glad I asked! This is so great! There is no breakage or pulling when I comb through my hair when wet, and boy does this smell good! I use this on my hair when dry too. This also makes my hair soft even when I use it to flatiron. I highly recommend this product. I hope this is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> I feel like all it does is coat your hair with silicone or some other product to make it smooth. My hair is super dry and damaged from highlighting and it just wasn&#x27;t that miracle worker I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Light but does the job! My hair is so shiny and healthy! Very inexpensive for the value. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> My former stylist recommended this and the entire Creme of Nature. At the time, I was using Cantu. It was leaving my hair dry and brittle. I brought a bottle of this at my local beauty supply store. I started using it about six months ago in Dec./Jan.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this bottle! It leaves my relaxed 4C hair soft and shinny. It&#x27;s really helped it grow!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There are ALOT of silicones in it! I use all organic and natural products so I was surprised especially since it&#x27;s often paired up with their sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Since there are so many silicones in it, I will NOT be re-purchasing. But I did decide not waste product (which means I do kind of like it) and will use it until the end of the bottle. I did purchase their other leave-in (Perfect 7) which is a little bit more healthy and has a built in heat protectant.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love and swear by this stuff. It leaves your hair super moisturized and shiny. I love that it&#x27;s a spray bottle so it&#x27;s easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> Buyers should know that this leave-in is largely composed of silicones, so if you&#x27;re trying to avoid putting silicone in your hair, this may not be the right thing to buy. (No ingredients list is shown on the product page as I write this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, argan oil is the fourth ingredient, not way down on the list as with some argan oil products. It also contains hydrolyzed keratin and wheat protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very strong, though that may be the argan oil.</li>
            <li> This product is very runny. Be careful not to slip on your bathroom floor after applying it. I now pour it in my hand. Won&#x27;t buy again. Not as rich as others.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my daughter and she was happy with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this leave-in. Smells great. Its LIGHT. I use it in the summer to keep my scalp moisturized when I have braids. Also I mist it on my curls to keep them soft and shiny. This is good FOR ALL hair types! No greasy finish!</li>
            <li> I like this product; it doesn&#x27;t really wow me though. I use this as my liquid for the LOC method. Uhm its very runny lol. Like it drips to my face which I find annoying but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much. I don&#x27;t really like the way it makes my hair feel but I use this product with the LOC method and it makes my hair feels nice when I use my oil and cream. Alone I never used it because it makes my hair feel weird. I don&#x27;t know what to say for this product; I am a 4b to 4c hair texture with very dry hair and this product is helpful because it shows amazing results. However, I still think I will be looking for a new Leave in Conditioner as my Liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is a lot for the money and it smells nice and has a lot of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> great nutty smell. helps soften my hair and add nutrients.</li>
            <li> I have very soft hair so it&#x27;s too heavy.  My daughter wears her hair natural and she has wavy hair, it works well for her.</li>
            <li> this product smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love it!! Its light but moisturizes very well and the smell is great. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I really love the cream of nature argan oil line. I am African-American with type  4a hair. This leave in conditioner has my hair feeling really soft and shiny. I also use this with Argan  oil. So far it&#x27;s been pretty good. It smells really good and is lightweight. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> i love this product it makes my hair soft and manageable after washing and it also keeps some moisture in my hair so I&#x27;m all for that,it smells great and it&#x27;s inexpensive .</li>
            <li> I saw this product in a magazine and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It detangled as advertised but didn&#x27;t add any shine to my hair at all. It did however, leave a weird yellow residue whenever you ran your fingers through the hair or tried to comb it.  Very embarrassing when you&#x27;re out and about.  Looks like yellow dandruff.  I threw the bottle in garbage after a week.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as a detangler, though it is really good at giving your hair a little daily moisturizing. It may cause a little frizz, but has an excellent aroma. I use it as a finishing touch.</li>
            <li> I love it because it makes my hair very managable.  I would definately reccommend it to a friend. Love the mixture of the oil withthe coniditioner which helps soften the hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice... Helps my hair after washing... Just spray and brushing is much easier, smells good also</li>
            <li> I received this produce extremely quickly and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Only used it a few times but it smells great and it made my hair very soft and manageable.  Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am a stylist I recommend this all the time I love it on my relaxed hair I&#x27;m transitioning now so let&#x27;s see how this works on natural hair...</li>
            <li> Smells good - very light spray. You only need a little bit. I would suggest once or twice a week before wrapping or styling.</li>
            <li> I love this on my Senegalese twists. It makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used! It works wonders on my 4c afro textured hair. It makes detangling so easy, like a hot knife through butter! If I could I&#x27;d give it 10 stars I absolutely would.</li>
            <li> Great!  Use this as a moisturizer.  Hope they never change the formula!</li>
            <li> i have tried serums, gels, oils, olive oil, mayo treatments, etc etc etc...i looked around again at the local store and before i dropped $50 on another senseless product i went back to keeping it simple...found this, read the ingredients compared the list to all the rest, the price rocked, the scent was lovely and my hair is AMAZING. so simple, got rid of my dry looking hair, it feels super silky and soft without looking oily, greasy and icky.  I am buying this for all my nieces and mom.  For $7 you should give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years now and I really like it</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft, which is nice, but then it won&#x27;t take a curl very well.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the curliest hair and this is the best product I know of to comb through her curls. This product is great. It smells lovely and does so a great job on her hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this thing. It is okay, I think it works well. But the shampoo is the best! make sure you buy that one too.</li>
            <li> For some reason this product did not agree with my hair; it makes it awfully frizzy. I have used argan oil in different brands before and have always gotten very positive results. This product was different. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> leaves hair nice an fluffy. I have curly hair, and it keeps it looking natural and nice.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of new growth and I need to go back and get a relaxer but this really softened the new growth that I had and it works really well with the Argan oil shampoo and conditioner (also by crème of nature). I have only used it once spraying it throughout my hair and combing through it with a wide tooth comb and immediately it made dentangling my relaxed hair very easy and it added shine (I used it before I did a rollerset).</li>
            <li> Creme of nature argan line just love this line of products for my hair i will be buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Nice product and inexpensive for a superior detangler</li>
            <li> This is great for my dreadlocks.  I have had locs for about 7 years and as they got longer and older I was getting some breakage. The Creme of Nature conditioner actually stopped it!  It&#x27;s easy to apply because it&#x27;s a spray.  It smells so good.  It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t cause buildup.</li>
            <li> Great product! It helps detangle and moisturize very well.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my relaxed hair and in my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would def buy again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter after she really loved how it made her hair feel and look. This is the 3rd bottle and I will be buying more as she uses them up.</li>
            <li> love this leave in conditioner. it makes it soo soft, manageable and it smells amazing. will by more in the future.</li>
            <li> Very conditioning. Helps keeps my hair shiny before blow drying it.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in gives my hair a healthy natural shine. I am natural with 4a hair and i love it and it has a great vanilla smell to it as well</li>
            <li> great product! keeps hair from getting to dried out between washes</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff and I love the smell. It also makes my hair feel as soft as cotton.</li>
            <li> Love, love this stuff for my natural tresses.  The smell is awesome too.  I bought it on a whim at my local Dollar General Store for considerably less though. I love using it even when my hair is dry for moisture and sheen.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair. Normally when I wash my hair, I have a little hair in the comb when I comb through my hair using conditioner. Well since I have been using this product, there has been no hair Left in the comb. I really like this new product and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Love the whole line for my relaxed hair. My mom used these products on me when I was younger. Went in a large expensive circle (thinking I would use new fancier products) and went right back around to home :) I love how the bottle sprays evenly and the smell.</li>
            <li> I have long relaxed 4a African American hair.  This product is amazing!  When sprayed on wet hair it makes comb through a breeze.  After I blow dry and flat Iron the hair is smooth like glass and retains the hold overnight.  I have been able to extend the time between relaxers by months.  Also retains the smoothness after heavy exercise.  Fantastic product, i cannot say enough!  Can be sprayed on dry hair to add shine and body.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used! It does not dry my hair out, and it leaves it super soft! My hair is relaxed, so after I wash and deep conditioned, I applied this for the first time and the tangles were gone. Thanks to my mom for recommending!</li>
            <li> I have good hair that&#x27;s been mismanaged for years. I found a stylist to professionally do my relaxers every 2 months. In between, I do my own maintenance. My stylist stressed the importance of conditioners and that you can never over condition your hair. I found this product and used it nightly before tying up my hair. With proper weekly washing and nightly maintenance, my hair has never looked better! I spray a good coat on at night and by morning, my hair is soft and silky. It&#x27;s growing pretty fast as well! I don&#x27;t recommend the hair wrap foam from the argan line, but this 2n1 conditioner is worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Does not leave hair as shiny as promised on label. Great comb out conditioner though.</li>
            <li> its ok not very moisturizing also the bottle was used up in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does exactly what it says it does. Will definitely continue to use</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Have been using for over a year (I have very curly hair) and it smells and works great!</li>
            <li> I originally found and bought this item while on vacation, and immediately fell in love with it. Unfortunately the stores around where I live do not carry the same thing, so I was glad to find it on amazon. I use it on a daily basis, right before I comb my hair and find that it helps with tangles and always leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! It leaves my hair shiny and smells so good! This is definitely one of my staple products.</li>
            <li> A VERY GOOD PRODUCT, IT MAKES ME HAIR VERY MANAGEABLE. I DID SHARE THE EXPERIENCE WITH MY FRIENDS. AND THE PRICE IS VERY AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li> After receiving a sample of this product, I ordered another and am now on my third bottle. On the days when I keep my hair down, I always use this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for my hair !</li>
            <li> This formula didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair but made it tangle up. I have thick coarse hair and that could be the reason.</li>
            <li> My natural hair absolutely loves this stuff. It leaves my hair so soft. Argan oil?! We all know us naturals love argan oil.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Leaves my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> This item works well in my hair and it smells good. I recommend this to everyone who want to have soft shiny hair</li>
            <li> I really love this. It worked perfectly on my natural hair. I am black and my hair is natural has to be done and this product is perfect. If you want to see how i use the product watch my youtube video and subscribe, if you have any question ask me on the comment section [...]</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Once after washing and conditioning hair, this stuff is the perfect as a detangler. Love love love and will buy the family of this product soon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for my grand daughters dry curly hair.  She uses it daily and we both love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Creme of Nature is a fantastic leave in conditioner.  The Argan oil gives my hair a brilliant shine and protects it from heat damage.  As an African American woman with natural hair,  I had been on the look out for a leave in conditioner that would not dry my hair out. Creme of Nature does the trick and I love the light aroma on top of the other benefits it provides.  Great product for natural hair!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have APL relaxed hair and I use it faithfully before blow drying and prepping for flat ironing, for braid/twist outs, and to keep my real hair moisturized while wearing protective styles such as Senegalese twists, etc.It&#x27;s not too heavy and has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> My Stylist uses this product on my hair, and I Love it and would recommend it to anyone to use</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair, other than make it smell different.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been using this to seal my twists and it&#x27;s worked wonderfully. My twistouts have been more defined than they&#x27;d been all winter so i definitely consider it a must-have during this season. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make my hair FEEL moisturized-but i do believe it is helping with moisture retention despite the feel. Finally, what solidifies this as a 5 star product is the fact that my twists remain defined and untangled all day and even through the next day. Can&#x27;t beat a product that allows me to rock 1 twist out for more multiple days.</li>
            <li> This leave-in is amazing .🙌🏿😊 Its a great detangler , its smells soo good , and its a great moisturizer. I use this product on wet and dry hair . I haven&#x27;t had an issue with build up with this product. This product has helped me retain length tremendously, without this I probably would&#x27;ve combed all of my hair hair out . I cant imagine doing my hair without it.😂 Thank you CON!</li>
            <li> This products works great and smells good. Adds shine to your hair and makes hair extremely soft. Also works as a heat protectant. Go get this product.</li>
            <li> Great leaven conditioner. Smells nice and works really well. It also helps me use less shampoo, which is a great thing when your shampoo costs a lot. Would recommend it to friends and family. I tried the shampoo and conditioner and wasn&#x27;t at all happy. They made my hair frizzy and smelled like grocery store hair dye.</li>
            <li> This product is more for wavy hair than curly natural hair, but keeps my hair moisturized because it has the argan oil mixed in. I like the price point, not so much the smell, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> Smells like vanilla extract!  I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel; no tangles, fairly soft hair (I dye and bleach and butcher my hair relentlessly so it will never be perfect)  Bought a second bottle when my first one ran out, which I rarely do with beauty products!</li>
            <li> my friend gave this to me and it literally is the best. it leaves an amazing smell</li>
            <li> It works very well for my show dogs</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT I GIVE AN A+. I AM OVER HERE IN KUWAIT AND THE HUMIDITY IS SO BAD USING THIS PRODUCT I HAVE NO MORE DRY HAIR OR BRAKAGE. I USED IT EVERY MORNING AS A LEAVE IN CONDITION HAIR IS GREAT!</li>
            <li> this not only works well with my dry frizzy hair, it also smells good..  it makes my hair looks and feels healthy</li>
            <li> Love it, this is my 3rd bottle of the conditioner, it does not leave your hair greasy looking or yuck feeling ....wish I could find it locally ....</li>
            <li> Just started using this product, and it is awesome, My hair is soft, smells great and feels and looks healthier. I am hispanic but I am brown skin and have hair texture similar to actress Thandie Newton and this product works great. I&#x27;ve been searching for a leave in that adds body, manageability, and shine...this is it, I definitely recommend this product. I thought that this product would be oily and it isnt oily at all.</li>
            <li> This is my go to leave in conditioner. It is light weight with a great scent!</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, sets in well with no yucky residue. Keeps frizz away and leaves my hair soft, loved it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. Spray it on your hair while it is still damp and it helps retain moisture. It smells great too. :)</li>
            <li> Have used this product before.  It is a good product.  Shipping was a little slow.</li>
            <li> Great detangler and conditioner.  I have very long hair and this works.  No split ends and my hair shines :-)</li>
            <li> Awesome!! It instantly stopped my Afro kinky coily Textured hair breakage!  Wow! OMG! I Love it!!!! It has silicones(which is not necessarily bad). Not all silicones are created equal. This silicone product keeps moisture in the hair, which we like. It seals the hair after washing and conditioning moisture has been applied.  The coating is slick.  So, it makes the hair easier to comb and smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I use for my hair vacation month to keep it moisturize, it make my hair feel soft and keep it in its braid while I keep my hair like this for 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes recommend it</li>
            <li> I strongly dislike the smell of this product. Way too strong of a scent for me.</li>
            <li> I use this as my protein leave in conditioner and it works great; it gives my hair moisture even though it is a proteijbbased product. I also love the smell of it. I like to use it when I been using. a lot of moisture based products or after I relax my hair.</li>
            <li> This product did leave my hair with shine. However, I must say that it leaves a weird clumpy yellowish residue on my ends. I used this during my wash n go and by the time my hair completely dried I was annoyed by the residue. I was so embarrassed and people noticed at work. I wouldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again to wash it out. Maybe it works on other styling methods but I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used, and considering my vanity cabinet looks like its own beauty supply store I know what I am talking about.  This left my hair so soft and took the puffiness out of my roots.  I have 2a hair type, but my neice;s hair is 3c and I used this on her hair and it did wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> this had a nice smell and wasn&#x27;t oily, i would recommend it to to other people, try it for yourself</li>
            <li> I like this leave-in. I use it as a detangler because it provides a good amount of slip and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hair. I use it whenever I wrap my hair at night and before adding my moisturizer on freshly washed hair to protect against breakage and it&#x27;s been working well. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a moisturizer, however, it&#x27;s way to light weight for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and hydrates my hair and tames frizz, but the scent has really gotten to me lately. It isn&#x27;t pleasant anymore. Kind of smells moldy/musky now to me.</li>
            <li> I have caucasian hair. My hair is very dry and damaged. This spray works awesome, does not weigh my hair down at all, and it&#x27;s a fine mist which I like, and makes my hair soooo soft.</li>
