            <li>It must really be popular.</li>
            <li>Shampoo smells great, provides some shine, and most importantly, does a great job of thickening fine hair.  </li>

            <li>The Ojon line is excellent - the entire brand.  </li>
            <li>I love their conditioners and restoring products as well.</li>
            <li>I love these products for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Clearly this is a good merchant whom we will be buying from for many years to come</li>
            <li>I alternate using this with Alterna Bamboo Abundant Volume Shampoo and am having good results.</li>
            <li>I have semi fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is full, but fine, shoulder-length</li>
            <li>The packaging as well as the smell and texture of the shampoo was fake/not original.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey though but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>This did not do anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li>New bottle is much better.  </li>
            <li>I like the volume it gives my fine hair, but it is very drying &amp; has no moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But, I feel that this particular one is nothing special.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using this item.</li>
            <li>It was well packed and exactly as I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>and it really adds volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>It really does thicken my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was blown away by how fast it got to me.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo I received was not the real thing.</li>
            <li>and it really does give me volume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products that were cheaper than this product and gave me better results.</li>
            <li>;i have tried so many other shampoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li>And you only need a little for a good lather.  </li>
            <li>It gives it body and makes it a little more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for shampoo/conditioner that makes my hair feel full and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>My hair always looks shiny ,feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have thin, color-treated light blonde hair and this shampoo leaves my hair looking and feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>THIS LEAVES YOUR HAIR FEELING SOFT AND SMELLING</li>
            <li>I have tried many like-minded products, but have sometimes encountered heavy products that create flat hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because it is actually adding volume or because it rinses clean and my hair isn&#x27;t left with a residue that adds weight.</li>
            <li>love this shampoo and it&#x27;s very hard to find!</li>

            <li> love this shampoo and it&#x27;s very hard to find!</li>
            <li> I swear this, with the use of the conditioner keeps my hair from turning grey and I&#x27;m 72, with few grey hairs.</li>
            <li> It is harder to keep hair silky and shiny when 50+ years, Ojon helps me with this.</li>
            <li> , little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ojon conditioner, like all conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, does not thicken hair at all but does control dryness a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Ojon products (moisturizing shampoos and oil) in the past</li>
            <li> and I have just a little bend, no curl.</li>
            <li> I have crazy fine thin hair</li>
            <li> now it does give volume, however after a while it will dry the hair and the scalp will start to itch, you would think for 26 bucks and for the small amount you pay for the shampoo would deliver more, years ago the company had ojon thickening shampoo and the base was actually a thicker shampoo substance, but because of marketing and savings, the company changed it to volumizing and the texture of the shampoo is not as thick as it once was, too bad they changed the shampoo because they just lost a buyer</li>
            <li> It might seem expensive but a bottle last way over a yr for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted the shampoo as I have used it in the past from another supplier.</li>
            <li> Almost stopped buying this shampoo because of poor bottle design - took forever to get shampoo out.  </li>
            <li> Nothing works as well to remove oil without stripping, and add volume to my thin colored hair.  </li>

            <li> This Shampoo works great. It does not take a lot of shampoo to lather up your hair and it cleans so well. One bottle lasts forever</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it really adds volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  It really does thicken my hair.  I just wish I could find it locally but the store keeps running out of Ojon supplies.  It must really be popular.</li>
            <li> I love this great-smelling shampoo. I have thin, color-treated light blonde hair and this shampoo leaves my hair looking and feeling soft and smooth. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using this item. I used Ojon but a different one. I like this product</li>
            <li> Almost stopped buying this shampoo because of poor bottle design - took forever to get shampoo out.  New bottle is much better.  Shampoo smells great, provides some shine, and most importantly, does a great job of thickening fine hair.  Love it.  FYI, Ojon conditioner, like all conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, does not thicken hair at all but does control dryness a little.</li>
            <li> My go-to shampoo.  Tried to use a less-expensive one, and came back to this.  Nothing works as well to remove oil without stripping, and add volume to my thin colored hair.  It smells great too.  And you only need a little for a good lather.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years and love the way my hair feels and looks when using it. It also smells great!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for shampoo/conditioner that makes my hair feel full and soft at the same time. This along with the conditioner and the volumizing thickening mousse is the best combination I have used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone with the same hair type as me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife.  She bought some a year ago and just loves the stuff.  I was blown away by how fast it got to me.  It was well packed and exactly as I hoped it would be.  Clearly this is a good merchant whom we will be buying from for many years to come</li>
            <li> Love Ojon products.  I have been using them for several years now and my hair is in great condition as a result.  Would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I love these products for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo ever. THIS LEAVES YOUR HAIR FEELING SOFT AND SMELLING GREAT.SCALP FEEL GREAT ALSO. SO GO OUT AND BUY IT TODAY AT AMAZON.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great on my thinning hair.  It gives it body and makes it a little more manageable.  It is also a healthier choice because it does not have any harmful ingredients in it.  For me, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and it&#x27;s very hard to find! It might seem expensive but a bottle last way over a yr for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My hair always looks shiny ,feels very soft.  I have used this product for years with great results.</li>
            <li> The shampoo I received was not the real thing. The packaging as well as the smell and texture of the shampoo was fake/not original.</li>
            <li> Used Ojon for years; it&#x27;s always been the best. I just wonder the reason for the amazing price hike on a 32 oz. bottle. Can&#x27;t afford that any longer :c/</li>
            <li> This Ojon shampoo is not the same as the Ojon collection. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> 10 year user and have healthy hair, little goes a long way. Great smell.  I swear this, with the use of the conditioner keeps my hair from turning grey and I&#x27;m 72, with few grey hairs.</li>
            <li> Love Love this shampoo...I have semi fine hair and it really does give me volume.  Receive compliments always....</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo for people who are looking for a good volumizer. It is a bit pricey though but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that were cheaper than this product and gave me better results. This did not do anything special for my hair. I should factor in my hair texture (course). I&#x27;ve tried other Ojon products (moisturizing shampoos and oil) in the past and I think they were terrific. But, I feel that this particular one is nothing special.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful &#x27;i always use Ojon all the time and i think it is one of the best out there ;i have tried so many other shampoo&#x27;s but i always come back for Ojon the smell is very light and it cleans the hair perfect ;i think Ojon is the best .&lt;br /&gt;If they ever discontinue this i don&#x27;t no wat i will do .</li>
            <li> now it does give volume, however after a while it will dry the hair and the scalp will start to itch, you would think for 26 bucks and for the small amount you pay for the shampoo would deliver more, years ago the company had ojon thickening shampoo and the base was actually a thicker shampoo substance, but because of marketing and savings, the company changed it to volumizing and the texture of the shampoo is not as thick as it once was, too bad they changed the shampoo because they just lost a buyer</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo</li>
            <li> I did not expect this shampoo in concentrated form.  I wanted the shampoo as I have used it in the past from another supplier.</li>
            <li> Have been using tis shampoo for several years, do not ever want to be with out it or any of the&lt;br /&gt;OJon products. I am always complimented on my hair as it always looks good.</li>
            <li> I have crazy fine thin hair and I started using this shampoo a while ago. I&#x27;ve had several people ask me if my hair has gotten thicker since I&#x27;ve started using this! It works great.</li>
            <li> I have tried many like-minded products, but have sometimes encountered heavy products that create flat hair.  My hair is full, but fine, shoulder-length and I have just a little bend, no curl. The Ojon line is excellent - the entire brand.  The shampoo cleans, but for me does not damage or lift color.  I love their conditioners and restoring products as well. It is harder to keep hair silky and shiny when 50+ years, Ojon helps me with this.</li>
            <li> I like the volume it gives my fine hair, but it is very drying &amp; has no moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo with a pleasant light scent.  It does seem to give my hair a bit of a boost and I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because it is actually adding volume or because it rinses clean and my hair isn&#x27;t left with a residue that adds weight. I alternate using this with Alterna Bamboo Abundant Volume Shampoo and am having good results.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this helps relieve the itching</li>
            <li> husband loves this stuff</li>
