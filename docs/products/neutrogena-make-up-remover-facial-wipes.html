            <li>I love these things and the price here was good too.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling and has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li>These cloths take off stubborn eye makeup very easily.</li>
            <li>The best advantage is that they are convenient for travel, no messy oils or lotions to deal with.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best wipes on the market!</li>
            <li>Removes even the most waterproof mascara CLEAN! !</li>
            <li>My favorite make-up wipes that will take off even the most stubborn make-up.</li>
            <li>Great on my sensitive skin and effective.</li>
            <li>Removes most of the permanent makeup</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.  </li>
            <li>Love these towels they are so convenient and  take off make in a snap.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>Am I ever pleased that I did.</li>
            <li>The four pack is about a twenty percent savings over most drug/department store prices for this product.</li>
            <li>Love them and woukd reccomend them to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>But I love them.  </li>
            <li>They sure save the washcloth washing.</li>
            <li>I love this make up removing wipes.  </li>
            <li>and I still love them.  </li>
            <li>Oh and compared to the price I paid for that to get the blue box - this multipack is a great value!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as it is also a great value.</li>
            <li>Love how it has minimal scent :D</li>
            <li>so being able to purchase them in bulk is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>I take my eye makeup off with something else, but these are great for removing face makeup - and they leave my skin so soft</li>
            <li>To be precise, they don&#x27;t remove eye makeup which is what we all want, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I thought that this package was pretty good deal with free shipping.</li>
            <li>They take off a full face of makeup including eye makeup leaving no residue to wash off!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena wipes removed all of the makeup easily.</li>
            <li>The four pack makes it easy to always have some on hand</li>
            <li>Easy to take anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Have been looking for a make up removing wipe that is easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Just so easy</li>
            <li>Love this product and this is such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is way too strong for ones face.  </li>
            <li>The best go to for clean glowing skin, minus any irritation.  </li>
            <li>I follow it up with a quick spritz of witch hazel and whichever moisturizer I&#x27;m into and, voila!</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin, with a nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I bought a cheaper kind of makeup remover wipes, and every time I used it my eyes would burn so much.</li>
            <li>makeup comes up easily and face feels clean.  </li>
            <li>Nice gentle smell.</li>
            <li>Shipper got it to me ASAP - fantastic all around experience.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you have a good seal otherwise, the towels tend to dry out.  </li>
            <li>Great after long flight to freshen up.</li>
            <li>Leave my face clean</li>
            <li>Leaves my face clean and that&#x27;s what I want from a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>My face feels really clean and there is no need to rinse after using them.</li>
            <li>Also, buying in bulk from Amazon is much more cost effective than getting from the local store.</li>
            <li>By far the best I have used personally.</li>
            <li>Love these so much.  </li>
            <li>I use them daily and found they are also good for my skin.</li>
            <li>The wipes are very convenient  to use (travel nicely) and they take my makeup off easily and leave my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It removes all make-up quickly and leaves my skin with a luminous glow.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes them quick and easy. .  </li>
            <li>These are easy to use and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked these wipes as they typically get most of my make-up off.</li>
            <li>I hate to give these a great review at the risk of them becoming even more popular.  </li>
            <li>These Cleansing Towelettes are the best because they remove any and all kinds of makeup, even the serious waterproof mascara very easily without having to put any pressure or pulling on your skin while moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>I do keep mine in the little blue box, so these refills fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are sturdy but not too heavy and my skin feels great afterward - no oily residue or burning sensations that alcohol based cleansers give you.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING - my skin is actually improved after using it even though it&#x27;s just a make-up remover.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>Removes waterproof mascara easily - leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li>sensitive baby wipes work better for me.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li>Anyone looking for an easy way to remove makeup without drying out your skin and feeling soft and smooth afterwards need to try these, I am glad I found them on Amazon which is a big savings also compared to CVS.</li>
            <li>This remover wipes it right off.  </li>
            <li>I have discovered that if I place the package in the holder with the opening down, the top layer stays more damp than they are when placing the package right-side-up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s very perfumed, and lingers for a while after use.</li>
            <li>texture of the towelettes is very fine but enough to give some exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>They come super fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, highly recommended for people with sensitive skin and who like all of their make-up removed before bed and who hates washing their face before bed! :-)</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t you need to wash your face in a shower first then</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re incredibly gentle and leave my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use one wipe for everything, making sure I get all my face and eye makeup off, then follow up with a hot washcloth on my face for about 10-20 seconds to open the pores a bit and wipe any remaining goop off.  </li>
            <li>and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
            <li>I have lately developed very sensitive skin on my cheeks (allergies, we suspect), and these don&#x27;t burn or cause more issues.</li>
            <li>Clean, soft face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these, but they were extremely dry when I first opened them.</li>
            <li>These have been my favorite make up remover wipes for as long as they&#x27;ve made them.  </li>
            <li>I love these because they&#x27;re not soaking wet.</li>
            <li>No scent, not greasy, no irritation &amp; comes off amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>And they work really well at getting a of your makeup off.</li>
            <li>They are so moist and can really get off waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also gentle on eyes; I wear contacts and I never feel irritated when using these.</li>
            <li>They really do remove all makeup;</li>
            <li>thing is that this is just a box with four refill packs - you have to either already have or buy the light blue plastic container that the packs sit in and helps keep them moist.</li>
            <li>Bought them to clean off stage make-up after performances and in most instances only 1 to 2 clothes were needed as they are thick and strong.  </li>
            <li>Only one cloth is needed to clean off all makeup as they are large cloths.&lt;br /&gt;Removes mascara, liquid eyeliner, lipstick etc.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other wipes and liquid makeup removers.  </li>
            <li>Non greasy soft cloths leave skin clean but not tight, slippery or oily.  </li>
            <li>I use them every night even if I haven&#x27;t put on any make-up to clean off my face, neck and upper chest.  </li>
            <li>though these wipes are moist, I give them a quick dip under the running faucet and gentle squeeze to distribute the extra liquid.  </li>
            <li>Cannot live without these makeup removal gems!  </li>
            <li>There are more expensive cleansers on the market, so I have tried samples from time to time; but they don&#x27;t do a better job.</li>
            <li>I can remove all of my make up with a single wipe, including water proof mascara, and wether I am wearing light every day make up or &amp;#34;clubbing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So I can save a little more.  </li>
            <li>The material of the cloth gently exfoliates as well and leaves skin soft and prepped for nightly routine.</li>
            <li>- think they&#x27;re called &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; - did not like them any where near as much as these.</li>
            <li>Skin feels rejuvenated and fresh for the next morning&#x27;s makeup.</li>
            <li>Been using for several years and the product really gets the eye makeup off very well, recommended!</li>
            <li>I know that is strange, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>As long as Neutrogena keeps making this product with no changes, they will have a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li>After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t add anything new to all the reviews here -</li>
            <li>Love these little gems!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but I can use this product on my face without a problem.</li>
            <li>The only wipes I will ever use because they are so gentle on skin!</li>
            <li>but after ordering, I found the exact same product and quantity for cheaper at Costco.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to pay the higher price at the big box store!</li>
            <li>; this is a great product I would (and have) recommend to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am not sure how long this deal will last</li>
            <li>These towelettes are a good size, large enough and thick enough to do your whole face as well as extra attention to the eyes.</li>
            <li>The cloth is large enough to remove face &amp; eye makeup and leaves your face feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And, though this may sound gross, sometimes I save my lightly-use wipes, wet them again and re-use.  </li>
            <li>This way I do not have to either wet them more or scrub harder because it is not so</li>
            <li>They are fairly soft so non-irritating on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>use the towelettes then a soft scrub</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and eyes, but these don&#x27;t irritate either.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>It both, gives me a migraine and burns my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend these wipes to those with sensitive skin;</li>
            <li>These cleansing towelettes remove your make-up but leave your skin feeling moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>The ones I used before were super wet and just kind of weird.</li>
            <li>I went to the local pharmacy and bought a single one with the light blue plastic box and now put each pack in that</li>
            <li>I prefer them to be a little more wet when I start using them.  </li>
            <li>No worries, though, because my skin feels soft and supple the next morning.  </li>
            <li>So much neater than splashing soap and water all around at night when I&#x27;m tired and just want quick face clean-up before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>I find I don&#x27;t have to rub as much with these as I had to with the other ones.</li>
            <li>I use this every night and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>And on days that I wear a little more eye make up, no more than 3 wipes will do the job.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> These cloths take off stubborn eye makeup very easily.</li>
            <li> The best advantage is that they are convenient for travel, no messy oils or lotions to deal with.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best wipes on the market!</li>
            <li> Removes even the most waterproof mascara CLEAN! !</li>
            <li> My favorite make-up wipes that will take off even the most stubborn make-up.</li>
            <li> Great on my sensitive skin and effective.</li>
            <li> Removes most of the permanent makeup</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.  </li>
            <li> Love these towels they are so convenient and  take off make in a snap.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent.  </li>
            <li> Am I ever pleased that I did.</li>
            <li> The four pack is about a twenty percent savings over most drug/department store prices for this product.</li>
            <li> Love them and woukd reccomend them to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> But I love them.  </li>
            <li> They sure save the washcloth washing.</li>
            <li> I love this make up removing wipes.  </li>
            <li> and I still love them.  </li>
            <li> Oh and compared to the price I paid for that to get the blue box - this multipack is a great value!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as it is also a great value.</li>
            <li> Love how it has minimal scent :D</li>
            <li> so being able to purchase them in bulk is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> I take my eye makeup off with something else, but these are great for removing face makeup - and they leave my skin so soft</li>
            <li> To be precise, they don&#x27;t remove eye makeup which is what we all want, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I thought that this package was pretty good deal with free shipping.</li>
            <li> They take off a full face of makeup including eye makeup leaving no residue to wash off!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena wipes removed all of the makeup easily.</li>
            <li> The four pack makes it easy to always have some on hand</li>
            <li> Easy to take anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Have been looking for a make up removing wipe that is easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Just so easy</li>
            <li> Love this product and this is such a great deal.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is way too strong for ones face.  </li>
            <li> The best go to for clean glowing skin, minus any irritation.  </li>
            <li> I follow it up with a quick spritz of witch hazel and whichever moisturizer I&#x27;m into and, voila!</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin, with a nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper kind of makeup remover wipes, and every time I used it my eyes would burn so much.</li>
            <li> makeup comes up easily and face feels clean.  </li>
            <li> Nice gentle smell.</li>
            <li> Shipper got it to me ASAP - fantastic all around experience.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you have a good seal otherwise, the towels tend to dry out.  </li>
            <li> Great after long flight to freshen up.</li>
            <li> Leave my face clean</li>
            <li> Leaves my face clean and that&#x27;s what I want from a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> My face feels really clean and there is no need to rinse after using them.</li>
            <li> Also, buying in bulk from Amazon is much more cost effective than getting from the local store.</li>
            <li> By far the best I have used personally.</li>
            <li> Love these so much.  </li>
            <li> I use them daily and found they are also good for my skin.</li>
            <li> The wipes are very convenient  to use (travel nicely) and they take my makeup off easily and leave my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It removes all make-up quickly and leaves my skin with a luminous glow.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes them quick and easy. .  </li>
            <li> These are easy to use and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked these wipes as they typically get most of my make-up off.</li>
            <li> I hate to give these a great review at the risk of them becoming even more popular.  </li>
            <li> These Cleansing Towelettes are the best because they remove any and all kinds of makeup, even the serious waterproof mascara very easily without having to put any pressure or pulling on your skin while moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> I do keep mine in the little blue box, so these refills fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are sturdy but not too heavy and my skin feels great afterward - no oily residue or burning sensations that alcohol based cleansers give you.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING - my skin is actually improved after using it even though it&#x27;s just a make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth the money</li>
            <li> Removes waterproof mascara easily - leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> sensitive baby wipes work better for me.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li> Anyone looking for an easy way to remove makeup without drying out your skin and feeling soft and smooth afterwards need to try these, I am glad I found them on Amazon which is a big savings also compared to CVS.</li>
            <li> This remover wipes it right off.  </li>
            <li> I have discovered that if I place the package in the holder with the opening down, the top layer stays more damp than they are when placing the package right-side-up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s very perfumed, and lingers for a while after use.</li>
            <li> texture of the towelettes is very fine but enough to give some exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> They come super fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, highly recommended for people with sensitive skin and who like all of their make-up removed before bed and who hates washing their face before bed! :-)</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t you need to wash your face in a shower first then</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re incredibly gentle and leave my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I use one wipe for everything, making sure I get all my face and eye makeup off, then follow up with a hot washcloth on my face for about 10-20 seconds to open the pores a bit and wipe any remaining goop off.  </li>
            <li> and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
            <li> I have lately developed very sensitive skin on my cheeks (allergies, we suspect), and these don&#x27;t burn or cause more issues.</li>
            <li> Clean, soft face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these, but they were extremely dry when I first opened them.</li>
            <li> These have been my favorite make up remover wipes for as long as they&#x27;ve made them.  </li>
            <li> I love these because they&#x27;re not soaking wet.</li>
            <li> No scent, not greasy, no irritation &amp; comes off amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> And they work really well at getting a of your makeup off.</li>
            <li> They are so moist and can really get off waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also gentle on eyes; I wear contacts and I never feel irritated when using these.</li>
            <li> They really do remove all makeup;</li>
            <li> thing is that this is just a box with four refill packs - you have to either already have or buy the light blue plastic container that the packs sit in and helps keep them moist.</li>
            <li> Bought them to clean off stage make-up after performances and in most instances only 1 to 2 clothes were needed as they are thick and strong.  </li>
            <li> Only one cloth is needed to clean off all makeup as they are large cloths.&lt;br /&gt;Removes mascara, liquid eyeliner, lipstick etc.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other wipes and liquid makeup removers.  </li>
            <li> Non greasy soft cloths leave skin clean but not tight, slippery or oily.  </li>
            <li> I use them every night even if I haven&#x27;t put on any make-up to clean off my face, neck and upper chest.  </li>
            <li> though these wipes are moist, I give them a quick dip under the running faucet and gentle squeeze to distribute the extra liquid.  </li>
            <li> Cannot live without these makeup removal gems!  </li>
            <li> There are more expensive cleansers on the market, so I have tried samples from time to time; but they don&#x27;t do a better job.</li>
            <li> I can remove all of my make up with a single wipe, including water proof mascara, and wether I am wearing light every day make up or &amp;#34;clubbing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So I can save a little more.  </li>
            <li> The material of the cloth gently exfoliates as well and leaves skin soft and prepped for nightly routine.</li>
            <li> - think they&#x27;re called &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; - did not like them any where near as much as these.</li>
            <li> Skin feels rejuvenated and fresh for the next morning&#x27;s makeup.</li>
            <li> Been using for several years and the product really gets the eye makeup off very well, recommended!</li>
            <li> I know that is strange, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> As long as Neutrogena keeps making this product with no changes, they will have a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li> After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t add anything new to all the reviews here -</li>
            <li> Love these little gems!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but I can use this product on my face without a problem.</li>
            <li> The only wipes I will ever use because they are so gentle on skin!</li>
            <li> but after ordering, I found the exact same product and quantity for cheaper at Costco.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to pay the higher price at the big box store!</li>
            <li> ; this is a great product I would (and have) recommend to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am not sure how long this deal will last</li>
            <li> These towelettes are a good size, large enough and thick enough to do your whole face as well as extra attention to the eyes.</li>
            <li> The cloth is large enough to remove face &amp; eye makeup and leaves your face feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And, though this may sound gross, sometimes I save my lightly-use wipes, wet them again and re-use.  </li>
            <li> This way I do not have to either wet them more or scrub harder because it is not so</li>
            <li> They are fairly soft so non-irritating on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> use the towelettes then a soft scrub</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and eyes, but these don&#x27;t irritate either.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> It both, gives me a migraine and burns my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend these wipes to those with sensitive skin;</li>
            <li> These cleansing towelettes remove your make-up but leave your skin feeling moist and soft.  </li>
            <li> The ones I used before were super wet and just kind of weird.</li>
            <li> I went to the local pharmacy and bought a single one with the light blue plastic box and now put each pack in that</li>
            <li> I prefer them to be a little more wet when I start using them.  </li>
            <li> No worries, though, because my skin feels soft and supple the next morning.  </li>
            <li> So much neater than splashing soap and water all around at night when I&#x27;m tired and just want quick face clean-up before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> I find I don&#x27;t have to rub as much with these as I had to with the other ones.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> And on days that I wear a little more eye make up, no more than 3 wipes will do the job.  </li>
            <li> I use them because in contrast with other facial cleansers they do not burn my sensitive eyes when I remove my makeup.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sad to admit that is pretty much every day for me -</li>
            <li> Had a hard time getting off the mascara but was most likely because I didn&#x27;t like wiping too hard around the lid area.  </li>
            <li> Each pack has a foil over the opening that you can reseal, but it only stays sticky so long.</li>
            <li> makeup, I only need a single wipe.  </li>
            <li> Found these when I was postpartum for the first time and too exhausted and short on time to think about washing my face at night.</li>
            <li> Doesnt dry out her skin either.</li>
            <li> Not greasy but don&#x27;t over dry skin.</li>
            <li> I did have some dry skin around my eyes at the time as well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just enough wetness to remove the makeup and it doesn&#x27;t run all down my face.</li>
            <li> do wish they came in half sizes, they work so well that you dont need an entire sheet</li>
            <li> but they are inexpensive online and get the job done when I&#x27;m too lazy to purchase more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Because, using these everyday without extra cleansing will eventually lead to clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these facial wipes for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing to my skin, and they do the job when you are too tired to cleanse your face with water and other products.  </li>
            <li> all day lipsticks with a minimal amount of rubbing, so no chapped lips!</li>
            <li> yet I still have no outbreaks or dirty pores! :)</li>
            <li> I wear UD&#x27;s 24/7 liner which is usually pretty difficult to get off, but these worked like a dream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up daily, so usually one wipe will work</li>
            <li> Had used other products before.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that some of the packets seem to have less lotion than others and the cloths are a little dry.</li>
            <li> quite expensive but work really well</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, EXTRA sensitive eyes, and hate overly fragranced items - and have no issues.</li>
            <li> and I pay a lot less than I would at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> They get the job done, but I think they are just a little bit harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it for travel but use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Removes stubborn waterproof mascara with just a few swipes, does not irritate eyes or the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> one negative comment is that even if keep these in the plastic holder - I have to wet them.</li>
            <li> With a few wipes the makeup is gone.</li>
            <li> I used these everyday to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the residue these wipes leave on my face...</li>
            <li> I usually rinse with water afterwards and that is all.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always hard to take my make up off.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I wipe, I always find clunks of mascara, so I also wash my face after using this and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> And by this I mean in the morning, when I am putting make-up on, if I make a mistake, I re-wet an unused part of the wipe and use that.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin and these are non irritating for me.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and when I used this it stung my eyelids like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> I wear Mac stain lipstick which is virtual impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to go to the store to purchase one package.</li>

            <li> I bought a cheaper kind of makeup remover wipes, and every time I used it my eyes would burn so much. I love these because they&#x27;re not soaking wet. There&#x27;s just enough wetness to remove the makeup and it doesn&#x27;t run all down my face. The ones I used before were super wet and just kind of weird. I find I don&#x27;t have to rub as much with these as I had to with the other ones. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> i chose 5 stars,  cuz it does it;s job.  makeup comes up easily and face feels clean.  well worth the money</li>
            <li> I have tried several different towelette products.  This one is the best.  It removes all make-up quickly and leaves my skin with a luminous glow.  I bought it for travel but use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - works every time - stocking up so I never run out!  Removes even the most waterproof mascara CLEAN! !</li>
            <li> These towelettes are a good size, large enough and thick enough to do your whole face as well as extra attention to the eyes. They are fairly soft so non-irritating on sensitive skin. Removes stubborn waterproof mascara with just a few swipes, does not irritate eyes or the surrounding skin. Works great on removing lip stains/liners/all day lipsticks with a minimal amount of rubbing, so no chapped lips! The best advantage is that they are convenient for travel, no messy oils or lotions to deal with. I keep a pack in my travel bag and have never had an issue with them drying out. As long as Neutrogena keeps making this product with no changes, they will have a loyal customer for life. Would I recommend? Absolutely!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s very perfumed, and lingers for a while after use. I prefer something that just does the job and doesn&#x27;t hang around afterward!</li>
            <li> The only makeup wipes to take ALL of my makeup off. The only wipes I will ever use because they are so gentle on skin!</li>
            <li> Best mak-up remover wipes. Love how it has minimal scent :D</li>
            <li> These are my HG makeup remover wipes.  That said, I only use them for my eyes because they make my skin greasy.  I use waterproof mascara so it&#x27;s always hard to take my make up off.  one negative comment is that even if keep these in the plastic holder - I have to wet them.</li>

            <li> These are by far the best wipes on the market!</li>
            <li> It good and removing all the makeup but it burn the eyes once you try to remove your mascara</li>
            <li> My favorite make-up wipes that will take off even the most stubborn make-up.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes them quick and easy. .  Helps her acne by keeping her pours clearer.  Doesnt dry out her skin either.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but I can use this product on my face without a problem. It is soothing and cleansing.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I use this every night and does not dry out my skin. Thank-you!</li>
            <li> these are tested on animals!  that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li> the product is as advertised. but after ordering, I found the exact same product and quantity for cheaper at Costco.</li>
            <li> No scent, not greasy, no irritation &amp; comes off amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I love it!  The wipes are very convenient  to use (travel nicely) and they take my makeup off easily and leave my skin soft and moisturized.  I won&#x27;t be without them!</li>
            <li> I keep these in my gym bag, vanity and car.  The best go to for clean glowing skin, minus any irritation.  Neutrogena wipes surpass others in size, quality and nourishment to pores.</li>
            <li> Great on my sensitive skin and effective.</li>
            <li> A great value. And they work really well at getting a of your makeup off.</li>
            <li> I have used these for awhile now. They are excellent for removing make-up, however if you want to clean your face also, you must use two or cleanse it afterwards. Because, using these everyday without extra cleansing will eventually lead to clogged pores.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and the best price that I have found for these wipes.  My two teenage daughters go through these like nothing so being able to purchase them in bulk is a huge plus.  Having them on the &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; is an even bigger plus.  They come super fast and I don&#x27;t have to pay the higher price at the big box store!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves these to help take off her make up.</li>
            <li> I thought when I got these towelettes my makeup would come off all the way but it doesn&#x27;t you need to wash your face in a shower first then use the towelettes then a soft scrub sorry but I don&#x27;t know if I will purshase this item again</li>
            <li> Removes most of the permanent makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these facial wipes for a few years.  I use them because in contrast with other facial cleansers they do not burn my sensitive eyes when I remove my makeup.  Plus they do a great job of getting my makeup off.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.  My only complaint is that some of the packets seem to have less lotion than others and the cloths are a little dry.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and gentle on the skin.  Neutrogena wipes removed all of the makeup easily.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I wear UD&#x27;s 24/7 liner which is usually pretty difficult to get off, but these worked like a dream. It gets every bit of makeup off of your face with ease. I have sensitive skin and eyes, but these don&#x27;t irritate either. I will definitely be purchasing these again when I run out. Great deal too.</li>
            <li> These are one of my favorites. They do a superb job at taking off even water-proof makeup - eyeliner (any color), mascara, even eyelash glue.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I&#x27;m saving that for the night-time makeup removers from Nutrogena.</li>
            <li> Found these when I was postpartum for the first time and too exhausted and short on time to think about washing my face at night. They are almost as good as cleanser and water and I never leave home for a trip without them. Great after long flight to freshen up. Not greasy but don&#x27;t over dry skin. Love these!</li>
            <li> good product and good price</li>
            <li> Love these! Leave my face clean</li>
            <li> Love these towels they are so convenient and  take off make in a snap.</li>
            <li> I love these - have used for years! I do keep mine in the little blue box, so these refills fit perfectly. When I travel, I just pack what I need in a Ziplock. They are so moist and can really get off waterproof mascara. Love them! I have sensitive skin, EXTRA sensitive eyes, and hate overly fragranced items - and have no issues.</li>
            <li> these are the best make up removing wipes I have used. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up daily, so usually one wipe will work but on occasion I use two just to be its all off.  And on days that I wear a little more eye make up, no more than 3 wipes will do the job.  The material of the cloth gently exfoliates as well and leaves skin soft and prepped for nightly routine.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  I wear Mac stain lipstick which is virtual impossible to remove.  This remover wipes it right off.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is now the only makeup remover I use. Removes face and eye makeup without any oily residue. Nice gentle smell. Leaves my face clean and that&#x27;s what I want from a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> quite expensive but work really well</li>
            <li> My niece requested these as part of her Christmas gift and she is VERY pleased with them.  She says they work wonderfully and clean make-up off the face without drying out the skin or making it oily.  She would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Love these. Use them every night to take off my makeup. I used to buy the MAC wipes but then I came across these and loved the scent and the price. They&#x27;re incredibly gentle and leave my skin feeling fresh. They&#x27;re also gentle on eyes; I wear contacts and I never feel irritated when using these.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other wipes and liquid makeup removers.  Nothing even comes close to the quality of these.  They really do remove all makeup; even waterproof mascara.  Nice light scent.  My face feels really clean and there is no need to rinse after using them.</li>
            <li> Great make up wipes. Exactly as described. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Work great!! No complaints.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the reviews of others so I had to reciprocate with a review of my own. This product worked beautifully for me. I was hesitant to order because I was unsure it would remove stubborn waterproof mascara but based on the excellent reviews I did make the purchase. Am I ever pleased that I did. These wipes do not leave my face feeling greasy, they remove all my makeup and they actually seem to be improving the texture of my skin. Additionally I learned they won a Best of Beauty award from \\&quot;Allure\\&quot; magazine in 2011. No wonder; this is a great product I would (and have) recommend to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am not sure how long this deal will last but I went to the Costco in Chino Hills CA 3/8/13 and got 125 towelettes and bonus vanity for $14.99. Was I ever happy. Great deal.</li>
            <li> Best makeup remover ever! A must have ladies. Skin feels rejuvenated and fresh for the next morning&#x27;s makeup. A great price too!</li>
            <li> These are the only make up removal wipes that I have found that take off the majority of my eye make up in one swipe.  Gentle on skin, with a nice light fragrance.  Also, buying in bulk from Amazon is much more cost effective than getting from the local store.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without these makeup removal gems!  Also great for cleaning puppy paws and ears!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Products for over 20 years and I&#x27;ve tried every makeup remover on the market. These Cleansing Towelettes are the best because they remove any and all kinds of makeup, even the serious waterproof mascara very easily without having to put any pressure or pulling on your skin while moisturizing at the same time. The four pack is about a twenty percent savings over most drug/department store prices for this product. Was ordered, shipped and received in 36 hours!</li>
            <li> I love these make up removing wipes!  The cloth is large enough to remove face &amp; eye makeup and leaves your face feeling refreshed.  I would definitely recommend them.  The only dislike is that the package does not stay sealed once it&#x27;s opened.  You have to make sure you have a good seal otherwise, the towels tend to dry out.  I&#x27;ve had to use tape to reseal the package which is not to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Same reason for using this.  Reliable name and a good price.  I will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This pack is a really great value! I make sure to always keep stocked up on these as they are the best! They get all make-up off without leaving any oily residue or burning my eyes. The four pack makes it easy to always have some on hand and I pay a lot less than I would at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I adore these! They take off a full face of makeup including eye makeup leaving no residue to wash off! I have never had iritation from these and keep them in stock at my house at all times! Love them and woukd reccomend them to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they came in half sizes, they work so well that you dont need an entire sheet</li>
            <li> Great for eye make up remover...it does not hurt the eyes and it does remove the make up and I have use this product for 3 years and no complaints.</li>
            <li> These do not remove makeup as advertised.  To be precise, they don&#x27;t remove eye makeup which is what we all want, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> The best, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly.  Been using for several years and the product really gets the eye makeup off very well, recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the residue these wipes leave on my face... but they are inexpensive online and get the job done when I&#x27;m too lazy to purchase more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Removes waterproof mascara easily - leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out. They don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  Easy to take anywhere.  I love these and this is a great price!  I will order more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered the ones in the purple package  - think they&#x27;re called &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; - did not like them any where near as much as these.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, gentle cleansing product.  Only one cloth is needed to clean off all makeup as they are large cloths.&lt;br /&gt;Removes mascara, liquid eyeliner, lipstick etc. Non greasy soft cloths leave skin clean but not tight, slippery or oily.  I highly recommend this product as it is also a great value.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a make up removing wipe that is easy on the skin.  THis one nails it out of the park.  Removes and cleanses at the same time.  Hightly recommend</li>
            <li> Anyone looking for an easy way to remove makeup without drying out your skin and feeling soft and smooth afterwards need to try these, I am glad I found them on Amazon which is a big savings also compared to CVS.</li>
            <li> Had used other products before. By far the best I have used personally.</li>
            <li> I hate to give these a great review at the risk of them becoming even more popular.  The price just keeps going up!  But I love them.  I&#x27;m an addict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though these wipes are moist, I give them a quick dip under the running faucet and gentle squeeze to distribute the extra liquid.  I prefer them to be a little more wet when I start using them.  I use one wipe for everything, making sure I get all my face and eye makeup off, then follow up with a hot washcloth on my face for about 10-20 seconds to open the pores a bit and wipe any remaining goop off.  I follow it up with a quick spritz of witch hazel and whichever moisturizer I&#x27;m into and, voila! Clean, soft face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the towelettes is very fine but enough to give some exfoliation.  Love these little gems!</li>
            <li> I love these, but they were extremely dry when I first opened them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and these are the ones for me.</li>
            <li> Removes all my makeup, and the smell is good. I like how i dont have to rub at my eyes or face to remove my makeup. With a few wipes the makeup is gone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to do without these.  So convenient work so well for removing all kinds of makeup and mascara.  I have delicate skin and these are non irritating for me.  So much neater than splashing soap and water all around at night when I&#x27;m tired and just want quick face clean-up before bedtime.  I take them with me when I travel.  They sure save the washcloth washing.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena Make up Removing Wipes! It is so convenient and I use it daily. I thought that this package was pretty good deal with free shipping. Just wiping my face I can remove all my eye make-up. Just so easy and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this make up removing wipes.  I have been using them for 2 years now and I still love them.  I can remove all of my make up with a single wipe, including water proof mascara, and wether I am wearing light every day make up or &amp;#34;clubbing&amp;#34; makeup, I only need a single wipe.  I usually rinse with water afterwards and that is all.  I totally recommend these wipes!</li>
            <li> Love these so much.  The only way to go for makeup removal.  Every friend who has borrowed one of these from me has become hooked.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is way too strong for ones face.  It both, gives me a migraine and burns my sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s stronger than my perfume!  The cloth is also scratchy.  I would not recommend these wipes to those with sensitive skin; NOR, those prone to eczema or migraines.  Pampers sensitive baby wipes work better for me.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the commercials. I thought a towelette would be easier than using several cotton balls. I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and when I used this it stung my eyelids like crazy!!! I did have some dry skin around my eyes at the time as well. After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin). It works great and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
            <li> These are great towelettes for the price. I used these everyday to remove my makeup. They get the job done, but I think they are just a little bit harsh on my skin. Nothing some moisturizer can&#x27;t handle!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t add anything new to all the reviews here - this is a great make up remover product, just pull out a wipe and remove your makeup. It couldn&#x27;t be easier. The towelettes are sturdy but not too heavy and my skin feels great afterward - no oily residue or burning sensations that alcohol based cleansers give you. Neutrogena has always made great products and I&#x27;ve been using them for decades, so when I saw that they made makeup remover, I knew it would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is that this is just a box with four refill packs - you have to either already have or buy the light blue plastic container that the packs sit in and helps keep them moist. Each pack has a foil over the opening that you can reseal, but it only stays sticky so long. I went to the local pharmacy and bought a single one with the light blue plastic box and now put each pack in that and they stay nice and moist. Oh and compared to the price I paid for that to get the blue box - this multipack is a great value!</li>
            <li> I love these things and the price here was good too.</li>
            <li> These are so good. They do a perfect job removing makeup. I use them daily and found they are also good for my skin. These cloths take off stubborn eye makeup very easily. I will always have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> These cleansing towelettes remove your make-up but leave your skin feeling moist and soft.  I use them every night even if I haven&#x27;t put on any make-up to clean off my face, neck and upper chest.  They are perfect for travelers too.  There is no chance of liquid leaking in your suitcase.  I have been using this product for years.  There are more expensive cleansers on the market, so I have tried samples from time to time; but they don&#x27;t do a better job.</li>
            <li> And this box helps to cover myself and my two teenage daughters who now wear make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, though this may sound gross, sometimes I save my lightly-use wipes, wet them again and re-use.  So I can save a little more.  And by this I mean in the morning, when I am putting make-up on, if I make a mistake, I re-wet an unused part of the wipe and use that. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These remove all of my make-up with no problems.  I have discovered that if I place the package in the holder with the opening down, the top layer stays more damp than they are when placing the package right-side-up.  This way I do not have to either wet them more or scrub harder because it is not so damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, highly recommended for people with sensitive skin and who like all of their make-up removed before bed and who hates washing their face before bed! :-)</li>
            <li> Great product does the job.</li>
            <li> Love this product and this is such a great deal.  I hate having to go to the store to purchase one package. Its so convenient.  Product arrived on time and in good condition.  Will purchase this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked these wipes as they typically get most of my make-up off. I wear Mac studio fix and it takes about 2 wipes to wipe off. My eye make-up is a different story. No matter how hard I wipe, I always find clunks of mascara, so I also wash my face after using this and it seems to be working. For the price, I think it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING - my skin is actually improved after using it even though it&#x27;s just a make-up remover. I know that is strange, but it&#x27;s true.  Shipper got it to me ASAP - fantastic all around experience.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST makeup wipes ever.</li>
            <li> A great way to wipe away make-up at the end of the day.  Bought them to clean off stage make-up after performances and in most instances only 1 to 2 clothes were needed as they are thick and strong.  Had a hard time getting off the mascara but was most likely because I didn&#x27;t like wiping too hard around the lid area.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling and has a nice aroma.</li>
