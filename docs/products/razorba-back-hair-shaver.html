            <li>What an amazing invention !</li>
            <li>Non-slip handle is so nice to use in the shower!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compatible with some of the popular razors that can be found at almost every store, which is a plus!</li>
            <li>Once you figure it out, it works, and that&#x27;s what matters.  :-P</li>
            <li>The Razorba is easy to use and has awesome results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use once you get used to reversing what you see in the mirror!</li>
            <li>Good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wife is good with it.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the electic version tho.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good idea, but not in my husbands case.  </li>
            <li>its a perfect fit</li>
            <li>I think this works really good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product idea.  </li>
            <li>The concept of the Razorba is good but they seem to have forgot or ignored those of us who are taller (</li>
            <li>Seemed like a good idea and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a good device</li>
            <li>Do not understand where all of the good reviews came from.</li>
            <li>Good size and handling.</li>
            <li>surprisingly sturdy.  </li>
            <li>product is quite good.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job, no issues.</li>
            <li>It is easier to use with a razor that does not have a pivoting head like a Gillette Good News.</li>
            <li>Good angle he said and works well.</li>
            <li>It takes me 3 days in a row to do a good job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>Life is so much more beautiful</li>
            <li>This is a very ingenious product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for backs as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad someone came up with the idea and a great product.</li>
            <li>Great seller communication &amp; follow up too :)</li>
            <li>i am very glad i made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It sure beat&#x27;s using a paint stick with razor duct taped to the end!</li>
            <li>and then... MAGIC!  </li>
            <li>Works best if you use an electric trimmer first.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>If you first use, the product &amp;#34;MANGROOMER Sku 211-6 Professional&amp;#34; then this product finialise the job to a perfect result.</li>
            <li>Great design and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works great and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to do it myself!  </li>
            <li>I bought this from the amazing reviews I had read on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing how it stayed in&lt;br /&gt;securely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you, it felt really nice.  </li>
            <li>You have to attach your own razor.</li>
            <li>You could make your own with a yardstick and duct tape - it would work just as well and save you 30 bucks</li>
            <li>Good idea, but a flexible handle would have made more sense.    </li>
            <li>It does not require batteries and you can use your own blades / shavers with it.</li>
            <li>Works best with straight handle razor.</li>
            <li>the Sport Razor, its a good design and a better choice.</li>
            <li>For the money I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s engineered all that well to be honest.</li>
            <li>taking control of their own body hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>very time saving and a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for skinny guys with no muscle, but if you are a muscular man like me, you will not find this product effective.</li>
            <li>Nice product, will work with any mans disposable razor.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the Razorba suprised me when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>Nice to get neck</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a fresh razor for best results</li>
            <li>Because one supplies his own razor, each shave can be as close as you wish.  </li>
            <li>Effective product.</li>
            <li>Nice item for the money.</li>
            <li>and it is very easy and effective.  </li>
            <li>Works great came quickly and all I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>works fine with gillette good news</li>
            <li>I made my own version of this with a steel pipe and could make another if I wanted to, but this design is ergonomically perfect for the job and holds a thin handled razor perfectly (I use a Mach 3 disposable).  </li>
            <li>So far I have achieved the best results using a gel type shaving cream in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Get a good razor that will fit your model and shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Works great and the price is definitely right.</li>
            <li>It worked great right from the start.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and even helpful for shaving areas like tops of shoulders, too!  </li>
            <li>Now I can take car of this myself easily!</li>
            <li>I love this thing very strong</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as described</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described, works great, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Great invention that gets the job done and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Great product, does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Great item, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It works just fine with my Gillette Fusion and Pro-Glide razors!</li>
            <li>Once I placed a razor in the holder, it is very secure and doesn&#x27;t shift or get out of control.</li>
            <li>Quick and good product</li>
            <li>The Razorbak relies on the handle of the razor fitting into a rubber tube to hold it in place.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>But if you keep at it you will get better.</li>
            <li>I found this one for $20 on Amazon but most places sell them for a lot more.</li>
            <li>This works much better.  :)</li>
            <li>I love this and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Make sure use a grease razor</li>
            <li>But know more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get the rest off with a razor.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I was hitting anything, but when I was done, the hair was gone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it 5 more times just to make sure.</li>
            <li>Each time I get better.  </li>
            <li>One of the reviewers guessed that the old/cheaper version would also work with most razors so</li>
            <li>I thought it was better than what it is.may be  </li>
            <li>i need more instruction on it since I didn&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li>After use be sure to remove razor if not it can streach out the insert sleve</li>
            <li>The seller is great and shipping was very</li>
            <li>Was able to hit the pool with out feeling self conscience.</li>
            <li>With some practice I&#x27;ve been able to use it, but it would have worked a lot better for me if the razor was at a steeper angle and closer to being inline with the handle.  </li>
            <li>And glad I did.</li>
            <li>Maxim reviews gave it top marks as the best product for back shaving.</li>
            <li>He loves it and that is all that matters to me :)</li>
            <li>Very simple product, works great!</li>
            <li>Great product, saves me so much time.</li>
            <li>He loves it and has relieved my sister from the work :)</li>
            <li>This back shaver is awesome.</li>
            <li>However, when I actually put the razor in there and used it, it was perfect!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the most flexible guy</li>
            <li>You would be better off taping a disposable razor to a dowel and using it instead.</li>
            <li>Also, would be better if you put a non slip grip like some of the fancy womans disposable blades a silicone of some type.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product that helped me shave the unwanted hair on my back by myself</li>
            <li>I like this product so much better than the electric foil type groomer I had.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I repeat, NOTHING works better than the Razorba Shaver.</li>
            <li>I have seen hairier than I, but mostly in zoos.</li>
            <li>Just have to be sure to hold it correctly, and use a mirror.</li>
            <li>works as described and will work with most disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Sport Razor is more nimble with much better tactile feel</li>
            <li>This thing is top quality.  </li>
            <li>Women love</li>
            <li>I find the Mag Groomer much more convenient and easier to use.</li>
            <li>Love this device.  </li>
            <li>The reason you want to do that is cause the Venus blades have more surface area</li>
            <li>A butter knife and some packaging tape worked better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many times.</li>
            <li>This would have been better had one end of the handle</li>
            <li>I found that I got better results going under my arm rather than over my head.    </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Much better than this Razorba.</li>
            <li>She wanted to be able to shave legs -</li>
            <li>Took a bit of getting used to but then did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>The razor fits in the grip well and doesn&#x27;t move around (make sure that you are getting the correct one for your razor).  </li>
            <li>I like most about the product is the heft that it has.  </li>
            <li>And having some heft to the product allows you to be more confident with it as you know that it&#x27;s not going to flex on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I can see getting many years of use out it.</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>The Razorba is an interesting product.  </li>
            <li>Works well, better if you use it more often (like every two weeks).  </li>
            <li>I could not be more satisfied with the design and function.</li>
            <li>While in the shower, I just get some good soap suds going and do my best to get some on my back, then glance over at my shaving mirror on wall to ensure I&#x27;m on the right path.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten one myself yet, but can see that it&#x27;s very useful!  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, you get a really nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li>USING MY OWN RAZOR GIVES ME A CLEAN, PAINLESS SHAVE.</li>
            <li>It will help you look nice and clean for the ladies.</li>
            <li>Within the tube is a rubber sleeve that you stuff the handle of your razor into and it is supposed to hold the razor in place and position it for a clean effective shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality product that works great.</li>
            <li>Seems to not be able to get the right angle to get everything as I just seems to be able to get the blade to angle right to shave every thing still good to use and my fiancé even uses to shave her legs comes in handy if ya don&#x27;t wanna have to bend over or take a bath or whatever.</li>
            <li>I am in pretty good shape</li>
            <li>This is a good product that does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Very easy and straightforward in using.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to shave more often if you want to.</li>
            <li>I use it with the generic Target brand disposable razors which are compatible as they fit perfectly and it&#x27;s a winner all the way around every time.</li>
            <li>This is the most incredible tool for shaving your back!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 different disposable razors with it and the handles fit snuggly and perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and does a good job if razor is new.</li>
            <li>After the first use I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>The razor holder is \\&quot;universal\\&quot;, however it tends to hold razors with slimmer handles more securely.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, its working great.  </li>
            <li>Better than the clippers because you get close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Deceptively simple, but incredibly well engineered and constructed.</li>
            <li>Tip: get the disposable razors that have a square handle not rounded, they seem to fit better.</li>
            <li>Will fit most disposable and non- disposable razors including the Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s really really rediculosuly good looking.</li>
            <li>Very overpriced but still works good.</li>
            <li>good quality product, holds a disposable razor very well..takes a bit to get use too but works well...</li>
            <li>Very easy and quick to shave</li>
            <li>Reaches all over easily.</li>
            <li>Does the job, fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>&quot; makes the task easy.</li>
            <li>Then insert it in the Rezorba and easily shave where you couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>The Razorba works great for maneuvering around the back more easily and now I don&#x27;t have to be self-conscious anymore when I take off my shirt.  </li>
            <li>This got all the hair off and is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have used some body groomers and shavers, but they did not have the reach that allowed me to do the job easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and speedy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and it saves my wife the delight of using the weed-whacker in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>is easily removed the Razorba.</li>
            <li>Easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I think it would be easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li>When I use this, I use the Aquasentials Easy Lotion Applicator  from Amazon with baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It works for me: easy to attach disposable/non-disposable razor (tried both), easy to shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I used the recommended Gillette Mach 3 razor, along with the Aquasentials Easy Lotion Applicator, and Edge Body Renew Face &amp; Body Shave Cream.</li>
            <li>You can easily use disposable razors for this though.</li>
            <li>Get this Razorba, a can of decent shaving gel, and a good mirror, and go to town.</li>
            <li>But after about ten minutes of fudging with it, I felt I had a pretty good handle and control of the Shaver and was able to hit all the areas and feel when the razor was making good contact.</li>
            <li>I am using a Schick ST2 razor which fits fine in the product.  </li>
            <li>The packing was overkill but fine...  </li>
            <li>But, any razor with a roundish handle will work fine.  </li>
            <li>and they work fine.  </li>
            <li>Works Great, Easy to Use, Fits all my Razors (Different Gillette Razors)</li>
            <li>I can now easily shave my own back and love that I don&#x27;t need to ask for help any more.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to perfect it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the shaver and can highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>beforehand is a huge help.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband, who has always tried to keep himself neat and fit.</li>
            <li>You will need to put some type of tape around razor handle to make it fit</li>
            <li>handle securely but not tear up the plastic tube.  </li>
            <li>, I ordered the cheap version and guess what?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used razorba products since I saw the back shaver on the Rachael Ray Show where it got great reviews from the panel</li>
            <li>It works best with razors with round handles like a Gillette Excel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s worth the price, but it does work.</li>
            <li>GREAT LOW TECH ITEM.</li>
            <li>With the Razorba, I can do it myself and maintain a hair free back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>problem with the razorba is that not all razor handles fit their product securely or some not at all.</li>
            <li>And you get the razor smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the widest most powerful and highest quality of the electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Any razor handle will fit in the end .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy using it now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also... if you go with this use a Mach 3 razor with a Venus Divine blade (The Venus Divine blades fit on the Mach 3 razor, but the Venus Divine razor doesn&#x27;t fit in the Razorba).</li>
            <li>I looked at several others and am happy I went with this one.  </li>
            <li>You really have to work and bend and flex to use it effectively, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and effective</li>
            <li>Razor fit snugly so no problem there.</li>
            <li>I found you MUST use a slim handle razor to fit in the end.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic...</li>
            <li>Holds disposable razors securely.  </li>
            <li>Some razors don&#x27;t fit in handle.</li>
            <li>Also didnt have a problem finding razors that fit.</li>
            <li>A 5 blade Fusion Pro Glide fit snugly into the handles holder.</li>
            <li>Proud its american made.  </li>
            <li>Piece of cake, smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>Nice to hold your razor and shave your own back.</li>
            <li>This is far superior.  </li>
            <li>I like the razorba because i am now able to shave my back fairly well without the help of my wife.  </li>
            <li>After that, it&#x27;s pretty fast and easy to get a good shave with.  </li>
            <li>Clean and silky smooth results.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok - does not hold most of the new razors.  </li>
            <li>I was originally concerned that it would be hard/clumsy to use.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to get the hair off leaving my back nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and seems to be even better quality than I thought.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much more effective at shaving my back now than it was before without it.</li>
            <li>Very handy for women who have had hip surgery and need a long handle for leg shaving.</li>
            <li>So what special razor works with this thing?</li>
            <li>It works with the razor and blades you already use for your face, so there&#x27;s no need to keep buying separate special blades for this.</li>
            <li>Still not a bad purchase though specially for the price</li>
            <li>But there really isn&#x27;t anything else that works any better.</li>
            <li>With every stroke of the razor, sweet satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure how this is actually getting good reviews though.</li>
            <li>It is ergonomically designed, my Bic double blade razors fit well, and I am most pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>best part is saving many an argument with your significant other about PLEASE shaving your back again!!!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s much easier to get a better shave on each pass.</li>
            <li>And it doesnt have a good angle to truly help for bigger guys.</li>
            <li>Good reach and angle for the back.</li>
            <li>It has a taken a while to get used to it, but I can manage to shave all of my back with it and a good mirror.</li>
            <li>F*****g sweet.</li>
            <li>You really have to have a full length mirror to help you see and kind of bend your arms in a way they don&#x27;t normally go, but overall a great product.</li>
            <li>strong construction, not flimsy / helps w/ those tough to reach areas/ great product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended if you don&#x27;t have someone to shave your back for you, which is a lot more fun!  :-)</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not expensive either.</li>
            <li>My back looks smooth, and it is all thanks to this amazing product!</li>
            <li>no problem -- older and/or inactive people will probably have a longer adjustment period or find the device may just not be able to work for them.</li>
            <li>Shipped Quick</li>
            <li>The best product for the purpose of personal back shaving ever.</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;re buying a gift or just want the best rechargeable back shaver then look no further than [[ASIN:B0055T3CCO</li>
            <li>Gets the job done quick, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s that need to be reached, but luckily the Razorba does the trick.</li>
            <li>Also, because of it&#x27;s length, I had to use it from the top, bottom, and side of the back to get most of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quick and was as promised in the description.</li>
            <li>But overall and with practice I am very glad I purchased this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months now and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>My husband requested this back shaver and he is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It&lt;br /&gt;is comfortable and easy to use, and it fits pretty much any razor, so you can use what ever one you prefer.  </li>
            <li>Its easy and fast to use and can be done just  before the pool or beach.</li>
            <li>easy to use, very well made.</li>
            <li>I think this is a pretty good product overall.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>and you have a great power razor,no need to mess with cheep razors...</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you want it to do!  </li>
            <li>You need to jam it in there good, because a loose razor won&#x27;t perform well.    </li>
            <li>It has a comfortable handle that has a good length and angle to easily access the hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice but is nice to be able to shave without help.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great idea that badly needs some refining to make it also a great product.</li>
            <li>So, I can see how this product would work great for you if you happened to use a razor with a narrow grip.</li>
            <li>Since there are no competing products for this that I know of, they can charge $30 for a piece of (heavy duty) plastic and you&#x27;ll be happy about it.    </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t fit the razor very well.  </li>
            <li>over the years I think shaving my own back without assistance has taken a toll on my shoulders</li>
            <li>It seems to me that we get ripped-off badly enough without the need for a company that sells an item that likely costs them all of $2-3 to manufacture and then sell them for $30 and then, on top of this, they try to scam us into paying more than 2 times for an already overpriced product because they make us believe that the cheap version will not accomodate the newer blade handles!</li>
            <li>It makes shaving your own back one of the easiest tasks.</li>
            <li>Is it fun?</li>
            <li>it came in really handy for him because he had rotator cuff surgery and couldn&#x27;t shave his back.</li>
            <li>Nice not having to ask spouse to help with back.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an incredible amount of back hair but enough that I wanted to do something about it.  </li>
            <li>Great old fashioned American quality product.  </li>
            <li>get the hang of it, but it is really worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>works great, better than expected, just need to do your back in front of a mirror.</li>
            <li>It really is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Good in theory, but not very practical.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>While I would hesitate to call this device inexpensive, it&#x27;s worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Must be adept at using the mirror to keep from razor burning the back.  </li>
            <li>looking at it online, you wonder if it&#x27;s really worth the price.  </li>
            <li>After receiving it and using it, I would say yes, it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Not bad for my first time.</li>
            <li>Once you get your technique down, it really does a exceptional job!    </li>
            <li>I purchased one originally it worked well enough that I bought two more for my sons.</li>
            <li>I can shave my back easily in the shower and maintenance is easy.</li>
            <li>fast delivery, nothing against the online store that sold it, but it doesn&#x27;t work and cut my back up pretty good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly, you have to wedge it in there as tight as you can, but it still comes loose.</li>
            <li>This way it&#x27;s always at the right position and will shave a lot closer then the electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>The angle is right, the grip is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>It took a bit of learning to figure out how to get all the right angle.</li>
            <li>Designed with the right curves and angles.</li>
            <li>Very easy to reach all areas of my back with the Razorba.</li>
            <li>Given that my back hair is so fine, I don&#x27;t see myself needing to do this much more than once a week, if that, but it works REALLY</li>
            <li>The tube holds on to the cheap &amp;#34;Good News&amp;#34; disposable razors that I use for normal shaving...</li>
            <li>It works easily, standard inexpensive disposable razors fit it fine.  </li>
            <li>caveat - if you&#x27;re very hairy (as I was) you&#x27;ll probably want someone to do your first clean shave for you, and then use the Razorba to maintain after that point.</li>
            <li>Maybe really hairy guys would have to use shaving cream, but they&#x27;d probably be shaving everywhere, so trying to target a certain area wouldn&#x27;t be as important to them.    </li>
            <li>BUT, i think it should be curved a little more, or even better make it so that the device is like a &amp;#34;gooseneck&amp;#34; and is bendable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the blue basic model for years and it works great, with a couple of modifications I made.  </li>
            <li>Go ahead and get the Mangroomer if you want a good shave in less time.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy tool, worthy of being sold in the Home Depot tool department.  </li>
            <li>This one accepts many different types of razor handles so you can always use a fresh blade.  </li>
            <li>and they both fit inside very well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Simple, effective, works very well.</li>
            <li>The angle is great for those hard-to-reach spots in the middle of the back.  </li>
            <li>With this tRazorba tool my back is always clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>(2) the idea of putting shaving cream on the wall of the shower and rubbing your back on that was perfect for the one spot I couldn&#x27;t reach, but now I just use that method for my entire back.  </li>
            <li>If you nick yourself you won&#x27;t be able to reach back there to blot.  </li>
            <li>A real winner for us carpet-backs!</li>
            <li>At first, that seemed too cautious.  </li>
            <li>After my first use I was ecstatic.  </li>
            <li>THANKS RAZORBA.!</li>
            <li>I at first tried one of the eclectic kinds and the arm wouldn&#x27;t stay locked in place.  </li>
            <li>Before I got this item, you should&#x27;ve seen what I used at first.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first product to actually, consistently get the job</li>
            <li>Xtreme3 Sensitive razor fit</li>
            <li>This interesting product reached the back areas for shaving but you must have a degree of dexterity.</li>
            <li>This leads to having to do multiple passes and many skin cuts.</li>
            <li>I can shave my back from many angles to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>Better with smaller handled razors</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I like the weight on the handle to be able shave, the only remark I have is the</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with your product.</li>
            <li>The device does exactly what its manufacturer claims.  </li>
            <li>But it is not difficult to use and &amp;#34;getting</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I wanted it to do except clog the drain.  </li>
            <li>works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Worked exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to for me.</li>
            <li>At first, it takes some learning.  </li>
            <li>It  does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it, but if there was a competing product that was cheaper and seemed worthwhile, I&#x27;d definitely check it out.    </li>
            <li>Like most men, I have a hairy back, and I do not like this.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to shave your back with you will love it.</li>
            <li>No need to buy the higher end model.</li>
            <li>Go slowly at first.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Although not horribly expensive, you still wonder.  </li>
            <li>works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Used prior to a 9 day vacation in the Caribbean...extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to remove the hair on my back without help, This product gives me that ability.</li>
            <li>I have now used this product about a total of 6 to 10 times while it works ok</li>
            <li>(2-blade) razor the first time to try it out</li>
            <li>but I need to make sure it is inserted firmly enough so that it won&#x27;t come out when using the Razorba.</li>
            <li>Now you can make the jobb by yourself ;-)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Second time purchasing since it worked okay the first time using it.</li>
            <li>Exactly, as advertised, and just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>For Men 3-in-one Body Wash as it leaves a slick layer on the skin which makes shaving a lot easier and more effective and I am not afraid to shave on a daily basis as there has been no bad effects on my skin.</li>
            <li>It works great, I&#x27;m surprised no one has come up with a copy for less then 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>The Razorba actually makes back shaving pleasant.  </li>
            <li>In fact I am getting ready to go to a pool party right now, something that I would have passed on had it not been for the Razorba.  </li>
            <li>It’s sturdy, making it easy to apply the right amount of pressure, and after a little bit of time getting used to it, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Hard to get most razors to stay in for more than a min or two at a time but works pretty well.</li>
            <li>then you may need the more expensive Razorba models so you can use a higher end razor, but this model was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cost effective because you use the razor of your choice unlike other shavers that trap you with pricey replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Does the job much better than more expensive electric wands that break easily.</li>
            <li>Now , I do not have much back hair at all so this version works really good for me using just a disposable razor, now if you have a back like a Yetti</li>
            <li>Even old Atra razors fit this and do very well----thanks a lot for this</li>
            <li>Seems to fit a couple of the razors that I have with no problem, but may not fit some of the more &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; razors out there.</li>
            <li>The product seems solidly made and gives good control over the razor as you guide it along your back.</li>
            <li>When I received the Razorba the first thing I did was try and see if it would easily hold 3 different razors that I had in the house.</li>
            <li>This simple but sturdy design was easy to use the first time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good although hard to maneuver just at first.</li>
            <li>so I put my razor in it and with the long handle was able to shave my lower legs without having to bend over.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lock on the folding part would come undone when you were trying to use it, which made it pretty much</li>
            <li>I love the angle, the long handle, and the fact that it is not flexible.</li>
            <li>As funny as this tool might &amp;#34;look&amp;#34;, it is actually very functional for it&#x27;s designed purpose.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and it&#x27;s super simple to use</li>
            <li>if you want to get rid of back hair and don&#x27;t have some sucker (haha) available to shave it for you, this is a great option.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone with back hair.</li>
            <li>Oh and as for the picture of the guy easily reaching over his back to hit the spots... I didn&#x27;t use it from that angle at all.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly easy to shave my back hair.</li>
            <li>Use the smaller handled disposable razors (cheap ones) and this item does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Boy did this make shaving my back easy.  </li>
            <li>Taking care of back hair isnt easy, and this product</li>
            <li>Can be left in the shower for easy storage.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and has solved my back hair issues.</li>
            <li>Use it with a Fusion razor which has easily rinsed open blades.  </li>
            <li>Subsequent shaves easy.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good product that doesn&#x27;t require batteries and should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have used it once only (and I will report back with more good and bad things about it) and it certainly did a great job</li>
            <li>I used Barbasol soothing aloe shaving cream and find it superior to more the more hip Edge, Fusion&#x27;s or other expensive shaving creams with ads on television.</li>
            <li>You need a large mirror you can turn sideways to</li>
            <li>certainly helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a small amount more I got the electronic man groomer that works FAR better</li>
            <li>THIS MAKES TAKING CARE OF THE BACK RUG FAST AND EASY.</li>
            <li>This is a simple straight forward easy to use tool.</li>
            <li>I used a Aquasential Easy Lotion Applicator and this made it so much easier to apply the shaving cream to my back.</li>
            <li>It is a bit of a tight fight but it must be as there are no tightening screws or clamps of any kind.</li>
            <li>Product works fine, takes some practice to master contours on back.</li>
            <li>I have the mid tier razor from Dollar Shave Club and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll really want to try it after a shower in front of a fairly large bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not to need the help of a wife or girlfriend for my manscaping, but this takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li>Mine came with a disposable razor included, which, again I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and is a nice little perk.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone who has issues reaching or even maybe might be good for those having a hard time bending to shave their legs.  </li>
            <li>I have gone back to the Mangroomer because it is so much easier to use, but the result isn&#x27;t as smooth.</li>
            <li>but it really works.  </li>
            <li>I have always had the dilemma of having a smooth back.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the shaving cream applicator they sell to!  </li>
            <li>I use cheap disposables for the back.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving/grooming a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>Seller is also a very valuable asset to amazon</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The Razorba will hold your disposable razor but it&#x27;s still tricky because you really can&#x27;t see what your doing.</li>
            <li>Makes for a smooth back and saves lots of money.</li>
            <li>Hahaha</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful level of freedom if you&#x27;ve relied on others to assist you with this dirty task.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But this product works, and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no adjusting.</li>
            <li>and I had a smooth back.</li>
            <li>I found there was too much razor movement</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to have a mirror nearby to check your results and which areas need work, but with practice, it becomes almost second nature.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This product seems pricey, but is very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I bought what was described, thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The angle really takes care of any need for pressure.  </li>
            <li>It had gotten to the point where I&#x27;ve just given up on the whole thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the inventor for a job</li>
            <li>product worked very well for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you still have to ask somebody else to do it, isn&#x27;t that the whole point of getting this?</li>
            <li>20 minutes to a smooth shaven back.</li>
            <li>In these days of women&#x27;s lib,&lt;br /&gt;men don&#x27;t give enough credit to the primary by-product of women&#x27;s lib:  men&#x27;s lib.</li>
            <li>This devise really works well.</li>
            <li>Very well made and does the trick</li>
            <li>fast delivery of the order.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Just be sure to have a filter on your shower/bathtub drain and empty it after every use to prevent clogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a very sturdy tool</li>
            <li>For me, the handle needs to be much longer</li>
            <li>works very well...</li>
            <li>shall we say smaller, circular/square type razor handles (ex: the Gillette body razor wouldn&#x27;t fit in the holder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Razorba really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>By the time I was finished, my back was smooth and hairless.  </li>
            <li>Heavier and more sturdy than I expected.</li>
            <li>Takes a minute or two to get the hang of it, but solves the problem very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks alot</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It works really well &amp; with a verity of razors just as promised.</li>
            <li>I wonder how much it cost the company to make this versus the selling price.</li>
            <li>Skin becomes smooth and you can not feel any hair anywhere on your back.</li>
            <li>Seems very pricey though, it would&#x27;ve made five stars if not for that</li>
            <li>Thanks raxorba team .</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know you nicked yourself, you&#x27;ll have a nice red blotch on the back of your shirt.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t one clear winning solution for shaving your back.</li>
            <li>Overall a pretty cool item that solves a lot of guys problems.</li>
            <li>Love this product, love the idea behind it.  </li>
            <li>Also, as someone else mentioned, be sure to pull it away from your back when moving to the next spot because you can really make a nice slice with the razor if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li>Was bought as a gift, the unit is very well made, no problems with it, and the user said that one must remove the blade unit after using so as to keep the blade handle from becoming loose in the unit.  </li>
            <li>I do allot of activities and having a clean back is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Really simplifies getting your back clean.</li>
            <li>I turned to the Razorba since it looked simple &amp; straightforward.</li>
            <li>After I pulled it out of the box it sure seemed small and I thought to myself it might take a contortionist to be able to use this properly.  </li>
            <li>We were a bit skeptical at first, but now we both agree that this is a great device.  </li>
            <li>It took me 3 attemps to get back clean.  </li>
            <li>If you want a clean shaven back, this does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Makes the wife happy, no more hairy back</li>
            <li>But it may take one or two times to get all the hair on your back as that hair is a little more fine than the hair on your face.  </li>
            <li>The BIC Disposable razor is the one to use, it has a single blade which rinses out easily and is of ridged construction</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this</li>
            <li>There are many products out there that can help with the hair you can easily reach, but until using this product, I had no easy way of reaching my back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll live with drano and have a baby smooth back.  </li>
            <li>With very little practice, you can do it all on your own.</li>
            <li>DRY WAS FINE WITH NO IRRITATION, BUT</li>
            <li>Did not want to buy the more expensive versions even though I wanted to use my Fusion razor, but I use a good disposable with this basic model.</li>
            <li>Works very well, am able to reach all areas of my entire back</li>
            <li>I thought the whole idea was to shave the ENTIRE BACK from an over the top reach.</li>
            <li>so I drilled a hole on top of the Razorba  where the razor is inserted and once again used a thumb bolt to tighten it down.  </li>
            <li>so I inserted some curved aluminum sheet metal on the top where the bolt clamps down</li>
            <li>Because I live in a share house in a hot climate thanks to this product I can walk around the house without a shirt on as before my back was very hairy, before I had to use the Air Con at my expense a lot as I was to embarrassed with my back hair , I even had my first swim  at the beach for many years just recently!</li>
            <li>Works best with a round or square handle razor, not as well with a wide flat handle razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver is a good length which allows you to reach those hard to get to spots &amp; with ease !</li>
            <li>I was able to access every area of my back in which back hair was growing.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the robins&#x27; egg blue color you can always take it out in the garage and paint it something more manly like road cone Orange or fire engine Red.</li>
            <li>I verified that this is the latest version that is very sturdy and heavy.</li>
            <li>Using razors gives me a super close shave you can&#x27;t even tell I have back hair.</li>
            <li>I do not have a lot of back hair, but enough to where I know my girlfriends do not find it sexy.</li>
            <li>I am a larger fellow, and I was able to reach ALL areas of my back.  </li>
            <li>Works well with a gillette older razors and grips</li>
            <li>the main reason I order</li>
            <li>It is a clever product - and quite sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The Razorba back shaper is perfectly dsigned to reach your entire back, with a little patience and flexibility.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Razorba for its ease and simplicity.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing the applicator as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the device once so far, but it was a relatively simple process of loading in a disposable Gillette razor (three blades and a lubricating strip, similar to the Mach 3, but without the reusable handle) and taking five or six good passes, then rinsing off the area I&#x27;d shaved and repeating.</li>
            <li>Follow the positive reviews advice, like (1) give it time, the first or second use you are learning how to make it work for you,</li>
            <li>I dry shave with it with only a simple stationary two blade Good News with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>The product arrived right on time and works well with a small to medium size razor..makes it easy to reach all areas..</li>
            <li>Of course professional waxing would last longer, and lasering would be forever, but this is fine if you can give the time and effort frequently.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to the Razorba Sum3 Power and it&#x27;s the new classic.</li>
            <li>I had paid $40 for an over-priced Mangroomer that was so cheap it broke &amp; jammed after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>this does the trick, but you have to use men&#x27;s razors because the wide handles won&#x27;t fit into this device.</li>
            <li>Very hairy body for which I have been self conscious for years.  </li>
            <li>First one the grey inner piece came free of the screw holdi NH it in place.</li>
            <li>Have to make sure it is firmly in place.</li>
            <li>The most drawback was that all razors do not fit.</li>
            <li>They fall out consistently, as this is really just a piece of plastic with a rubber insert in the end meant to grasp the back of the razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit steep in price, but worth every penny once you actually learn how to use it.</li>
            <li>I tried using a \\&quot;back scratching\\&quot; technique, easy back and forths over the areas that needed cleaning up.  </li>
            <li>Thus equipped, shaving the back suddenly becomes quite easy.  </li>
            <li>When I bought this I thought the handle was going to be flexible so that you could bend it to the right angle that works for the individual using it.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, able to reach all areas of my entire back with this, just replace the blade when necessary.</li>
            <li>But it is very well constructed and solid, so I guess we are paying for the smart design.</li>
            <li>Of course, your first shave will take MUCH longer than subsequent ones, as you&#x27;ll be stopping to clear the razor every swipe or so.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you get a razor wide enough to stay put.</li>
            <li>One time well spent and I am enjoying to use it to shave my husband back hair or of cause, he can do it himself.</li>
            <li>It definitely can save you big $$$ and free you from pain vs waxing.</li>
            <li>it would be simple for them to include a couple of different holders that fit in the end of the razorba.</li>
            <li>Tried several different razors that I have in this thing and none of them fit or worked well.</li>
            <li>And no small parts to break.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty solid.       </li>
            <li>I wish oh I wish i could post the picture of the multitude of gauze and bandages on my back after the first use.  </li>
            <li>No small parts to break, or blades to replace.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty hairy back.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what the real benefits are to the more expensive versions as my Gillette Mach 3 as well as Sensor handles fit well and securely.</li>
            <li>Electric back shavers don&#x27;t do it for me because my back hair is soft and I want smooth shaven skin, not stubby.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First off, I am joking, my mother has never shaved my back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty simple tool that does what you need it to do.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this instead of any of the more expensive back hair removal options here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of my hairy back, and while I don&#x27;t think it completely ruined my social life to be a bit more hairy than some, it certainly did not help.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a similar product a while back, it was foldable, cheaply made and I had trouble finding blades to fit it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With gentle glides , I get a smooth back &amp; also other locations .</li>
            <li>The opening that receives the razor has a fixed diameter that is smaller that each razor I buy (or would be willing to).  </li>
            <li>Once I started holding it by the handle at the end, I realized the razor was starting to hit the sweet spot/angle to where it was actually taking off the hair.</li>
            <li>To give you an idea, I can barely touch my left shoulder with my right hand and vice versa, and I can definitely not touch the right shoulder with the right hand or the left shoulder with the left hand.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this new gizmo, and I don&#x27;t have to help him shave his back anymore.  </li>
            <li>I made one out of a coathanger double in a half circle and taped a razor to the end that works much better then this does....</li>
            <li>so you can see what you&#x27;re doing, and your middle back is near-impossible to do quickly.</li>
            <li>but it can only accomodate certain razors.  </li>
            <li>I like the way how it works , but the price in general a bit high..</li>
            <li>The Fusion Pro Glide handle isn&#x27;t wide enough to fit snugly in the tube.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be clear.</li>
            <li>After about the 4th use it just clicked with me on how to use it, and yes, you do have to sometimes twist and get into positions that are hardly natural.  </li>
            <li>There are versions of this thing that are double the price, but I really can&#x27;t see how you could do much to improve upon what is essentially a angled plastic gripper.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Frequent rinsing of the razor is required.  </li>
            <li>So when we opened it, we were alittle surprised that it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>but I have a really Harry back.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any cuts and no sores developed after time.  </li>
            <li>Used it three times so far.  </li>
            <li>Can you spell deceptive trade practices and class action litigation?     </li>
            <li>Allows me to do a complete shave.</li>
            <li>The angle the razor is held at is fixed.  </li>
            <li>but wow what a difference.</li>
            <li>Although it is not heavy, when it arrived its weight surprised me.</li>
            <li>I have an arthritic hip and cannot reach that far.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money...</li>
            <li>so I can really sense where and how the blade is contacting my back.</li>
            <li>I am a 62 year old woman</li>
            <li>in the mirror, see a very patchy hairy back</li>
            <li>Also, push it is quite far,</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves the Razorba back shaver.</li>
            <li>Now I am not self conscious when I swim at the pool.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to use this than it is to have to ask someone to shave your back for you!!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, you could really gouge your back.  </li>
            <li>Simple and ready to use.</li>
            <li>I had used a Mangroomer (much like an electric razor for the back) which required batteries and replacement once the blades wore out.  </li>
            <li>do not waste your money or time</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband after I was asked to shave his back a few too many times.</li>
            <li>the razor will seem a little wobbly in the holder but that&#x27;s actually good - too stiff</li>
            <li>Definitely use a new razor and trim your back hair first if you&#x27;ve got a bumper crop.  </li>
            <li>Results will not be immediate if you have as much of a pelt back there as I did, but regular use will result in a clean back after only a week or so.</li>
            <li>The product itself does little more than make it possible for one to reach areas of the back that are normally beyond our reach.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick and this product secures the razor with a tight fit for easy shaving.</li>
            <li>It is plenty long enough to reach comfortably to any spot on my back.</li>
            <li>The user is required to stick his razor (usually a disposable works just fine) in the opening provided on the Razorba.  </li>
            <li>Using a razor is the first thing you think of when shaving, but it doesn&#x27;t work the same on your back.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend it to a friend who was interested in cleaning up his back.</li>
            <li>It may not work for some people, in particular those who have some muscle on their back.</li>
            <li>No one enjoys having their significant other shave their back.</li>
            <li>and I can change my shirt in public whilst locking up the bicycle, takes a bit of getting used to the product especially the first use</li>
            <li>Unlike a mechanical back shaver I had tried before, this gear is sturdy, easy to use, and requires little maintenance to keep in working order.</li>
            <li>I just have little fine hair at back.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I think as long as you know how to shave, this product should be very intuitive.</li>
            <li>not many razor handles fit in it</li>
            <li>I  use it twice a week and focus on different  parts of the back each time, and it that way do not take more than a few mnutes each time.</li>
            <li>It does the job as expected, no fancy packaging, no useless add-ons.</li>
            <li>The first time using this to cut down a forest was pretty long</li>
            <li>A little hard to get the hang of, but it does a good job when u get used to the motion.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless less, it takes some getting used to but it works pretty well!</li>
            <li>Simple and huge (much larger than expected) but it works like a dream!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, they should let the ribbed handle for your grip run at least halfway up the shaft, so you can easily adjust for shorter length areas you want to reach.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second one and the first lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Why so much money for such a simple product!  </li>
            <li>When the product arrived I quickly found that my shaver from the Dollar Shave Club did not fit in the handle, but I thought that might be the case.  </li>
            <li>After extensive research, and using other not so good products (groomr) in the past I have learned the following: Nothing.</li>
            <li>While a little pricey, is worth its salt.</li>
            <li>The Razorba takes way too much time to get a good back shave due to its weird angles and lack of length.  </li>
            <li>Product was ok, just a little awkward to use, but I&#x27;m guessing that will get better with practice.</li>
            <li>Only issue is, the price could be a little less for what I&#x27;m actually getting, although I saw other products at much higher prices that I would never even consider spending that kind of money...</li>
            <li>Actually, it&#x27;s a killer electric trimmer that shaves off long over growth with absolute ease.</li>
            <li>not much more to say - works as expected, no batteries and much better reach</li>
            <li>Your back hair is fairly soft so the stubble is not prickly</li>
            <li>The biggest problem is that the part that holds the razor only accepts the old 2-bladed razors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much heftier than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised a simple design would work so well!</li>
            <li>I made a longer handle by slipping a length of PVC pipe over the end of the handle and drilling a hole in the pipe and inserting a thumb bolt to tighten down and secure it.  </li>
            <li>you need a razor to have the handle  more or less round, so this way will stay on the razor handle.</li>
            <li>Seems quality constructed which goes against another persons review, seems solid enough where if someone broke into your house and your baseball bat wasn&#x27;t near, just grab the Razorba!  </li>
            <li>My first time I was not used to working the angles, so I used a double mirror technique by standing backwards in my bathroom mirror and holding a handheld mirror in my other hand.</li>
            <li>This product totally disappoints as the long rubber handle bends too much when pressing the razor against your back.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy hard plastic, and a disposable razor fits VERY snugly in the end of it.  </li>
            <li>It is a hard plastic with a rubber insert to hold the razor nice and firm.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my hair stubble is visible with in 3 or 4 days, but this gives me a few days of worry free conscious that has allowed me to significantly increase activities I do \\&quot;in comfort\\&quot; and at any given moment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, bulky and the angle on it doesn&#x27;t really provide the natural motion I need to use it well.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little coordination and some practice, but once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll be ready for the beach in no time!  </li>
            <li>When I first took it out of the box, I was a little concerned...</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to the first time.  </li>
            <li>I shave dry usually, using a light sawing motion w/o raising it off my skin , like mowing a lawn.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on more expensive back shavers.</li>
            <li>one upside is that the product is made of pretty heavy and seemingly durable material.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tough getting the shaving cream on but other than that it works great</li>
            <li>Well it really should for the cost, it is a little steep, but it is pretty heavy duty</li>
            <li>Its still a little awkward to keep the handle straight while your shaving your back, but with patience it can be done, but definitely takes more time than having someone else do it!</li>

            <li> Non-slip handle is so nice to use in the shower!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compatible with some of the popular razors that can be found at almost every store, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> Once you figure it out, it works, and that&#x27;s what matters.  :-P</li>
            <li> The Razorba is easy to use and has awesome results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use once you get used to reversing what you see in the mirror!</li>
            <li> Good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wife is good with it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the electic version tho.  </li>
            <li> Good product</li>

            <li> its a perfect fit</li>
            <li> I think this works really good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product idea.  </li>
            <li> The concept of the Razorba is good but they seem to have forgot or ignored those of us who are taller (</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a good device</li>
            <li> Do not understand where all of the good reviews came from.</li>
            <li> Good size and handling.</li>
            <li> surprisingly sturdy.  </li>
            <li> product is quite good.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job, no issues.</li>
            <li> It is easier to use with a razor that does not have a pivoting head like a Gillette Good News.</li>
            <li> Good angle he said and works well.</li>
            <li> It takes me 3 days in a row to do a good job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.</li>
            <li> Life is so much more beautiful</li>
            <li> This is a very ingenious product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for backs as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad someone came up with the idea and a great product.</li>
            <li> Great seller communication &amp; follow up too :)</li>
            <li> i am very glad i made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> It sure beat&#x27;s using a paint stick with razor duct taped to the end!</li>
            <li> and then... MAGIC!  </li>
            <li> Works best if you use an electric trimmer first.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> If you first use, the product &amp;#34;MANGROOMER Sku 211-6 Professional&amp;#34; then this product finialise the job to a perfect result.</li>
            <li> Great design and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to do it myself!  </li>
            <li> I bought this from the amazing reviews I had read on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing how it stayed in&lt;br /&gt;securely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you, it felt really nice.  </li>
            <li> You have to attach your own razor.</li>
            <li> You could make your own with a yardstick and duct tape - it would work just as well and save you 30 bucks</li>
            <li> Good idea, but a flexible handle would have made more sense.    </li>
            <li> It does not require batteries and you can use your own blades / shavers with it.</li>
            <li> Works best with straight handle razor.</li>
            <li> the Sport Razor, its a good design and a better choice.</li>
            <li> For the money I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s engineered all that well to be honest.</li>
            <li> taking control of their own body hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> very time saving and a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for skinny guys with no muscle, but if you are a muscular man like me, you will not find this product effective.</li>
            <li> Nice product, will work with any mans disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the Razorba suprised me when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Nice to get neck</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a fresh razor for best results</li>
            <li> Because one supplies his own razor, each shave can be as close as you wish.  </li>
            <li> Effective product.</li>
            <li> Nice item for the money.</li>
            <li> and it is very easy and effective.  </li>
            <li> Works great came quickly and all I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> works fine with gillette good news</li>
            <li> I made my own version of this with a steel pipe and could make another if I wanted to, but this design is ergonomically perfect for the job and holds a thin handled razor perfectly (I use a Mach 3 disposable).  </li>
            <li> So far I have achieved the best results using a gel type shaving cream in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Get a good razor that will fit your model and shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great and the price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> It worked great right from the start.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and even helpful for shaving areas like tops of shoulders, too!  </li>
            <li> Now I can take car of this myself easily!</li>
            <li> I love this thing very strong</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described, works great, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great invention that gets the job done and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It works just fine with my Gillette Fusion and Pro-Glide razors!</li>
            <li> Once I placed a razor in the holder, it is very secure and doesn&#x27;t shift or get out of control.</li>
            <li> Quick and good product</li>
            <li> The Razorbak relies on the handle of the razor fitting into a rubber tube to hold it in place.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> But if you keep at it you will get better.</li>
            <li> I found this one for $20 on Amazon but most places sell them for a lot more.</li>
            <li> This works much better.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Make sure use a grease razor</li>
            <li> But know more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get the rest off with a razor.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was hitting anything, but when I was done, the hair was gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it 5 more times just to make sure.</li>
            <li> Each time I get better.  </li>
            <li> One of the reviewers guessed that the old/cheaper version would also work with most razors so</li>
            <li> I thought it was better than what it is.may be  </li>
            <li> i need more instruction on it since I didn&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li> After use be sure to remove razor if not it can streach out the insert sleve</li>
            <li> The seller is great and shipping was very</li>
            <li> Was able to hit the pool with out feeling self conscience.</li>
            <li> With some practice I&#x27;ve been able to use it, but it would have worked a lot better for me if the razor was at a steeper angle and closer to being inline with the handle.  </li>
            <li> And glad I did.</li>
            <li> Maxim reviews gave it top marks as the best product for back shaving.</li>
            <li> He loves it and that is all that matters to me :)</li>
            <li> Very simple product, works great!</li>
            <li> Great product, saves me so much time.</li>
            <li> He loves it and has relieved my sister from the work :)</li>
            <li> This back shaver is awesome.</li>
            <li> However, when I actually put the razor in there and used it, it was perfect!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the most flexible guy</li>
            <li> You would be better off taping a disposable razor to a dowel and using it instead.</li>
            <li> Also, would be better if you put a non slip grip like some of the fancy womans disposable blades a silicone of some type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent product that helped me shave the unwanted hair on my back by myself</li>
            <li> I like this product so much better than the electric foil type groomer I had.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I repeat, NOTHING works better than the Razorba Shaver.</li>
            <li> I have seen hairier than I, but mostly in zoos.</li>
            <li> Just have to be sure to hold it correctly, and use a mirror.</li>
            <li> works as described and will work with most disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Sport Razor is more nimble with much better tactile feel</li>
            <li> This thing is top quality.  </li>
            <li> Women love</li>
            <li> I find the Mag Groomer much more convenient and easier to use.</li>
            <li> Love this device.  </li>
            <li> The reason you want to do that is cause the Venus blades have more surface area</li>
            <li> A butter knife and some packaging tape worked better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many times.</li>
            <li> This would have been better had one end of the handle</li>
            <li> I found that I got better results going under my arm rather than over my head.    </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Much better than this Razorba.</li>
            <li> She wanted to be able to shave legs -</li>
            <li> Took a bit of getting used to but then did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> The razor fits in the grip well and doesn&#x27;t move around (make sure that you are getting the correct one for your razor).  </li>
            <li> I like most about the product is the heft that it has.  </li>
            <li> And having some heft to the product allows you to be more confident with it as you know that it&#x27;s not going to flex on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I can see getting many years of use out it.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> The Razorba is an interesting product.  </li>
            <li> Works well, better if you use it more often (like every two weeks).  </li>
            <li> I could not be more satisfied with the design and function.</li>
            <li> While in the shower, I just get some good soap suds going and do my best to get some on my back, then glance over at my shaving mirror on wall to ensure I&#x27;m on the right path.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten one myself yet, but can see that it&#x27;s very useful!  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, you get a really nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li> USING MY OWN RAZOR GIVES ME A CLEAN, PAINLESS SHAVE.</li>
            <li> It will help you look nice and clean for the ladies.</li>
            <li> Within the tube is a rubber sleeve that you stuff the handle of your razor into and it is supposed to hold the razor in place and position it for a clean effective shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality product that works great.</li>
            <li> Seems to not be able to get the right angle to get everything as I just seems to be able to get the blade to angle right to shave every thing still good to use and my fiancé even uses to shave her legs comes in handy if ya don&#x27;t wanna have to bend over or take a bath or whatever.</li>
            <li> I am in pretty good shape</li>
            <li> This is a good product that does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Very easy and straightforward in using.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to shave more often if you want to.</li>
            <li> I use it with the generic Target brand disposable razors which are compatible as they fit perfectly and it&#x27;s a winner all the way around every time.</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible tool for shaving your back!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 different disposable razors with it and the handles fit snuggly and perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and does a good job if razor is new.</li>
            <li> After the first use I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> The razor holder is \\&quot;universal\\&quot;, however it tends to hold razors with slimmer handles more securely.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, its working great.  </li>
            <li> Better than the clippers because you get close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Deceptively simple, but incredibly well engineered and constructed.</li>
            <li> Tip: get the disposable razors that have a square handle not rounded, they seem to fit better.</li>
            <li> Will fit most disposable and non- disposable razors including the Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s really really rediculosuly good looking.</li>
            <li> Very overpriced but still works good.</li>
            <li> good quality product, holds a disposable razor very well..takes a bit to get use too but works well...</li>
            <li> Very easy and quick to shave</li>
            <li> Reaches all over easily.</li>
            <li> Does the job, fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> &quot; makes the task easy.</li>
            <li> Then insert it in the Rezorba and easily shave where you couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> The Razorba works great for maneuvering around the back more easily and now I don&#x27;t have to be self-conscious anymore when I take off my shirt.  </li>
            <li> This got all the hair off and is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used some body groomers and shavers, but they did not have the reach that allowed me to do the job easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and speedy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and it saves my wife the delight of using the weed-whacker in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> is easily removed the Razorba.</li>
            <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I think it would be easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> When I use this, I use the Aquasentials Easy Lotion Applicator  from Amazon with baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It works for me: easy to attach disposable/non-disposable razor (tried both), easy to shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I used the recommended Gillette Mach 3 razor, along with the Aquasentials Easy Lotion Applicator, and Edge Body Renew Face &amp; Body Shave Cream.</li>
            <li> You can easily use disposable razors for this though.</li>
            <li> Get this Razorba, a can of decent shaving gel, and a good mirror, and go to town.</li>
            <li> But after about ten minutes of fudging with it, I felt I had a pretty good handle and control of the Shaver and was able to hit all the areas and feel when the razor was making good contact.</li>
            <li> I am using a Schick ST2 razor which fits fine in the product.  </li>
            <li> The packing was overkill but fine...  </li>
            <li> But, any razor with a roundish handle will work fine.  </li>
            <li> and they work fine.  </li>
            <li> Works Great, Easy to Use, Fits all my Razors (Different Gillette Razors)</li>
            <li> I can now easily shave my own back and love that I don&#x27;t need to ask for help any more.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to perfect it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the shaver and can highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> beforehand is a huge help.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband, who has always tried to keep himself neat and fit.</li>
            <li> You will need to put some type of tape around razor handle to make it fit</li>
            <li> handle securely but not tear up the plastic tube.  </li>
            <li> , I ordered the cheap version and guess what?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used razorba products since I saw the back shaver on the Rachael Ray Show where it got great reviews from the panel</li>
            <li> It works best with razors with round handles like a Gillette Excel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s worth the price, but it does work.</li>
            <li> GREAT LOW TECH ITEM.</li>
            <li> With the Razorba, I can do it myself and maintain a hair free back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> problem with the razorba is that not all razor handles fit their product securely or some not at all.</li>
            <li> And you get the razor smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the widest most powerful and highest quality of the electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any razor handle will fit in the end .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy using it now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also... if you go with this use a Mach 3 razor with a Venus Divine blade (The Venus Divine blades fit on the Mach 3 razor, but the Venus Divine razor doesn&#x27;t fit in the Razorba).</li>
            <li> I looked at several others and am happy I went with this one.  </li>
            <li> You really have to work and bend and flex to use it effectively, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and effective</li>
            <li> Razor fit snugly so no problem there.</li>
            <li> I found you MUST use a slim handle razor to fit in the end.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic...</li>
            <li> Holds disposable razors securely.  </li>
            <li> Some razors don&#x27;t fit in handle.</li>
            <li> Also didnt have a problem finding razors that fit.</li>
            <li> A 5 blade Fusion Pro Glide fit snugly into the handles holder.</li>
            <li> Proud its american made.  </li>
            <li> Piece of cake, smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> Nice to hold your razor and shave your own back.</li>
            <li> This is far superior.  </li>
            <li> I like the razorba because i am now able to shave my back fairly well without the help of my wife.  </li>
            <li> After that, it&#x27;s pretty fast and easy to get a good shave with.  </li>
            <li> Clean and silky smooth results.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - does not hold most of the new razors.  </li>
            <li> I was originally concerned that it would be hard/clumsy to use.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to get the hair off leaving my back nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and seems to be even better quality than I thought.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much more effective at shaving my back now than it was before without it.</li>
            <li> Very handy for women who have had hip surgery and need a long handle for leg shaving.</li>
            <li> So what special razor works with this thing?</li>
            <li> It works with the razor and blades you already use for your face, so there&#x27;s no need to keep buying separate special blades for this.</li>
            <li> Still not a bad purchase though specially for the price</li>
            <li> But there really isn&#x27;t anything else that works any better.</li>
            <li> With every stroke of the razor, sweet satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure how this is actually getting good reviews though.</li>
            <li> It is ergonomically designed, my Bic double blade razors fit well, and I am most pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> best part is saving many an argument with your significant other about PLEASE shaving your back again!!!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s much easier to get a better shave on each pass.</li>
            <li> And it doesnt have a good angle to truly help for bigger guys.</li>
            <li> Good reach and angle for the back.</li>
            <li> It has a taken a while to get used to it, but I can manage to shave all of my back with it and a good mirror.</li>
            <li> F*****g sweet.</li>
            <li> You really have to have a full length mirror to help you see and kind of bend your arms in a way they don&#x27;t normally go, but overall a great product.</li>
            <li> strong construction, not flimsy / helps w/ those tough to reach areas/ great product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended if you don&#x27;t have someone to shave your back for you, which is a lot more fun!  :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and not expensive either.</li>
            <li> My back looks smooth, and it is all thanks to this amazing product!</li>
            <li> no problem -- older and/or inactive people will probably have a longer adjustment period or find the device may just not be able to work for them.</li>
            <li> Shipped Quick</li>
            <li> The best product for the purpose of personal back shaving ever.</li>
            <li> , if you&#x27;re buying a gift or just want the best rechargeable back shaver then look no further than [[ASIN:B0055T3CCO</li>
            <li> Gets the job done quick, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s that need to be reached, but luckily the Razorba does the trick.</li>
            <li> Also, because of it&#x27;s length, I had to use it from the top, bottom, and side of the back to get most of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived quick and was as promised in the description.</li>
            <li> But overall and with practice I am very glad I purchased this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My husband requested this back shaver and he is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It&lt;br /&gt;is comfortable and easy to use, and it fits pretty much any razor, so you can use what ever one you prefer.  </li>
            <li> Its easy and fast to use and can be done just  before the pool or beach.</li>
            <li> easy to use, very well made.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good product overall.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> and you have a great power razor,no need to mess with cheep razors...</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you want it to do!  </li>
            <li> You need to jam it in there good, because a loose razor won&#x27;t perform well.    </li>
            <li> It has a comfortable handle that has a good length and angle to easily access the hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice but is nice to be able to shave without help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great idea that badly needs some refining to make it also a great product.</li>
            <li> So, I can see how this product would work great for you if you happened to use a razor with a narrow grip.</li>
            <li> Since there are no competing products for this that I know of, they can charge $30 for a piece of (heavy duty) plastic and you&#x27;ll be happy about it.    </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t fit the razor very well.  </li>
            <li> over the years I think shaving my own back without assistance has taken a toll on my shoulders</li>
            <li> It seems to me that we get ripped-off badly enough without the need for a company that sells an item that likely costs them all of $2-3 to manufacture and then sell them for $30 and then, on top of this, they try to scam us into paying more than 2 times for an already overpriced product because they make us believe that the cheap version will not accomodate the newer blade handles!</li>
            <li> It makes shaving your own back one of the easiest tasks.</li>
            <li> Is it fun?</li>
            <li> it came in really handy for him because he had rotator cuff surgery and couldn&#x27;t shave his back.</li>
            <li> Nice not having to ask spouse to help with back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an incredible amount of back hair but enough that I wanted to do something about it.  </li>
            <li> Great old fashioned American quality product.  </li>
            <li> get the hang of it, but it is really worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> works great, better than expected, just need to do your back in front of a mirror.</li>
            <li> It really is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good in theory, but not very practical.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> While I would hesitate to call this device inexpensive, it&#x27;s worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Must be adept at using the mirror to keep from razor burning the back.  </li>
            <li> looking at it online, you wonder if it&#x27;s really worth the price.  </li>
            <li> After receiving it and using it, I would say yes, it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not bad for my first time.</li>
            <li> Once you get your technique down, it really does a exceptional job!    </li>
            <li> I purchased one originally it worked well enough that I bought two more for my sons.</li>
            <li> I can shave my back easily in the shower and maintenance is easy.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, nothing against the online store that sold it, but it doesn&#x27;t work and cut my back up pretty good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly, you have to wedge it in there as tight as you can, but it still comes loose.</li>
            <li> This way it&#x27;s always at the right position and will shave a lot closer then the electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> The angle is right, the grip is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> It took a bit of learning to figure out how to get all the right angle.</li>
            <li> Designed with the right curves and angles.</li>
            <li> Very easy to reach all areas of my back with the Razorba.</li>
            <li> Given that my back hair is so fine, I don&#x27;t see myself needing to do this much more than once a week, if that, but it works REALLY</li>
            <li> The tube holds on to the cheap &amp;#34;Good News&amp;#34; disposable razors that I use for normal shaving...</li>
            <li> It works easily, standard inexpensive disposable razors fit it fine.  </li>
            <li> caveat - if you&#x27;re very hairy (as I was) you&#x27;ll probably want someone to do your first clean shave for you, and then use the Razorba to maintain after that point.</li>
            <li> Maybe really hairy guys would have to use shaving cream, but they&#x27;d probably be shaving everywhere, so trying to target a certain area wouldn&#x27;t be as important to them.    </li>
            <li> BUT, i think it should be curved a little more, or even better make it so that the device is like a &amp;#34;gooseneck&amp;#34; and is bendable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the blue basic model for years and it works great, with a couple of modifications I made.  </li>
            <li> Go ahead and get the Mangroomer if you want a good shave in less time.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy tool, worthy of being sold in the Home Depot tool department.  </li>
            <li> This one accepts many different types of razor handles so you can always use a fresh blade.  </li>
            <li> and they both fit inside very well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, works very well.</li>
            <li> The angle is great for those hard-to-reach spots in the middle of the back.  </li>
            <li> With this tRazorba tool my back is always clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> (2) the idea of putting shaving cream on the wall of the shower and rubbing your back on that was perfect for the one spot I couldn&#x27;t reach, but now I just use that method for my entire back.  </li>
            <li> If you nick yourself you won&#x27;t be able to reach back there to blot.  </li>
            <li> A real winner for us carpet-backs!</li>
            <li> At first, that seemed too cautious.  </li>
            <li> After my first use I was ecstatic.  </li>
            <li> THANKS RAZORBA.!</li>
            <li> I at first tried one of the eclectic kinds and the arm wouldn&#x27;t stay locked in place.  </li>
            <li> Before I got this item, you should&#x27;ve seen what I used at first.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first product to actually, consistently get the job</li>
            <li> Xtreme3 Sensitive razor fit</li>
            <li> This interesting product reached the back areas for shaving but you must have a degree of dexterity.</li>
            <li> This leads to having to do multiple passes and many skin cuts.</li>
            <li> I can shave my back from many angles to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Better with smaller handled razors</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I like the weight on the handle to be able shave, the only remark I have is the</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with your product.</li>
            <li> The device does exactly what its manufacturer claims.  </li>
            <li> But it is not difficult to use and &amp;#34;getting</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I wanted it to do except clog the drain.  </li>
            <li> works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to for me.</li>
            <li> At first, it takes some learning.  </li>
            <li> It  does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it, but if there was a competing product that was cheaper and seemed worthwhile, I&#x27;d definitely check it out.    </li>
            <li> Like most men, I have a hairy back, and I do not like this.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to shave your back with you will love it.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the higher end model.</li>
            <li> Go slowly at first.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Although not horribly expensive, you still wonder.  </li>
            <li> works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Used prior to a 9 day vacation in the Caribbean...extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to remove the hair on my back without help, This product gives me that ability.</li>
            <li> I have now used this product about a total of 6 to 10 times while it works ok</li>
            <li> (2-blade) razor the first time to try it out</li>
            <li> but I need to make sure it is inserted firmly enough so that it won&#x27;t come out when using the Razorba.</li>
            <li> Now you can make the jobb by yourself ;-)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing since it worked okay the first time using it.</li>
            <li> Exactly, as advertised, and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> For Men 3-in-one Body Wash as it leaves a slick layer on the skin which makes shaving a lot easier and more effective and I am not afraid to shave on a daily basis as there has been no bad effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> It works great, I&#x27;m surprised no one has come up with a copy for less then 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> The Razorba actually makes back shaving pleasant.  </li>
            <li> In fact I am getting ready to go to a pool party right now, something that I would have passed on had it not been for the Razorba.  </li>
            <li> It’s sturdy, making it easy to apply the right amount of pressure, and after a little bit of time getting used to it, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hard to get most razors to stay in for more than a min or two at a time but works pretty well.</li>
            <li> then you may need the more expensive Razorba models so you can use a higher end razor, but this model was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cost effective because you use the razor of your choice unlike other shavers that trap you with pricey replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Does the job much better than more expensive electric wands that break easily.</li>
            <li> Now , I do not have much back hair at all so this version works really good for me using just a disposable razor, now if you have a back like a Yetti</li>
            <li> Even old Atra razors fit this and do very well----thanks a lot for this</li>
            <li> Seems to fit a couple of the razors that I have with no problem, but may not fit some of the more &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; razors out there.</li>
            <li> The product seems solidly made and gives good control over the razor as you guide it along your back.</li>
            <li> When I received the Razorba the first thing I did was try and see if it would easily hold 3 different razors that I had in the house.</li>
            <li> This simple but sturdy design was easy to use the first time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good although hard to maneuver just at first.</li>
            <li> so I put my razor in it and with the long handle was able to shave my lower legs without having to bend over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lock on the folding part would come undone when you were trying to use it, which made it pretty much</li>
            <li> I love the angle, the long handle, and the fact that it is not flexible.</li>
            <li> As funny as this tool might &amp;#34;look&amp;#34;, it is actually very functional for it&#x27;s designed purpose.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and it&#x27;s super simple to use</li>
            <li> if you want to get rid of back hair and don&#x27;t have some sucker (haha) available to shave it for you, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone with back hair.</li>
            <li> Oh and as for the picture of the guy easily reaching over his back to hit the spots... I didn&#x27;t use it from that angle at all.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly easy to shave my back hair.</li>
            <li> Use the smaller handled disposable razors (cheap ones) and this item does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Boy did this make shaving my back easy.  </li>
            <li> Taking care of back hair isnt easy, and this product</li>
            <li> Can be left in the shower for easy storage.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and has solved my back hair issues.</li>
            <li> Use it with a Fusion razor which has easily rinsed open blades.  </li>
            <li> Subsequent shaves easy.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good product that doesn&#x27;t require batteries and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used it once only (and I will report back with more good and bad things about it) and it certainly did a great job</li>
            <li> I used Barbasol soothing aloe shaving cream and find it superior to more the more hip Edge, Fusion&#x27;s or other expensive shaving creams with ads on television.</li>
            <li> You need a large mirror you can turn sideways to</li>
            <li> certainly helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a small amount more I got the electronic man groomer that works FAR better</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES TAKING CARE OF THE BACK RUG FAST AND EASY.</li>
            <li> This is a simple straight forward easy to use tool.</li>
            <li> I used a Aquasential Easy Lotion Applicator and this made it so much easier to apply the shaving cream to my back.</li>
            <li> It is a bit of a tight fight but it must be as there are no tightening screws or clamps of any kind.</li>
            <li> Product works fine, takes some practice to master contours on back.</li>
            <li> I have the mid tier razor from Dollar Shave Club and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll really want to try it after a shower in front of a fairly large bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not to need the help of a wife or girlfriend for my manscaping, but this takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Mine came with a disposable razor included, which, again I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and is a nice little perk.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who has issues reaching or even maybe might be good for those having a hard time bending to shave their legs.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back to the Mangroomer because it is so much easier to use, but the result isn&#x27;t as smooth.</li>
            <li> but it really works.  </li>
            <li> I have always had the dilemma of having a smooth back.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the shaving cream applicator they sell to!  </li>
            <li> I use cheap disposables for the back.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving/grooming a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> Seller is also a very valuable asset to amazon</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The Razorba will hold your disposable razor but it&#x27;s still tricky because you really can&#x27;t see what your doing.</li>
            <li> Makes for a smooth back and saves lots of money.</li>
            <li> Hahaha</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful level of freedom if you&#x27;ve relied on others to assist you with this dirty task.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But this product works, and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no adjusting.</li>
            <li> and I had a smooth back.</li>
            <li> I found there was too much razor movement</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to have a mirror nearby to check your results and which areas need work, but with practice, it becomes almost second nature.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product seems pricey, but is very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought what was described, thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The angle really takes care of any need for pressure.  </li>
            <li> It had gotten to the point where I&#x27;ve just given up on the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the inventor for a job</li>
            <li> product worked very well for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you still have to ask somebody else to do it, isn&#x27;t that the whole point of getting this?</li>
            <li> 20 minutes to a smooth shaven back.</li>
            <li> In these days of women&#x27;s lib,&lt;br /&gt;men don&#x27;t give enough credit to the primary by-product of women&#x27;s lib:  men&#x27;s lib.</li>
            <li> This devise really works well.</li>
            <li> Very well made and does the trick</li>
            <li> fast delivery of the order.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Just be sure to have a filter on your shower/bathtub drain and empty it after every use to prevent clogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a very sturdy tool</li>
            <li> For me, the handle needs to be much longer</li>
            <li> works very well...</li>
            <li> shall we say smaller, circular/square type razor handles (ex: the Gillette body razor wouldn&#x27;t fit in the holder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Razorba really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> By the time I was finished, my back was smooth and hairless.  </li>
            <li> Heavier and more sturdy than I expected.</li>
            <li> Takes a minute or two to get the hang of it, but solves the problem very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks alot</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works really well &amp; with a verity of razors just as promised.</li>
            <li> I wonder how much it cost the company to make this versus the selling price.</li>
            <li> Skin becomes smooth and you can not feel any hair anywhere on your back.</li>
            <li> Seems very pricey though, it would&#x27;ve made five stars if not for that</li>
            <li> Thanks raxorba team .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know you nicked yourself, you&#x27;ll have a nice red blotch on the back of your shirt.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t one clear winning solution for shaving your back.</li>
            <li> Overall a pretty cool item that solves a lot of guys problems.</li>
            <li> Love this product, love the idea behind it.  </li>
            <li> Also, as someone else mentioned, be sure to pull it away from your back when moving to the next spot because you can really make a nice slice with the razor if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> Was bought as a gift, the unit is very well made, no problems with it, and the user said that one must remove the blade unit after using so as to keep the blade handle from becoming loose in the unit.  </li>
            <li> I do allot of activities and having a clean back is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Really simplifies getting your back clean.</li>
            <li> I turned to the Razorba since it looked simple &amp; straightforward.</li>
            <li> After I pulled it out of the box it sure seemed small and I thought to myself it might take a contortionist to be able to use this properly.  </li>
            <li> We were a bit skeptical at first, but now we both agree that this is a great device.  </li>
            <li> It took me 3 attemps to get back clean.  </li>
            <li> If you want a clean shaven back, this does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Makes the wife happy, no more hairy back</li>
            <li> But it may take one or two times to get all the hair on your back as that hair is a little more fine than the hair on your face.  </li>
            <li> The BIC Disposable razor is the one to use, it has a single blade which rinses out easily and is of ridged construction</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this</li>
            <li> There are many products out there that can help with the hair you can easily reach, but until using this product, I had no easy way of reaching my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll live with drano and have a baby smooth back.  </li>
            <li> With very little practice, you can do it all on your own.</li>
            <li> DRY WAS FINE WITH NO IRRITATION, BUT</li>
            <li> Did not want to buy the more expensive versions even though I wanted to use my Fusion razor, but I use a good disposable with this basic model.</li>
            <li> Works very well, am able to reach all areas of my entire back</li>
            <li> I thought the whole idea was to shave the ENTIRE BACK from an over the top reach.</li>
            <li> so I drilled a hole on top of the Razorba  where the razor is inserted and once again used a thumb bolt to tighten it down.  </li>
            <li> so I inserted some curved aluminum sheet metal on the top where the bolt clamps down</li>
            <li> Because I live in a share house in a hot climate thanks to this product I can walk around the house without a shirt on as before my back was very hairy, before I had to use the Air Con at my expense a lot as I was to embarrassed with my back hair , I even had my first swim  at the beach for many years just recently!</li>
            <li> Works best with a round or square handle razor, not as well with a wide flat handle razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver is a good length which allows you to reach those hard to get to spots &amp; with ease !</li>
            <li> I was able to access every area of my back in which back hair was growing.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the robins&#x27; egg blue color you can always take it out in the garage and paint it something more manly like road cone Orange or fire engine Red.</li>
            <li> I verified that this is the latest version that is very sturdy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Using razors gives me a super close shave you can&#x27;t even tell I have back hair.</li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of back hair, but enough to where I know my girlfriends do not find it sexy.</li>
            <li> I am a larger fellow, and I was able to reach ALL areas of my back.  </li>
            <li> Works well with a gillette older razors and grips</li>
            <li> the main reason I order</li>
            <li> It is a clever product - and quite sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The Razorba back shaper is perfectly dsigned to reach your entire back, with a little patience and flexibility.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Razorba for its ease and simplicity.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing the applicator as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the device once so far, but it was a relatively simple process of loading in a disposable Gillette razor (three blades and a lubricating strip, similar to the Mach 3, but without the reusable handle) and taking five or six good passes, then rinsing off the area I&#x27;d shaved and repeating.</li>
            <li> Follow the positive reviews advice, like (1) give it time, the first or second use you are learning how to make it work for you,</li>
            <li> I dry shave with it with only a simple stationary two blade Good News with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> The product arrived right on time and works well with a small to medium size razor..makes it easy to reach all areas..</li>
            <li> Of course professional waxing would last longer, and lasering would be forever, but this is fine if you can give the time and effort frequently.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to the Razorba Sum3 Power and it&#x27;s the new classic.</li>
            <li> I had paid $40 for an over-priced Mangroomer that was so cheap it broke &amp; jammed after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> this does the trick, but you have to use men&#x27;s razors because the wide handles won&#x27;t fit into this device.</li>
            <li> Very hairy body for which I have been self conscious for years.  </li>
            <li> First one the grey inner piece came free of the screw holdi NH it in place.</li>
            <li> Have to make sure it is firmly in place.</li>
            <li> The most drawback was that all razors do not fit.</li>
            <li> They fall out consistently, as this is really just a piece of plastic with a rubber insert in the end meant to grasp the back of the razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit steep in price, but worth every penny once you actually learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> I tried using a \\&quot;back scratching\\&quot; technique, easy back and forths over the areas that needed cleaning up.  </li>
            <li> Thus equipped, shaving the back suddenly becomes quite easy.  </li>
            <li> When I bought this I thought the handle was going to be flexible so that you could bend it to the right angle that works for the individual using it.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, able to reach all areas of my entire back with this, just replace the blade when necessary.</li>
            <li> But it is very well constructed and solid, so I guess we are paying for the smart design.</li>
            <li> Of course, your first shave will take MUCH longer than subsequent ones, as you&#x27;ll be stopping to clear the razor every swipe or so.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you get a razor wide enough to stay put.</li>
            <li> One time well spent and I am enjoying to use it to shave my husband back hair or of cause, he can do it himself.</li>
            <li> It definitely can save you big $$$ and free you from pain vs waxing.</li>
            <li> it would be simple for them to include a couple of different holders that fit in the end of the razorba.</li>
            <li> Tried several different razors that I have in this thing and none of them fit or worked well.</li>
            <li> And no small parts to break.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty solid.       </li>
            <li> I wish oh I wish i could post the picture of the multitude of gauze and bandages on my back after the first use.  </li>
            <li> No small parts to break, or blades to replace.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty hairy back.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the real benefits are to the more expensive versions as my Gillette Mach 3 as well as Sensor handles fit well and securely.</li>
            <li> Electric back shavers don&#x27;t do it for me because my back hair is soft and I want smooth shaven skin, not stubby.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First off, I am joking, my mother has never shaved my back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty simple tool that does what you need it to do.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this instead of any of the more expensive back hair removal options here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of my hairy back, and while I don&#x27;t think it completely ruined my social life to be a bit more hairy than some, it certainly did not help.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar product a while back, it was foldable, cheaply made and I had trouble finding blades to fit it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With gentle glides , I get a smooth back &amp; also other locations .</li>
            <li> The opening that receives the razor has a fixed diameter that is smaller that each razor I buy (or would be willing to).  </li>
            <li> Once I started holding it by the handle at the end, I realized the razor was starting to hit the sweet spot/angle to where it was actually taking off the hair.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea, I can barely touch my left shoulder with my right hand and vice versa, and I can definitely not touch the right shoulder with the right hand or the left shoulder with the left hand.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this new gizmo, and I don&#x27;t have to help him shave his back anymore.  </li>
            <li> I made one out of a coathanger double in a half circle and taped a razor to the end that works much better then this does....</li>
            <li> so you can see what you&#x27;re doing, and your middle back is near-impossible to do quickly.</li>
            <li> but it can only accomodate certain razors.  </li>
            <li> I like the way how it works , but the price in general a bit high..</li>
            <li> The Fusion Pro Glide handle isn&#x27;t wide enough to fit snugly in the tube.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear.</li>
            <li> After about the 4th use it just clicked with me on how to use it, and yes, you do have to sometimes twist and get into positions that are hardly natural.  </li>
            <li> There are versions of this thing that are double the price, but I really can&#x27;t see how you could do much to improve upon what is essentially a angled plastic gripper.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Frequent rinsing of the razor is required.  </li>
            <li> So when we opened it, we were alittle surprised that it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> but I have a really Harry back.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any cuts and no sores developed after time.  </li>
            <li> Used it three times so far.  </li>
            <li> Can you spell deceptive trade practices and class action litigation?     </li>
            <li> Allows me to do a complete shave.</li>
            <li> The angle the razor is held at is fixed.  </li>
            <li> but wow what a difference.</li>
            <li> Although it is not heavy, when it arrived its weight surprised me.</li>
            <li> I have an arthritic hip and cannot reach that far.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money...</li>
            <li> so I can really sense where and how the blade is contacting my back.</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old woman</li>
            <li> in the mirror, see a very patchy hairy back</li>
            <li> Also, push it is quite far,</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves the Razorba back shaver.</li>
            <li> Now I am not self conscious when I swim at the pool.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to use this than it is to have to ask someone to shave your back for you!!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, you could really gouge your back.  </li>
            <li> Simple and ready to use.</li>
            <li> I had used a Mangroomer (much like an electric razor for the back) which required batteries and replacement once the blades wore out.  </li>
            <li> do not waste your money or time</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband after I was asked to shave his back a few too many times.</li>
            <li> the razor will seem a little wobbly in the holder but that&#x27;s actually good - too stiff</li>
            <li> Definitely use a new razor and trim your back hair first if you&#x27;ve got a bumper crop.  </li>
            <li> Results will not be immediate if you have as much of a pelt back there as I did, but regular use will result in a clean back after only a week or so.</li>
            <li> The product itself does little more than make it possible for one to reach areas of the back that are normally beyond our reach.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this product secures the razor with a tight fit for easy shaving.</li>
            <li> It is plenty long enough to reach comfortably to any spot on my back.</li>
            <li> The user is required to stick his razor (usually a disposable works just fine) in the opening provided on the Razorba.  </li>
            <li> Using a razor is the first thing you think of when shaving, but it doesn&#x27;t work the same on your back.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend it to a friend who was interested in cleaning up his back.</li>
            <li> It may not work for some people, in particular those who have some muscle on their back.</li>
            <li> No one enjoys having their significant other shave their back.</li>
            <li> and I can change my shirt in public whilst locking up the bicycle, takes a bit of getting used to the product especially the first use</li>
            <li> Unlike a mechanical back shaver I had tried before, this gear is sturdy, easy to use, and requires little maintenance to keep in working order.</li>
            <li> I just have little fine hair at back.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I think as long as you know how to shave, this product should be very intuitive.</li>
            <li> not many razor handles fit in it</li>
            <li> I  use it twice a week and focus on different  parts of the back each time, and it that way do not take more than a few mnutes each time.</li>
            <li> It does the job as expected, no fancy packaging, no useless add-ons.</li>
            <li> The first time using this to cut down a forest was pretty long</li>
            <li> A little hard to get the hang of, but it does a good job when u get used to the motion.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless less, it takes some getting used to but it works pretty well!</li>
            <li> Simple and huge (much larger than expected) but it works like a dream!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, they should let the ribbed handle for your grip run at least halfway up the shaft, so you can easily adjust for shorter length areas you want to reach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one and the first lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Why so much money for such a simple product!  </li>
            <li> When the product arrived I quickly found that my shaver from the Dollar Shave Club did not fit in the handle, but I thought that might be the case.  </li>
            <li> After extensive research, and using other not so good products (groomr) in the past I have learned the following: Nothing.</li>
            <li> While a little pricey, is worth its salt.</li>
            <li> The Razorba takes way too much time to get a good back shave due to its weird angles and lack of length.  </li>
            <li> Product was ok, just a little awkward to use, but I&#x27;m guessing that will get better with practice.</li>
            <li> Only issue is, the price could be a little less for what I&#x27;m actually getting, although I saw other products at much higher prices that I would never even consider spending that kind of money...</li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s a killer electric trimmer that shaves off long over growth with absolute ease.</li>
            <li> not much more to say - works as expected, no batteries and much better reach</li>
            <li> Your back hair is fairly soft so the stubble is not prickly</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is that the part that holds the razor only accepts the old 2-bladed razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much heftier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised a simple design would work so well!</li>
            <li> I made a longer handle by slipping a length of PVC pipe over the end of the handle and drilling a hole in the pipe and inserting a thumb bolt to tighten down and secure it.  </li>
            <li> you need a razor to have the handle  more or less round, so this way will stay on the razor handle.</li>
            <li> Seems quality constructed which goes against another persons review, seems solid enough where if someone broke into your house and your baseball bat wasn&#x27;t near, just grab the Razorba!  </li>
            <li> My first time I was not used to working the angles, so I used a double mirror technique by standing backwards in my bathroom mirror and holding a handheld mirror in my other hand.</li>
            <li> This product totally disappoints as the long rubber handle bends too much when pressing the razor against your back.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy hard plastic, and a disposable razor fits VERY snugly in the end of it.  </li>
            <li> It is a hard plastic with a rubber insert to hold the razor nice and firm.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hair stubble is visible with in 3 or 4 days, but this gives me a few days of worry free conscious that has allowed me to significantly increase activities I do \\&quot;in comfort\\&quot; and at any given moment.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, bulky and the angle on it doesn&#x27;t really provide the natural motion I need to use it well.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little coordination and some practice, but once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll be ready for the beach in no time!  </li>
            <li> When I first took it out of the box, I was a little concerned...</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to the first time.  </li>
            <li> I shave dry usually, using a light sawing motion w/o raising it off my skin , like mowing a lawn.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on more expensive back shavers.</li>
            <li> one upside is that the product is made of pretty heavy and seemingly durable material.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tough getting the shaving cream on but other than that it works great</li>
            <li> Well it really should for the cost, it is a little steep, but it is pretty heavy duty</li>
            <li> Its still a little awkward to keep the handle straight while your shaving your back, but with patience it can be done, but definitely takes more time than having someone else do it!</li>
            <li> I will say I do not have heavy back hair, but it does run down the full length of my back.  </li>
            <li> A previous commenter mentioned that you should sort of scratch back and forth instead of long gentle strokes like you use on your face.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that there is play where the razor is inserted and it is tough to shave the middle area of my back because the razor is not sitting firm on the area for a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young and active enough</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful and guide the razor only in the directions it is meant to go (perpendicular to the blades), you should find it a simple matter to shave your own back without cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sturdy product and was much less expensive than most other shavers I looked into.  </li>
            <li> Not very aesthetic design but no other complaints.</li>
            <li> #34;choke up&amp;#34; like a baseball bat, this felt like the natural way to hold the shaver, but it made for less contact with the razor blades to the back.</li>
            <li> For me, it was too close to a right angle from the handle and is very hard to properly pull it up my back.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to go over the same spot a dozen times because the hair is too long for the razor resulting in razor-burn.  </li>
            <li> Also, you may want to keep up with it and not let the hair grow back too long or your \\&quot;back\\&quot; to where you started.</li>
            <li> When I let the back hair get too long</li>
            <li> I anticipate this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the awkward back shaving experience...</li>
            <li> Pushing the non cutting way over the hair seemed to help stick it up for the pull back which got most of it.  </li>
            <li> After the redness went away (didn&#x27;t last anything crazy like days, more like 15 minutes hah)</li>
            <li> The closer areas are actually the most awkward to use this</li>
            <li> I found that it made shaving no easier than just reaching back with a razor and cant understand why anyone would pay this much money when a stick with tape would work at least as well.</li>
            <li> I thought the product a bit expensive for a hunk of plastic and bit more than half the price of a Mangroomer) but that said, the product does make back shaving simple.  </li>
            <li> I read positive and negative reviews about this</li>
            <li> But when you actually set it up, with the razor sticking out of this thing in one hand, a hand held mirror the other hand, looking at your back in a medicine cabinet mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a extremely hairy person, but what little hair I do have on my back</li>
            <li> Little sarcastic</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, its a little tricky to use, and doesnt do as complete a job as i would have hoped.</li>
            <li> Swimmers have been shaving their body hair for a long time, so I&#x27;m amazed it took so long for someone to conceive and market this device.    </li>
            <li> Monkey Boy.</li>
            <li> After using this a few times and after some frustration, I actually got a lot of my back done without using it, just reaching back wtih a razor in my hand.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, because of the shape, which resembles a razor, I thought it was just a long razor.  </li>
            <li> so I was not surprised.      </li>
            <li> This is basically a plastic handle with a short hollow tube on the end.</li>
            <li> The Razorba design places a long handle, then a tube, then the handle of your razor...</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t someone think of this a long time ago?  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about shaving my legs (TMI) and looked online for a long handled shaver.  </li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised, much larger than expected</li>
            <li> Should have ordered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Should have bought one a long time ago.....</li>
            <li> but grows too long.  </li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to pick one up.</li>
            <li> which is an incredibly long time to spend in the bathroom..</li>
            <li> Well I was a little worried that this might not live up to my expectations, but it has so far.</li>
            <li> I actually cut myself couple of times because I accidentally slid the razor slightly sideways on my back.  </li>
            <li> I wet down and apply shaving foam to my back by using a long handled back scrub brush with a wash cloth wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had due to the hair on my back.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come in some fancy custom box, only a standard box with a little instruction slip.  </li>
            <li> But the upper middle back is a challenge that usually results in my contorting myself in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, I&#x27;m back on the market looking for other options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product works, but it&#x27;s REALLY hard to completely shave your back and get 100% of the hair off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> The shaving cream can make it hard to tell where you need to shave, and your back isn&#x27;t like your face, where you have to be super delicate.  </li>
            <li> out of the shower and dry off&lt;br /&gt;-Look</li>
            <li> Both times worked very well, but I&#x27;ll admit that my back hair is thin and sparse, so you might want to take that into account.  </li>
            <li> Take it slow the first time you use it don&#x27;t try to press down, let the handle do the work.  </li>
            <li> With every single hair circling the shower drain, peace.  </li>
            <li> Shaving your back is not fun</li>
            <li> It feels very weird to feel your shirts actually touching your skin, I can feel any silkscreens too.</li>
            <li> It has no batteries to wear down, is durable enough to use as a war hammer, and is adaptable to any disposable razor.</li>
            <li> i just let the water run down my back while shaving.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend doing so, even if the risk is very small.    </li>
            <li> I looked at getting the other, more expensive Razorba&#x27;s they sell but don&#x27;t see what you gain!  </li>
            <li> He uses it dry and wet with disposables--</li>
            <li> No more cramping up while trying to reach the middle your back.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t mind showing off a little, but because of this paranoia of what others may think or say about my back I avoid going shirtless anywhere there may be others.  </li>
            <li> I got this for a friend who was a little bit embarassed about shaving their back hair.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but seems to he well made so it should last for a while. .</li>
            <li> Allows me to shave back hair that was otherwise not accessible.</li>
            <li> I would definitely follow the advice of others here, in that taking a little time to practice (preferably with the covered razor inserted)</li>
            <li> it gouges your back, and also its heavy.</li>
            <li> There are such few products out there to help guys with this problem</li>
            <li> My problem was stray hairs, below the shoulders and center of my back.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Product arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> but I just went and spent a couple of bucks on some disposables</li>
            <li> If a woman is expected to keep herself well, so should a guy.</li>
            <li> ; only takes a few minutes of practice.  </li>
            <li> As a disabled female, this helped me shave my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very stable but does the job.</li>
            <li> Granted, I am not very hairy</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m not very fond of how the razor attaches to the Razorba.</li>
            <li> It does help to arch your back a little when trying to get around the spinal area, but all other areas was a snap.  </li>
            <li> After researching and using other products I found a little gem called the Razorba Back Hair Shaver.</li>
            <li> Some method of being able to take care of that age-related crap on your back without having to resort to extreme and costly measures.</li>
            <li> tall and for me it is long enough, though a tall person might have a little trouble getting all the way to the ankle with it.</li>
            <li> The whole concept of using a small headed FACE razor for Heavy thick back hair MAKES NO SENSE...</li>
            <li> but I dont have to bend myself into sometimes painful positions to clean my back up.</li>
            <li> The end is round and pressure can be applied according to your taste simply by pulling down harder or lighter.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I should have been expected to know this prior to purchasing this product</li>
            <li> As the disposable blade dulls (usually 6-8 shaves) simply replace it.  </li>
            <li> As far as shaving cream goes, I&#x27;m not very hairy on my back at all, just a few thin groups of hair to eliminate, and I found just using water worked</li>
            <li> Its really embarassing to go ask someone to go shave your back for you, (even though I know my girl would do it) and the cost of waxing as a ritual just seemed too painful physically and monetarily.      </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Works as well as I expected!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Rather, I&#x27;m not sure why the opening isn&#x27;t simply adjustable</li>
            <li> it also has other uses.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t say that about the other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I could not find any other product that would come close to it.</li>
            <li> Also quite inexpensive compared to the other models.</li>
            <li> No more brushing a hairy back.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> No more back hair for me.</li>
            <li> Even then, there was a small area I couldn&#x27;t reach that I still had to get a second person to finish off.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than the expense of replacing disposal razors, it is designed to be practical.  </li>
            <li> I disagree with other reviewers who do a lot of prepping, cuz I dont.</li>
            <li> This device does exactly what it is supposed to do although, it is way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> No more back hair.</li>
            <li> First shaving was lengthy and difficult, but w/o any cuts.  </li>
            <li> It was a little awkward to use at first because I was being so careful, but by my 3rd use it was a breeze.    </li>
            <li> (I could conceive of a very wide opening that has screws to lock any razor in place).  </li>
            <li> Works for reaching the hard to reach center parts of the back...</li>
            <li> I am not very flexible and I definitely can get to the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I have always left my shirt on when at the beach,  just hanging out in my yard doing yard work or worse, avoid getting in pools with my child just because I was embarrassed of my back hair.   </li>
            <li> Being an Italian hair ball who finally got tired of it, I researched them all online and picked this method of \\&quot;self hair</li>
            <li> Barbasol&#x27;s the least expensive yet creates a nice thick fluffy cloud of cream,</li>
            <li> I placed one hand where its supposed to be and the other just below the \\&quot;head.\\&quot;   Angle, and pull down.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an extension for a shaver, since I am unable to reach the bottom of my left leg due to a major surgery.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This must weigh about 2lbs and in addition to helping you reach hard to shave spots, could double as a weapon in the event you needed to defend yourself during a home invasion.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use at first</li>
            <li> Unlike others, I don&#x27;t like to put \\&quot;shaving cream\\&quot; on the back because it&#x27;s hard for me to \\&quot;see\\&quot; the spots that have been shaved versus where I need to go over again.  </li>
            <li> At first a little difficult to use, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Takes some getting use to, but all in all reaches those places that are hard to shave in the back.</li>
            <li> It reaches all the hard to reach spots on your back.</li>
            <li> This technique I use does red the skin pretty badly but for me it was just misleading.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have somebody to shave your back, you probably don&#x27;t have anybody to massage your shoulder muscles (at least I don&#x27;t at the moment).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this for a loooooong time...even back in the late 80s.  </li>
            <li> but my back hair is long and thin.</li>
            <li> I was about ready to throw this thing out the window until I decided to try it, it seemed silly.  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy so while I recommend it, it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;ll ever need to buy another.</li>
            <li> They were all common basic razors that the instructions stated should have worked.</li>
            <li> But so far it does the trick, I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> My advice is to shave slowly, using short strokes.  </li>
            <li> And you definitely want to use it both pulling up from over the shoulder and pulling down from around the side as, at least in my case</li>
            <li> Getting started, you must have someone \\&quot;trim\\&quot; the hair down a bit.  </li>
            <li> , now I can tighten down on the razor</li>
            <li> shaved down with an electric trimmer.</li>
            <li> If your a wolfman, i&#x27;d have someone shave it down with a pair of clippers before you use this, after that</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-Watch clumps of hair go down the drain</li>
            <li> While some other products look like they might get the job done a little quicker, I like the fact that the Razorba is a one-time purchase.</li>
            <li> But this product really has so far solved the annoying problem of reaching the hard to reach areas of my back.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a little hard to get bigger razors like Fusion in and oit of holder.</li>
            <li> A little too much flexion made it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> so your razor feels much, much less in your control</li>
            <li> Was way less irritation than I thought there would be.</li>
            <li> Any looseness from this part of the shaver and you might as well be duct taping your razor to a cut in half broom handle.</li>
            <li> No special and costly specialty blades.</li>
            <li> This thing is a little awkward, but i gotta admit it really does work!</li>
            <li> Although some angles are a little tight.</li>
            <li> Strange angle and difficult to get the middle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flaw, the device that holds the razor comes loose if you need to pull hard to remove your razor from the Razorba.</li>
            <li> This product does the job but is a little bit pricey for what it is ... it does work though</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey for what it is abut works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to it</li>
            <li> After a little experimenting it works as claimed.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on electronic back shavers that either didn&#x27;t fulfill the purpose (bad design), broke down within months, needed pricey blade replacements, or just didn&#x27;t cut close enough.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy and could be made a little lighter.</li>
            <li> The length of the whole contraption makes it a little awkward, but it works.  </li>
            <li> I found that I could still fit Gillette Fusion razor in the base model (with a little squeezing).  </li>
            <li> Worked as advertised for a few months then one day while removing the razor the gray tubing that holds the razor in place completely came out of the end rendering my Razorba useless.  </li>
            <li> A mirror may be helpful, but after a few times, you probably won&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> then I guess the user will have trouble with razor being stable in the sleeve.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my husband who was tired of asking his wife to shave his back during the summer months.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few times to get the knack of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick, so it fits well in the hand without slipping around, even when you grasp it along portion of the handle without the finger grips.  </li>
            <li> but after a few times its a lot easier.</li>
            <li> and I could definitely see how one false move could result in a poke in the eye with the blade.  </li>
            <li> this is made of plastic but is stiff and holds the razer well.</li>
            <li> If it starts giving me any problems in the near future I will definitely repost, but for now, I highly recommend the shaver and it has solved a very annoying and frustrating problem of reaching those hard to reach areas.those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> The resulting flexing of the handle makes it impossible to press firmly against the back when reaching to shave the areas I cannot get to by simply holding the razor in my hand.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product 100% for anyone looking tame the caveman in them.</li>
            <li> to say,  she was never excited about this!</li>
            <li> The other was a Gillette Fusion and it also was no good.</li>
            <li> Maybe for those who have small patches of manhood.</li>
            <li> I do have a small mirror on the shower wall that helps me with guidance.  </li>
            <li> No more asking the Girlfriend for the weekly shave.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t allowed to bend past a 90 degree angle</li>
            <li> I would shy away from public pools, beach, etc.  </li>
            <li> I always had to have my wife shave my back and needless</li>
            <li> There is not a better one on the market.</li>
            <li> One thing I initially did wrong was &amp;</li>
            <li> No more hair gel.</li>
            <li> , hair on the back tends to grow at rather random angles.  </li>
            <li> No more imposing on someone else for help.</li>
            <li> Remebember with this contraption: you ARE using a FACE razor to clip DIFFICULT back hair??.Which you will find out that the face razor get CLOGGED approx every 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> very heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> It is very firm.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use hard to get all hair off back.</li>
            <li> If you HATE having back hair, and have no one you can con into shaving your back for you, this is a MUST HAVE product.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on someone with thick dense hair.  </li>
            <li> The others go dull and irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> hard to feel which way is up</li>
            <li> The smell of nair makes me vomit, and I still couldn&#x27;t get those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s hard to find these days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The angle might be hard to master, as your razor will have some curve to it.  </li>
            <li> It enables you to reach the hard to reach places that your arm just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> You can reach those hard to reach areas that you just can&#x27;t get to.</li>
            <li> I hardly think about it since I leave it in the shower and use it when needed.</li>
            <li> It will take at least once or twice to get used to the angles and</li>
            <li> Big disappointment is this product.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.</li>
            <li> My brother in law was in desperate need for one of these and actually requested it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of pressure and just slowly skimmed from side to side.  </li>
            <li> Unless you had a really thick razor handle, I think this would work with just about any razor you have.  </li>
            <li> Backhair comes in thick for me.</li>
            <li> I was sick of contorting myself to get the few patches on my back</li>
            <li> waited a while to purchase the Razorba because I was skeptical after my experience with the other one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;won&#x27;t ever have to purchase another one since this one is almost indestructible, and I mean that literally.  </li>
            <li> I mean, you can&#x27;t expect it to angle the razor for you</li>
            <li> but, I seriously doubt it.    </li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to keep the razor blade flat against the skin to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Saves dislocating your shoulder to reach those hard spots!</li>
            <li> It is not flimsy or weak.</li>
            <li> And when used in conjunction with the applicator brushes (sponges) will keep that nasty hair off your back and you don&#x27;t have clogged drains due to hair by keeping that forest &amp;#34;mowed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Makes it tough areas acessable</li>
            <li> But no more!!  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible design, there is no flex,and if you dont hold it perfectly straight</li>
            <li> Just enough to be annoying.  </li>
            <li> , the Razorba tends to let smaller handle razors &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; around as you are using it, which is inefficient as well as annoying as all heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So tactile feel is poor and the razor flexes and moves around within the tube</li>
            <li> Worse than that, we would be considered weird.&lt;br /&gt;Men who dyed their hair?  </li>
            <li> This is a game changer.</li>
            <li> Why does amazon allow false info?</li>
            <li> I just need one that has a hair indicator for all the very small patches I miss!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> The beauty in the Razorba is the simplistic design.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why they are so expensive-</li>
            <li> beyond any manner of twisted wrist reach.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Razorba\\</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product doesnt work well.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go  wrong with the razorba.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Razorba</li>
            <li> Simplistic design and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Asking me to change my razor to use this product seems a bit unrealistic.  </li>
            <li> Its gross, disgusting and its a pain to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The product is kinda expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Terrible... only used it once and the inside piece came off.</li>
            <li> Overall, one of the worst purchases I have ever made online!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mind chest hair, but back hair looks terrible.  </li>
            <li> Disposables cost me mere pennies.</li>
            <li> no need to get any expensive, fancy 3-4-5 blade gimmicks.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> What I do have is a broken shoulder, hip and pelvis which makes shaving my legs impossible.  </li>
            <li> It may have been a bit awkward, but it worked and I didn&#x27;t get any cuts or irritation.  </li>
            <li> Its awkward and the razor isnt snug</li>
            <li> kinda awkward to use as well.</li>
            <li> The weight distribution on this is awkward and I never got used to it.  </li>
            <li> Was shocked with the simplicity and effectiveness</li>
            <li> I feel stupid for buying this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worthless</li>
            <li> Deal with the fact that you and me have some terrible issues!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Awful awful awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a terrible design, there is no flex,and if you dont hold it perfectly straight it gouges your back, and also its heavy. I made one out of a coathanger double in a half circle and taped a razor to the end that works much better then this does....</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide.  The Razorbak relies on the handle of the razor fitting into a rubber tube to hold it in place.  The Fusion Pro Glide handle isn&#x27;t wide enough to fit snugly in the tube.  It fell out twice during my shower and the razor was damaged when it hit the shower.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the awkward back shaving experience... Just make sure you get a razor wide enough to stay put.</li>
            <li> I read positive and negative reviews about this so I was unsure when I ordered it if it was going to do the trick.  Follow the positive reviews advice, like (1) give it time, the first or second use you are learning how to make it work for you, (2) the idea of putting shaving cream on the wall of the shower and rubbing your back on that was perfect for the one spot I couldn&#x27;t reach, but now I just use that method for my entire back.  After about the 4th use it just clicked with me on how to use it, and yes, you do have to sometimes twist and get into positions that are hardly natural.  I&#x27;m young and active enough I find it no problem -- older and/or inactive people will probably have a longer adjustment period or find the device may just not be able to work for them.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this but it really works.  Does not hold Gillette Fusion but does hold thinner razors well.</li>
            <li> Holds my Mach 3 like a champ. While in the shower, I just get some good soap suds going and do my best to get some on my back, then glance over at my shaving mirror on wall to ensure I&#x27;m on the right path. Reaches all over easily. I then tuck it away in the vanity ASAP to avoid jeering from house guests.</li>
            <li> Works Great, Easy to Use, Fits all my Razors (Different Gillette Razors) Shipped Quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband, who has always tried to keep himself neat and fit. He absolutely loves this new gizmo, and I don&#x27;t have to help him shave his back anymore.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The Razorba works great! One time well spent and I am enjoying to use it to shave my husband back hair or of cause, he can do it himself. Non-slip handle is so nice to use in the shower! I give this one 5 stars.</li>
            <li> great for solo use.  follow instructions</li>
            <li> Using a razor is the first thing you think of when shaving, but it doesn&#x27;t work the same on your back.  Sometimes you have to go over the same spot a dozen times because the hair is too long for the razor resulting in razor-burn.  If you nick yourself you won&#x27;t be able to reach back there to blot.  If you don&#x27;t know you nicked yourself, you&#x27;ll have a nice red blotch on the back of your shirt.</li>
            <li> This simple product does what it is supposed too...hold a razer at the end of a stick so you can self shave your back.  It takes some getting used too, and being flexible is a must, but this did the trick for me.  It sure beat&#x27;s using a paint stick with razor duct taped to the end!</li>
            <li> The beauty in the Razorba is the simplistic design. I had paid $40 for an over-priced Mangroomer that was so cheap it broke &amp; jammed after a couple uses. I turned to the Razorba since it looked simple &amp; straightforward. After the first use I was very pleased. It has no batteries to wear down, is durable enough to use as a war hammer, and is adaptable to any disposable razor. And no small parts to break. A real winner for us carpet-backs!</li>
            <li> I have always had the dilemma of having a smooth back.  Having my partner shave my back was always problematic with scheduling etc..  It&#x27;s nice to be able to do it myself!  I have a Schick Razor attached to it and it works great!  I highly recommend the shaving cream applicator they sell to!  I haven&#x27;t gotten one myself yet, but can see that it&#x27;s very useful!  I looked at getting the other, more expensive Razorba&#x27;s they sell but don&#x27;t see what you gain!  This one is perfect from what I can tell!    It&#x27;s very easy to use once you get used to reversing what you see in the mirror!</li>
            <li> Swimmers have been shaving their body hair for a long time, so I&#x27;m amazed it took so long for someone to conceive and market this device.    In a nutshell, it works after you get the hang of it.  Give yourself three or four efforts.  You&#x27;ll really want to try it after a shower in front of a fairly large bathroom mirror.  I also recommend that you get back in the shower for a minute after using to wash off any stuck hairs.    There are versions of this thing that are double the price, but I really can&#x27;t see how you could do much to improve upon what is essentially a angled plastic gripper.  Any version would take a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear. There isn&#x27;t one clear winning solution for shaving your back. Maybe for those who have small patches of manhood. But for us testosterone bursting men who have been endowed with a forest of the stuff, this is the best solution I have found. Getting started, you must have someone \\&quot;trim\\&quot; the hair down a bit.  Then the Razorba can do its trick. Otherwise, your razor will clog. The Razorbo holds the razor well. I use cheap disposables for the back. The handle can get slippery. You will have to stretch to reach the middle of your back, but it will get easier with practice. Also, you may want to keep up with it and not let the hair grow back too long or your \\&quot;back\\&quot; to where you started. My wife is thankful for that. 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Wow. Talk about ease and simplicity. Makes shaving/grooming a whole lot easier. Seller is also a very valuable asset to amazon and it&#x27;s community. Fast shipping. Highly recommend. A+++ Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This product works well - if you know the trick.  Use a Gillette Mach 3 handle with a Venus Divine blade.  Trust me - it works and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> The instructions recommend the use of eye protection.  At first, that seemed too cautious.  But when you actually set it up, with the razor sticking out of this thing in one hand, a hand held mirror the other hand, looking at your back in a medicine cabinet mirror, it&#x27;s disorienting and I could definitely see how one false move could result in a poke in the eye with the blade.  I put my glasses on.  I highly recommend doing so, even if the risk is very small.    It may have been a bit awkward, but it worked and I didn&#x27;t get any cuts or irritation.  I think with time it will get easier.</li>
            <li> This is for all the non believers.  I just purchased this product June 2010 with hopes that this product would finally give me back my freedom after 15 years of embarrassment I&#x27;ve had due to the hair on my back.  I have always left my shirt on when at the beach,  just hanging out in my yard doing yard work or worse, avoid getting in pools with my child just because I was embarrassed of my back hair.   I am in pretty good shape so I wouldn&#x27;t mind showing off a little, but because of this paranoia of what others may think or say about my back I avoid going shirtless anywhere there may be others.  There are such few products out there to help guys with this problem so I decided to purchase the Razorba.  After my first use I was ecstatic.  It was a little awkward to use at first because I was being so careful, but by my 3rd use it was a breeze.    I will say I do not have heavy back hair, but it does run down the full length of my back.  I do use this while showering.  I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of pressure and just slowly skimmed from side to side.  It does help to arch your back a little when trying to get around the spinal area, but all other areas was a snap.  I don&#x27;t use shaving cream, but you might need to if you have a lot of hair.  I do have a small mirror on the shower wall that helps me with guidance.  I am using a Schick ST2 razor which fits fine in the product.  Unfortunately my hair stubble is visible with in 3 or 4 days, but this gives me a few days of worry free conscious that has allowed me to significantly increase activities I do \\&quot;in comfort\\&quot; and at any given moment.  I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone with back hair. THANKS RAZORBA.!</li>
            <li> Good price.&lt;br /&gt;Clever design.&lt;br /&gt;Mach 3 works best in the head.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps you from being a Yeti....wife is good with it.</li>
            <li> Life is so much more beautiful</li>
            <li> When I received the Razorba the first thing I did was try and see if it would easily hold 3 different razors that I had in the house. Two were disposable (Schick &amp; Gillette) and neither one would work. The other was a Gillette Fusion and it also was no good. So what special razor works with this thing? I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Hair must be clipped short prior to using the Razorba.  Otherwise it won&#x27;t cut anything. Frequent rinsing of the razor is required.  I have gone back to the Mangroomer because it is so much easier to use, but the result isn&#x27;t as smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the amazing reviews I had read on Amazon.  I love it.  In fact I am getting ready to go to a pool party right now, something that I would have passed on had it not been for the Razorba.  One thing that I noticed, after pulling a muscle on my shoulder, is the products multipurpose benefits.  I used the none razor side to massage a giant knot out of my shoulder.  The end is round and pressure can be applied according to your taste simply by pulling down harder or lighter.  I placed one hand where its supposed to be and the other just below the \\&quot;head.\\&quot;   Angle, and pull down.  I&#x27;m telling you, it felt really nice.  If you don&#x27;t have somebody to shave your back, you probably don&#x27;t have anybody to massage your shoulder muscles (at least I don&#x27;t at the moment).  This solves two problems!!!  BUY IT NOW!</li>
            <li> Very easy and straightforward in using. I just took a Walgreens Twin Blade Plus razor, inserted it, and the rest was intuitive. I was able to access every area of my back in which back hair was growing. I highly recommend the Razorba for its ease and simplicity.</li>
            <li> Shaving your back is not fun but I can&#x27;t stand having hair on it. The Razorba will hold your disposable razor but it&#x27;s still tricky because you really can&#x27;t see what your doing. But if you keep at it you will get better. I found this one for $20 on Amazon but most places sell them for a lot more. I can&#x27;t understand why they are so expensive- they are just plastic. But there really isn&#x27;t anything else that works any better.</li>
            <li> Does the job, fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it. Makes for a smooth back and saves lots of money. I thought after a couple of days growth the stubble would be a problem but it isn&#x27;t. Your back hair is fairly soft so the stubble is not prickly and it&#x27;s easy to shave more often if you want to.</li>
            <li> Nice to hold your razor and shave your own back. Not as good as the electic version tho.  However, cheaper and works well.</li>
            <li> I at first tried one of the eclectic kinds and the arm wouldn&#x27;t stay locked in place.  This way it&#x27;s always at the right position and will shave a lot closer then the electric shavers.  Before I got this item, you should&#x27;ve seen what I used at first.  It was a vise with a duct-taped on razor.  This works much better.  :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  It made the laser hair removal treatment go WAY smoother. (get it, smoother?)</li>
            <li> My problem was stray hairs, below the shoulders and center of my back.&lt;br /&gt;Just beyond any manner of twisted wrist reach.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Razorba\\&quot; makes the task easy. The angle is right, the grip is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;No batteries or cords to deal with changing. Just insert a plastic razor and go.&lt;br /&gt;The inserted razor does not slip or rotate, it stays in place, until you remove it.</li>
            <li> I love this and have used it for years. I upgraded to the Razorba Sum3 Power and it&#x27;s the new classic. The Sum3 is the best of both shaving worlds: attach a razor like the razorba and shave OR use the electric trimmer. Actually, it&#x27;s a killer electric trimmer that shaves off long over growth with absolute ease. The motor on this thing hums like head hair clippers</li>
            <li> Great Product. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this for a loooooong time...even back in the late 80s.  I&#x27;m flexible but over the years I think shaving my own back without assistance has taken a toll on my shoulders - I&#x27;m a design engineer...I made my own version of this with a steel pipe and could make another if I wanted to, but this design is ergonomically perfect for the job and holds a thin handled razor perfectly (I use a Mach 3 disposable).  Save your shoulders and save your wax money &amp; get one of these gems...</li>
            <li> Chewbacca. Monkey Boy. Captain Caveman. These are the names that I&#x27;ve had to endure over the years. But no more!!  With every swipe of the razor, years of torment and abuse were literally stripped away.  With every stroke of the razor, sweet satisfaction.  With every single hair circling the shower drain, peace.  My dear Razorba Back Hair Shaver, you are indeed a godsend. I am once again human. Dear, dear Razorba, you are truly my greatest hero.</li>
            <li> Do what you can reach with a regular razor. Then insert it in the Rezorba and easily shave where you couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Good product</li>
            <li> After using this a few times and after some frustration, I actually got a lot of my back done without using it, just reaching back wtih a razor in my hand.  I didn&#x27;t know I could contort so well, but I do use it for the places I can&#x27;t reach, I would recommend using a mirror.</li>
            <li> For some reason, because of the shape, which resembles a razor, I thought it was just a long razor.  So when we opened it, we were alittle surprised that it wasn&#x27;t.  You have to attach your own razor. If a person has problem raising/bending their arms, this product is not for them.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a good idea, but not in my husbands case.  I will still have to do the job for him! Ugh!</li>
            <li> While some other products look like they might get the job done a little quicker, I like the fact that the Razorba is a one-time purchase. It works with the razor and blades you already use for your face, so there&#x27;s no need to keep buying separate special blades for this. This was just what I needed. Works well.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Make sure use a grease razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman but I have a really Harry back. My husband calls me queen of the amazons. But know more. I no have any hair on me back. Hahaha I&#x27;ll shown him an amazon. He&#x27;s really really rediculosuly good looking.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and does a good job if razor is new. The only problem is the razor falling out of holder. Have to make sure it is firmly in place.</li>
            <li> So I pull this thing out of the box... It didn&#x27;t come in some fancy custom box, only a standard box with a little instruction slip.  The packing was overkill but fine...  After I pulled it out of the box it sure seemed small and I thought to myself it might take a contortionist to be able to use this properly.  So later that day I read the slip&#x27;s instructions and followed them.  While I&#x27;m using it it was definitely a chore to get it to work properly... and then... MAGIC!  I tried using a \\&quot;back scratching\\&quot; technique, easy back and forths over the areas that needed cleaning up.  Pushing the non cutting way over the hair seemed to help stick it up for the pull back which got most of it.  The first time using this to cut down a forest was pretty long but since then it&#x27;s been a breeze.  This technique I use does red the skin pretty badly but for me it was just misleading.  After the redness went away (didn&#x27;t last anything crazy like days, more like 15 minutes hah) I didn&#x27;t have any cuts and no sores developed after time.  Guess that&#x27;s why they want you to use antibacterial soap, etc etc (it&#x27;s all in the instructions).  Oh and as for the picture of the guy easily reaching over his back to hit the spots... I didn&#x27;t use it from that angle at all.  I ended up using a from the side approach, under armed for mid/lower back, over armed for shoulder blades.      All in all, works great for me.  No issues as of yet owning it for probably a month.  Seems quality constructed which goes against another persons review, seems solid enough where if someone broke into your house and your baseball bat wasn&#x27;t near, just grab the Razorba!  The highest quality in home defense!...  Little sarcastic but it is pretty solid.       Would definitely recommend it to a friend who was interested in cleaning up his back.</li>
            <li> This thing works as advertised.  It&#x27;s a wonderful level of freedom if you&#x27;ve relied on others to assist you with this dirty task.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool for the job.  Well made and well-priced.  Love it.</li>
            <li> To all guys out there....&lt;br /&gt;Jut pull out the rubber and put it the &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Styler&amp;#34;. its a perfect fit and you have a great power razor,no need to mess with cheep razors...&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0062IWQVU/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_sfl_title_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its working great for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I think this works really good. Did not want to buy the more expensive versions even though I wanted to use my Fusion razor, but I use a good disposable with this basic model. It will take at least once or twice to get used to the angles and what not but after the second time of using I can now hit up my back for some manscapping in about 10 minutes. Now , I do not have much back hair at all so this version works really good for me using just a disposable razor, now if you have a back like a Yetti then you may need the more expensive Razorba models so you can use a higher end razor, but this model was a good purchase. I am happy with this model and definately give it two thumbs up..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the man groomer.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything --Everything!! -- and this is the first product to actually, consistently get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to find a solution to my upper middle back hair problem. I&#x27;m able to get the rest off with a razor. But the upper middle back is a challenge that usually results in my contorting myself in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Mangroomer Pro, and it worked maybe 20% of the time. I&#x27;d hover it over and over and it wouldn&#x27;t get the hair out. Finally, it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom, and it worked maybe 30% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Remington body and back groomer. Still no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product works, and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no adjusting. My Schick Xtreme3 Sensitive razor fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I just shaved my back. I wasn&#x27;t sure I was hitting anything, but when I was done, the hair was gone and I had a smooth back. I&#x27;ve tried it 5 more times just to make sure. And it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Works great. It&#x27;s a little tough getting the shaving cream on but other than that it works great</li>
            <li> I purchased one originally it worked well enough that I bought two more for my sons. It is a little heavy and could be made a little lighter. The most drawback was that all razors do not fit. You will need to put some type of tape around razor handle to make it fit firmer.&lt;br /&gt;But it did make shaving your back a lot easier. It only took one time using it to get used to the feel.&lt;br /&gt;Could be cheaper in price</li>
            <li> Used it three times so far.  Each time I get better.  I think it&#x27;s an acquired skill, but definitely can be learned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the blue basic model for years and it works great, with a couple of modifications I made.  I made a longer handle by slipping a length of PVC pipe over the end of the handle and drilling a hole in the pipe and inserting a thumb bolt to tighten down and secure it.  I found there was too much razor movement so I drilled a hole on top of the Razorba  where the razor is inserted and once again used a thumb bolt to tighten it down.  I was concerned the bolt would cut through the plastic tube so I inserted some curved aluminum sheet metal on the top where the bolt clamps down, now I can tighten down on the razor handle securely but not tear up the plastic tube.  Works great when you get used to working with two mirrors.  The BIC Disposable razor is the one to use, it has a single blade which rinses out easily and is of ridged construction so it doesn&#x27;t flex.  I wet down and apply shaving foam to my back by using a long handled back scrub brush with a wash cloth wrapped around it.  When I let the back hair get too long I use the Mangroomer electric back shaver, it works well on longer hair, you can go forward or backward when using it.  There you have it, self grooming back hair expertise.  UGH!</li>
            <li> I was sick of contorting myself to get the few patches on my back shaved down with an electric trimmer. I gave this a shot, and DAMN! Once you get your technique down, it really does a exceptional job!    If your a wolfman, i&#x27;d have someone shave it down with a pair of clippers before you use this, after that, your regular shavings will be a piece of cake.....</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this item before placing my order. One of the reviewers guessed that the old/cheaper version would also work with most razors so, I ordered the cheap version and guess what? It works just fine with my Gillette Fusion and Pro-Glide razors! It is a bit of a tight fight but it must be as there are no tightening screws or clamps of any kind. I like the product but question the ethics of the company that is marketing these items. It seems to me that we get ripped-off badly enough without the need for a company that sells an item that likely costs them all of $2-3 to manufacture and then sell them for $30 and then, on top of this, they try to scam us into paying more than 2 times for an already overpriced product because they make us believe that the cheap version will not accomodate the newer blade handles! Maybe my Fusion is the exception but, I seriously doubt it.    Can you spell deceptive trade practices and class action litigation?     I can....</li>
            <li> Does the job much better than more expensive electric wands that break easily.</li>
            <li> Each time I use the Razorba it gets quicker and easier. I use it every month or so with a Mach 3 and it is very easy and effective.  It&#x27;s important to have a mirror nearby to check your results and which areas need work, but with practice, it becomes almost second nature.  I have been tempted to upgrade to the war hammer[[ASIN:B002MUAP5G Razorba War Hammer Back Hair Shaver]] and a fusion razor, but in reality the results achieved with this and the Mach 3 have been excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - does not hold most of the new razors.  They fall out consistently, as this is really just a piece of plastic with a rubber insert in the end meant to grasp the back of the razor.  You could make your own with a yardstick and duct tape - it would work just as well and save you 30 bucks</li>
            <li> Great quality Product</li>
            <li> The Razorba back shaver is a must have in every hairy guys bathroom arsenal.  It takes a little coordination and some practice, but once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll be ready for the beach in no time!  The razor holder is \\&quot;universal\\&quot;, however it tends to hold razors with slimmer handles more securely.  So far I have achieved the best results using a gel type shaving cream in the shower.  A mirror may be helpful, but after a few times, you probably won&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product doesnt work well.  Its awkward and the razor isnt snug</li>
            <li> Allows me to do a complete shave.</li>
            <li> The Razorba is awesome! It makes shaving your own back one of the easiest tasks.</li>
            <li> The best product for the purpose of personal back shaving ever. Now don&#x27;t have to ask someone else to help. Does just as advertised. Don&#x27;t pay attention to all the reviews that tell you different methods, some time consuming. I dry shave with it with only a simple stationary two blade Good News with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> This interesting product reached the back areas for shaving but you must have a degree of dexterity. The biggest problem is that the part that holds the razor only accepts the old 2-bladed razors. This leads to having to do multiple passes and many skin cuts. If you think it is tricky applying the shaving cream and then shaving, try putting stiptick to the razor cuts!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Dont have a girlfriend to shave my back so this makes it possible lol</li>
            <li> The Razorba is easy to use and has awesome results. I can shave my back from many angles to get a close shave. It&#x27;s flaw, the device that holds the razor comes loose if you need to pull hard to remove your razor from the Razorba.</li>
            <li> This product does the job but is a little bit pricey for what it is ... it does work though</li>
            <li> Works for reaching the hard to reach center parts of the back...</li>
            <li> A little hard to get the hang of, but it does a good job when u get used to the motion. Also, it is a little hard to get bigger razors like Fusion in and oit of holder. Better with smaller handled razors</li>
            <li> I thought it was better than what it is.may be  i need more instruction on it since I didn&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li> I got the razorba around 6 years ago and it has been a great  investment. Its easy and fast to use and can be done just  before the pool or beach. Simple problem and simple  solution. I recently upgraded to the war model. You can&#x27;t go  wrong with the razorba. Just get it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. I use with Gillette custom disposable razors.</li>
            <li> This product totally disappoints as the long rubber handle bends too much when pressing the razor against your back. The resulting flexing of the handle makes it impossible to press firmly against the back when reaching to shave the areas I cannot get to by simply holding the razor in my hand. Big disappointment is this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He&#x27;s always been a hairy dude, but wanted to do something about it. I remembered seeing this advertised years ago, so when he asked me to find something to help him shave, I immediately remembered this. It arrived quickly and it&#x27;s super simple to use and he loves it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works great. Just Hope the holding sleave holds up. After use be sure to remove razor if not it can streach out the insert sleve then I guess the user will have trouble with razor being stable in the sleeve.</li>
            <li> The seller is great and shipping was very fast.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works great and is compatible with all razors</li>
            <li> Very handy for women who have had hip surgery and need a long handle for leg shaving. A bit heavy.</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for . recieved promtly</li>
            <li> This is a good product idea.  It definitely can save you big $$$ and free you from pain vs waxing.</li>
            <li> This thing helps greatly. I have back hair that I simply cannot reach. With the Razorba I can get rid of it. Is it a pain in the ass? Of course. Is it fun? No. But with this device it is gone. That&#x27;s all I want. Nobody likes back hair. Women think it&#x27;s gross. This thing will help you get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Saves dislocating your shoulder to reach those hard spots!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my back.  Just enough to be annoying.  This worked perfectly for me.  Was able to hit the pool with out feeling self conscience.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product..it came in really handy for him because he had rotator cuff surgery and couldn&#x27;t shave his back.</li>
            <li> this is made of plastic but is stiff and holds the razer well. i can shave my back with ease in the shower. i just let the water run down my back while shaving. i dont even use shaving cream or lather up soap but my back hair is long and thin. yours may vary</li>
            <li> When I bought this I thought the handle was going to be flexible so that you could bend it to the right angle that works for the individual using it.  However, it is not.  It is solid and fixes the razor in one position.  For me, it was too close to a right angle from the handle and is very hard to properly pull it up my back.  With some practice I&#x27;ve been able to use it, but it would have worked a lot better for me if the razor was at a steeper angle and closer to being inline with the handle.  For others, the angle it comes with might be perfect.  It all depends on the individual.  Good idea, but a flexible handle would have made more sense.    Pros:  Holds the razor well.  The razor doesn&#x27;t try to move or shift at all when in the holder.    Cons:  The angle the razor is held at is fixed.  It may not work for some people, in particular those who have some muscle on their back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used razorba products since I saw the back shaver on the Rachael Ray Show where it got great reviews from the panel so I gave it a try. And glad I did. The beauty of this product is in it&#x27;s simplicity, there are no moving parts that can break. And you get a shave just like your face with a safety razor. Maxim reviews gave it top marks as the best product for back shaving. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Razorba and it&#x27;s been around forever so you know you can trust them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the standard for back shaving, just do it.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled. very heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> It works great, I&#x27;m surprised no one has come up with a copy for less then 5 bucks. Until then if you can&#x27;t reach your back hair this works.</li>
            <li> Works as well as I expected! If you have a lot of hair it will take some extra time and patience!</li>
            <li> easy to use, very well made. I recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trying to use this in the shower. Yea...no. You need a large mirror you can turn sideways to so you can see what you&#x27;re doing, and your middle back is near-impossible to do quickly. Of course, your first shave will take MUCH longer than subsequent ones, as you&#x27;ll be stopping to clear the razor every swipe or so.  I wish the handle was longer, and I wish the angle was different so the spine area was easier to shave.  A previous commenter mentioned that you should sort of scratch back and forth instead of long gentle strokes like you use on your face. DO THIS. I was about ready to throw this thing out the window until I decided to try it, it seemed silly.  Once you get the hang of it, you get a really nice, clean shave. It feels very weird to feel your shirts actually touching your skin, I can feel any silkscreens too. I wasn&#x27;t especially hairy--but wow what a difference.</li>
            <li> Simplistic design and gets the job done.  It&#x27;s compatible with some of the popular razors that can be found at almost every store, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  It works best with razors with round handles like a Gillette Excel.  But, any razor with a roundish handle will work fine.  I use the Bic Comfort Twin disposable razors.  The Razorba works great for maneuvering around the back more easily and now I don&#x27;t have to be self-conscious anymore when I take off my shirt.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works very well, am able to reach all areas of my entire back and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. I can shave my back easily in the shower and maintenance is easy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband.  We were a bit skeptical at first, but now we both agree that this is a great device.  Super easy to use.  Great design and construction.  He loves it and that is all that matters to me :)</li>
            <li> Very simple product, works great! I&#x27;ve heard some say it doesn&#x27;t work well enough or that they cut themselves with it, but I&#x27;ve never had either of these problems at all. Frankly, I think as long as you know how to shave, this product should be very intuitive. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It does what is described. I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s worth the price, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Works very well, able to reach all areas of my entire back with this, just replace the blade when necessary.</li>
            <li> Was shocked with the simplicity and effectiveness</li>
            <li> This is a good product that does exactly what it says. The only challenge you, as a prospective buyer, are going to have just looking at the Amazon picture is you don&#x27;t get a sense of how this back-hair shaver is substantial and well made. It is not flimsy or weak. Although it is not heavy, when it arrived its weight surprised me. I have a lot of confidence that it won&#x27;t crack or break under pressure. It is plenty long enough to reach comfortably to any spot on my back. I recommend this item without hesitation for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay hundreds of dollars for laser hair removal or who doesn&#x27;t want to go through the pain and agony of waxing. Get this Razorba, a can of decent shaving gel, and a good mirror, and go to town. It works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help me shave my legs. I have an arthritic hip and cannot reach that far. This product seems pricey, but is very sturdy and well made. Once I placed a razor in the holder, it is very secure and doesn&#x27;t shift or get out of control. But, keep in mind that once in the holder, I cannot get it out. It is very firm. Plan to use a razor with a refillable cartridge, that will stay in this holder. Good product, I recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the weight on the handle to be able shave, the only remark I have is the you need a razor to have the handle  more or less round, so this way will stay on the razor handle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the number of positive reviews.  The Razorba takes way too much time to get a good back shave due to its weird angles and lack of length.  Add the fact its $30, and this is a 1 star product.  Go ahead and get the Mangroomer if you want a good shave in less time.</li>
            <li> Great product, saves me so much time. Product arrived faster than expected. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This thing works like a champ! Do not waste your money on more expensive back shavers. This got all the hair off and is extremely easy to use. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wish I had done this  sooner!  Even old Atra razors fit this and do very well----thanks a lot for this</li>
            <li> Product was ok, just a little awkward to use, but I&#x27;m guessing that will get better with practice. Seems to fit a couple of the razors that I have with no problem, but may not fit some of the more &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; razors out there. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with your product. Only issue is, the price could be a little less for what I&#x27;m actually getting, although I saw other products at much higher prices that I would never even consider spending that kind of money...</li>
            <li> I bought what was described, thanks.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> strong construction, not flimsy / helps w/ those tough to reach areas/ great product!</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend who was a little bit embarassed about shaving their back hair.  As far as I can tell, its working great.  The only mumurring that I have heard is that the razor slips out sometimes.  I dont know what can be done about.  Other than that, all is well on the home front.</li>
            <li> My brother in law was in desperate need for one of these and actually requested it. He loves it and has relieved my sister from the work :) Saw it on Rachael Ray, plug a razor in and shave. He uses it dry and wet with disposables-- he loves talking about it.</li>
            <li> Product works fine, takes some practice to master contours on back. Nice not having to ask spouse to help with back.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but this is a Great product! This back shaver is awesome. It was easier to use than I thought. Works great and the price is definitely right. No more asking the Girlfriend for the weekly shave.</li>
            <li> The concept of the Razorba is good but they seem to have forgot or ignored those of us who are taller (i.e 6ft+) and therefore have longer backs.  I can only reach the middle of the back with this shaver. It needs another 5 or 6 inches in order to reach the lower back! Very frustrating. The company could have added another model called &amp;#34;Razorba Tall&amp;#34; for example.  I wind up removing the blade handle from the Razorba and reaching up my back to shave the lower back. I thought the whole idea was to shave the ENTIRE BACK from an over the top reach.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for myself at Christmas.  The device is simple enough and well constructed.  I don&#x27;t have an incredible amount of back hair but enough that I wanted to do something about it.  I have used some body groomers and shavers, but they did not have the reach that allowed me to do the job easily. When the product arrived I quickly found that my shaver from the Dollar Shave Club did not fit in the handle, but I thought that might be the case.  I have put a Shick Hydra in there and it worked well but I just went and spent a couple of bucks on some disposables and they work fine.  Take it slow the first time you use it don&#x27;t try to press down, let the handle do the work.  The angle really takes care of any need for pressure.  But it may take one or two times to get all the hair on your back as that hair is a little more fine than the hair on your face.  But it&#x27;s a good product that doesn&#x27;t require batteries and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should have been expected to know this prior to purchasing this product but it can only accomodate certain razors.  The opening that receives the razor has a fixed diameter that is smaller that each razor I buy (or would be willing to).  Asking me to change my razor to use this product seems a bit unrealistic.  Rather, I&#x27;m not sure why the opening isn&#x27;t simply adjustable (I could conceive of a very wide opening that has screws to lock any razor in place).  Guess that&#x27;s just me, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I&#x27;m back on the market looking for other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one upside is that the product is made of pretty heavy and seemingly durable material. So, I can see how this product would work great for you if you happened to use a razor with a narrow grip.</li>
            <li> These things are great. I&#x27;m on my second one and the first lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Very good. If a woman is expected to keep herself well, so should a guy. It takes a bit of getting used to but I dont have to bend myself into sometimes painful positions to clean my back up.</li>
            <li> When I first took it out of the box, I was a little concerned...didn&#x27;t look like it was at the correct angle.  However, when I actually put the razor in there and used it, it was perfect!  The swivel function is great as well!  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Great product! Built well, Not flimsy and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The device does exactly what its manufacturer claims.  It works easily, standard inexpensive disposable razors fit it fine.  I&#x27;m not the most flexible guy I was originally concerned that it would be hard/clumsy to use.  But it is not difficult to use and &amp;#34;getting the hang of it&amp;#34; only takes a few minutes of practice.  It is very sturdy so while I recommend it, it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;ll ever need to buy another.</li>
            <li> This is a very ingenious product.  I like how it handles and gets a close shave on those pesky back hairs.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described, works great, no complaints. Manscaping has never been easier.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use and speedy. Worked great with my Harry&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea and had good reviews. I can&#x27;t figure how this is actually getting good reviews though. You would be better off taping a disposable razor to a dowel and using it instead.</li>
            <li> This is a good device BUT, i think it should be curved a little more, or even better make it so that the device is like a &amp;#34;gooseneck&amp;#34; and is bendable. Also, would be better if you put a non slip grip like some of the fancy womans disposable blades a silicone of some type.&lt;br /&gt;other than that, its great.</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES TAKING CARE OF THE BACK RUG FAST AND EASY. USING MY OWN RAZOR GIVES ME A CLEAN, PAINLESS SHAVE. IM HAPPY I FOUND THIS. THE MAKEUP OF IT IS VERY SOLID AND HEFTY AND ITS BACKED WITH A LIFETIME WARRANTY. IT WORKS. THINK ABOUT IT, THE BEST, SAFEST, AND CLOSEST SHAVE YOU EVER HAD WAS WITH A RAZOR. DRY WAS FINE WITH NO IRRITATION, BUT I PREFER DOING IT IN THE SHOWER. GREAT LOW TECH ITEM.</li>
            <li> Not just for men!  As a disabled female, this helped me shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razorba Back Hair Shaver</li>
            <li> No one enjoys having their significant other shave their back. I&#x27;m no exception.  With the Razorba, I can do it myself and maintain a hair free back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat - if you&#x27;re very hairy (as I was) you&#x27;ll probably want someone to do your first clean shave for you, and then use the Razorba to maintain after that point.</li>
            <li> After researching and using other products I found a little gem called the Razorba Back Hair Shaver. This is a simple straight forward easy to use tool. It does not require batteries and you can use your own blades / shavers with it. I recommend this product 100% for anyone looking tame the caveman in them. It will help you look nice and clean for the ladies.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy tool, worthy of being sold in the Home Depot tool department.  This must weigh about 2lbs and in addition to helping you reach hard to shave spots, could double as a weapon in the event you needed to defend yourself during a home invasion.</li>
            <li> Great old fashioned American quality product.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that helped me shave the unwanted hair on my back by myself</li>
            <li> Finally! Some method of being able to take care of that age-related crap on your back without having to resort to extreme and costly measures. Works well for me. Although some angles are a little tight.</li>
            <li> Well, the item arrived on time and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the razorba is that not all razor handles fit their product securely or some not at all. At the price they charge for a piece of molded plastic...it would be simple for them to include a couple of different holders that fit in the end of the razorba. If it cost them an extra 25 cents I would be amazed. But noooo....they try to make it a one hole fits all handles.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the Razorba tends to let smaller handle razors &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; around as you are using it, which is inefficient as well as annoying as all heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, they should let the ribbed handle for your grip run at least halfway up the shaft, so you can easily adjust for shorter length areas you want to reach. The closer areas are actually the most awkward to use this with!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great idea that badly needs some refining to make it also a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this after having hip replacement surgery to help me shave my legs. I wasn&#x27;t allowed to bend past a 90 degree angle so I put my razor in it and with the long handle was able to shave my lower legs without having to bend over. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for backs as well but that was not my purpose for using it. So I do recommend as you can see it also has other uses.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Do not understand where all of the good reviews came from. Tried several different razors that I have in this thing and none of them fit or worked well. They were all common basic razors that the instructions stated should have worked. Do not waste your money... For a small amount more I got the electronic man groomer that works FAR better</li>
            <li> can be somewhat clumsy/difficult to get used to...hey, it&#x27;s your back we&#x27;re talking about here, but it works.  if you want to get rid of back hair and don&#x27;t have some sucker (haha) available to shave it for you, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> Easy to use! Works best with straight handle razor.</li>
            <li> I wish oh I wish i could post the picture of the multitude of gauze and bandages on my back after the first use.  Avoid like the plague~!</li>
            <li> Works great and easier than I thought to use. Takes a little practice but is nice to be able to shave without help. Better than the clippers because you get close smooth shave. Great quality also.</li>
            <li> Works as described! The solution to do it yourself back shaes</li>
            <li> I like this product so much better than the electric foil type groomer I had.  The others go dull and irritate your skin. This one accepts many different types of razor handles so you can always use a fresh blade.  It has a comfortable handle that has a good length and angle to easily access the hard to reach spots. I love it.</li>
            <li> After extensive research, and using other not so good products (groomr) in the past I have learned the following: Nothing. I repeat, NOTHING works better than the Razorba Shaver. No small parts to break, or blades to replace. No special and costly specialty blades. Use the razors you have at home. And you get the razor smooth and comfortable shave. A product that will last you a lifetime, with nothing else to buy. You can&#x27;t say that about the other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you&#x27;re buying a gift or just want the best rechargeable back shaver then look no further than [[ASIN:B0055T3CCO Razorba Sum3 Power Back Hair Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the widest most powerful and highest quality of the electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want best of both worlds then get the Don Juan which has both the SUM3 and War Hammer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00G3KSWEM Razorba Don Juan Back Hair Shaver Kit]]</li>
            <li> Not very stable but does the job.</li>
            <li> Great product! Gets the job done quick, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> the razor fell out a lot  wouldn&#x27;t recommend. kinda awkward to use as well. hard to feel which way is up</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for any guy with a hairy back. My hair is thick and this product secures the razor with a tight fit for easy shaving. Because it is not electronic it should last forever. Thank you Razorba!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed. It is ergonomically designed, my Bic double blade razors fit well, and I am most pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty hairy back.  Its gross, disgusting and its a pain to get rid of.  The smell of nair makes me vomit, and I still couldn&#x27;t get those hard to reach places.  Shaving with a razor alone means you need to be a contortionist to get the job done.   It had gotten to the point where I&#x27;ve just given up on the whole thing. I would shy away from public pools, beach, etc.  Its really embarassing to go ask someone to go shave your back for you, (even though I know my girl would do it) and the cost of waxing as a ritual just seemed too painful physically and monetarily.      I will say that this product has made it a lot easier for me to get the job done.  I had no issues with the razorba losing grip, however I did have some catches with my mach 3 razor and the cartridge fell off twice.  I&#x27;ve had issues with the mach 3 razor doing that with my back before so I was not surprised.      All in all, I give it five stars.  It did exactly what I wanted it to do except clog the drain.  I&#x27;ll live with drano and have a baby smooth back.  Thanks to the inventor for a job well done.</li>
            <li> I have seen hairier than I, but mostly in zoos. This is easy to use and it saves my wife the delight of using the weed-whacker in the bathroom. Not sure what the real benefits are to the more expensive versions as my Gillette Mach 3 as well as Sensor handles fit well and securely. Perhaps the others with the heavier weight and solid construction could also be used in self defense...</li>
            <li> I do allot of activities and having a clean back is very helpful. I always had to have my wife shave my back and needless to say,  she was never excited about this! Its still a little awkward to keep the handle straight while your shaving your back, but with patience it can be done, but definitely takes more time than having someone else do it! But overall and with practice I am very glad I purchased this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does the job for a great price.</li>
            <li> Does the job it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> This simply works, and works well.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to but it works great</li>
            <li> Deceptively simple, but incredibly well engineered and constructed.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about it&#x27;s effectiveness. But so far it does the trick, I have thin hair. So I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on someone with thick dense hair.  Just have to be sure to hold it correctly, and use a mirror.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an extension for a shaver, since I am unable to reach the bottom of my left leg due to a major surgery.&lt;br /&gt;This product worked very well for this purpose. Granted, I am not very hairy and I am petitte, but I was happy to find a tool that did the trick and not have to depend on anyone for shaving. The product is kinda expensive for what it is. But it is very well constructed and solid, so I guess we are paying for the smart design. I could not find any other product that would come close to it. I am grateful that someone solved this problem for me. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in buying this product but I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;It works as described and will work with most disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;I used Gillette and a store brand razor and they both fit inside very well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works with my Gillette shaver. Good size and handling. Sturdy build.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I&#x27;m not a extremely hairy person, but what little hair I do have on my back is easily removed the Razorba. I&#x27;ve always thought about such a product. I&#x27;m glad someone came up with the idea and a great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> works exactly as described. Tip: get the disposable razors that have a square handle not rounded, they seem to fit better.</li>
            <li> This is basically a plastic handle with a short hollow tube on the end. Within the tube is a rubber sleeve that you stuff the handle of your razor into and it is supposed to hold the razor in place and position it for a clean effective shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and the Sport Razor [[ASIN:B004S48PRY SPORT RAZOR Compact Do-It-Yourself Body Razor Back Hair Shaver *BLUE* 30-day money back guarantee]] for a side-by-side comparison. The Sport Razor is more nimble with much better tactile feel so I can really sense where and how the blade is contacting my back. The Razorba design places a long handle, then a tube, then the handle of your razor...all of that between your hand and the blade. So tactile feel is poor and the razor flexes and moves around within the tube so your razor feels much, much less in your control then it does with the Sport Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the Sport Razor, its a good design and a better choice.</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old woman and I definitely do not have a hairy back!  What I do have is a broken shoulder, hip and pelvis which makes shaving my legs impossible.  Until I saw the Razorback.  I ordered it, popped a disposable razor in the end, and shaved my legs in no time.  This needs to also be offered as a home health care aid for seniors and the physically challenged.  But you might want to change the name to RazorArm!</li>
            <li> The Razorba back shaper is perfectly dsigned to reach your entire back, with a little patience and flexibility. I  use it twice a week and focus on different  parts of the back each time, and it that way do not take more than a few mnutes each time. Any razor handle will fit in the end .  I no longer have to ask or pay anyone to shave my back. It fits in my medium size suitcase so it is now a travel accesory.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it!  You&#x27;ll only hurt your arms trying to shave yourself.  It&#x27;s worthless</li>
            <li> For the money I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s engineered all that well to be honest. It&#x27;s heavy, bulky and the angle on it doesn&#x27;t really provide the natural motion I need to use it well.  That being said it is durable and does get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great invention that gets the job done and was exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and it works perfectly.  I use it with the generic Target brand disposable razors which are compatible as they fit perfectly and it&#x27;s a winner all the way around every time.</li>
            <li> Of all the innovation and big-business for shaving, this is the best we have... For some reason bigger companies neglect guys with hairy backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works, but it&#x27;s REALLY hard to completely shave your back and get 100% of the hair off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it in the shower:&lt;br /&gt;-Plug the razor in&lt;br /&gt;-Start scratching my back with it&lt;br /&gt;-Imagine if I&#x27;m hitting each spot of my back&lt;br /&gt;-Watch clumps of hair go down the drain&lt;br /&gt;-Get out of the shower and dry off&lt;br /&gt;-Look in the mirror, see a very patchy hairy back&lt;br /&gt;-Ask my wife to finish the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you still have to ask somebody else to do it, isn&#x27;t that the whole point of getting this?</li>
            <li> Because I live in a share house in a hot climate thanks to this product I can walk around the house without a shirt on as before my back was very hairy, before I had to use the Air Con at my expense a lot as I was to embarrassed with my back hair , I even had my first swim  at the beach for many years just recently! Also I ride a bicycle to work and I can change my shirt in public whilst locking up the bicycle, takes a bit of getting used to the product especially the first use, I find I need to use the product once a week as the stubble comes back, so excellent product</li>
            <li> Well I was a little worried that this might not live up to my expectations, but it has so far. It takes a little practice to perfect it. An added bonus is this is an American company.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to for me. Was way less irritation than I thought there would be. My confidence has doubled since I began using it. I&#x27;m actually looking forward to going swimming this summer now.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar product a while back, it was foldable, cheaply made and I had trouble finding blades to fit it.&lt;br /&gt;The lock on the folding part would come undone when you were trying to use it, which made it pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;I waited a while to purchase the Razorba because I was skeptical after my experience with the other one.&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn&#x27;t have waited.  This thing is top quality.  It is solid and sturdy.  This thing will probably last a lifetime.  It&lt;br /&gt;is comfortable and easy to use, and it fits pretty much any razor, so you can use what ever one you prefer.  I probably&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t ever have to purchase another one since this one is almost indestructible, and I mean that literally.  I would&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it to anyone looking for this type of product.  There is not a better one on the market.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!! Electric back shavers don&#x27;t do it for me because my back hair is soft and I want smooth shaven skin, not stubby.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Razorba with my mach 3 razor. My first time I was not used to working the angles, so I used a double mirror technique by standing backwards in my bathroom mirror and holding a handheld mirror in my other hand. 20 minutes to a smooth shaven back. Not bad for my first time. Will use again.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of maneuvering but works great. I use Gilette mach 3 blades. Works best if you use an electric trimmer first. I use the mangroomer ultimate pro.</li>
            <li> Hard to get most razors to stay in for more than a min or two at a time but works pretty well.</li>
            <li> surprisingly sturdy.  works fine with gillette good news but i doubt it will work with newer disposable razors with the thicker handles  wanted to try it with gillette sensor excel but that&#x27;s hard to find these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best part is saving many an argument with your significant other about PLEASE shaving your back again!!!</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use at first</li>
            <li> Simple and huge (much larger than expected) but it works like a dream! Also quite inexpensive compared to the other models. If you don&#x27;t like the robins&#x27; egg blue color you can always take it out in the garage and paint it something more manly like road cone Orange or fire engine Red.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t someone think of this a long time ago?  Some time ago, men would be stigmatized or chastised&lt;br /&gt;for taking control of their own body hair.  Worse than that, we would be considered weird.&lt;br /&gt;Men who dyed their hair?  Fuhgeddaboudit. Aliens from another planet.  In these days of women&#x27;s lib,&lt;br /&gt;men don&#x27;t give enough credit to the primary by-product of women&#x27;s lib:  men&#x27;s lib. Metro-sexualism.&lt;br /&gt;We are hetero dudes who take control of our grooming and get pedicures, manicures, dye our hair,&lt;br /&gt;spend a lot of money on tailored clothes and shoes, and you know what?  Women love it.&lt;br /&gt;This product is quite good.  At first, it takes some learning.  You may work on it for 4 or 5 days&lt;br /&gt;to get the hang of it, but it is really worth the effort.  it works.  I use a back scrubber to apply the shaving&lt;br /&gt;cream, but the Razorba product for this is probably better.&lt;br /&gt;It has become a part of my almost daily ritual in the shower.  I actually enjoy using it now.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to expand the operation with one of the electric body shavers.  I think the combination will&lt;br /&gt;be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will like it. Gave it four stars since I almost never pick five stars.</li>
            <li> This devise really works well. I guess I don&#x27;t do enough yoga for my arm and shoulder to be flexible enough to reach the here and there&#x27;s that need to be reached, but luckily the Razorba does the trick.</li>
            <li> Works great, just as advertised. Works best with a round or square handle razor, not as well with a wide flat handle razor.</li>
            <li> The weight distribution on this is awkward and I never got used to it.  I actually cut myself couple of times because I accidentally slid the razor slightly sideways on my back.  I ended up buying the Man Groomer electric shaver.  I find the Mag Groomer much more convenient and easier to use.</li>
            <li> works great, better than expected, just need to do your back in front of a mirror. beats waxing.</li>
            <li> Great invention.  Holds razor snugly and does its job.  Easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Love this device.  Very well made and does the trick</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised for a few months then one day while removing the razor the gray tubing that holds the razor in place completely came out of the end rendering my Razorba useless.  Purchased the Bakblade and prefer it 100x over the Razorba.</li>
            <li> well made and assigned.  highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to determine how to navigate the thing, but it&#x27;s durable, sturdy, and I believe will be a great product for my needs.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very overpriced but still works good. Do not use diposable razors since they suck. Get a good razor that will fit your model and shave in the shower. Do what you can in the shower and when you get out look in the mirror and see if there were anyspots you missed and tweek it then. Great product but not meant for people with tons of fur.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit steep in price, but worth every penny once you actually learn how to use it. Also... if you go with this use a Mach 3 razor with a Venus Divine blade (The Venus Divine blades fit on the Mach 3 razor, but the Venus Divine razor doesn&#x27;t fit in the Razorba). The reason you want to do that is cause the Venus blades have more surface area so it&#x27;s much easier to get a better shave on each pass. And you still get the 3 blade goodness of the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Amazingly easy to shave my back hair. I use it in the shower and store it in there. I verified that this is the latest version that is very sturdy and heavy. Using razors gives me a super close shave you can&#x27;t even tell I have back hair. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the cost of using disposable razors in this.</li>
            <li> It does the job as expected, no fancy packaging, no useless add-ons. Just what we need, the way we need it and that&#x27;s it. I like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not to need the help of a wife or girlfriend for my manscaping, but this takes a little getting used to.  The length of the whole contraption makes it a little awkward, but it works.  Once you figure it out, it works, and that&#x27;s what matters.  :-P</li>
            <li> It  does exactly what I needed it to do. Very effective and yet inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Since 2005, I have been using my Razorba to get rid of the pesky back hair. Unlike others, I don&#x27;t like to put \\&quot;shaving cream\\&quot; on the back because it&#x27;s hard for me to \\&quot;see\\&quot; the spots that have been shaved versus where I need to go over again.  So I just use diluted shampoo on the back. I also have my shower head on \\&quot;jet power\\&quot; so that I can water rinse off the hair (on the razor) in between shavings. I also bought a \\&quot;sink trapper\\&quot; deal for the drain so that the hair will be collected in that trapper so it won&#x27;t collect inside the shower drain and pipe.</li>
            <li> I had a total hip replacement recently which prevents my bending at the waist.  I was concerned about shaving my legs (TMI) and looked online for a long handled shaver.  This is advertised for men to shave their backs, but it is perfect for a woman who cannot bend.  I looked at several others and am happy I went with this one.  It is very sturdy hard plastic, and a disposable razor fits VERY snugly in the end of it.  I am happy and well groomed!  I have no problem what so ever.  I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; tall and for me it is long enough, though a tall person might have a little trouble getting all the way to the ankle with it.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, no issues.</li>
            <li> Overall a pretty cool item that solves a lot of guys problems. I would give it 5 stars but, I&#x27;m not very fond of how the razor attaches to the Razorba. I found the razor moving out of position sometimes. It is easier to use with a razor that does not have a pivoting head like a Gillette Good News. Perhaps if the attaching portion were adjustable it would ease some of the frustration with the razor moving about. Nevertheless less, it takes some getting used to but it works pretty well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of my hairy back, and while I don&#x27;t think it completely ruined my social life to be a bit more hairy than some, it certainly did not help. There are many products out there that can help with the hair you can easily reach, but until using this product, I had no easy way of reaching my back. I&#x27;ve only used the device once so far, but it was a relatively simple process of loading in a disposable Gillette razor (three blades and a lubricating strip, similar to the Mach 3, but without the reusable handle) and taking five or six good passes, then rinsing off the area I&#x27;d shaved and repeating. I didn&#x27;t find shaving cream to be necessary for my back, which is not hairy all over, but it does help. I used a back brush to apply shaving cream as needed and it worked well. The product seems solidly made and gives good control over the razor as you guide it along your back. If you&#x27;re careful and guide the razor only in the directions it is meant to go (perpendicular to the blades), you should find it a simple matter to shave your own back without cutting yourself. I would definitely purchase this product again as an essential part of my personal hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li> Was bought as a gift, the unit is very well made, no problems with it, and the user said that one must remove the blade unit after using so as to keep the blade handle from becoming loose in the unit.  Also, push it is quite far, no problem with blade unit turning then.</li>
            <li> Great tool. I am not very flexible and I definitely can get to the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> good quality product, holds a disposable razor very well..takes a bit to get use too but works well...fast delivery of the order.</li>
            <li> This actually works. Well it really should for the cost, it is a little steep, but it is pretty heavy duty and well made. You really have to work and bend and flex to use it effectively, but once you get the hang of it it works. It really is worth the money.</li>
            <li> First off, I am joking, my mother has never shaved my back. But this product really has so far solved the annoying problem of reaching the hard to reach areas of my back. I do not have a lot of back hair, but enough to where I know my girlfriends do not find it sexy. I have used it once only (and I will report back with more good and bad things about it) and it certainly did a great job and I was able to get the hair off leaving my back nice and smooth. It took a bit of learning to figure out how to get all the right angle. One thing I initially did wrong was &amp;#34;choke up&amp;#34; like a baseball bat, this felt like the natural way to hold the shaver, but it made for less contact with the razor blades to the back. Once I started holding it by the handle at the end, I realized the razor was starting to hit the sweet spot/angle to where it was actually taking off the hair. I used a Aquasential Easy Lotion Applicator and this made it so much easier to apply the shaving cream to my back. I highly recommend purchasing the applicator as well. I used Barbasol soothing aloe shaving cream and find it superior to more the more hip Edge, Fusion&#x27;s or other expensive shaving creams with ads on television. Barbasol&#x27;s the least expensive yet creates a nice thick fluffy cloud of cream, rather then a stringy pasty gel that needs to be rubbed into a lather. The key to the Back Shaver is the plastic hole that you stick the razor in. It held the razor inside in a sturdy manner. Any looseness from this part of the shaver and you might as well be duct taping your razor to a cut in half broom handle. It wont work. But after about ten minutes of fudging with it, I felt I had a pretty good handle and control of the Shaver and was able to hit all the areas and feel when the razor was making good contact. If it starts giving me any problems in the near future I will definitely repost, but for now, I highly recommend the shaver and it has solved a very annoying and frustrating problem of reaching those hard to reach areas.those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my husband who was tired of asking his wife to shave his back during the summer months.  He absolutely loves the Razorba back shaver. The shaver is a good length which allows you to reach those hard to get to spots &amp; with ease ! I would recommend this product for anyone who has issues reaching or even maybe might be good for those having a hard time bending to shave their legs.  What an amazing invention ! Great seller communication &amp; follow up too :)</li>
            <li> does what it should, just takes a while. Strange angle and difficult to get the middle.</li>
            <li> It really works. Note:  the razor will seem a little wobbly in the holder but that&#x27;s actually good - too stiff I think it would be easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and effective</li>
            <li> All three razors I used with this popped off, despite being compatible according to the product description. I found that it made shaving no easier than just reaching back with a razor and cant understand why anyone would pay this much money when a stick with tape would work at least as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now and very satisfied. It is easy to use and does the job. I would recommend it to anyone that would like to shave their backs. I would also recommend that they buy the stud stamps to go with it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This should cost 5,10 dollars tops for what it is. Razor fit snugly so no problem there. A little too much flexion made it difficult to use. A butter knife and some packaging tape worked better</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey for what it is abut works as advertised.  I can reach the mid section of my back with ease and it will do for now until I can afford laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many times. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Terrible... only used it once and the inside piece came off. it says that it is compatible with various razors but do not try to use it with one of the later ones... I think it is made to be used with disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Good in theory, but not very practical. This would have been better had one end of the handle had something you could use to apply shaving cream. I just went back to using the battery powered back shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he shaves every day. He uses this to shave his back. It is a hard plastic with a rubber insert to hold the razor nice and firm. Good angle he said and works well. He was very happy.</li>
            <li> Since there are no competing products for this that I know of, they can charge $30 for a piece of (heavy duty) plastic and you&#x27;ll be happy about it.    You stick your razor in a rubber holder that&#x27;s inside the plastic.  You just jam it in there; the instructions tell you not to twist it.  Unless you had a really thick razor handle, I think this would work with just about any razor you have.  You need to jam it in there good, because a loose razor won&#x27;t perform well.    The angle might be hard to master, as your razor will have some curve to it.  I found that I got better results going under my arm rather than over my head.    As far as shaving cream goes, I&#x27;m not very hairy on my back at all, just a few thin groups of hair to eliminate, and I found just using water worked okay.  The shaving cream can make it hard to tell where you need to shave, and your back isn&#x27;t like your face, where you have to be super delicate.  Maybe really hairy guys would have to use shaving cream, but they&#x27;d probably be shaving everywhere, so trying to target a certain area wouldn&#x27;t be as important to them.    Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it, but if there was a competing product that was cheaper and seemed worthwhile, I&#x27;d definitely check it out.    EDIT ON JAN 2015:  I never used this thing.  It was a waste of money.  I got the bakblade last week, and it is a miracle worker.  Much better than this Razorba.</li>
            <li> Works well although takes a bit of getting used to</li>
            <li> Got this for mom having hip replacement. She wanted to be able to shave legs - this does the trick, but you have to use men&#x27;s razors because the wide handles won&#x27;t fit into this device.</li>
            <li> The product arrived right on time and works well with a small to medium size razor..makes it easy to reach all areas..A little pricey but seems to he well made so it should last for a while. .</li>
            <li> fast delivery, nothing against the online store that sold it, but it doesn&#x27;t work and cut my back up pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great design and easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you HATE having back hair, and have no one you can con into shaving your back for you, this is a MUST HAVE product.  I am a larger fellow, and I was able to reach ALL areas of my back.  Now I am not self conscious when I swim at the pool.  My back looks smooth, and it is all thanks to this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Like most men, I have a hairy back, and I do not like this.  I found you MUST use a slim handle razor to fit in the end.  When I use this, I use the Aquasentials Easy Lotion Applicator  from Amazon with baby shampoo.  It took me a few times to get the knack of it.  It takes me 3 days in a row to do a good job.</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible tool for shaving your back!!!  I cannot recommend it highly enough!  It&#x27;s easy to use, and even helpful for shaving areas like tops of shoulders, too!  It&#x27;s so much easier to use this than it is to have to ask someone to shave your back for you!!  I&#x27;ve even given some as gifts to friends...</li>
            <li> Fantastic...very time saving and a wonderful job. I can reach all of my back with ease. If you are looking for something to shave your back with you will love it.</li>
            <li> I feel stupid for buying this.</li>
            <li> Love this product, love the idea behind it.  Works great too!!!</li>
            <li> I have the mid tier razor from Dollar Shave Club and it seems to work just fine. It enables you to reach the hard to reach places that your arm just can&#x27;t do. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Deal with the fact that you and me have some terrible issues! But this device is a life saver for those with back hair and choose to do it themselves. I use with a Gilette Sensor razor in the shower and with routine maintenance, shavings become a breeze!</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, works very well.</li>
            <li> Very easy and quick to shave</li>
            <li> The wife uses it to shave her back hair.</li>
            <li> At first a little difficult to use, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get used to the handle and how to properly use it but after that the Razorbacks has worked well.</li>
            <li> This product is made and performs well. I am definitely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised, much larger than expected</li>
            <li> I love it! No more brushing a hairy back. No more hair gel. My sink was clogged with hair but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This does the job. It extends your reach all over your back. I use it so I don&#x27;t gross out my massage therapist.</li>
            <li> Works great came quickly and all I was looking for.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Would give 2 stars but trying to get rating where it should be. Why does amazon allow false info? This does not hold my pro glide, only disposable razors. And it doesnt have a good angle to truly help for bigger guys. Im 215 lbs, muscular build. If it was 10 bucks,  4 stars.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to it but it is worth it. Use the smaller handled disposable razors (cheap ones) and this item does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> It works for me: easy to attach disposable/non-disposable razor (tried both), easy to shave. Not very aesthetic design but no other complaints.</li>
            <li> I always had to get someone to do this for me. Now I can take car of this myself easily!</li>
            <li> While I would hesitate to call this device inexpensive, it&#x27;s worth what you pay for. Unlike a mechanical back shaver I had tried before, this gear is sturdy, easy to use, and requires little maintenance to keep in working order. The instructions say to use shaving creme, but I&#x27;ve found that aloe-based bodywash when used in a shower will also work well. Results will not be immediate if you have as much of a pelt back there as I did, but regular use will result in a clean back after only a week or so. Just be sure to have a filter on your shower/bathtub drain and empty it after every use to prevent clogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doubles as a club if you are attacked by a wolf.</li>
            <li> Item works great. Should have ordered it a long time ago. I recommend this product for everyone ago needs such an item.</li>
            <li> well made.  solid plastic. dropped it on the tile floor.  indestructable.  Holds disposable razors securely.  Must be adept at using the mirror to keep from razor burning the back.  I had a &#x27;man groomer&#x27; before this.  This is far superior.  The man groomer only will cut dense back hair and leave stubble your lady will dislike.</li>
            <li> I completely loved this product! Thank you for giving me this opportunity.</li>
            <li> Great Product! It&#x27;s a pretty simple tool that does what you need it to do. You can reach those hard to reach areas that you just can&#x27;t get to. No more cramping up while trying to reach the middle your back. Its a very sturdy tool and i can&#x27;t see it wearing out anytime soon. Service was great! it showed up on time and in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting use to, but all in all reaches those places that are hard to shave in the back.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you want it to do!  I found that I could still fit Gillette Fusion razor in the base model (with a little squeezing).  No need to buy the higher end model.</li>
            <li> If you are a big man with any muscle at all in your arms and shoulders, you will find this product virtually unusable. I can&#x27;t speak for skinny guys with no muscle, but if you are a muscular man like me, you will not find this product effective. For me, the handle needs to be much longer and it is very difficult to keep the razor blade flat against the skin to get a close shave. Overall, one of the worst purchases I have ever made online! I&#x27;ll probably never even use mine again.</li>
            <li> Makes it tough areas acessable</li>
            <li> Quick and good product</li>
            <li> This item was just what I have been searching for. I love the angle, the long handle, and the fact that it is not flexible.</li>
            <li> I like the razorba because i am now able to shave my back fairly well without the help of my wife.  The only down fall is that there is play where the razor is inserted and it is tough to shave the middle area of my back because the razor is not sitting firm on the area for a good shave.  Other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> As funny as this tool might &amp;#34;look&amp;#34;, it is actually very functional for it&#x27;s designed purpose. I spent a lot of money on electronic back shavers that either didn&#x27;t fulfill the purpose (bad design), broke down within months, needed pricey blade replacements, or just didn&#x27;t cut close enough. With this tRazorba tool my back is always clean and smooth. No need to be a contortions to shave anymore. The best part is that I get to use my own blade shaver! Saved me money, time, and my back! Love it!</li>
            <li> Go slowly at first. Use a cream or soap.  Do in the mirror.  It took me 3 attemps to get back clean.  The maintenance part is a snap.</li>
            <li> This is a must for shaving those places you can&#x27;t reach.  You really have to have a full length mirror to help you see and kind of bend your arms in a way they don&#x27;t normally go, but overall a great product.</li>
            <li> It work well. I like it and will continue to use it. I just need one that has a hair indicator for all the very small patches I miss! ;P</li>
            <li> Nice product, will work with any mans disposable razor. Allows me to shave back hair that was otherwise not accessible.</li>
            <li> works very well... after you get used to it</li>
            <li> Great product!  Takes a little getting used to the first time.  After that, it&#x27;s pretty fast and easy to get a good shave with.  You may have to get a different razor for it as the razor holder only holds shall we say smaller, circular/square type razor handles (ex: the Gillette body razor wouldn&#x27;t fit in the holder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if you don&#x27;t have someone to shave your back for you, which is a lot more fun!  :-)</li>
            <li> Great quality and value... Should have bought one years ago</li>
            <li> Boy did this make shaving my back easy.  Took a bit of getting used to but then did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> Good product. Works well with a gillette older razors and grips well. Good reach and angle for the back. 4 stars since it cannot adapt to razors that have a wider shaft.</li>
            <li> Taking care of back hair isnt easy, and this product certainly helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, its a little tricky to use, and doesnt do as complete a job as i would have hoped.</li>
            <li> I love this thing very strong</li>
            <li> Honestly, the Razorba suprised me when it arrived.  It&#x27;s much heftier than I expected.  It&#x27;s really thick, so it fits well in the hand without slipping around, even when you grasp it along portion of the handle without the finger grips.  Mine came with a disposable razor included, which, again I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and is a nice little perk.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times since purchase, once with the included razor and once with my Gillettte Mach 3.  Both times worked very well, but I&#x27;ll admit that my back hair is thin and sparse, so you might want to take that into account.  I would definitely follow the advice of others here, in that taking a little time to practice (preferably with the covered razor inserted) beforehand is a huge help.  Otherwise, you could really gouge your back.  And you definitely want to use it both pulling up from over the shoulder and pulling down from around the side as, at least in my case, hair on the back tends to grow at rather random angles.  Also, as someone else mentioned, be sure to pull it away from your back when moving to the next spot because you can really make a nice slice with the razor if you aren&#x27;t careful.  The Razorba really worked well for me.  The razor fits in the grip well and doesn&#x27;t move around (make sure that you are getting the correct one for your razor).  By the time I was finished, my back was smooth and hairless.  Given that my back hair is so fine, I don&#x27;t see myself needing to do this much more than once a week, if that, but it works REALLY well and I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this instead of any of the more expensive back hair removal options here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> High quality product that works great. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well. Been looking for ever for this. No more back hair for me. Now if I could just get a mirror in my shower.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use hard to get all hair off back. Some razors don&#x27;t fit in handle. Nice to get neck</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit longer.  For people like me, who have almost no shoulder flexibility, it was a task to get it in position and to control it.  To give you an idea, I can barely touch my left shoulder with my right hand and vice versa, and I can definitely not touch the right shoulder with the right hand or the left shoulder with the left hand.  This is also because I strength train daily, so my biceps get in the way.  Also, because of it&#x27;s length, I had to use it from the top, bottom, and side of the back to get most of the hair.  Even then, there was a small area I couldn&#x27;t reach that I still had to get a second person to finish off.  Come on Razorba manufacturers, make it 1 or 2 inches longer and it&#x27;d be perfect.  Other than that, it&#x27;s much more effective at shaving my back now than it was before without it.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. No complaints. Great alternative to waxing. Easy to use and not expensive either. Can recommend it. Should have bought one a long time ago.....</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my back.  It has a taken a while to get used to it, but I can manage to shave all of my back with it and a good mirror.</li>
            <li> Very hairy body for which I have been self conscious for years.  Don&#x27;t mind chest hair, but back hair looks terrible.  Very easy to reach all areas of my back with the Razorba.</li>
            <li> What is great about this product is that it does not require batteries or electrical power.  Other than the expense of replacing disposal razors, it is designed to be practical.  Designed with the right curves and angles. Can be left in the shower for easy storage.</li>
            <li> What can I say works for me no problem. I hardly think about it since I leave it in the shower and use it when needed. I don&#x27;t worry about my backhair anymore. Clean and silky smooth results. Backhair comes in thick for me. I disagree with other reviewers who do a lot of prepping, cuz I dont. Also didnt have a problem finding razors that fit. It&#x27;s cost effective because you use the razor of your choice unlike other shavers that trap you with pricey replacement blades. Disposables cost me mere pennies. Simplicity works. I &amp;#60;heart&amp;#62; this product!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quick and was as promised in the description. Works pretty good although hard to maneuver just at first.</li>
            <li> My husband requested this back shaver and he is very pleased with it.  We would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times and it works just as described.  Stick a razor in it and go to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about the product is the heft that it has.  It feels solid, well built.  And having some heft to the product allows you to be more confident with it as you know that it&#x27;s not going to flex on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking at it online, you wonder if it&#x27;s really worth the price.  Although not horribly expensive, you still wonder.  After receiving it and using it, I would say yes, it is worth the price.  I can see getting many years of use out it.</li>
            <li> I like the way how it works , but the price in general a bit high.. Hope you like it as i did</li>
            <li> Works great.  Be sure to use a fresh razor for best results</li>
            <li> If you want a clean shaven back, this does the trick.  It’s sturdy, making it easy to apply the right amount of pressure, and after a little bit of time getting used to it, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great. Really simplifies getting your back clean. I like that I can choose the razor and blade. Easy to maneuver. Heavier and more sturdy than I expected. I anticipate this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> not many razor handles fit in it</li>
            <li> Takes a minute or two to get the hang of it, but solves the problem very well.</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what it says it does. Will pay for itself in a couple of shavings.</li>
            <li> Great product. Simple and ready to use. If you have back hair and your woman keeps bitching at you, look no further.</li>
            <li> durable construction has a rubber sleeve for your razor.</li>
            <li> Worked well. Now if I can keep my back from breaking out....that is a big problem also. Why is there a minimum word count for a review?</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and has solved my back hair issues. I can now easily shave my own back and love that I don&#x27;t need to ask for help any more.</li>
            <li> The Razorba is an interesting product.  The product itself does little more than make it possible for one to reach areas of the back that are normally beyond our reach.  Of and by itself it does nothing at all.  The user is required to stick his razor (usually a disposable works just fine) in the opening provided on the Razorba.  Thus equipped, shaving the back suddenly becomes quite easy.  I thought the product a bit expensive for a hunk of plastic and bit more than half the price of a Mangroomer) but that said, the product does make back shaving simple.  Because one supplies his own razor, each shave can be as close as you wish.  As the disposable blade dulls (usually 6-8 shaves) simply replace it.  I had used a Mangroomer (much like an electric razor for the back) which required batteries and replacement once the blades wore out.  I am quite happy with the Razorba and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thought there might be a bit of a learning curve but no. It worked great right from the start. Thanks alot</li>
            <li> works pretty well.  put disposable razor into it.  have only had it a couple of weeks.  seems like it should last</li>
            <li> Functionality, quality of construction and results are all excellent! Used prior to a 9 day vacation in the Caribbean...extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Being an Italian hair ball who finally got tired of it, I researched them all online and picked this method of \\&quot;self hair removal\\&quot; - A simple device that I found works well once you get the knack of it. I use it for back hair removal, the hardest to do. Note that you will need the accessories - I used the recommended Gillette Mach 3 razor, along with the Aquasentials Easy Lotion Applicator, and Edge Body Renew Face &amp; Body Shave Cream. Being hirsute, it grows back relentlessly - I need to do this every 2 weeks. Of course professional waxing would last longer, and lasering would be forever, but this is fine if you can give the time and effort frequently.</li>
            <li> Well made.It works as said.</li>
            <li> Great product works great</li>
            <li> This device does exactly what it is supposed to do although, it is way too expensive.  It is a quality built product but I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> No more back hair. F*****g sweet.</li>
            <li> Amazed how well this works. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Use it with a Fusion razor which has easily rinsed open blades.  First shaving was lengthy and difficult, but w/o any cuts.  Subsequent shaves easy.  Took awhile to find the best manipulations.  I shave dry usually, using a light sawing motion w/o raising it off my skin , like mowing a lawn.  My hair is not coarse, quite the opposite. but grows too long.  Do shave under shower too, have not found soap or shave cream necessary.  Effective product.</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping! Exactly as described and seems to be even better quality than I thought. Nice item for the money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to remove the hair on my back without help, This product gives me that ability. Works perfect. With very little practice, you can do it all on your own. No more imposing on someone else for help. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Just as described - use with bic type razor.</li>
            <li> I have now used this product about a total of 6 to 10 times while it works ok the main reason I order it was to shave my back with it. Seems to not be able to get the right angle to get everything as I just seems to be able to get the blade to angle right to shave every thing still good to use and my fiancé even uses to shave her legs comes in handy if ya don&#x27;t wanna have to bend over or take a bath or whatever. Still not a bad purchase though specially for the price</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  No point in wasting money on lasers when they stimulate hair growth and last about the same time frame.</li>
            <li> This is a game changer. Makes it a breeze to shave your back.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to pick one up.</li>
            <li> It works! This simple but sturdy design was easy to use the first time. I just used a&lt;br /&gt;disposable (2-blade) razor the first time to try it out and it&#x27;s amazing how it stayed in&lt;br /&gt;securely and the leverage of the design shaved hard-to-reach areas like my lower back&lt;br /&gt;easily. I was surprised a simple design would work so well!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve tried 3 different disposable razors with it and the handles fit snuggly and perfectly.  The angle is great for those hard-to-reach spots in the middle of the back.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money or time</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband after I was asked to shave his back a few too many times. He heard about this product from a brother who loves it. It works really well &amp; with a verity of razors just as promised. My husband can now shave his back with out any help from me...I love it!</li>
            <li> The back shaver is well made  . It takes a while to get used to but works well.</li>
            <li> Why so much money for such a simple product!  Ridiculous!  Over 30 bucks for some plastic?  Come on! I wonder how much it cost the company to make this versus the selling price.</li>
            <li> Works well, better if you use it more often (like every two weeks).  Makes the wife happy, no more hairy back and she doesn&#x27;t have to take care of it!</li>
            <li> A 5 blade Fusion Pro Glide fit snugly into the handles holder. I tried different angles while watching in a mirror. After a little experimenting it works as claimed. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> And when used in conjunction with the applicator brushes (sponges) will keep that nasty hair off your back and you don&#x27;t have clogged drains due to hair by keeping that forest &amp;#34;mowed&amp;#34;. Not to mention the cleaner feel and odor reduction ( and they say the women like it too!). My Schick Hydro 5 inserts easily enough into the plastic holder but I need to make sure it is inserted firmly enough so that it won&#x27;t come out when using the Razorba. I recommend applying any of the Nivea For Men 3-in-one Body Wash as it leaves a slick layer on the skin which makes shaving a lot easier and more effective and I am not afraid to shave on a daily basis as there has been no bad effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you first use, the product &amp;#34;MANGROOMER Sku 211-6 Professional&amp;#34; then this product finialise the job to a perfect result. Skin becomes smooth and you can not feel any hair anywhere on your back. The best part is that you no longer need to ask someone else for help. Now you can make the jobb by yourself ;-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sturdy product and was much less expensive than most other shavers I looked into.  But it doesn&#x27;t fit the razor very well.  I have to wrap the razor in a baby wipe before putting it in the Razorba.  The description said it worked well with Gillette and disposable razors but I don&#x27;t find that to be the case without wrapping the grip of your razor.</li>
            <li> Practical and does the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get a rhythm going it&#x27;s simple.</li>
            <li> Remebember with this contraption: you ARE using a FACE razor to clip DIFFICULT back hair??.Which you will find out that the face razor get CLOGGED approx every 5 seconds.Which means you are CONSTANTLY wiping/rinsing the clogged razor blade OFF which means it takes approx ONE HOUR to do your back which is an incredibly long time to spend in the bathroom..And even then you will have missed spots...The whole concept of using a small headed FACE razor for Heavy thick back hair MAKES NO SENSE...</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good product overall.  I mean, you can&#x27;t expect it to angle the razor for you so it takes some work and practice but after a few times its a lot easier.</li>
            <li> This device is simple in design and it works. Proud its american made.  seems to be durable construction.  i am very glad i made this purchase.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> Works as an extension of your arm. You put a shaving razor in the end, so basically, it&#x27;s a matter of what type of razor you use as to how well it works.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works great with Mach 3 turbo.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It reaches all the hard to reach spots on your back. Grips my mach 3 razor like a champ</li>
            <li> The Razorba actually makes back shaving pleasant.  Definitely use a new razor and trim your back hair first if you&#x27;ve got a bumper crop.  The Razorba belongs in the personal grooming hall of fame-if there was one.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Works great!!!!</li>
            <li> Works as described. I used it with my Dollar Shave Club 4X razor handle. It doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly, you have to wedge it in there as tight as you can, but it still comes loose. You can easily use disposable razors for this though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in August.  It is a clever product - and quite sturdy.  I am very pleased with the shaver and can highly recommend it to anyone.  My advice is to shave slowly, using short strokes.  It works!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works great and is so easy to use.  Perfect gift for the well groomed man</li>
            <li> As advertised. Works great every time.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Second time purchasing since it worked okay the first time using it. First one the grey inner piece came free of the screw holdi NH it in place. Second one didn&#x27;t even make it thru one use and the entire screw came out during use. Awful awful awful.</li>
            <li> This thing is a little awkward, but i gotta admit it really does work! Seems very pricey though, it would&#x27;ve made five stars if not for that...would be a great stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> Works like a champ!  Don&#x27;t even need to use any shave cream / lotion...just stand in the shower stream of water and have at it.  The water provides all the moisture and lubrication you need, and the flowing water washes the hair away as you shave.  Piece of cake, smooth as silk.  The tube holds on to the cheap &amp;#34;Good News&amp;#34; disposable razors that I use for normal shaving...no need to get any expensive, fancy 3-4-5 blade gimmicks.  I could not be more satisfied with the design and function.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to get use for shaving back . I just have little fine hair at back. Just want to be clean/ neat under my gym tanks . Razorba  delivers , I uses shick double blade disposable inserted to  raxorba ( can adjust angle &amp; extend of exposed length). With gentle glides , I get a smooth back &amp; also other locations . Thanks raxorba team .</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> Exactly, as advertised, and just what I needed. Thanks!</li>
            <li> As described. Sturdy construction. Will fit most disposable and non- disposable razors including the Schick Hydro 5. While a little pricey, is worth its salt.</li>
            <li> not much more to say - works as expected, no batteries and much better reach compared to the mechanical back trimmers I was using.</li>
