            <li>With the Vinylux topcoat, this polish dries fast and looks great!</li>
            <li>This is a great spring color and with the vinylux topcoat it lasts the full week.  </li>
            <li>far as the Vinylux itself, it works great and looks great.  </li>
            <li>So far, it is the best color that I have found in this line.  </li>
            <li>I love nail polish and the CND brand - but I found that shellac was a pain to put on my fingers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite summer color.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>However, this shade is much more orange than it appears.</li>
            <li>So many compliments on this color and it lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li>keep in mind that to get the durable, 1 week wear, you must top it with the vinylux topcoat.</li>
            <li>did not stay on more than 3 days</li>
            <li>The color is more orange than the pic, but still worked with my skin tone</li>
            <li>Great wear for a good 5-7 days with minor wear showing on the edges.</li>
            <li>I have made sure that I followed the instructions for applying it by using the Scrubfresh to clean my nails and sealing it with the Vinylux topcoat sealer.</li>
            <li>I frequently polish my own nails with nice results but not so with this product.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li>The nail polish lacquer is very easy to use, stays on well, and this color is really pretty.  </li>
            <li>Stays on a week but because you use no base coat it stains your nails.</li>
            <li>Vinylux polishes dry very quickly and this is a great value.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it quickly and it came packaged well, so no complaints about the experience, just the color.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color of a pinky coral.</li>
            <li>I like these colors for toes during the summer months &amp; a very pretty color for nails too.</li>
            <li>I never fail to receive a compliment when I wear this color, Tropix!</li>
            <li>This one did last a full week when used with their top coat.</li>
            <li>Pretty color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use it again just because the color was pretty, but it wasn&#x27;t as miraculous as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>This is the first nail product I&#x27;ve used that stays on for a week without chipping.</li>
            <li>and it really lasts!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m fair skinned) and I got compliments on it from a few people!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery &amp; packaged well.</li>
            <li>I like this brand of polish, it really stays on a week.</li>
            <li>and I love the quality; it really does last a week, but even at the nail salon, they could not remove all of the red from my toes.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product based upon my spouse.</li>
            <li>Used the color on bare nails, applied 2 coats with plenty of dry time, used the special top coat, but still got chipping within a few days.  </li>
            <li>Usually my nails chip by the second day, but this easily lasts for 5 as long as you use the top coat.  </li>
            <li>Seems like pretty standard nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I have bought at least 5 colors as well as the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I realize that they say that you don&#x27;t need a base coat, but I ALWAYS use a basecoat and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>It does last the full week without chipping (I also ordered and used the Vinylux topcoat) and it comes right off usually with regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>Wife really loves the color and so do I, and how long it stays on without chipping.</li>
            <li>As much as I love this polish and the Tropix coral tone, this particular color is really tough to remove which is why I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>This polish really does last a long time.  </li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t last an entire week, it sure held up extremely well for at least 5 days.  </li>

            <li> This polish really does last a long time.  Usually my nails chip by the second day, but this easily lasts for 5 as long as you use the top coat.  I have been wearing this color nonstop.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for these polishes they go on thin and are streaky.  I frequently polish my own nails with nice results but not so with this product.  Never again</li>

            <li> This is the only polish I&#x27;m buying from now on! I&#x27;ve never had a polish (except gel) last a full week without serious chips and the need for a touch-up after a few days. This one did last a full week when used with their top coat. Love!</li>
            <li> Best nail polish I have ever used.  While it didn&#x27;t last an entire week, it sure held up extremely well for at least 5 days.  I have bought at least 5 colors as well as the top coat.  I have thin, brittle nails and nothing works as well as this polish.  Buy this product, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is a great spring color and with the vinylux topcoat it lasts the full week.  Even strangers complimented me on my nails when I wore this!</li>
            <li> its the only nail enamel that last in my hands without the roughness to the nails of shelac</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, if a bit bright.  It lasted a week as advertized, used with recommended products, even on flaking nails!</li>
            <li> Billed as orange, it is not! It is a deep pink. I returned it. So beware color descriptions online. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Pretty color.  Seems like pretty standard nail polish.  Used the color on bare nails, applied 2 coats with plenty of dry time, used the special top coat, but still got chipping within a few days.

            <li> Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> 1.  DOESN&#x27;T LAST BUT 4 DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;2  COLOR LOOKS TO BE PINK ON COMPUTER, BUT TOO ORANGE IN REALITY OR WHEN APPLIED.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color of a pinky coral. I like these colors for toes during the summer months &amp; a very pretty color for nails too. Vinylux polishes dry very quickly and this is a great value. Fast delivery &amp; packaged well.</li>

            <li> As much as I love this polish and the Tropix coral tone, this particular color is really tough to remove which is why I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars.  I have ordered a bunch of CND Vinylux polishes and I love the quality; it really does last a week, but even at the nail salon, they could not remove all of the red from my toes.  I haven&#x27;t had that experience with the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Vinylux itself, it works great and looks great.  It does last the full week without chipping (I also ordered and used the Vinylux topcoat) and it comes right off usually with regular nail polish remover.

            <li> Color matches perfectly with the CND Shellac Tropix.</li>
            <li> Stays on a week but because you use no base coat it stains your nails. Pretty color nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li> This is the first nail product I&#x27;ve used that stays on for a week without chipping. I am very happy with it !</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a coral pink color, this is it!!  keep in mind that to get the durable, 1 week wear, you must top it with the vinylux topcoat.</li>
            <li> Polish never lasts on my nails.  This lasted only 2 days.  I had hoed it would last longer before peeling off.</li>
            <li> did not stay on more than 3 days</li>
            <li> Great wear for a good 5-7 days with minor wear showing on the edges. The color is more orange than the pic, but still worked with my skin tone (I&#x27;m fair skinned) and I got compliments on it from a few people!</li>
            <li> Best polish EVER- Trust me it lasts</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and it really lasts!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last a week for me, it starts to chip and flake after 3 days.</li>
            <li> I never fail to receive a compliment when I wear this color, Tropix! It&#x27;s bright, cheerful, and perfect for summer. My delivery was when stated and the product was intact. I remain a fan of this longer lasting since I use and wash my hands often.</li>
