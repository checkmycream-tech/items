            <li>I think it&#x27;s still a good product</li>
            <li>I am still giving them a 5 star rating because they are as pictured, have nice case, and are a great value.  </li>
            <li>one or two did shed but stops if you take good care of it.</li>
            <li>its good.</li>
            <li>I even gave the hairs a good tug, and washed them well, and no hairs came out.</li>

            <li>Loved the price.</li>

            <li>I loved the foundation brush, and yet the hairs continued to fall out of that one as well.</li>

            <li>good quality for the amount of brushes you get in the case.</li>
            <li>but they weren&#x27;t even good quality in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>however I thought were good quality.</li>
            <li>I  would recommend them to anyone wanting a good set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>they are good.</li>
            <li>She cleans them about every three days by soaking them in dish detergent and water mixture and are still as good as the day she received them.</li>

            <li>if you really love makeup and doing a great job, these are not for you.</li>
            <li>None of the brushes are great for applying eyeshadow or blending, they are more the type for applying cream eyeshadow or highlight.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am glad I bought these, it is a great starter set or to fill out your collection</li>
            <li>IS GREAT :)</li>

            <li>Cute color, work great for the price.</li>
            <li>The material is all very cheap, the bristles are flimsy!</li>
            <li>Well, the quality of the brushes are great, I love the color</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s really nice on the eye but the brush quality isn&#x27;t good</li>

            <li>I kind of wish it came with labels</li>

            <li>Every kind of brush is in this set.  </li>

            <li>She wanted to have some nice cosmetic brushes.  </li>
            <li>Made kind of flimsley.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like glue of some kind... but</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t brush on nicely</li>
            <li>I do recommend the E.L.F studio brushes if you don&#x27;t want to spend much money on brushes. :D</li>
            <li>It went away however, after I washed them with warm water and baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>they were really nice until&lt;</li>
            <li>Some of my friends even want to get their own sets of these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the brushes at first.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve cleaned really nicely for me with some baby shampoo and warm water.  </li>
            <li>My daugther purchased this with her own money.  </li>
            <li>They Are Really Nice Brushes.</li>

            <li>they arnt even useful for paint brushes!!!</li>

            <li>if your looking for a decent set of makeup brushes then this set would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Many of these brushes are exactly what I wanted and excellent.</li>
            <li>The product is decent for the price, not the best</li>

            <li>Great quality, brushes are really soft and the product is great for traveling</li>
            <li>I knew it would be a stretch to get good brushes for so cheap, but i think people need to be honest about these brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are good for beginners, but most of them would probably serve better as painting brushes.  </li>
            <li>The handles are not attached very strongly either.  </li>
            <li>Does have a very strong odor of paint (the makeup bag) .</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s very easy to fix</li>
            <li>I love that I got so many makeup brushes so inexpensively!</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with these babies!</li>

            <li>Very soft and cute case, perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy girl right now</li>
            <li>It goes away quick and the brushes work amazing!</li>
            <li>SO IS THE BAG, BUT IT HAs a STRONG paint smell!</li>
            <li>I love love love these brushes!</li>
            <li>I cant fix and the smell of paint was strong but whatever!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect those brushes to be so good!</li>
            <li>Great brushes easy to clean</li>
            <li>great set of pieces and amazing service, it really was what i wanted and need for myself.</li>
            <li>I was heading towards getting the $150 sigma set but honestly, this was a better deal &amp; you get so many brushes</li>
            <li>and they contain more than what i need super good &amp; nice</li>
            <li>i think they r great blend shadows well easy to clean</li>
            <li>The synthetic fibers are better for make up artist because it is very easy to wash without shedding.</li>
            <li>I was kinda happy with them at first</li>
            <li>First I want to add that I have never done a review before in my life about any product , but I decided I woukd do one on these brushes because they are that great.</li>
            <li>The brushes were great and SOOO SOFT!!!!</li>
            <li>said and soaked them in shampoo and now they smell just fine!</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re fine!</li>
            <li>and they smelled just fine!</li>
            <li>Super girly!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are very secure in the tote.  </li>
            <li>case looks very cheap</li>
            <li>Just the plastic looks very cheap........</li>
            <li>anything better, they were soft &amp;i love the way it works with my favorite make-up!!!</li>
            <li>if the top pops on any of your brushes just use some good glue and it will fix it right up!</li>
            <li>These brushes are sooo soft and work so amazing!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if your want your face looking good too!</li>
            <li>I also loved how quickly I received the item.</li>
            <li>The smell was a strong acetone kind of smell or maybe even acrylic.</li>
            <li>The big buffer brushes and the foundation brushes are beautiful and soft and very good but the one for the eyes aren&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>But, they are great and easy to bring with, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>will probably give them to my little sister to play with because they won&#x27;t do me any good, but again a great buy for beginners!</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews and because many people wrote about the bag smelling I immediately took it out of the package to air it out before giving this to my sister for her birthday.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell as badly as many people made it seem</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I CAN&#x27;T WAIT FOR THEM :3</li>
            <li>so much better than wasting 50 bucks on 12 brushes  from Mac.</li>
            <li>Brushes are shipped fast and are packaged great.</li>
            <li>I use these brushes for eye shadow,blush,bronzer, eye liner, my brows, I just love this product no doubts about it</li>

            <li>It was an okay purchase for me, but that was just preference.</li>
            <li>There were too many brushes for me to handle.</li>
            <li>: I think I ended up throwing away most of the brushes.  </li>

            <li>This was the perfect gift for my younger sister.</li>
            <li>and she is in love.</li>

            <li>Okay so like most of you, I was in the business of finding some good quality brushes without having to shell out too much money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good considering the price...</li>
            <li>The brushes are nicely made, work great, and best of all weren&#x27;t to expensive.  </li>

            <li>I own this brush set for a month now and it have not failed me once!</li>
            <li>Great item and brushes are precise and very soft!</li>
            <li>This brush set has all you need in a nice compact case, I highly recommend it as a nice gift too.</li>
            <li>:) I just wish there was a little bit more variety when it comes to the eyeshadow brushes (a blending brush would be awesome!)</li>
            <li>For me, that is the most important.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a light application of blush</li>
            <li>I love that the important brushes come with &amp;#34;covers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Some many to choose from it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it if you are expecting anything more than cheap drugstore quality.</li>
            <li>Totally Happy With My Purchase Thus Far.</li>
            <li>ELF has better brushes and are also cheap.</li>
            <li>And i love how smooth they feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>They are soft and work great..</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it will turn out so great because the bristles are so soft and flimsy.</li>
            <li>totally recommend it, if i could i would totally buy another one lol its awesome</li>
            <li>So soft and great quality.</li>
            <li>I think makes better brushes for a cheap line.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft, they made a great gift for my niece.  </li>
            <li>In love with these brushes I do make up for pageants prom important dates</li>

            <li>I bought these for myself and so far they are great.</li>
            <li>But anyway after everything was fixed and cleaned It turned out to be a great palette.</li>
            <li>This is a really a great set of brushes - extremly soft and seem durable.</li>
            <li>Is one of the most important brushes</li>
            <li>The pink brushes are great!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you are looking for a very versatile brush set, but would recommend if you are looking for a good value set for learning.</li>
            <li>Everyone on my dance team loved them and now they want to get some too haha.</li>
            <li>I honestly dont think this is worth it</li>

            <li>The brushes are great quality and SUPER SOFT!!!</li>
            <li>the bag it comes with is SUPER cute and easy to use :)</li>
            <li>Overall great product for a great price HIGHLY RECOMEND.</li>
            <li>I looked up a lot of other types of brush kits and read the reviews on them, but this is by far the best you are going to get for CHEAP!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hobby of mine and these are perfect and extremely affordable.  </li>
            <li>Not only are they really attractive to the eye, but they&#x27;re pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I took them out of the carrycase and put in a vase in the bathroom so they are more accessible.</li>
            <li>so glad I ordered and so worth the price!</li>
            <li>and all those things in such a good prize!</li>
            <li>You wont regret getting them they are soo cute and so soft very cute purse even better in person.  </li>

            <li>they where good as new !</li>
            <li>The brush kit came in a amazing time and they were soft and they work amazingly</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>they fall off the stems easily.</li>
            <li>They would work great wet to get a nice defined edge.</li>
            <li>No worries easy to fix but just a heads up.</li>
            <li>The brushes can easily be compared to high-end brands.</li>
            <li>This brush set arrived very quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I got the item very quickly.</li>
            <li>it is easy to keep the brushes organized.  </li>
            <li>The case makes them easy to keep together and to store.</li>
            <li>they are really soft but not too much just perfect.</li>
            <li>What an exciting, action-packed set of awesome cosmetic brushes for my teen daughter to color herself with.</li>
            <li>It took them awhile to get here, and when I opened them i did notice the fairly strong chemical type smell a lot of people had mentioned smelling.</li>
            <li>and they are strong but</li>
            <li>BUT NOTHING TO STRONG</li>
            <li>I picked out this set based on the great price, the number of brushes, and the nice roll-up pink case.</li>
            <li>they are cute and soft but have a good grip.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Mine are not that strong smelling</li>
            <li>I did not notice a strong smell that others are commenting on, but I also didn&#x27;t buy them for the case and do not store them in the case (which seems to be the source of everyone&#x27;s complaints).  </li>
            <li>Has a strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>Not the case with these brushes, GREAT length, great size overall, and very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>the price you pay, these are GREAT products, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re GREAT brushes.</li>
            <li>Them brushes are super soft and them bag is beautiful.</li>
            <li>AMAZING QUALITY BRUSH AND REALLY PRETTY.</li>
            <li>:) i am thrilled to of found such a amazing product.</li>
            <li>I believe for the price that these are amazing brushes for someone interested in make up and is just beginning.</li>
            <li>The brushes in general are great.</li>
            <li>Brushes are true to picture love the quality of the brushes .</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t fallen apart or anything like that, pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t even used them at all, but they look exactly like they do in the picture.</li>
            <li>This was a pretty nice set.  </li>
            <li>but when you wash ur brushes their good as new</li>
            <li>and it was just fine.</li>
            <li>U can tell the brushes are cheap because the bristles come out easily.  </li>
            <li>They still work fine</li>
            <li>But air it out and youll be fine.</li>
            <li>But they work fine for a beginner who&#x27;s learning..</li>
            <li>it is fine now.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and the glue wears of easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>it is fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>product may be fine, but, this company has no clue as to how to resolve a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes work well when applying make-up and again are super cute.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very very soft and are good quality.</li>
            <li>They are good quality, a brush for every need and are very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an amazing value and definitely a great gift idea for someone looking to learn more about makeup application, experiment with different types of brushes, and any makeup diva who needs a new \\&quot;tool kit\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very much loved these so far, though!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love these brushes very pretty can&#x27;t wait to use them and write another review for them ..</li>
            <li>I loved it all the brushes were soft and made it easy to do my make-up</li>
            <li>they are super soft and great quality.</li>
            <li>The brushes are true to color, extremely soft and i love them!!</li>
            <li>arrived super fast, the product is great, soft brushes, nice quality, and the carrying case is super cute.</li>
            <li>I Love Love Love my new brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a very pretty pink, and they are beautiful.!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super easy to use clean and store!</li>
            <li>The case and brushes look exactly as they do in the pictures, however, the case does have a very strong smell of paint.</li>
            <li>overall very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>simply heavenly I am very pleased with this product I cant think of anything to complain about!  </li>
            <li>I simply love them and will buy another set for my daughter for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;The roll-up pouch does smell of \\&quot;strong plastic\\&quot; but nothing I haven&#x27;t experienced with other products.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t really a huge deal for me</li>
            <li>Cleaning brushes between clients will eat into your time, not tremendously, but it&#x27;s best to have an abundance of clean brushes.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t really have any nice brushes for brow bone/highlight.</li>
            <li>your looking for great brushed for eyeshadow</li>
            <li>These are cute and useful.</li>
            <li>I actually got this product before I was suppose to, so I&#x27;m happy about that.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and fall apart.</li>
            <li>For a middle schooler - this may be a great product</li>
            <li>These brushes were alright, great deal for the price, but the eyebrow spoolie broke the second week I had it!</li>
            <li>It has all I need for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Will not buy again, product cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Powder and eyeshadow application smooth and picks up rather nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, they are great.</li>
            <li>IT WAS CHEAP</li>
            <li>I bought these for the price and color of the brushes, they do their job and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The smell was really light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to spending a lot of money on my makeup and brushes and doubt anything that is too cheap.</li>
            <li>for SO CHEAP.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from a cheap material and you can tell.</li>
            <li>its not that great for people who wear daily makeup..</li>
            <li>These are great for anyone starting off with makeup.</li>
            <li>The company is fast and amazing.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>otherwise the brushed are great.</li>
            <li>the shipping was free because,It was ground and would take 14-25 days , which I could have choose a faster ship</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m cheap and didn&#x27;t mind the wait.</li>
            <li>These are SO cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I purchased these a few months ago and they work wonderfully!</li>
            <li>but I got it the very next day which was great.</li>
            <li>This product is cheaply made, but useable.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the brushes once, but the were great.</li>
            <li>They r easy to clean</li>
            <li>, they clean easily</li>
            <li>i would let her spend a &#x27;reasonable&#x27; amount of money on something she liked.....</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes were cheap material</li>
            <li>I also have a few MAC brushes but these are wonderful.</li>
            <li>for an everyday use they are awesome!</li>
            <li>Obviously they&#x27;re not going to be great quality</li>
            <li>For the price though I am happy with the face brushes and would expect to pay way more for individual ones so that alone is worth the price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a makeup artist I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing these brushes as they are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>These makeup brushes are so cute and such a good value.</li>
            <li>They were soft which was good.</li>
            <li>i bought these as my old ones i lost and they are good-</li>
            <li>but overall they&#x27;re good brushes :)</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>the brushes are so soft and are good quality need to get them if you are in a budget</li>
            <li>The brushes were soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value for a set of brushes that are soft and work well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful deal since at the store you pay as much for smaller sets and cheaper quality.  </li>
            <li>and the brushes are so soft and so good to work with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are really nicely colored, and have a good aesthetic quality to them if you like loads of pink.</li>
            <li>Overall, this was a great purchase and it came right on time :)</li>
            <li>i use these everyday and love love love them!!</li>
            <li>I clean them every month and they work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super super soft almost like cotton lol.</li>
            <li>, they are very useful in some instances.</li>
            <li>I spent hours searching reviews and a good set of brushes!</li>
            <li>I love them because they are very soft and easy to clean :)</li>
            <li>so come on girls, less complain, is a WONDERFUL price, they are so soft and nice</li>
            <li>It was pink and pretty and fits perfect in my purse</li>
            <li>Considering my professional makeup artist friend was interested in them after she did my makeup with them, I&#x27;m going to say I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>There all beautiful soft and work very well</li>
            <li>travels well and is super easy to pack</li>

            <li>I am so excited to try them out,</li>
            <li>So I was excited to get these brushes</li>
            <li>I love these so much!</li>
            <li>at first i said okay, no biggie...</li>
            <li>I was pleased when I first got them.</li>
            <li>totally worth it!</li>
            <li>This was well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a student of cosmetology and these have not disappointed me at all.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to use it when I go to school.</li>
            <li>I told her to give me a chance to look on Amazon first and if we didn&#x27;t find anything she was satisfied with</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to get here because it is shipped from China, but I think it was worth it for the bargain!</li>
            <li>i was so excited when they arrived.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty ok for now.</li>
            <li>When I got these brushes in the mail I was so excited</li>
            <li>TOTALLY WORTH IT !&lt;</li>
            <li>The money was really worth it !</li>
            <li>i am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>They have been great for me as a beginner; I just would have preferred a little more of a guide.</li>
            <li>The eye brushes are very firm and nice!!!</li>
            <li>Some brushes are better than others, but overall they&#x27;re nice.</li>
            <li>BUT if you clean the (which you should) and the brush case, they will not smell anymore.</li>
            <li>However if you don&#x27;t have enough money for really nice ones, then you will be satisfied with these.</li>
            <li>great simple and useful.</li>
            <li>but you can clean them and vua-la</li>
            <li>i see the clean finish</li>
            <li>so you will want to clean them and let them air out for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>to clean..</li>
            <li>time to clean if you don&#x27;t maintain it well like I do</li>
            <li>The bag is so pretty and shiny as well and just has an overall beautiful look to it.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and apply the make up so evenly and nicely definitely the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>

            <li>Yes, the brushes do have a paint kind of smell, but there sooo soft &amp;&#x27;d so far I&#x27;m loving what I purchased</li>
            <li>the brush heads arent as full as i had hoped or as the picture apeared.</li>
            <li>This 22 piece set is adorable and very functional.</li>
            <li>For the most part I really like this set.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how soft they are and how easy it is to clean them</li>
            <li>The only good brush was the fan brush ....</li>
            <li>For the price I paid these brushes are really soft and nice.</li>
            <li>the larger brushes are good.</li>
            <li>YOU&#x27;LL LOVE THEM SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Would probably be some good paint brushed for my crafts.</li>
            <li>Very gift appropriate.</li>
            <li>It is also a good product to have for people who just like to collect different kinds of brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product though.</li>
            <li>They are very comparable to the Too Faced Teddy Bear brushes, but a much better price.</li>
            <li>I actually really like how the brushes look and fell for the most part...</li>
            <li>Really nice brush set, really soft.</li>
            <li>They are not as good as my Urban Decay or</li>
            <li>I do like the big brushes though, which is good</li>
            <li>shrug*.I love the bag that holds them, the number of brushes I received and how fast my package came .</li>
            <li>Very neat and adorable set of make up brushes.</li>
            <li>but I doubt they will last over a year but still good brushes for the price</li>
            <li>Overall good quality</li>
            <li>Had the sizes she wanted and a cool pouch with it.</li>
            <li>but the price was low and it still makes it a good value.  </li>
            <li>SO WORTH IT FOR SO CHEAP</li>
            <li>When I use my &#x27;ecotools&#x27; brushes, makeup NEVER ends up on the side of my face because the brush bristles are full.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i use always in my handbag is cool</li>
            <li>I bought these as a gift for my friend who wanted a full set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really cute set, and a lot of the brushes to work really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>my daughter loved her birthday present!</li>
            <li>and I love them so much.</li>
            <li>Which was not bad.</li>
            <li>not a bad purchase though.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t get the look your really going for there great for a in a hurry makeup or a touch up but not for a long that needs to last all day for work and special night out just not my top favorite!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no shedding just a strong smell when I first took it out of the box</li>
            <li>The pink is adorable and you just can&#x27;t beat how many brushes you get for the price!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft as can be, great for sensitive skin like mine!</li>
            <li>other than that these are great brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>but other then that great brushes</li>
            <li>Upon checking around other sites, this set of brushes are a great buy.  </li>
            <li>I thought the brushes were good, but they were flat, not rounded like I wanted.</li>
            <li>these are super soft, cute, and cheaply priced.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is worth buying, and would make a good addition to any brush collection.</li>
            <li>It wore off quickly though.  </li>
            <li>Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this because I most definitely needed it.</li>
            <li>I love the nice pink roll up holder.  </li>
            <li>Perfect if you are just starting to use make up and need to learn different uses for all kinds of brushes</li>
            <li>These brushes came really quick, in 3 days.</li>
            <li>Only the fan brush and the smaller brushes didn&#x27;t work out awesome.</li>
            <li>For one, I received this product quickly (with Prime) and it was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li>so I have to super glue them.</li>
            <li>Brushes are surprisingly SUPER</li>
            <li>They are soft to the touch and works great so far.</li>
            <li>&amp;&amp; last thing I wanted to point out is all the 5 star reviews looks all the same with the excellent grammar and alot of \\&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\&quot; after every sentence</li>
            <li>so I quickly opened it up.</li>
            <li>My brushes came quickly, way ahead of schedule, and did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>i got them quick</li>
            <li>They were here quickly and packaged for safety as there weren&#x27;t any problems with any of the brushes upon receipt.</li>
            <li>If you want to have many high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>This is the very first set of make up brushes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m barely learning how to use them, so it would have been nice if they were labeled.</li>
            <li>OH yeah, and cheap ;)</li>
            <li>They are all so cute and wrapped in a cute pink bag which did have some sort of hardware smell to it that I oddly enjoy.</li>
            <li>the top just popped :/ over all the other bushes work great! :)</li>
            <li>This is a great starter set because it not only includes the most basic brushes, but some specialty ones as well.</li>
            <li>and they arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes because they seemed like a good deal... but they aren&#x27;t as soft as i thought they would be and using these brushed makes you use more makeup or eye shadow</li>
            <li>At first the brushes seemed very good but after a few months, the heads started breaking form their handles and since the hair was so dense, product didn&#x27;t stay on as well.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the whole bag.its so much for a good price.</li>
            <li>these brushes are nice if your on a tight budget, but i would honestly pick higher end brushes like sigma</li>
            <li>The bristles on the powder brushes are very soft and plush!!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, they&#x27;re pretty good</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty good for the price, obviously they are not Mac quality brushes but nonetheless they work well.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing, and I only use high quality most of the time.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and cute.</li>
            <li>When I took it out, it broke even more, however, the brushes are very soft to my liking on my face</li>
            <li>Item came in much earlier than the estimated shipping date, and they are just so adorable!</li>
            <li>and pretty i almost dont want to use the brushes&amp;#62;haha!</li>
            <li>I ordered these first and foremost because of the color!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>These brushes do exactly what they are intended to do giving you the control you need when applying makeup and achieving the effect you want!</li>
            <li>What I love is that they are super soft.</li>
            <li>Super Cute and Soft.</li>
            <li>so in love with my brushes.. super soft..</li>
            <li>The brushed are very soft and feel great on the skin.</li>
            <li>The brushes in this set aren&#x27;t of professional quality very cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Brushes are pretty and clean well&lt;br</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t attached very well but the work perfectly fine with or without the handle.</li>
            <li>this product was soo cheap and cute and the quality of the brushes dont feel cheap although it doesnt have every single brush</li>
            <li>They are very cheap and the bristles are too soft to be useful at all.. they are flimsy and don&#x27;t pick up makeup well.</li>
            <li>I wish they would have had a name or number to them, but the larger brushes are what I use the most and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>Brushes are of fine quality, so many choices for different effects.</li>
            <li>Most of them are flat and small so they&#x27;re great for applying mostly eye makeup and getting product onto the crevices of your face.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about these brushes was the large brushes.</li>
            <li>My only only gripe was that of the shaddow brushes are perfect for blending but it is NOT a problem as I think I will prefer to buy a single blending brush to add to this collection as it was most definately worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Great brushes, had them 13 months now and still use everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and very well worth it.</li>
            <li>I jut received the brushes a few days ago, they are great.</li>
            <li>But over all.. Worth the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li>absolutely.......totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so lovely and soft.</li>
            <li>You can make an equally cute one out of some old fabric.</li>
            <li>they are sooooo soft and cute</li>
            <li>The shadow brushes are not fluffy for my liking and they feel really cheap !</li>
            <li>This makeup brushes are really soft, love the color.</li>
            <li>Having a lot of fun with my makep</li>
            <li>They feel like soft bunny paws haha, and they are really nice.</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t be absorbed into bristles.</li>
            <li>The set is AWESOME and way above what I expected.</li>
            <li>There are better options that may not be as cute as these pink ones.</li>

            <li>Definitely worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I love how soft they are and how well kept up they have been.</li>
            <li>but i would save my money to get some brushes that are worth it.</li>
            <li>And they are all useful.</li>
            <li>they are everything you need for a beauty guru on a budget they are so nice except for the fan brushes they werent packaged correctly that they made a gap in the middle</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t see a need to wash unless your sticking them in things they are not meant to be used with and if they aren&#x27;t the perfect white and pink who cares, no one sees my brushes they see my makeup!</li>

            <li>can&#x27;t imagine not having the right brush to do the job.</li>
            <li>but I had to put it right against my nose to smell it.</li>
            <li>Right when I opened it up, one of the brush heads fell out of the handle.  </li>
            <li>All you need is some baby shampoo and all of the makeup washes right off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m letting it air out right now, but</li>
            <li>I also washed the brushes right away before using them, but that should be a given, no?</li>
            <li>Literally, the metal piece and brush parts just popped right off.</li>
            <li>I put the case right up to my nose</li>
            <li>the brushes came in because it caused all the brushes to bend and one of the brushes fell right off the stick when i was going to use it.</li>

            <li>prices and anyone looking for a cheap decent makeup set.</li>

            <li>Love these super soft, affordable and cute will definitely recommend them for anybody, only thing was that most of the brushes didn&#x27;t have the different angles I mainly needed but overall good product!!!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the vibrant colours of the brushes, the were extremely soft, I just wish that the set was a little more diverse in what type of brushes it came with; a blending brush would&#x27;ve been nice in it.</li>
            <li>Very large collection</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced very little shedding.</li>
            <li>Enough brushes to do any style you have in mind, from office day time look to artistic over the top beauty makeup.  </li>
            <li>the brushes are very soft and good besides the big fan brush was all bend up because of the packaging</li>
            <li>havent used them yet, but they look fun &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li>great for blending blush or bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush is either too small or my face is just</li>
            <li>I love the face brushes, fluffy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a distinct smell when you first get the brushes.</li>
            <li>So far ive only used the big fan brush for my highlighter and it works GREAT!</li>
            <li>are very dense soft and easy to clean..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re packaged wonderfully and I&#x27;m excited to actually use them when I decide to not be lazy and take them out of the pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and cute, but they hardly  hold any product or any pigment onto the brushes.</li>
            <li>Brushes are cute but they have some downsides... 1) not very pink.</li>
            <li>I was using new makeup in just days with many of these super soft brushes..</li>
            <li>SUPER fast delivery as well..</li>
            <li>(To get rid of the smell I used baby shampoo and warm water, I let them dry and now there is no smell.)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s less than good</li>
            <li>but they are good quality none the less.</li>
            <li>the only issue that I have and the reason why I&#x27;m giving it only two stars is because the quality isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t professional, but they are soft and nice to use.</li>
            <li>Me and my sister are both in winterguard and these will be perfect for not only everyday makeup but show makeup as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft, they blend well, they&#x27;re easy to take care of...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll keep your brushes clean and super soft inbetween applications.</li>
            <li>came in super fast</li>
            <li>These brushes would be great for teenage girls who are just starting to experiment with makeup!</li>
            <li>They have really soft bristles and are really easy to work with.</li>
            <li>If u don&#x27;t have these brushes definitely get them they are soooo amazing and soft and apply makeup on so well!!!</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s so ever I would recommend these super affordable, and super soft!</li>
            <li>Would be a good set for a beginner, or a teen looking to just have a first set of brushes, but a medium level to professional level makeup artist would not like them.</li>
            <li>The brushes I received were very pretty (much prettier in person) and they exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped them very fast.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the brushes very much yet.</li>
            <li>It got this order very fast.</li>
            <li>But considering the price which was very reasonable</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for the amount of brushes and the quality.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I got my brushes very fast.</li>
            <li>These brushes work very very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is very reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The brushes in this set are soft and fine for the price.</li>
            <li>Adorable, pink &amp; fun!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not totally disappointed, didn&#x27;t really expect much from this set to begin with.</li>
            <li>Soft, easy to use, but some of the brushes are repetative so you are getting more than one of the same brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Brushes are very soft and cute pink color (my favorite color).</li>
            <li>Ordered these brushes and am just in love with them and they are so soft and I live the color!  </li>
            <li>The whole set of brushes work really well!!</li>
            <li>There is a listing of what is included in the description, but that does little good if you have no idea what your looking for.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are vey soft, but they fall apart super quick.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re hard to clean which is a shame because I loved the beautiful white and pink combo.</li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s super hard to make the decision and take the risk of buying make up brushes online, but honestly, these are worth it!</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and very pretty!</li>
            <li>All the brushes are soft and very pretty!</li>
            <li>I am loving these brushes; The highlight is definitely how soft they are!!</li>
            <li>i love them there really soft and easy to use there also very pretty for any girl that likes pink</li>
            <li>Soft tips and a huge variety.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly that does not really matter, it&#x27;s the brushes that count, which are again AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I have used them mostly for heavier makeup, such as theater and costume work.  </li>
            <li>There are so many different sizes and shapes to chose from I</li>
            <li>These brushes are mostly that sane brush over a iver some in different sizes.</li>
            <li>I was able to glue them back together, but I should not have to do that.</li>
            <li>I really like these!</li>
            <li>Which is a shame since they&#x27;re so pretty.</li>
            <li>I just taught they were pretty</li>
            <li>Just better for me to store a different way.  </li>
            <li>The smell went away after the first wash.</li>
            <li>I love how there is every brush you could possibly need for your make-up including an eyebrow/lash brush.</li>
            <li>these brushes are so pretty</li>
            <li>the brushes are so much bigger than i thought and so many of them.</li>
            <li>yet I love it soooo much more than my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try spraying the ends with MAC Fix+ or the similar one by elf and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a lot of smaller brushes for eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I just got them today, I was bit worried about the brush because a lot of people had negative reviews on them and mine came in great condition</li>
            <li>ONLY CUTE</li>
            <li>None of the brushes so far shed and they allow applications to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>She was pleased with the vast assortment of brushes to match her every need.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I never had any makeup brushes, so I wanted something to test out before I invested in higher end brushes.</li>
            <li>For the price, you get a lot of brushes, but some of them look exactly the same and the quality is ok, but something I wouldn&#x27;t use on clients.</li>
            <li>They may have a smell that first</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about the brushes shedding, and I have not found that after I cleaned them up a bit before the first use.</li>
            <li>3 had so much hot glue in the bristles I had to throw them out.</li>
            <li>I fell in LOVE instantly!</li>
            <li>15 bucks was wayyyyyyy much a smalll price to pay for the quality of these brushes!</li>
            <li>There was no weird smell or anything..</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>but, they sure feel the same!</li>
            <li>Pretty.</li>
            <li>A couple fell apart after opening the package, and 2 more face brushes shortly after.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve bought similar brushes on this site before and was definitely better off.</li>
            <li>the first time i used one of the brushes for blush and mineral powder i was noticing that it was shedding.</li>
            <li>Of all the 22 brushes, there is no foundation brush which is pretty upsetting.</li>
            <li>Came in almost 2 weeks ahead of time, did have a light odor of paint but went away after they aired out on my table .</li>
            <li>i have used this item so much since i have gotten it!</li>
            <li>two the fan brushes applied blush  pretty well.  </li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>When i first received them they DID smell  like plastic.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>However, they are soft, pretty and cheap.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t ask for any thing better definitely the package to by it</li>
            <li>overall i love them.</li>
            <li>this is my first brush set</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Ok for personal use.</li>
            <li>you probably washed it with hot water</li>
            <li>This are really pretty</li>
            <li>There was absolutely no shedding, and the first thing I did was wash my brushes with warm water and a bit of shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice a funny smell to these brushes or anything.</li>
            <li>I love these but the only problem with them is that they smell.</li>
            <li>You get a lot of brushes for the price &amp; they&#x27;re a pretty girl -</li>
            <li>It sheds soooo much !</li>
            <li>I tried to make this sound professional</li>
            <li>The Brushes are soft but when you get them they stank like cheap plastic</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It may just be from over use of the make up brush, which is the most likely answer.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ever buying anything off the internet.</li>
            <li>The set looks exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>it comes with a lot of brushes and the belt case with cover protectors for the big brushes :)</li>
            <li>some of the brushes that i used for the first time came apart</li>
            <li>There are too many fan and big powder brushes for my taste, however.</li>
            <li>The brush holder and the brushes had a funny smell to the.</li>
            <li>when i first got them</li>
            <li>i might end up buying myself a set in the future. :)</li>
            <li>They had a funny odor when I received them.</li>
            <li>Now I see why there are many people giving away similar brush sets.</li>
            <li>Oh and it smells funny</li>
            <li>this one was okay only because when they opened it one of the brushes was kinda messed up.</li>
            <li>But overall it was an OK experience</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a bit of initial maintenance, it&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>I was scared at first because of the reviews</li>
            <li>I bought these for my sister who is an avid makeup user.</li>
            <li>love the colors, love the softness of the bristles and its actually A LOT bigger</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a pretty well-rounded set that will cover most makeup application needs.</li>
            <li>I really love this set and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>first of all</li>
            <li>Better than I thought, Totally recommended!</li>
            <li>I really love the fan big fan brush for Highlighting.</li>
            <li>but if you wash with soap and warm water the pink comes through again.</li>
            <li>I just wish they have big stippling brush and more of a dome shaped blender brush.</li>
            <li>This was the first brush set I had ever purchased</li>
            <li>So, it WILL stink when you first receive it</li>
            <li>they are so pretty</li>
            <li>Brushes look pretty</li>
            <li>Im sure if i buy some hot glue i can glue them back.</li>
            <li>overall I think they&#x27;re okay for beginners.</li>
            <li>I lobe how there are so many brushes that you don&#x27;t have to worry about reusing the same brush twice when your doing you makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>brushes are exactly like the picture, I didn&#x27;t get any fall out, and they work well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My favorite brushes are the bigger faces ones.</li>
            <li>and I do really like it!</li>
            <li>DO NOT PURCHASE THESE BRUSHES FOR MORE THAN $16 INCLUDING SHIPPING AND HANDLING ANY PRICES ABOVE</li>
            <li>These suck and are not makeup brushes although the larger ones are okay.</li>
            <li>love the brushes but they do no last.</li>
            <li>Just pulled out my trusty hot glue gun and bam.</li>
            <li>Because that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li>Also use just a bit of conditioner on them the first time you wash them it&#x27;ll prevent shedding (this tip is for ALL brushes not just these)</li>
            <li>And the most exiting part its that not only do they work so well</li>
            <li>When I first got it, it smelled kinda funny</li>
            <li>I have other brushes that I&#x27;ve had for years that I found the other day, washed, and they looked perfect.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading my review Godbless &amp; Jesus loves you! x</li>
            <li>Overall the brushes are ok.</li>
            <li>When I took the plastic wrap off the first brush all of the bristles started to fall out.</li>
            <li>Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be great soft brushes because i read previous comments.</li>
            <li>They are super cute with the pink handles.</li>
            <li>They r amazingly soft too!!!!</li>
            <li>Most are flat filbert style, which you only need so many of.  </li>
            <li>The bigger, fluffier ones are very soft and feel nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>they have no ugly smell like people say it just smells like new.</li>
            <li>These brushes are more for beginners than experienced people , but I have to say these are quite soft and they work pretty good except for the liquid foundation blender, it was too flimsy and soft for me to blend my foundation :(</li>
            <li>Brushes are high quality and very pretty.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very appealing to look at and do have a slight smell ( this is a result of the case)</li>
            <li>a hand full of the bristles came out, I have not tried using them yet because I just got them today, but they are very soft and except for the one brush that fell apart</li>
            <li>There are tons of them in so many different shapes, and they&#x27;re super soft!  </li>
            <li>Cheap cheap cheap &amp; stiffer than a dead body.!</li>
            <li>Other than that, nice product for a synthetic makeup brushes</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these brushes because of the variety and alot of positive reviews, but after receiving them the quality of the brush is good soft and fluffy but they do absolutely NOTHING to your makeup.</li>
            <li>She was soo happy she&#x27;s been wearing makeup everyday feeling so professional with her brushes.</li>
            <li>Soft durable and application is amazing not to mention it arrived in such a hurry</li>
            <li>Really, you&#x27;re better off getting a product that actually works.</li>
            <li>Id say if you need brushes on a budget these are the way to go, I love them so much I might buy another set in a different color!!</li>
            <li>you should get at least the mac brushed, but for home use they work wonderful, and the smell</li>
            <li>I am a college student who does makeup for fashion shows and these are really nice simply because they dont fall apart, they don&#x27;t shed and they&#x27;re soft.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes aren&#x27;t quite as soft, but still do a nice job.  </li>
            <li>But overall I love it and really looks pro</li>
            <li>I recommend this set to anyone who is starting out for fun, likes to do primarily eye makeup, and for traveling.</li>
            <li>The brushes I use for eyeshadow hold the color nicely and by the same token, are so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and seem very durable and the touches of pink make the set super cute!</li>
            <li>they are super soft and are very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>love these brushes, I probably won&#x27;t buy more brushes for a long long time because these are just so pretty</li>
            <li>Other than that I have used the brushes and I really love them, if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like harsh brushes then this is good for you!</li>
            <li>these brushes are super soft and look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I like it just as much as my Sephora set, maybe even a little bit more because it is in such a cute color!</li>
            <li>As the brush started to fall apart, I could see that there was some form of cheap glue just barely holding the ferrule and handle together.</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend if you love pink &amp; doing make up.</li>
            <li>Brushes I got from Costco were better and lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li>(cause she loses everything), and i must say, they are quite nice!</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>and they are pretty, but thats not saying much when the hair is falling out.</li>
            <li>pretty, I don&#x27;t so much like the case</li>
            <li>So I bought her first REAL makeup brush set</li>
            <li>Pretty brushes but very synthetic.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, and true to color.</li>
            <li>I guess everyone has their own opinion, but in mine these brushes are not worth buying.</li>
            <li>other than that the brushes are soft and good.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the size of them, they are large and the handles are long in length</li>
            <li>Some were repeats but very satisfied for less than 11 bucks!</li>
            <li>they are pretty soft and very durable!!</li>
            <li>They work very well though and they&#x27;re super soft!</li>
            <li>They are also super durable as per they stand up to my 3 year old taking them and smashing them on the floor</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and durable and for the price it cannot be matched.</li>
            <li>They are super soft on my face.</li>
            <li>They are super soft, and not even one bristle fell after I washed them.</li>
            <li>super soft  smell</li>
            <li>They are super soft and hold product well.</li>
            <li>they are super soft</li>
            <li>They are super soft as well.</li>
            <li>They are super soft, there has been no shedding</li>
            <li>and if you want you could wash them, but i&#x27;m not making a big deal out of it because it isn&#x27;t as strong as people make it out to be.</li>
            <li>I only came across one problem, when I received them they had a strong smell of plastic.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that the brush tips came unglued from the handles of certain brushes.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and soft.</li>
            <li>I had bought this for myself a few months ago and love the material!</li>
            <li>You might be able to use the flat eyeshadow brushes for packing on color, if it is a high pigmented shadow.</li>
            <li>None of the bristles were loose and they came in a really cute carrying case, so you can always be on the go with these brushes!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a strong smell but that&#x27;s common with most brushes.</li>
            <li>Cleans easy and the brushes and wood and conectors hold up for regular monthy cleaning with gentle clensers.</li>
            <li>after reading the reviews about bristles falling out and the smell of the bag, i wasn&#x27;t sure about buying them but for less than 50 cents a piece, it was totally worth it</li>
            <li>These brushes hold pigment good but the types of brushes is limited there is no eyeshadow blending brush and all the brushes are shaped the same, I would reccomend.</li>
            <li>Despite reading the mixed reviews on this product, I decided to take my chances and hope the positive reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes and the fine line brushes are my favorites.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes are very high quality, haven&#x27;t had a problem with almost a month of use.</li>
            <li>This shows that they&#x27;re not of very high quality.</li>
            <li>The brushes were very soft and nothing was sheding off of the and the color was right on.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and they really get the job done!!</li>
            <li>, it was pretty troublesome to clean up and swab each eye shadows not only that</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, even if your a make-up artist ;)</li>
            <li>The light pink ombre showed exactly how I imagined it!</li>
            <li>The brushes were very soft!!</li>
            <li>They are VERY soft!!</li>
            <li>They are super soft and really cute being pink!</li>
            <li>I love the color and the pink bag, The tote makes it much easier to carry in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I still love them and nothing has gone wrong at all.</li>
            <li>but I do wear make up everyday and this set is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>All the material is really cheap, brushes don&#x27;t even apply make up properly.</li>
            <li>Plus there was a really foul smell that came with the brushes.</li>
            <li>I really just wanted the case</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast; don&#x27;t expect 22 working brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like this set...</li>
            <li>She mostly loves the pink color.  </li>
            <li>They all work really well and are dense.</li>
            <li>Came well packed and was in a cute pink leather carrier.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much need for the use of the fan brushes but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>I really like the brushes but</li>
            <li>Also when you wash these I&#x27;ve noticed that the color stays and isn&#x27;t really effected by the make up.</li>
            <li>Works very well with makeup and my skin.</li>
            <li>so you will have a whole array of brushes to fill out your brush collection for that stuff</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE THIS BRUSHES AND THE PRICE</li>
            <li>but most of them were no very well made</li>
            <li>You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>(I use a coconut/almond oil mix to remove the excess, then wash with a gentle anti-bacterial soap just like I do with my sponges).</li>
            <li>REALLY REGRET BUYING THEM FOR SO MUCH...</li>
            <li>Awsome set came with a cute roll up pink plether case.</li>
            <li>They also came very well wrapped and everything looked as advertised.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li>but i think it was just because these were pink and cute.</li>
            <li>these are your starter brushes, be careful, the face brushes suck and the eye brushes have many duplicates.</li>
            <li>My whole makeup bag got lost at school one day</li>
            <li>I couldnt believe how fast the shipping was.</li>
            <li>She wants another set for her sister.  </li>
            <li>Very displeased.</li>
            <li>I have just used 2 or 3 of the brushes out of the whole set.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to wash them very often..</li>
            <li>bought two sets for my cousins, they are going to love them, these brushes are softer than i had expected.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner brush didn&#x27;t work too well for me as it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold its shape very well.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy doing makeup and for starters too</li>
            <li>so i wouldn&#x27;t really expect much else.</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t understand why it was so much..</li>
            <li>You get a lot of different brushes for cheap.</li>
            <li>It is also a more metallic pink</li>
            <li>and u couldn&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li>The plastic smell that was mentioned dissipated after an hour after I opened the package, so no problems there, and the brushes cleaned really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just try to air on the side of gentle.</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>The brushes do not pick up makeup very well or that at all.</li>
            <li>i think its more for kids or minimal use..</li>
            <li>The case and brushes did smell like chemicals when I opened it, but I don&#x27;t really mind that, it will go away.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the brush set is still very workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this sets of make up brush, the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>They really hold on the color.</li>
            <li>I actully really like this set.</li>
            <li>I really like them all.</li>
            <li>i HIGHLY RECOMMEND these brushes!</li>
            <li>roll-up bag is also very well made and keeps the brushes protected.</li>
            <li>It has been everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li>I love the pink.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend them!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a reasonably priced bundle of brushes to add to my collection.</li>
            <li>I love the pink color and the brush holder it comes with.</li>
            <li>Over all I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>I gave them a rating of 5 because the brushes were better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the case and the shade of pink</li>
            <li>Also it came fast</li>
            <li>but I really coyuldnt stand the smell</li>
            <li>The smell of the bag smells like very processed plastic</li>
            <li>And I love Pink.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who Loves make-up as much as I do.</li>
            <li>But they do not hold or transfer pigment very well</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable, however you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>is very beautiful!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very well priced and you get a lot of brushes.  </li>
            <li>and I really like them.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely adored it.</li>
            <li>but these really do nothing it just caked my make up on</li>
            <li>and I spent more time trying to fix my make up from the brushes</li>
            <li>when you really think about it, if you buy this kit for about 12 bucks your getting each brush for around 50 cents.</li>
            <li>my favorite color is pink, and it a shame to say thats</li>
            <li>but i just dont feel like i get that much out of them</li>
            <li>The smell of the plastic didn&#x27;t bother me that much</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them yet really</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot Amazon and please don&#x27;t charge taxes.  </li>
            <li>This means that some of the makeup still stays on the brush, no matter how much you wash it.</li>
            <li>they also wash very well.</li>
            <li>Like really?</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold powder really wel...</li>
            <li>absolutely like it.</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;m really using them properly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I really think you should buy this before they run out</li>
            <li>It was fixed easily enough by leaving the brushes out for a day or so on my counter top.  </li>
            <li>overall view of the product is that it can be a good starting brush set for the young makeup enthusiast who may just be learning and building their makeup kit.</li>
            <li>Every brush has a cover and its comes out with the nice pink case and the brush was really soft.</li>
            <li>They even look soft and lovely when you open the pack.</li>
            <li>I do think the set could be a bit more complete if some fluffier eye shadow brushes, a blending brush, and a pencil brush or two were included, perhaps instead of a couple of the smaller brushes that are in the set.</li>
            <li>It kind of feels like a really fluffy dogs tail.</li>
            <li>She is thrilled with them, and uses them everyday.</li>
            <li>They are nice and firm and dont fray.  </li>
            <li>I have bought brushes for the same price and they are far better quality</li>
            <li>the brushes are super soft and are very professional!</li>
            <li>Its a very strong odd plastic smell.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and pick up just the right amount of colors from any eyeshadow pallette.</li>
            <li>They ARE NOT THAT HARD TO CLEAN , like most people say.</li>
            <li>, I wanted decent brushes that I am not paying hundreds for, and I certainly received that.</li>
            <li>Very cute brushes, the handles are pink and the brushes themselves ombré from white to pink:)</li>
            <li>denser.they are very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>These came within a week after ordering which was surprising because I was sure it&#x27;d at least be a few weeks before seeing them, so that was the first plus.</li>
            <li>They dont hold up as well as the more expensive ones but pretty good for daily use.</li>
            <li>: very soft , they look really pretty .</li>
            <li>and they are not only pretty, but they are super soft and other than a few hairs falling out when I cleaned them (that&#x27;s normal), they are perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes themselves are nice and full and fluffy, I was looking to get this kit to replace a lot of my worn brushes as well as expand the brush options I had before, and this definitely does the trick.</li>
            <li>You get so many brushes AND PINK!</li>
            <li>I love the pink bag and everything!</li>
            <li>If I was being extremely picky, I might say that I was just wishing it could be more of a brush belt, but that&#x27;s not what the product is advertised as.</li>
            <li>Love that they are pink!</li>
            <li>my powder is applied better than with any other brush.</li>
            <li>Yes they&#x27;re adorable and pink!</li>
            <li>I came across these brushes and fell in love with the pink bristles!</li>
            <li>goshh but other than that i love them</li>
            <li>These type of stiff flat brushes are great for concealer, primer, cream products, lipstick, gel liner, etc.</li>
            <li>As I noted in some other reviews when I first opened the package the brush roll and brushes did smell quite strongly like paint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very pink which I love.</li>
            <li>I recommend using your facial cleanser or Ivory bar soap to clean them.</li>
            <li>however i cant get these clean enough.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are soft and pretty, but they do not work very well.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re pretty good not great</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why these are rated so high.</li>
            <li>The roll up plastic case is also very durable and a shiny pink and its not cloth so the brushes aren&#x27;t going to fall out easily.</li>
            <li>Brushes are super soft, but they don&#x27;t hold the makeup as well as a natural fiber.</li>
            <li>The brushes were all good quality and all different usually brushes in a large amount as this is often filled with a lot of the same brushes</li>
            <li>The only thing is the pink turns into all different colors with makeup lol</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind that so much, what I do mind is how soft these brushes are!</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t fully used these brushes yet, but they are so pretty, and the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li>Bought this set for my daughter for Christmas as it was a full size pouch with all of the necessary brushes.  </li>
            <li>They are supper soft and you get exactly what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so pretty and soft.</li>
            <li>these brushes are amazingly soft and pretty i havent used them yet because</li>
            <li>These are for my own personal use and I would not know if they are of such quality to stand up to professional use.</li>
            <li>They are cute and pink !!</li>
            <li>The powder brushes are soo soft and fluffy; the eye shadow and concealer brushes are stiff (which they should be) and perfect for application!!</li>
            <li>they did have a bit of a paint smell but its something I can live with!</li>
            <li>They work well, yes, however, the tops come off easily, and its hard to make them look clean.</li>
            <li>I love this color so I already love it when I first opened it, has a slight weird smell but honestly, just open up the pouch and let it air for a while</li>
            <li>Ignoring the smell, I decided to use my new brushes to get ready to go out for the night.</li>
            <li>its only cause they are new and we have to clean them before we use them</li>
            <li>When I was considering buying theses brushes, I wasn&#x27;t sure because some reviews were good and some were bad.</li>
            <li>They bend too easily to pick up harder pigments.</li>
            <li>Overall, love the case and the brushes should last me a while</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make these better would be if the handles had labels on them such as fan, crease, etc.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes are really similar, but in different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many of the brush were the same or similar</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what I was mainly looking for in this</li>
            <li>Seriously do not buy them.</li>
            <li>I ONLY gave 3 stars because this item was delivered so quick.</li>
            <li>mainly the eye brushes but</li>
            <li>Great deal, a million brushes, no more blush where your bronzer should be going because you are too lazy to wash the brush, you don&#x27;t have to wash that ONE eye shadow brush every time you change colors anymore, pink&#x27;s cute, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>and i am glad i went with this one instead of the more expensive style.</li>
            <li>pretty much fell apart, I barely touched it and</li>
            <li>luckily I glued them back together</li>
            <li>My older sister was in need of some makeup brushes</li>
            <li>, that was the main reason I wanted them.</li>
            <li>I do my makeup everyday and these brushes are such good quality.</li>
            <li>most of the brushes are the same but different sized.</li>
            <li>the was the main reason i got them, however when i did get them and started trying to use them</li>
            <li>I am actually considering buying a second one, just to have more brushes for bridal parties, etc.</li>
            <li>They are decent material and work well with makeup.</li>
            <li>The pink bag has a strong plastic odor to it after unrolling, but after you air it out</li>
            <li>the feel is very soft on the skin and they apply cream products very well.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and work very well for inexpensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I contact the seller for a replacement, but you have yet to hear anything back from them as far as a replacement, but other than that they&#x27;re pretty nice brushes.</li>
            <li>it took a long time for them to arrive but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes for synthetic!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too, came 3 weeks early!</li>
            <li>These are a great buy, for such a small value!</li>
            <li>Very soft !</li>
            <li>They do shed when first used, but after the first few times, they have stopped and are still full and useable.  </li>
            <li>I immediately compared my old brushes to this and just laughed at how small my old brushes were compared to these .</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for these</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to any one.</li>
            <li>brushes are high quality.</li>
            <li>I have a mixture of drug store and high end brushes...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you will need to supplement a few other brushes to be really happy with your makeup application.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the brush set when I first got it even though there were pretty bad reviews, but once I started using it, I disliked it more and more.</li>
            <li>Only a mild new plastic smell.  </li>
            <li>ok so the brushes do smell a little like plastic, but that does not matter.</li>
            <li>Soon as I took them out of the packaging they smelled a little better.</li>
            <li>There are so many of them and some so little difference in size that I don&#x27;t know what is for what</li>
            <li>are a little better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are SO soft and the bristles dont fall out at all!!</li>
            <li>Very cute, pretty pink brushes, but does not apply makeup well due to the fact that they are way too soft.</li>
            <li>Just little smell like petroleum or something I think it is normal :)</li>
            <li>love the pink, and im no pink lover!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d spend a little more and get a real professional set if I could do it all over again.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some kind of glue or tape on the brushes that make them hard and unusable.</li>
            <li>The brushes shed A LOT (as in, I was worried ALL of the bristles were going to fall out), and the other reviewers were correct that there is a really strong odor.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really hold high hopes when first purchasing this brush set because of the really low price.</li>
            <li>Despite the bad experiences some people had with these brushes, I found them to be awesome.</li>
            <li>thing I didnt realize is now cheap the pink bag looks.</li>
            <li>and they are so soft and high quality!</li>
            <li>I was shocked at how great they were for the price!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and they work very well.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Great for a five minute, everyday make-up and for those of us learning to do more complicated applications.</li>
            <li>they are so soft i havent gotten a chance to try them but seems like they will work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their soft and apply the makeup very well.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and put on make up very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my 15 year old, up and coming makeup artist, and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>the brushes are too soft and do not hold the powder very well.</li>
            <li>The only con that I found on these brushes was that they smelt like fresh paint when I got them.</li>
            <li>, THE QUALITY IS PRETTY GOOD, IT JUST HAS A WEIRD SMELL, BUT</li>
            <li>I have 6 different brush sets and I recommend first picking up the Real Techniques Core Collection for face brushes and</li>
            <li>This came with a ton of different brushes, so for the money it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Out all of them only 3 are useful.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are pretty much all the same and none of them work for blending or contouring the lid.</li>
            <li>…I actually thought it smelled fresh</li>
            <li>(I posted a few photographs in the gallery, so you have a better look before</li>
            <li>They are all laid out flat right before your very eyes, then you roll it right back up...</li>
            <li>I fixed a couple with a little super glue and still use them, but i&#x27;ll be investing in better brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>I only have about half of them that I was able to save with some hot glue.</li>
            <li>other then that they work fine..</li>
            <li>2 of my fan brushes got folded over when it was wrapped up but all of my other brushes are fine.</li>
            <li>but i was just figuring it was because it was freshly unwrapped since that does occasionally happen with a new set.</li>
            <li>Super soft brushed .</li>
            <li>The case or pink bag is soft and cleans up easy when traveling.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft &amp; so far I have not noticed much shedding.</li>
            <li>Also 2 did arrive broken, but for the price they&#x27;re really good brushes and are very very soft.</li>
            <li>For the price it was an ok set, and I&#x27;ll probably continue buying different types of cheaper brushes, because I refuse to spend $30 on a single brush.  </li>
            <li>The face brushes are very soft and I love them, the eye makeup brushes are stiff cannot blend with them</li>
            <li>They come in a cute pink carrying case which makes them so much easier to carry along with you, didn&#x27;t take long to be shipped</li>
            <li>Spraying a little Fix+ works very well with these brushes to make a precise application of color.</li>
            <li>Spraying a little Fix+ works very well with these brushes to make a precise application of color.</li>
            <li>The brushes are extremely flimsy and are so cheap.</li>
            <li>Pretty good brushes, they are soft, washing them got rid of any weird smells.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the case is easy to clean if it becomes dirty and the brushes are true to size based on the photos.</li>
            <li>The brushed were really soft and the color was really pretty!</li>
            <li>, theres only a couple brushes i actually use out of this kit, and for the price its not bad if u really use them</li>
            <li>Within a week of using these brushes, I felt regretful of my new buy.</li>
            <li>I shouldnt need to use glue on my new brushes.</li>
            <li>She lives in Michigan, I live in NJ.  </li>
            <li>It smelled like a new brush roll for a bit, then it faded.</li>
            <li>Just like a new car smell fades over time.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>I would have thought these brushes would have fallen apart by now, but they still look fairly new.</li>
            <li>They just smelled like new brushes.</li>
            <li>No I have to order new brushes from someone else</li>
            <li>I live in arizona.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The larger brushes are soft enough for gentle placement and blending, and the smaller ones are stiff enough to work perfectly for eyebrow filling and eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Brushes have a slight smell but other than that its super cute luv</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was a manufacturing mistake or not, but it&#x27;s kind of ridiculous.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice, especially if you tend to be heavy handed.</li>
            <li>brushes are ONLY cute because they are PINK.</li>
            <li>The brushes are cute with the color pink and white.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and fluffy they are.</li>
            <li>Went out on a limb to try cheap low end brushes...and that&#x27;s what I got..cheap, low end brushes.  </li>
            <li>They all have soft bristles and so far I haven&#x27;t had much shedding.</li>
            <li>I love the pink &amp; white colors.</li>
            <li>I would compare it to the overwhelming smell of fresh paint but worse.</li>
            <li>however is that they smell strongly of chemicals and it worries me slightly to think they might be getting on my face.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and it included everything you need for daily and heavy makeup....very handy.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>These cosmetic makeup brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>They bristles are very very soft.  </li>
            <li>As for the brush they&#x27;re SOOOO soft and seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li>but I did take a couple out and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by these brushes.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and do not shed</li>
            <li>These brushes are very professional</li>

            <li>The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>So for all of you, who are very sensitive to smell, then just be cautious about this one because it may be bothersome or a nuisance.</li>
            <li>very soft bristles and the brushes are packed meaning they put a lot of bristles per brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s pretty much every single brush I could ever want in here</li>
            <li>I usually do not mind that smell.</li>
            <li>I like these brushes so far!</li>
            <li>The big blush/ powder brush broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Come in tons of different brushes but some of it fall of after first use</li>
            <li>When I open it the first thing I notice</li>
            <li>Brushes are cheap, and certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li>and soooooo soft!</li>
            <li>the face brushes are too soft and flimsy!</li>
            <li>The brushes are incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>The only think I did not like is that when it first arrived, I tried to wash them and two of them came apart, but that&#x27;s just b/c</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also extremely soft!</li>
            <li>So I hot glued them back on</li>
            <li>they are so soft and do not shed at all!</li>
            <li>But I love all the small ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re soo soft!</li>
            <li>And hair doesnt fall down which i think is really important.</li>
            <li>Pretty pink, large assortment.</li>
            <li>They clean up as well as any other makeup brushes after they&#x27;ve been used a bit and need washed to remove product build-up in the bristles.</li>
            <li>They handle all of the different product types very well, and you get 22 brushes for the price you pay for one brush from a high end brand.  </li>
            <li>There are like ten different eye shadow brushes, two fan brushes, a concealer brush, two powder brushes, one brush with a very flat top, about two lip brushes, one smudge brush, mascara brush, and one eye brow comb.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and soft but most of them are tiny, i find it difficult to find the proper blending brush out of all 22 of these.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t go past the gorgeous baby pink.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft, clean, and I detected no odd odor as I have read in other reviews.</li>
            <li>They serve their purpose well, and I can&#x27;t believe I found such great brushes for such a low price, compared to other big name brands.</li>
            <li>these brushes are very pretty but the quality is not what i expected...</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about these brushes but with all the good reviews i couldn&#x27;t help myself!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the pink bag did smell really strong like acetone or something.</li>
            <li>large powder brush and the smaller blush/powder brush work well for the application of those products.</li>
            <li>The case feels a little cheap</li>
            <li>I love pink, these are pink, they are soft and very professional.</li>
            <li>They were soft and worked good, I ordered one for myself, but the bristles on mine were a little uneven, I still use them.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a nice set, with tons of different types and shapes of brushes, but I don&#x27;t hardly use any of them.</li>
            <li>I love the color pink and to come on Amazon and find me some makeup brushes and they are pink</li>
            <li>Packaged in the light pink case and individually wrapped with platic over the bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I may actually return this product, because they brushes seem to be TOO soft and dont work very well because of it.</li>
            <li>Someone in the comments said they&#x27;re brush handles where plastic, mine was wooden with cheap pink paint coming off of the handles.</li>
            <li>They larger brushes are extremely soft and work very well.  </li>
            <li>Now I said I dont loke pink but with these brushes I now love pink.</li>
            <li>then i thought, couldn&#x27;t get a clear pic because of the length</li>
            <li>They dont hold any makeup, there too soft to use.</li>
            <li>They are so soft.</li>
            <li>So far they have held up and have not shed any bristles.</li>
            <li>I aired it out for a day/overnight</li>
            <li>And she has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The so called professional cosmetic brushes dont work the bristles are to soft and fall out.</li>
            <li>The blush &amp; countoring brush are so soft you can&#x27;t pick up any product.</li>
            <li>Brushes are so soft but it smells like paint.</li>
            <li>I put them in my bathroom cupboard and the next morning the whole cabinet smelled like Plastic.</li>
            <li>Brush is too soft for powder or creams products.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft, but the hairs continuously fall out while I&#x27;m using the brush, getting all over my face.</li>
            <li>They bristles are not fluffy at all.</li>
            <li>And personally, I don&#x27;t think that the brushes picks up the eye shadow very well.</li>
            <li>The metal ferrule, which leads to the bristle, completely detached from the handle of the brush.</li>
            <li>I would stay sturdy for at home use......not for professional use.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>In trying to get ready for work every day I can&#x27;t stop to glue a brush back on.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really soft.</li>
            <li>Soft brushes.</li>
            <li>I have brushes from sephora and nyc brushes and they are just as soft as them if not softer than those.</li>
            <li>The case definitely has some sort of scent to it, but I don&#x27;t really mind it since I&#x27;ll just let it air out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and picks up product well.</li>
            <li>I am definelty a EcoTools girl and I would say these are just as soft as my old brushes.</li>
            <li>The hair on the brushes are sooo soft and work wonders .</li>
            <li>These will go to my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li>I had it sent directly to her, so</li>
            <li>Brushes are too soft</li>
            <li>And they are so soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased them a year ago and only use about 3 brushes out of the whole set.</li>
            <li>So soft</li>
            <li>got these for my teenage daughter, as i didnt want to invest too much on something for her</li>
            <li>but 6are duplcations really thyy are all the same.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who is trying to achieve that professional look.</li>
            <li>When I ordered it, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much on the quality side because of the low price I had to pay.</li>
            <li>am giving you this review from the perspective of a professional makeup</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t fantastic with picking up or packing shadows, and this set doesn&#x27;t come with any type of fluffy blending brush.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are SO soft and I got all of the 22 brushes.</li>
            <li>Also the brushes are really soft and I have not had a problem with the bristles falling out.</li>
            <li>Soft and well made.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li>The brush was glued to the body but not firmly so the brush keeps sliding off the handle.</li>
            <li>but they store so neatly in the case it comes in, which is really soft as well.</li>
            <li>soft brittles</li>
            <li>I am a frequent user of all colors of eye shadows and this allows me the freedom to use them all without going HMMMMMMM which brush..</li>
            <li>the brissles are soft and dont shed.</li>
            <li>and theyre soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and pick up makeup so well.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>soft.</li>
            <li>Looking for a brush set that has a professional feel this is it.  </li>
            <li>the brushes were really soft but because they&#x27;re synthetic</li>
            <li>I was surprised when it got here.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely soft which doesnt allow the product to stay on the brush.</li>
            <li>I used them twice so far, and will say, they would be an alright set for beginners.</li>
            <li>but they get soft after a while of using.</li>
            <li>I order this for my 20 year old bestfriend/roommate for christmas</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes as a gift for my 18 year old niece&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>but after a wash in some baby shampoo they were smelling ggod and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Out of this whole 22 pc set I can only seem to use 3 of them.</li>
            <li>These brushes were too soft and didn&#x27;t pick up any make up.</li>
            <li>Soft and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li>By the way, it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>She is 20 years old and always watches those makeup tutorials saying things like she wish she could do what they are doing in the video.</li>
            <li>The hair in the brushes don&#x27;t fall out, stay soft &amp;</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and hold whatever makeup you&#x27;re using well.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>they are so dense and soft</li>
            <li>Yes, the brushes were soft - but it collects no makeup so it doesn&#x27;t even serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>They are amazingly soft and a brush for everything.</li>
            <li>The brushes were way too soft.</li>
            <li>I guess if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and you like soft bristles</li>
            <li>One of the brushes was already broke when it arrived in the mail but was easily fixed.</li>
            <li>I like the color and the brushes are soft but some are too soft.</li>
            <li>all the brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>but so far i like them.</li>
            <li>the brushes are too soft that it doesn&#x27;t pick up the pigment of your make up products.</li>
            <li>your are looking for soft brushes this is def.</li>
            <li>I ran my fingers through each brush and they are all amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>All the brushes are soft and the handles are sturdy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also really soft.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li>and they are by far the softest brushes i&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>they are sooooo soft and do not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>These brushes are durable and soft so they will not irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I thought WOW...</li>
            <li>shipped from far</li>
            <li>the brushes are SO SOFT but not too flimsy.</li>
            <li>There was a bit of a plasticky smell when I opened them, but it went away fast enough.</li>
            <li>and there so soft</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t really use it though because I will be transferring ALL of my brushes to a brush belt, or if space is allowed, a rolled out white towel.</li>
            <li>and some are too soft others</li>
            <li>I do use a few of these brushes regularly, however, most of them have been thrown away.  </li>
            <li>the only thing is that it doesnt have a round eyeshadow brush but for the money you save from buying these you can buy one from somewhere else :)</li>
            <li>but you will probably need to pick up a few better eyeshadow brushes, especially for blending, as there is nothing in here that works for that.</li>
            <li>However, for the small price I believe the set is worth it if you&#x27;re interested in temporary brushes.</li>
            <li>looks expensive but the price is fair.</li>
            <li>Not wonderful , the powder brushes are too soft for foundation but good for blending and blush .</li>
            <li>They were good brushes but a few were missing in the pack</li>
            <li>they also font look like expensive brushes but the price is a good for them .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are a little hard to clean, but most makeup brushes I&#x27;ve had are.</li>
            <li>The small brushes are nice and stiff, and the large ones are very soft.</li>
            <li>but I ordered mine in the hot month of July where I live so since they were rollers in a pink bag thingy, the brushes sorta got rolled too.</li>
            <li>there are a few brushes that i will use a lot in this set, but some of them are too stiff for good eye makeup blending.</li>
            <li>Have had for about 3 months use them everyday and for the price very worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been using these brushes for about 2 months now, and they have been very very usefull , I am using these for my every single day makeup</li>
            <li>The brushes are incredibly soft but hard to maintain for me because it really grabs the pigment and you will have to constantly clean it in between uses.</li>
            <li>You dont even notice the smell unless you put your face right up to the pink bag and try to smell it.</li>
            <li>As far as performance, the brushes are decent, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Some of my brushes broke right after I unpacked them, but I only needed a few new brushes, it&#x27;s not alright to waste your money on broken brushes, but if you want to these will be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Most brushes are made for the average consumer, therefore, the handles are short because they are for personal use.</li>
            <li>I use them almost daily and they are still like new!</li>
            <li>The case does have an odd new plastic smell, but u can&#x27;t smell it until u put ur face right up to it.</li>
            <li>Package came in good condition, the fan brush was the only brush that was a little bent, a little water and some diligent drying fixed that in a jiffy though.</li>
            <li>And surely enough people where not kidding I slightly passed my hand threw the fan brush and sure enough the hairs started falling out!...</li>
            <li>but they actually are pretty big.</li>
            <li>Got these when I first started the only thing I don&#x27;t care for the smaller brushes</li>
            <li>Decent enough quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Had a lot of brushes that did the same thing and were exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised on how soft &amp; professional these brushes actually are!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are awesome brushes especially for the price, but for me they are just a little too soft.</li>
            <li>These pink makeup brushes are very high quality, don&#x27;t shed, and apply makeup as evenly as posssible!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushed.</li>
            <li>would HIGHLY recommend not using this company for any of your purchases, especially around the holidays.</li>
            <li>Most are just similar to eachother and a little too big to be eyeshaow brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes shed like no other!</li>
            <li>Another thing is that the brushes are just way too soft and barely hold the color on them to put anything on your lids.</li>
            <li>I rally wouldn&#x27;t recommend theses brushes to anyone, I could find better brushes at a pharmacy, so that&#x27;s a no good for me,</li>
            <li>As long as you look after and shampoo your brushes, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>it came before expected and was exactly as described</li>
            <li>I was expecting more blending brushes for the eyes but all of the small brushes are flat and not usable for blending.</li>
            <li>Pink is pretty.</li>
            <li>I first ordered them just because i was curious</li>
            <li>nothing a little super glue and 30 seconds can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously not one rounded or fluffy eyeshadow brush in the whole bunch!</li>
            <li>and I will likely get a new one.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend these brushes to anyone who loves makeup or just needs new brushes.</li>
            <li>Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well.</li>
            <li>Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not pleasant but not disgusting.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, the only complaint i have is that they should include a guide of what each brush is and what they are used for.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough for all over application but not so soft that they&#x27;re flimsy.</li>
            <li>The brissles are soft and I see myself ordering another set in the near future.</li>
            <li>I do love how soft they are, and they don&#x27;t leave behind any parts of the brush on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product looks nothing like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice and soft, but I&#x27;ve been to angry to use them, plus I still want the purple ones, not the brown I recieved.</li>
            <li>, people were conplaining about a strong smell wich mine dont have , the little pink case looks like its made out of a durable material and is pretty, overall i think not only for the price of it</li>
            <li>The only thing that I dislike about these brushes are that they are VERY SOFT</li>
            <li>they are very soft but about a month later one by one the glue gave out and they fell apart. ) :</li>
            <li>the only problem is the packaging has a very loud plastic smell.</li>
            <li>Big, fluffy, and super soft!</li>
            <li>i would really recommend trying them i use them every single they</li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed is that some of the smaller brushes are almost exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I just bought it for the brushes, so I will probably toss or donate the bag, but if the bag is a major factor in your purchase decision, I would thing twice about getting</li>
            <li>You get several different brushes for a low price and each brush is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>it comes with a pretty pink case and has 22 brushes in it!</li>
            <li>Only downside is the packaging smells like paint when you first get it, but I left them open in my room for a bit and the smell went away.</li>
            <li>a major germs phobic</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t really pick up loose powder at all.</li>
            <li>I Rubbed Coconut Oil Into The Case And Wiped It Down With A Slightly Damp Cloth, That Took Away Most Of The Smell</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who is interested in adding a few more brushes into their collection, instead of going out and buying more expensive ones every few decades.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave this a rating of 2 stars is because the eye shadow brushes are too flat, they do not collect my naked pallet eye shadows even though it is really pigmented.</li>
            <li>The only real complaint is that the glue smell was rather strong when they first arrived.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are super soft, but stiff enough for application.</li>
            <li>The brushes are cheap quality and hardly blend any make up .</li>
            <li>I guess they would be good for someone that uses really subtle makeup, because to apply makeup, specially if you like heavy makeup, you have to apply quite a few times to actually do it to your liking.</li>
            <li>its true that they pick up very little makeup</li>
            <li>makeup beginners are anyone in general</li>
            <li>I put it as an okay for these brushes but not good enough.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft but doesn&#x27;t blend, the handles are way too long to be practical, and the brushes fall apart from the handle as soon as you touch it--22 brushes and so far I haven&#x27;t found one</li>
            <li>ANYONE IN Who&#x27;s INTERESTED IN THESE  BRUSHES SHOULD GET THEM AT CRAZY CART STOREFRONT: )</li>
            <li>bu save your money and just buy 3 or 4 basic professional brushes.</li>
            <li>My only problem is when I went to take one out the package it feel completely apart.</li>
            <li>face brushes barely hold powder.</li>
            <li>The larger powder brushes also have a considerable amount of shedding.</li>
            <li>My bare mineral powder doesn&#x27;t adhere to brush as well as I would like it to</li>
            <li>Firstly....it was shipped much faster than expected....</li>
            <li>The face brushes are extremely soft and hold enough face powder for my liking.</li>
            <li>yep it barely picks up the makeup.</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes are really gentle on the face and the other ones are a bit stiffer but still soft!</li>
            <li>I just aired it outside for a couple of days and the smell kinda faded.</li>
            <li>Why do I need four giant powder brushes that are nearly identical?</li>
            <li>came much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>I barely use them.</li>
            <li>To compare I have bare mineral brushes and have had them for 3 years.</li>
            <li>The sticks are sturdy, so they&#x27;re not liable to break.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I use to use the Bare Minerals brushes but my puppy got ahold of them and destroyed them.</li>
            <li>on yes some are too soft but even for those u can find use especially for blush</li>
            <li>These, however, spray makeup all over like a sprinkler if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>When I first received my brushes, the pink brush bag spelled like plastic (not necessarily an unbearable smell, but I didn&#x27;t like it).</li>
            <li>The bag had kind of a weird smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sending the kit to my daughter, because she knows a little more on the subject.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the pink bag smells like a new shower curtain when you first open the package, so unroll it and let it air out outside for an hour or two.</li>
            <li>there super cute and not so bad for $20 i just hate the brush holder but there pretty good i guess</li>
            <li>Pretty in Pink!!</li>
            <li>Pretty pink just not for me!!</li>
            <li>ONCE , I have already washed them and not a single strand of hair has came out !</li>
            <li>I will NOT be needing to buy any new brushes for a long time</li>
            <li>they have an odd smell at first...</li>
            <li>that b/c one look thru Amazon we were ordering exactly what she wanted for way less than she had seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li>The handles are pretty big in comparison to my other brushes in terms of the diameter of the handle.</li>
            <li>If its for a young teen that isn&#x27;t very serious about the look or precision, it would be okay.  </li>
            <li>Its smell a little but its not that strong as seen in other comments.</li>
            <li>Some of the bristles were sticking out or too long which would not be a good thing for those serious about applying make-up but for me, I just pulled the strays out or cut them down.</li>
            <li>Okay eyeshadow brushes for beginners, but the face brushes are just awful, don&#x27;t waste your money on this like most of the brushes that are really cheap on amazon.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very pretty and very soft, however, they smell like paint, the bristles are not trimmed evenly, and the pink paint on one of the brush have a finger printed like someone touched it before the paint was even dried up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to clean the brushes ..</li>
            <li>I wash these brushes every other week and they&#x27;ve been holding up very well.</li>
            <li>Due to the price you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>I really like the color of the white &amp; pink bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristles will hold the color you&#x27;re using (though I only rinsed them with water, this may be different with a professional cleaner)--so basically they stain, but</li>
            <li>This set will basically be my crap set, my mac ones will be saved for more important uses.</li>
            <li>The pink case doesn&#x27;t hold the brushes particularly well, but the flap helps with that.</li>
            <li>the pink color is not that vibrant</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive it based on all of the good reviews, but am very disappointed.</li>
            <li>Basically, they&#x27;re all the right amount of soft or hard for what they&#x27;re meant to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell was a little funky too when it first shipped...</li>
            <li>I slot near the larger brushes was empty and the first slt was empty</li>
            <li>enough- no good balance but for everyday simple makeup needs you are good to go.</li>
            <li>The pouch you get with the brushes is nice, the only complaint I have about it is that it smells a little plasticy.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, they&#x27;re kinda hard to clean.</li>
            <li>They are big and soft and do just what I expect them to do.&lt;br /&gt;However, some of the smaller brushes are basically the same</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and the handles are long and sturdy.</li>
            <li>they could be used for something but not professionally I think they&#x27;re soft but feel plastic ish</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I appreciate how long the handles are.</li>
            <li>they looked to be really good quality,plus they aren&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li>my only disappointment is it could of had certain brushed that would of made the set better</li>
            <li>and i love the little pink bag they came in with!!!!</li>
            <li>The only thing wrong is that they have a very strong plastic smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box</li>
            <li>Also the brushes do shed a little but only while you first wash them and pull at them.</li>
            <li>It is true that there is a slight smell, almost like a spray paint smell, but the smell is only on the pink bag that comes with the brushes.</li>
            <li>The large fan brush works well for dusting off excess powders and moderately well for blending out powder blushes/contour along with applying highlight down the nose and on the cheeks.</li>
            <li>The price was amazing and the product was shipped very quickly, however, I was very disappointed once I opened the package.</li>
            <li>They dry fast dont shed or loose there</li>
            <li>Package does have slight smell but very un noticable.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them long enough to see how well they hold up, but I like them so far.</li>
            <li>if you buy them you won&#x27;t be disappointed that&#x27;s for sure!!</li>
            <li>One of the brushes I use on a daily basis, the handle has become loose, but with a push back in, it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been airing out the brushes and once I wash them, I&#x27;m certain that little &#x27;smell&#x27; will go away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal due to use or not.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a large fluffy blending eyeshadow brush, but it seems all the eyeshadow brushes are pretty stiff ):</li>
            <li>&amp;&amp; i love pink!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t irritate the face; I&#x27;ve used them with a variety of products: pressed shadows and blushes, loose powders, cream shadows, eye primers, foundation, etc.  </li>
            <li>Not a new one, but a really gross, old smell.</li>
            <li>One thing I did not like is that a few jars on the brushes are stray and not perfectly straight, this will not affect make-up application but can be less appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft but every single one of the brushes came apart!</li>
            <li>The one thing I would change about this set is I would include a few &#x27;sponge applicators&#x27; for eye shadow and make the handles a little bit shorter so that one or two would fit in my cosmetic bag in my purse.  </li>
            <li>and i was afraid because of the reviews, to many ppl complaining about the smell, and blah blah, ofc if you are a professional make up artist</li>

            <li> if you really love makeup and doing a great job, these are not for you.</li>
            <li> None of the brushes are great for applying eyeshadow or blending, they are more the type for applying cream eyeshadow or highlight.</li>

            <li> Have some superglue handy though, the brushes fall out of the handles.</li>

            <li> The color is nice, the brush slots do their job, &amp; I didn&#x27;t have any problem with a smell as others have said.</li>
            <li> But, the rest of the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish it came with labels</li>
            <li> Now i am not a make up kind of girl</li>
            <li> Every kind of brush is in this set.  </li>

            <li> She wanted to have some nice cosmetic brushes.  </li>
            <li> Made kind of flimsley.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like glue of some kind... but</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t brush on nicely</li>
            <li> I do recommend the E.L.F studio brushes if you don&#x27;t want to spend much money on brushes. :D</li>
            <li> It went away however, after I washed them with warm water and baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> they were really nice until&lt;</li>
            <li> Some of my friends even want to get their own sets of these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the brushes at first.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve cleaned really nicely for me with some baby shampoo and warm water.  </li>
            <li> My daugther purchased this with her own money.  </li>
            <li> They Are Really Nice Brushes.</li>

            <li> Great quality, brushes are really soft and the product is great for traveling</li>
            <li> I knew it would be a stretch to get good brushes for so cheap, but i think people need to be honest about these brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are good for beginners, but most of them would probably serve better as painting brushes.  </li>
            <li> The handles are not attached very strongly either.  </li>
            <li> Does have a very strong odor of paint (the makeup bag) .</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s very easy to fix</li>
            <li> I love that I got so many makeup brushes so inexpensively!</li>

            <li> so if your looking to purshase these brushes i say go for it there nice soft,cute brushes but just be warned there may be some problems with them because the brushes are so cheap!</li>
            <li> I think these would be good for applying a light dusting of shimmer highlight to your cheekbones.</li>
            <li> and I was able to improvise and get a nice application of makeup.</li>
            <li> and I was able to improvise and get a nice application of makeup.</li>

            <li> Let me tell you, ladies and gents, these brushes are soooooo soft and dense, it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li> lol you get your moneys worth on this.</li>
            <li> but they are sure as heck amazing for 50 cents a brush.</li>
            <li> Cute color, amazing quality.</li>
            <li> i honestly wish i had saved my money and investing in a better brand of make up brushes.</li>

            <li> I cant fix and the smell of paint was strong but whatever!</li>

            <li> Great brushes easy to clean</li>
            <li> great set of pieces and amazing service, it really was what i wanted and need for myself.</li>
            <li> I was heading towards getting the $150 sigma set but honestly, this was a better deal &amp; you get so many brushes</li>
            <li> and they contain more than what i need super good &amp; nice</li>
            <li> i think they r great blend shadows well easy to clean</li>
            <li> The synthetic fibers are better for make up artist because it is very easy to wash without shedding.</li>
            <li> I was kinda happy with them at first</li>
            <li> First I want to add that I have never done a review before in my life about any product , but I decided I woukd do one on these brushes because they are that great.</li>
            <li> The brushes were great and SOOO SOFT!!!!</li>
            <li> said and soaked them in shampoo and now they smell just fine!</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re fine!</li>
            <li> and they smelled just fine!</li>
            <li> Super girly!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very secure in the tote.  </li>
            <li> case looks very cheap</li>
            <li> Just the plastic looks very cheap........</li>
            <li> anything better, they were soft &amp;i love the way it works with my favorite make-up!!!</li>
            <li> if the top pops on any of your brushes just use some good glue and it will fix it right up!</li>
            <li> These brushes are sooo soft and work so amazing!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if your want your face looking good too!</li>
            <li> I also loved how quickly I received the item.</li>
            <li> The smell was a strong acetone kind of smell or maybe even acrylic.</li>
            <li> The big buffer brushes and the foundation brushes are beautiful and soft and very good but the one for the eyes aren&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> But, they are great and easy to bring with, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> will probably give them to my little sister to play with because they won&#x27;t do me any good, but again a great buy for beginners!</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and because many people wrote about the bag smelling I immediately took it out of the package to air it out before giving this to my sister for her birthday.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell as badly as many people made it seem</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x27;T WAIT FOR THEM :3</li>

            <li> Brushes are shipped fast and are packaged great.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes for eye shadow,blush,bronzer, eye liner, my brows, I just love this product no doubts about it</li>

            <li> It was an okay purchase for me, but that was just preference.</li>
            <li> There were too many brushes for me to handle.</li>

            <li> I gifted this set, have had no complaints or remarks.</li>
            <li> i love them</li>
            <li> but im glad i kept them.</li>
            <li> I was in love it did have a plastic smell to it.</li>
            <li> everything:)</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect from this brush set.</li>
            <li> foundation brush is okay for putting the product on the face.</li>
            <li> Much more well suited for mineral make up.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve gotten five stars if I were able to use them on my pressed powder makeup</li>
            <li> and I love makeup I ordered them</li>
            <li> I Love the brushes they do not fall out</li>

            <li> I love them regardless.</li>
            <li> They are overall great brushes for being knock offs!</li>
            <li> I immediately check to see if the hair would fall out since I saw many reviews about the hair falling out...</li>
            <li> I believe 2 stars were appropriate because one there were a lot of brushes and</li>
            <li> Absoultly love.</li>
            <li> But the smell faded and I love them.</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes.</li>

            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what people say I love these brushes even tho</li>
            <li> The hardness keeps you from being able to pick up the powder</li>
            <li> Yes its a good price, but you will not get your money worth.</li>
            <li> they are cute, just dont get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these</li>

            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t really sure</li>
            <li> It was a perfect gift for her, the brushes are soft and the pink bag was the perfect match for the set.  </li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift for my younger sister.</li>
            <li> and she is in love.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t re-order it even if the powder brushes broke, but would recommend it to starters even though there are even better brush sets for starters.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and have purchased many many brushes.</li>
            <li> You will love these.</li>

            <li> &amp; I dont even use all of them since there is so many.</li>

            <li> it is easy to keep the brushes organized.  </li>
            <li> The case makes them easy to keep together and to store.</li>
            <li> they are really soft but not too much just perfect.</li>
            <li> What an exciting, action-packed set of awesome cosmetic brushes for my teen daughter to color herself with.</li>
            <li> It took them awhile to get here, and when I opened them i did notice the fairly strong chemical type smell a lot of people had mentioned smelling.</li>
            <li> and they are strong but</li>
            <li> BUT NOTHING TO STRONG</li>
            <li> I picked out this set based on the great price, the number of brushes, and the nice roll-up pink case.</li>
            <li> they are cute and soft but have a good grip.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Mine are not that strong smelling</li>
            <li> I did not notice a strong smell that others are commenting on, but I also didn&#x27;t buy them for the case and do not store them in the case (which seems to be the source of everyone&#x27;s complaints).  </li>
            <li> Has a strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> Not the case with these brushes, GREAT length, great size overall, and very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> the price you pay, these are GREAT products, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re GREAT brushes.</li>
            <li> Them brushes are super soft and them bag is beautiful.</li>
            <li> AMAZING QUALITY BRUSH AND REALLY PRETTY.</li>
            <li> :) i am thrilled to of found such a amazing product.</li>
            <li> I believe for the price that these are amazing brushes for someone interested in make up and is just beginning.</li>
            <li> The brushes in general are great.</li>
            <li> Brushes are true to picture love the quality of the brushes .</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t fallen apart or anything like that, pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t even used them at all, but they look exactly like they do in the picture.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty nice set.  </li>
            <li> but when you wash ur brushes their good as new</li>
            <li> and it was just fine.</li>
            <li> U can tell the brushes are cheap because the bristles come out easily.  </li>
            <li> They still work fine</li>
            <li> But air it out and youll be fine.</li>
            <li> But they work fine for a beginner who&#x27;s learning..</li>
            <li> it is fine now.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and the glue wears of easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> it is fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> product may be fine, but, this company has no clue as to how to resolve a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes work well when applying make-up and again are super cute.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very very soft and are good quality.</li>
            <li> They are good quality, a brush for every need and are very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an amazing value and definitely a great gift idea for someone looking to learn more about makeup application, experiment with different types of brushes, and any makeup diva who needs a new \\&quot;tool kit\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very much loved these so far, though!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love these brushes very pretty can&#x27;t wait to use them and write another review for them ..</li>
            <li> I loved it all the brushes were soft and made it easy to do my make-up</li>
            <li> they are super soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes are true to color, extremely soft and i love them!!</li>
            <li> arrived super fast, the product is great, soft brushes, nice quality, and the carrying case is super cute.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love my new brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a very pretty pink, and they are beautiful.!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super easy to use clean and store!</li>
            <li> The case and brushes look exactly as they do in the pictures, however, the case does have a very strong smell of paint.</li>
            <li> overall very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> simply heavenly I am very pleased with this product I cant think of anything to complain about!  </li>
            <li> I simply love them and will buy another set for my daughter for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;The roll-up pouch does smell of \\&quot;strong plastic\\&quot; but nothing I haven&#x27;t experienced with other products.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t really a huge deal for me</li>
            <li> Cleaning brushes between clients will eat into your time, not tremendously, but it&#x27;s best to have an abundance of clean brushes.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t really have any nice brushes for brow bone/highlight.</li>
            <li> your looking for great brushed for eyeshadow</li>
            <li> These are cute and useful.</li>
            <li> I actually got this product before I was suppose to, so I&#x27;m happy about that.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and fall apart.</li>
            <li> For a middle schooler - this may be a great product</li>
            <li> These brushes were alright, great deal for the price, but the eyebrow spoolie broke the second week I had it!</li>
            <li> It has all I need for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Will not buy again, product cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Powder and eyeshadow application smooth and picks up rather nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, they are great.</li>
            <li> IT WAS CHEAP</li>
            <li> I bought these for the price and color of the brushes, they do their job and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The smell was really light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to spending a lot of money on my makeup and brushes and doubt anything that is too cheap.</li>
            <li> for SO CHEAP.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made from a cheap material and you can tell.</li>
            <li> its not that great for people who wear daily makeup..</li>
            <li> These are great for anyone starting off with makeup.</li>
            <li> The company is fast and amazing.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> otherwise the brushed are great.</li>
            <li> the shipping was free because,It was ground and would take 14-25 days , which I could have choose a faster ship</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m cheap and didn&#x27;t mind the wait.</li>
            <li> These are SO cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I purchased these a few months ago and they work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> but I got it the very next day which was great.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made, but useable.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the brushes once, but the were great.</li>
            <li> They r easy to clean</li>
            <li> , they clean easily</li>
            <li> i would let her spend a &#x27;reasonable&#x27; amount of money on something she liked.....</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes were cheap material</li>
            <li> I also have a few MAC brushes but these are wonderful.</li>
            <li> for an everyday use they are awesome!</li>
            <li> Obviously they&#x27;re not going to be great quality</li>
            <li> For the price though I am happy with the face brushes and would expect to pay way more for individual ones so that alone is worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a makeup artist I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing these brushes as they are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are so cute and such a good value.</li>
            <li> They were soft which was good.</li>
            <li> i bought these as my old ones i lost and they are good-</li>
            <li> but overall they&#x27;re good brushes :)</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> the brushes are so soft and are good quality need to get them if you are in a budget</li>
            <li> The brushes were soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value for a set of brushes that are soft and work well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful deal since at the store you pay as much for smaller sets and cheaper quality.  </li>
            <li> and the brushes are so soft and so good to work with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are really nicely colored, and have a good aesthetic quality to them if you like loads of pink.</li>

            <li> , they are very useful in some instances.</li>
            <li> I spent hours searching reviews and a good set of brushes!</li>
            <li> I love them because they are very soft and easy to clean :)</li>
            <li> so come on girls, less complain, is a WONDERFUL price, they are so soft and nice</li>
            <li> It was pink and pretty and fits perfect in my purse</li>
            <li> Considering my professional makeup artist friend was interested in them after she did my makeup with them, I&#x27;m going to say I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> I just love and like them so much!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to try them out,</li>
            <li> So I was excited to get these brushes</li>
            <li> I love these so much!</li>
            <li> at first i said okay, no biggie...</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I first got them.</li>
            <li> totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This was well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a student of cosmetology and these have not disappointed me at all.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to use it when I go to school.</li>
            <li> I told her to give me a chance to look on Amazon first and if we didn&#x27;t find anything she was satisfied with</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to get here because it is shipped from China, but I think it was worth it for the bargain!</li>
            <li> i was so excited when they arrived.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ok for now.</li>
            <li> When I got these brushes in the mail I was so excited</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WORTH IT !&lt;</li>
            <li> The money was really worth it !</li>
            <li> i am never disappointed.</li>
            <li> They have been great for me as a beginner; I just would have preferred a little more of a guide.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are very firm and nice!!!</li>
            <li> Some brushes are better than others, but overall they&#x27;re nice.</li>
            <li> BUT if you clean the (which you should) and the brush case, they will not smell anymore.</li>
            <li> However if you don&#x27;t have enough money for really nice ones, then you will be satisfied with these.</li>
            <li> great simple and useful.</li>
            <li> but you can clean them and vua-la</li>
            <li> i see the clean finish</li>
            <li> so you will want to clean them and let them air out for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> to clean..</li>
            <li> time to clean if you don&#x27;t maintain it well like I do</li>
            <li> The bag is so pretty and shiny as well and just has an overall beautiful look to it.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and apply the make up so evenly and nicely definitely the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> Also, it looks really nice and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> exactly what they said in the description beautiful and soft exactly what i needed for my cousin to learn how to do her makeup</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, and the color is cute!</li>

            <li> OH WELL, VERY PRETTY IN COLOR NOT PROFESSIONAL THO, GREAT FOR TEENS</li>
            <li> But other than that, amazing amazing brushes.</li>
            <li> Also the eyebrow brush and comb are really baad quality but all the other brushes are great!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very soft and work amazing, i really love them and the price is very well.</li>
            <li> but when i had gone to take off the plastic of the large fan brush in the kit the top poped off</li>
            <li> I SPECIALLY  </li>
            <li> There are a large selection of brushes of many shapes and uses.  </li>
            <li> The brushes came right away!</li>
            <li> they are so soft and amazing</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> these soft brushes they are amazing...</li>
            <li> Not much fall out and great quality.</li>
            <li> and I got them and most of them are great, however the small fan like brush</li>
            <li> The brushes are great quality for the your 10 dollars I spent on them.</li>
            <li> the pink bag is great</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> i love the color and the work really well.</li>
            <li> Yes, the brushes do have a paint kind of smell, but there sooo soft &amp;&#x27;d so far I&#x27;m loving what I purchased</li>
            <li> the brush heads arent as full as i had hoped or as the picture apeared.</li>
            <li> This 22 piece set is adorable and very functional.</li>
            <li> For the most part I really like this set.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how soft they are and how easy it is to clean them</li>
            <li> The only good brush was the fan brush ....</li>
            <li> For the price I paid these brushes are really soft and nice.</li>
            <li> the larger brushes are good.</li>
            <li> YOU&#x27;LL LOVE THEM SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Would probably be some good paint brushed for my crafts.</li>
            <li> Very gift appropriate.</li>
            <li> It is also a good product to have for people who just like to collect different kinds of brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product though.</li>
            <li> They are very comparable to the Too Faced Teddy Bear brushes, but a much better price.</li>
            <li> I actually really like how the brushes look and fell for the most part...</li>
            <li> Really nice brush set, really soft.</li>
            <li> They are not as good as my Urban Decay or</li>
            <li> I do like the big brushes though, which is good</li>
            <li> shrug*.I love the bag that holds them, the number of brushes I received and how fast my package came .</li>
            <li> Very neat and adorable set of make up brushes.</li>
            <li> but I doubt they will last over a year but still good brushes for the price</li>
            <li> Overall good quality</li>
            <li> Had the sizes she wanted and a cool pouch with it.</li>
            <li> but the price was low and it still makes it a good value.  </li>
            <li> SO WORTH IT FOR SO CHEAP</li>
            <li> When I use my &#x27;ecotools&#x27; brushes, makeup NEVER ends up on the side of my face because the brush bristles are full.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use always in my handbag is cool</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my friend who wanted a full set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really cute set, and a lot of the brushes to work really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> my daughter loved her birthday present!</li>
            <li> and I love them so much.</li>
            <li> Which was not bad.</li>
            <li> not a bad purchase though.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t get the look your really going for there great for a in a hurry makeup or a touch up but not for a long that needs to last all day for work and special night out just not my top favorite!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no shedding just a strong smell when I first took it out of the box</li>
            <li> The pink is adorable and you just can&#x27;t beat how many brushes you get for the price!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft as can be, great for sensitive skin like mine!</li>
            <li> other than that these are great brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> but other then that great brushes</li>
            <li> Upon checking around other sites, this set of brushes are a great buy.  </li>
            <li> I thought the brushes were good, but they were flat, not rounded like I wanted.</li>
            <li> these are super soft, cute, and cheaply priced.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is worth buying, and would make a good addition to any brush collection.</li>
            <li> It wore off quickly though.  </li>
            <li> Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this because I most definitely needed it.</li>
            <li> I love the nice pink roll up holder.  </li>
            <li> Perfect if you are just starting to use make up and need to learn different uses for all kinds of brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes came really quick, in 3 days.</li>
            <li> Only the fan brush and the smaller brushes didn&#x27;t work out awesome.</li>
            <li> For one, I received this product quickly (with Prime) and it was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li> so I have to super glue them.</li>
            <li> Brushes are surprisingly SUPER</li>
            <li> They are soft to the touch and works great so far.</li>
            <li> &amp;&amp; last thing I wanted to point out is all the 5 star reviews looks all the same with the excellent grammar and alot of \\&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\&quot; after every sentence</li>
            <li> so I quickly opened it up.</li>
            <li> My brushes came quickly, way ahead of schedule, and did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> i got them quick</li>
            <li> They were here quickly and packaged for safety as there weren&#x27;t any problems with any of the brushes upon receipt.</li>
            <li> If you want to have many high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> This is the very first set of make up brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m barely learning how to use them, so it would have been nice if they were labeled.</li>
            <li> OH yeah, and cheap ;)</li>
            <li> They are all so cute and wrapped in a cute pink bag which did have some sort of hardware smell to it that I oddly enjoy.</li>
            <li> the top just popped :/ over all the other bushes work great! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great starter set because it not only includes the most basic brushes, but some specialty ones as well.</li>
            <li> and they arrived very fast!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because they seemed like a good deal... but they aren&#x27;t as soft as i thought they would be and using these brushed makes you use more makeup or eye shadow</li>
            <li> At first the brushes seemed very good but after a few months, the heads started breaking form their handles and since the hair was so dense, product didn&#x27;t stay on as well.</li>
            <li> Overall I love the whole bag.its so much for a good price.</li>
            <li> these brushes are nice if your on a tight budget, but i would honestly pick higher end brushes like sigma</li>
            <li> The bristles on the powder brushes are very soft and plush!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, they&#x27;re pretty good</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good for the price, obviously they are not Mac quality brushes but nonetheless they work well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, and I only use high quality most of the time.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and cute.</li>
            <li> When I took it out, it broke even more, however, the brushes are very soft to my liking on my face</li>
            <li> Item came in much earlier than the estimated shipping date, and they are just so adorable!</li>
            <li> and pretty i almost dont want to use the brushes&amp;#62;haha!</li>
            <li> I ordered these first and foremost because of the color!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> These brushes do exactly what they are intended to do giving you the control you need when applying makeup and achieving the effect you want!</li>
            <li> What I love is that they are super soft.</li>
            <li> Super Cute and Soft.</li>
            <li> so in love with my brushes.. super soft..</li>
            <li> The brushed are very soft and feel great on the skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes in this set aren&#x27;t of professional quality very cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brushes are pretty and clean well&lt;br</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t attached very well but the work perfectly fine with or without the handle.</li>
            <li> this product was soo cheap and cute and the quality of the brushes dont feel cheap although it doesnt have every single brush</li>
            <li> They are very cheap and the bristles are too soft to be useful at all.. they are flimsy and don&#x27;t pick up makeup well.</li>
            <li> I wish they would have had a name or number to them, but the larger brushes are what I use the most and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Brushes are of fine quality, so many choices for different effects.</li>
            <li> Most of them are flat and small so they&#x27;re great for applying mostly eye makeup and getting product onto the crevices of your face.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about these brushes was the large brushes.</li>
            <li> My only only gripe was that of the shaddow brushes are perfect for blending but it is NOT a problem as I think I will prefer to buy a single blending brush to add to this collection as it was most definately worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, had them 13 months now and still use everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and very well worth it.</li>
            <li> I jut received the brushes a few days ago, they are great.</li>
            <li> But over all.. Worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li> absolutely.......totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so lovely and soft.</li>
            <li> You can make an equally cute one out of some old fabric.</li>
            <li> they are sooooo soft and cute</li>
            <li> The shadow brushes are not fluffy for my liking and they feel really cheap !</li>
            <li> This makeup brushes are really soft, love the color.</li>
            <li> Having a lot of fun with my makep</li>

            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t be absorbed into bristles.</li>
            <li> The set is AWESOME and way above what I expected.</li>
            <li> There are better options that may not be as cute as these pink ones.</li>

            <li> I love how soft they are and how well kept up they have been.</li>
            <li> but i would save my money to get some brushes that are worth it.</li>

            <li> THEY DO have a distinct vinyl smell</li>
            <li> I liked these brushes; they are soft and feel real.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT SO FAR.</li>
            <li> They are so cute that if you&#x27;re a girl into pink you will love them because of the color.</li>
            <li> They are high quality brushes for super cheap.</li>
            <li> There is a kind of off-gassing smell when you first open the package, but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I used to LOVE these brushes more than my other ones</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a need to wash unless your sticking them in things they are not meant to be used with and if they aren&#x27;t the perfect white and pink who cares, no one sees my brushes they see my makeup!</li>
            <li> They got to me in less than 5 days which was nice!</li>
            <li> they are soft,i did get all the brushes, and i got them pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Also, it may be useful to mention that this set is very large.  </li>
            <li> but other then that good price</li>
            <li> Other brushes are good</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and there&#x27;s a lot of options for what brushes you can use and it&#x27;s great for a person like me who is just starting to learn how to do higher up makeup styles.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice and the brushes are soft, however they are a bit flat for my liking, other than that they are good for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine not having the right brush to do the job.</li>
            <li> but I had to put it right against my nose to smell it.</li>
            <li> Right when I opened it up, one of the brush heads fell out of the handle.  </li>
            <li> All you need is some baby shampoo and all of the makeup washes right off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting it air out right now, but</li>
            <li> I also washed the brushes right away before using them, but that should be a given, no?</li>
            <li> Literally, the metal piece and brush parts just popped right off.</li>
            <li> I put the case right up to my nose</li>
            <li> the brushes came in because it caused all the brushes to bend and one of the brushes fell right off the stick when i was going to use it.</li>
            <li> they smelled strong when i opened since they were brand new.</li>
            <li> prices and anyone looking for a cheap decent makeup set.</li>
            <li> they are soft, work well, and they are pretty and come inside of a cute case.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so incredibly soft and pretty, I just love using them every time I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Love these super soft, affordable and cute will definitely recommend them for anybody, only thing was that most of the brushes didn&#x27;t have the different angles I mainly needed but overall good product!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the vibrant colours of the brushes, the were extremely soft, I just wish that the set was a little more diverse in what type of brushes it came with; a blending brush would&#x27;ve been nice in it.</li>
            <li> Very large collection</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced very little shedding.</li>
            <li> Enough brushes to do any style you have in mind, from office day time look to artistic over the top beauty makeup.  </li>
            <li> the brushes are very soft and good besides the big fan brush was all bend up because of the packaging</li>
            <li> havent used them yet, but they look fun &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li> great for blending blush or bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush is either too small or my face is just</li>
            <li> I love the face brushes, fluffy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a distinct smell when you first get the brushes.</li>
            <li> So far ive only used the big fan brush for my highlighter and it works GREAT!</li>
            <li> are very dense soft and easy to clean..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re packaged wonderfully and I&#x27;m excited to actually use them when I decide to not be lazy and take them out of the pretty packaging.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and cute, but they hardly  hold any product or any pigment onto the brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are cute but they have some downsides... 1) not very pink.</li>
            <li> I was using new makeup in just days with many of these super soft brushes..</li>
            <li> SUPER fast delivery as well..</li>
            <li> (To get rid of the smell I used baby shampoo and warm water, I let them dry and now there is no smell.)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less than good</li>
            <li> but they are good quality none the less.</li>
            <li> the only issue that I have and the reason why I&#x27;m giving it only two stars is because the quality isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t professional, but they are soft and nice to use.</li>
            <li> Me and my sister are both in winterguard and these will be perfect for not only everyday makeup but show makeup as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft, they blend well, they&#x27;re easy to take care of...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll keep your brushes clean and super soft inbetween applications.</li>
            <li> came in super fast</li>
            <li> These brushes would be great for teenage girls who are just starting to experiment with makeup!</li>
            <li> They have really soft bristles and are really easy to work with.</li>
            <li> If u don&#x27;t have these brushes definitely get them they are soooo amazing and soft and apply makeup on so well!!!</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s so ever I would recommend these super affordable, and super soft!</li>
            <li> Would be a good set for a beginner, or a teen looking to just have a first set of brushes, but a medium level to professional level makeup artist would not like them.</li>
            <li> The brushes I received were very pretty (much prettier in person) and they exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped them very fast.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes very much yet.</li>
            <li> It got this order very fast.</li>
            <li> But considering the price which was very reasonable</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for the amount of brushes and the quality.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I got my brushes very fast.</li>
            <li> These brushes work very very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is very reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The brushes in this set are soft and fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Adorable, pink &amp; fun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally disappointed, didn&#x27;t really expect much from this set to begin with.</li>
            <li> Soft, easy to use, but some of the brushes are repetative so you are getting more than one of the same brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brushes are very soft and cute pink color (my favorite color).</li>
            <li> Ordered these brushes and am just in love with them and they are so soft and I live the color!  </li>
            <li> The whole set of brushes work really well!!</li>
            <li> There is a listing of what is included in the description, but that does little good if you have no idea what your looking for.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are vey soft, but they fall apart super quick.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard to clean which is a shame because I loved the beautiful white and pink combo.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s super hard to make the decision and take the risk of buying make up brushes online, but honestly, these are worth it!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and very pretty!</li>
            <li> All the brushes are soft and very pretty!</li>
            <li> I am loving these brushes; The highlight is definitely how soft they are!!</li>
            <li> i love them there really soft and easy to use there also very pretty for any girl that likes pink</li>
            <li> Soft tips and a huge variety.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly that does not really matter, it&#x27;s the brushes that count, which are again AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I have used them mostly for heavier makeup, such as theater and costume work.  </li>
            <li> There are so many different sizes and shapes to chose from I</li>
            <li> These brushes are mostly that sane brush over a iver some in different sizes.</li>
            <li> I was able to glue them back together, but I should not have to do that.</li>
            <li> I really like these!</li>
            <li> Which is a shame since they&#x27;re so pretty.</li>
            <li> I just taught they were pretty</li>
            <li> Just better for me to store a different way.  </li>
            <li> The smell went away after the first wash.</li>
            <li> I love how there is every brush you could possibly need for your make-up including an eyebrow/lash brush.</li>
            <li> these brushes are so pretty</li>
            <li> the brushes are so much bigger than i thought and so many of them.</li>
            <li> yet I love it soooo much more than my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try spraying the ends with MAC Fix+ or the similar one by elf and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a lot of smaller brushes for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I just got them today, I was bit worried about the brush because a lot of people had negative reviews on them and mine came in great condition</li>
            <li> ONLY CUTE</li>
            <li> None of the brushes so far shed and they allow applications to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> She was pleased with the vast assortment of brushes to match her every need.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I never had any makeup brushes, so I wanted something to test out before I invested in higher end brushes.</li>
            <li> For the price, you get a lot of brushes, but some of them look exactly the same and the quality is ok, but something I wouldn&#x27;t use on clients.</li>
            <li> They may have a smell that first</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about the brushes shedding, and I have not found that after I cleaned them up a bit before the first use.</li>
            <li> 3 had so much hot glue in the bristles I had to throw them out.</li>
            <li> I fell in LOVE instantly!</li>
            <li> 15 bucks was wayyyyyyy much a smalll price to pay for the quality of these brushes!</li>
            <li> There was no weird smell or anything..</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> but, they sure feel the same!</li>
            <li> Pretty.</li>
            <li> A couple fell apart after opening the package, and 2 more face brushes shortly after.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve bought similar brushes on this site before and was definitely better off.</li>
            <li> the first time i used one of the brushes for blush and mineral powder i was noticing that it was shedding.</li>
            <li> Of all the 22 brushes, there is no foundation brush which is pretty upsetting.</li>
            <li> Came in almost 2 weeks ahead of time, did have a light odor of paint but went away after they aired out on my table .</li>
            <li> i have used this item so much since i have gotten it!</li>
            <li> two the fan brushes applied blush  pretty well.  </li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> When i first received them they DID smell  like plastic.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> However, they are soft, pretty and cheap.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t ask for any thing better definitely the package to by it</li>
            <li> overall i love them.</li>
            <li> this is my first brush set</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Ok for personal use.</li>
            <li> you probably washed it with hot water</li>
            <li> This are really pretty</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no shedding, and the first thing I did was wash my brushes with warm water and a bit of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice a funny smell to these brushes or anything.</li>
            <li> I love these but the only problem with them is that they smell.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of brushes for the price &amp; they&#x27;re a pretty girl -</li>
            <li> It sheds soooo much !</li>
            <li> I tried to make this sound professional</li>
            <li> The Brushes are soft but when you get them they stank like cheap plastic</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> It may just be from over use of the make up brush, which is the most likely answer.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever buying anything off the internet.</li>
            <li> The set looks exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> it comes with a lot of brushes and the belt case with cover protectors for the big brushes :)</li>
            <li> some of the brushes that i used for the first time came apart</li>
            <li> There are too many fan and big powder brushes for my taste, however.</li>
            <li> The brush holder and the brushes had a funny smell to the.</li>
            <li> when i first got them</li>
            <li> i might end up buying myself a set in the future. :)</li>
            <li> They had a funny odor when I received them.</li>
            <li> Now I see why there are many people giving away similar brush sets.</li>
            <li> Oh and it smells funny</li>
            <li> this one was okay only because when they opened it one of the brushes was kinda messed up.</li>
            <li> But overall it was an OK experience</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a bit of initial maintenance, it&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I was scared at first because of the reviews</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister who is an avid makeup user.</li>
            <li> love the colors, love the softness of the bristles and its actually A LOT bigger</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a pretty well-rounded set that will cover most makeup application needs.</li>
            <li> I really love this set and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> first of all</li>
            <li> Better than I thought, Totally recommended!</li>
            <li> I really love the fan big fan brush for Highlighting.</li>
            <li> but if you wash with soap and warm water the pink comes through again.</li>
            <li> I just wish they have big stippling brush and more of a dome shaped blender brush.</li>
            <li> This was the first brush set I had ever purchased</li>
            <li> So, it WILL stink when you first receive it</li>
            <li> they are so pretty</li>
            <li> Brushes look pretty</li>
            <li> Im sure if i buy some hot glue i can glue them back.</li>
            <li> overall I think they&#x27;re okay for beginners.</li>
            <li> I lobe how there are so many brushes that you don&#x27;t have to worry about reusing the same brush twice when your doing you makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> brushes are exactly like the picture, I didn&#x27;t get any fall out, and they work well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes are the bigger faces ones.</li>
            <li> and I do really like it!</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THESE BRUSHES FOR MORE THAN $16 INCLUDING SHIPPING AND HANDLING ANY PRICES ABOVE</li>
            <li> These suck and are not makeup brushes although the larger ones are okay.</li>
            <li> love the brushes but they do no last.</li>
            <li> Just pulled out my trusty hot glue gun and bam.</li>
            <li> Because that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li> Also use just a bit of conditioner on them the first time you wash them it&#x27;ll prevent shedding (this tip is for ALL brushes not just these)</li>
            <li> And the most exiting part its that not only do they work so well</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it smelled kinda funny</li>
            <li> I have other brushes that I&#x27;ve had for years that I found the other day, washed, and they looked perfect.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading my review Godbless &amp; Jesus loves you! x</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes are ok.</li>
            <li> When I took the plastic wrap off the first brush all of the bristles started to fall out.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be great soft brushes because i read previous comments.</li>
            <li> They are super cute with the pink handles.</li>
            <li> They r amazingly soft too!!!!</li>
            <li> Most are flat filbert style, which you only need so many of.  </li>
            <li> The bigger, fluffier ones are very soft and feel nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> they have no ugly smell like people say it just smells like new.</li>
            <li> These brushes are more for beginners than experienced people , but I have to say these are quite soft and they work pretty good except for the liquid foundation blender, it was too flimsy and soft for me to blend my foundation :(</li>
            <li> Brushes are high quality and very pretty.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very appealing to look at and do have a slight smell ( this is a result of the case)</li>
            <li> a hand full of the bristles came out, I have not tried using them yet because I just got them today, but they are very soft and except for the one brush that fell apart</li>
            <li> There are tons of them in so many different shapes, and they&#x27;re super soft!  </li>
            <li> Cheap cheap cheap &amp; stiffer than a dead body.!</li>
            <li> Other than that, nice product for a synthetic makeup brushes</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these brushes because of the variety and alot of positive reviews, but after receiving them the quality of the brush is good soft and fluffy but they do absolutely NOTHING to your makeup.</li>
            <li> She was soo happy she&#x27;s been wearing makeup everyday feeling so professional with her brushes.</li>
            <li> Soft durable and application is amazing not to mention it arrived in such a hurry</li>
            <li> Really, you&#x27;re better off getting a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> Id say if you need brushes on a budget these are the way to go, I love them so much I might buy another set in a different color!!</li>
            <li> you should get at least the mac brushed, but for home use they work wonderful, and the smell</li>
            <li> I am a college student who does makeup for fashion shows and these are really nice simply because they dont fall apart, they don&#x27;t shed and they&#x27;re soft.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes aren&#x27;t quite as soft, but still do a nice job.  </li>
            <li> But overall I love it and really looks pro</li>
            <li> I recommend this set to anyone who is starting out for fun, likes to do primarily eye makeup, and for traveling.</li>
            <li> The brushes I use for eyeshadow hold the color nicely and by the same token, are so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and seem very durable and the touches of pink make the set super cute!</li>
            <li> they are super soft and are very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> love these brushes, I probably won&#x27;t buy more brushes for a long long time because these are just so pretty</li>
            <li> Other than that I have used the brushes and I really love them, if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like harsh brushes then this is good for you!</li>
            <li> these brushes are super soft and look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I like it just as much as my Sephora set, maybe even a little bit more because it is in such a cute color!</li>
            <li> As the brush started to fall apart, I could see that there was some form of cheap glue just barely holding the ferrule and handle together.</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend if you love pink &amp; doing make up.</li>
            <li> Brushes I got from Costco were better and lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> (cause she loses everything), and i must say, they are quite nice!</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> and they are pretty, but thats not saying much when the hair is falling out.</li>
            <li> pretty, I don&#x27;t so much like the case</li>
            <li> So I bought her first REAL makeup brush set</li>
            <li> Pretty brushes but very synthetic.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, and true to color.</li>
            <li> I guess everyone has their own opinion, but in mine these brushes are not worth buying.</li>
            <li> other than that the brushes are soft and good.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE the size of them, they are large and the handles are long in length</li>
            <li> Some were repeats but very satisfied for less than 11 bucks!</li>
            <li> they are pretty soft and very durable!!</li>
            <li> They work very well though and they&#x27;re super soft!</li>
            <li> They are also super durable as per they stand up to my 3 year old taking them and smashing them on the floor</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and durable and for the price it cannot be matched.</li>
            <li> They are super soft on my face.</li>
            <li> They are super soft, and not even one bristle fell after I washed them.</li>
            <li> super soft  smell</li>
            <li> They are super soft and hold product well.</li>
            <li> they are super soft</li>
            <li> They are super soft as well.</li>
            <li> They are super soft, there has been no shedding</li>
            <li> and if you want you could wash them, but i&#x27;m not making a big deal out of it because it isn&#x27;t as strong as people make it out to be.</li>
            <li> I only came across one problem, when I received them they had a strong smell of plastic.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the brush tips came unglued from the handles of certain brushes.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and soft.</li>
            <li> I had bought this for myself a few months ago and love the material!</li>
            <li> You might be able to use the flat eyeshadow brushes for packing on color, if it is a high pigmented shadow.</li>
            <li> None of the bristles were loose and they came in a really cute carrying case, so you can always be on the go with these brushes!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a strong smell but that&#x27;s common with most brushes.</li>
            <li> Cleans easy and the brushes and wood and conectors hold up for regular monthy cleaning with gentle clensers.</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews about bristles falling out and the smell of the bag, i wasn&#x27;t sure about buying them but for less than 50 cents a piece, it was totally worth it</li>
            <li> These brushes hold pigment good but the types of brushes is limited there is no eyeshadow blending brush and all the brushes are shaped the same, I would reccomend.</li>
            <li> Despite reading the mixed reviews on this product, I decided to take my chances and hope the positive reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes and the fine line brushes are my favorites.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are very high quality, haven&#x27;t had a problem with almost a month of use.</li>
            <li> This shows that they&#x27;re not of very high quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes were very soft and nothing was sheding off of the and the color was right on.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and they really get the job done!!</li>
            <li> , it was pretty troublesome to clean up and swab each eye shadows not only that</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, even if your a make-up artist ;)</li>
            <li> The light pink ombre showed exactly how I imagined it!</li>
            <li> The brushes were very soft!!</li>
            <li> They are VERY soft!!</li>
            <li> They are super soft and really cute being pink!</li>
            <li> I love the color and the pink bag, The tote makes it much easier to carry in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I still love them and nothing has gone wrong at all.</li>
            <li> but I do wear make up everyday and this set is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> All the material is really cheap, brushes don&#x27;t even apply make up properly.</li>
            <li> Plus there was a really foul smell that came with the brushes.</li>
            <li> I really just wanted the case</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast; don&#x27;t expect 22 working brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like this set...</li>
            <li> She mostly loves the pink color.  </li>
            <li> They all work really well and are dense.</li>
            <li> Came well packed and was in a cute pink leather carrier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much need for the use of the fan brushes but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes but</li>
            <li> Also when you wash these I&#x27;ve noticed that the color stays and isn&#x27;t really effected by the make up.</li>
            <li> Works very well with makeup and my skin.</li>
            <li> so you will have a whole array of brushes to fill out your brush collection for that stuff</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS BRUSHES AND THE PRICE</li>
            <li> but most of them were no very well made</li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> (I use a coconut/almond oil mix to remove the excess, then wash with a gentle anti-bacterial soap just like I do with my sponges).</li>
            <li> REALLY REGRET BUYING THEM FOR SO MUCH...</li>
            <li> Awsome set came with a cute roll up pink plether case.</li>
            <li> They also came very well wrapped and everything looked as advertised.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> but i think it was just because these were pink and cute.</li>
            <li> these are your starter brushes, be careful, the face brushes suck and the eye brushes have many duplicates.</li>
            <li> My whole makeup bag got lost at school one day</li>
            <li> I couldnt believe how fast the shipping was.</li>
            <li> She wants another set for her sister.  </li>
            <li> Very displeased.</li>
            <li> I have just used 2 or 3 of the brushes out of the whole set.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to wash them very often..</li>
            <li> bought two sets for my cousins, they are going to love them, these brushes are softer than i had expected.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush didn&#x27;t work too well for me as it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold its shape very well.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy doing makeup and for starters too</li>
            <li> so i wouldn&#x27;t really expect much else.</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t understand why it was so much..</li>
            <li> You get a lot of different brushes for cheap.</li>
            <li> It is also a more metallic pink</li>
            <li> and u couldn&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li> The plastic smell that was mentioned dissipated after an hour after I opened the package, so no problems there, and the brushes cleaned really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just try to air on the side of gentle.</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> The brushes do not pick up makeup very well or that at all.</li>
            <li> i think its more for kids or minimal use..</li>
            <li> The case and brushes did smell like chemicals when I opened it, but I don&#x27;t really mind that, it will go away.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the brush set is still very workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this sets of make up brush, the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> They really hold on the color.</li>
            <li> I actully really like this set.</li>
            <li> I really like them all.</li>
            <li> i HIGHLY RECOMMEND these brushes!</li>
            <li> roll-up bag is also very well made and keeps the brushes protected.</li>
            <li> It has been everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li> I love the pink.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend them!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonably priced bundle of brushes to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> I love the pink color and the brush holder it comes with.</li>
            <li> Over all I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> I gave them a rating of 5 because the brushes were better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the case and the shade of pink</li>
            <li> Also it came fast</li>
            <li> but I really coyuldnt stand the smell</li>
            <li> The smell of the bag smells like very processed plastic</li>
            <li> And I love Pink.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who Loves make-up as much as I do.</li>
            <li> But they do not hold or transfer pigment very well</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable, however you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> is very beautiful!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very well priced and you get a lot of brushes.  </li>
            <li> and I really like them.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely adored it.</li>
            <li> but these really do nothing it just caked my make up on</li>
            <li> and I spent more time trying to fix my make up from the brushes</li>
            <li> when you really think about it, if you buy this kit for about 12 bucks your getting each brush for around 50 cents.</li>
            <li> my favorite color is pink, and it a shame to say thats</li>
            <li> but i just dont feel like i get that much out of them</li>
            <li> The smell of the plastic didn&#x27;t bother me that much</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet really</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot Amazon and please don&#x27;t charge taxes.  </li>
            <li> This means that some of the makeup still stays on the brush, no matter how much you wash it.</li>
            <li> they also wash very well.</li>
            <li> Like really?</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold powder really wel...</li>
            <li> absolutely like it.</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;m really using them properly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I really think you should buy this before they run out</li>
            <li> It was fixed easily enough by leaving the brushes out for a day or so on my counter top.  </li>
            <li> overall view of the product is that it can be a good starting brush set for the young makeup enthusiast who may just be learning and building their makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Every brush has a cover and its comes out with the nice pink case and the brush was really soft.</li>
            <li> They even look soft and lovely when you open the pack.</li>
            <li> I do think the set could be a bit more complete if some fluffier eye shadow brushes, a blending brush, and a pencil brush or two were included, perhaps instead of a couple of the smaller brushes that are in the set.</li>
            <li> It kind of feels like a really fluffy dogs tail.</li>
            <li> She is thrilled with them, and uses them everyday.</li>
            <li> They are nice and firm and dont fray.  </li>
            <li> I have bought brushes for the same price and they are far better quality</li>
            <li> the brushes are super soft and are very professional!</li>
            <li> Its a very strong odd plastic smell.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and pick up just the right amount of colors from any eyeshadow pallette.</li>
            <li> They ARE NOT THAT HARD TO CLEAN , like most people say.</li>
            <li> , I wanted decent brushes that I am not paying hundreds for, and I certainly received that.</li>
            <li> Very cute brushes, the handles are pink and the brushes themselves ombré from white to pink:)</li>
            <li> denser.they are very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> These came within a week after ordering which was surprising because I was sure it&#x27;d at least be a few weeks before seeing them, so that was the first plus.</li>
            <li> They dont hold up as well as the more expensive ones but pretty good for daily use.</li>
            <li> : very soft , they look really pretty .</li>
            <li> and they are not only pretty, but they are super soft and other than a few hairs falling out when I cleaned them (that&#x27;s normal), they are perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes themselves are nice and full and fluffy, I was looking to get this kit to replace a lot of my worn brushes as well as expand the brush options I had before, and this definitely does the trick.</li>
            <li> You get so many brushes AND PINK!</li>
            <li> I love the pink bag and everything!</li>
            <li> If I was being extremely picky, I might say that I was just wishing it could be more of a brush belt, but that&#x27;s not what the product is advertised as.</li>
            <li> Love that they are pink!</li>
            <li> my powder is applied better than with any other brush.</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re adorable and pink!</li>
            <li> I came across these brushes and fell in love with the pink bristles!</li>
            <li> goshh but other than that i love them</li>
            <li> These type of stiff flat brushes are great for concealer, primer, cream products, lipstick, gel liner, etc.</li>
            <li> As I noted in some other reviews when I first opened the package the brush roll and brushes did smell quite strongly like paint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very pink which I love.</li>
            <li> I recommend using your facial cleanser or Ivory bar soap to clean them.</li>
            <li> however i cant get these clean enough.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are soft and pretty, but they do not work very well.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty good not great</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why these are rated so high.</li>
            <li> The roll up plastic case is also very durable and a shiny pink and its not cloth so the brushes aren&#x27;t going to fall out easily.</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft, but they don&#x27;t hold the makeup as well as a natural fiber.</li>
            <li> The brushes were all good quality and all different usually brushes in a large amount as this is often filled with a lot of the same brushes</li>
            <li> The only thing is the pink turns into all different colors with makeup lol</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind that so much, what I do mind is how soft these brushes are!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t fully used these brushes yet, but they are so pretty, and the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my daughter for Christmas as it was a full size pouch with all of the necessary brushes.  </li>
            <li> They are supper soft and you get exactly what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so pretty and soft.</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazingly soft and pretty i havent used them yet because</li>
            <li> These are for my own personal use and I would not know if they are of such quality to stand up to professional use.</li>
            <li> They are cute and pink !!</li>
            <li> The powder brushes are soo soft and fluffy; the eye shadow and concealer brushes are stiff (which they should be) and perfect for application!!</li>
            <li> they did have a bit of a paint smell but its something I can live with!</li>
            <li> They work well, yes, however, the tops come off easily, and its hard to make them look clean.</li>
            <li> I love this color so I already love it when I first opened it, has a slight weird smell but honestly, just open up the pouch and let it air for a while</li>
            <li> Ignoring the smell, I decided to use my new brushes to get ready to go out for the night.</li>
            <li> its only cause they are new and we have to clean them before we use them</li>
            <li> When I was considering buying theses brushes, I wasn&#x27;t sure because some reviews were good and some were bad.</li>
            <li> They bend too easily to pick up harder pigments.</li>
            <li> Overall, love the case and the brushes should last me a while</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make these better would be if the handles had labels on them such as fan, crease, etc.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes are really similar, but in different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too many of the brush were the same or similar</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what I was mainly looking for in this</li>
            <li> Seriously do not buy them.</li>
            <li> I ONLY gave 3 stars because this item was delivered so quick.</li>
            <li> mainly the eye brushes but</li>
            <li> Great deal, a million brushes, no more blush where your bronzer should be going because you are too lazy to wash the brush, you don&#x27;t have to wash that ONE eye shadow brush every time you change colors anymore, pink&#x27;s cute, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> and i am glad i went with this one instead of the more expensive style.</li>
            <li> pretty much fell apart, I barely touched it and</li>
            <li> luckily I glued them back together</li>
            <li> My older sister was in need of some makeup brushes</li>
            <li> , that was the main reason I wanted them.</li>
            <li> I do my makeup everyday and these brushes are such good quality.</li>
            <li> most of the brushes are the same but different sized.</li>
            <li> the was the main reason i got them, however when i did get them and started trying to use them</li>
            <li> I am actually considering buying a second one, just to have more brushes for bridal parties, etc.</li>
            <li> They are decent material and work well with makeup.</li>
            <li> The pink bag has a strong plastic odor to it after unrolling, but after you air it out</li>
            <li> the feel is very soft on the skin and they apply cream products very well.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and work very well for inexpensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I contact the seller for a replacement, but you have yet to hear anything back from them as far as a replacement, but other than that they&#x27;re pretty nice brushes.</li>
            <li> it took a long time for them to arrive but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes for synthetic!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too, came 3 weeks early!</li>
            <li> These are a great buy, for such a small value!</li>
            <li> Very soft !</li>
            <li> They do shed when first used, but after the first few times, they have stopped and are still full and useable.  </li>
            <li> I immediately compared my old brushes to this and just laughed at how small my old brushes were compared to these .</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for these</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to any one.</li>
            <li> brushes are high quality.</li>
            <li> I have a mixture of drug store and high end brushes...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you will need to supplement a few other brushes to be really happy with your makeup application.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the brush set when I first got it even though there were pretty bad reviews, but once I started using it, I disliked it more and more.</li>
            <li> Only a mild new plastic smell.  </li>
            <li> ok so the brushes do smell a little like plastic, but that does not matter.</li>
            <li> Soon as I took them out of the packaging they smelled a little better.</li>
            <li> There are so many of them and some so little difference in size that I don&#x27;t know what is for what</li>
            <li> are a little better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are SO soft and the bristles dont fall out at all!!</li>
            <li> Very cute, pretty pink brushes, but does not apply makeup well due to the fact that they are way too soft.</li>
            <li> Just little smell like petroleum or something I think it is normal :)</li>
            <li> love the pink, and im no pink lover!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d spend a little more and get a real professional set if I could do it all over again.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some kind of glue or tape on the brushes that make them hard and unusable.</li>
            <li> The brushes shed A LOT (as in, I was worried ALL of the bristles were going to fall out), and the other reviewers were correct that there is a really strong odor.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really hold high hopes when first purchasing this brush set because of the really low price.</li>
            <li> Despite the bad experiences some people had with these brushes, I found them to be awesome.</li>
            <li> thing I didnt realize is now cheap the pink bag looks.</li>
            <li> and they are so soft and high quality!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how great they were for the price!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and they work very well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Great for a five minute, everyday make-up and for those of us learning to do more complicated applications.</li>
            <li> they are so soft i havent gotten a chance to try them but seems like they will work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their soft and apply the makeup very well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and put on make up very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 15 year old, up and coming makeup artist, and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> the brushes are too soft and do not hold the powder very well.</li>
            <li> The only con that I found on these brushes was that they smelt like fresh paint when I got them.</li>
            <li> , THE QUALITY IS PRETTY GOOD, IT JUST HAS A WEIRD SMELL, BUT</li>
            <li> I have 6 different brush sets and I recommend first picking up the Real Techniques Core Collection for face brushes and</li>
            <li> This came with a ton of different brushes, so for the money it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Out all of them only 3 are useful.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are pretty much all the same and none of them work for blending or contouring the lid.</li>
            <li> …I actually thought it smelled fresh</li>
            <li> (I posted a few photographs in the gallery, so you have a better look before</li>
            <li> They are all laid out flat right before your very eyes, then you roll it right back up...</li>
            <li> I fixed a couple with a little super glue and still use them, but i&#x27;ll be investing in better brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> I only have about half of them that I was able to save with some hot glue.</li>
            <li> other then that they work fine..</li>
            <li> 2 of my fan brushes got folded over when it was wrapped up but all of my other brushes are fine.</li>
            <li> but i was just figuring it was because it was freshly unwrapped since that does occasionally happen with a new set.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushed .</li>
            <li> The case or pink bag is soft and cleans up easy when traveling.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft &amp; so far I have not noticed much shedding.</li>
            <li> Also 2 did arrive broken, but for the price they&#x27;re really good brushes and are very very soft.</li>
            <li> For the price it was an ok set, and I&#x27;ll probably continue buying different types of cheaper brushes, because I refuse to spend $30 on a single brush.  </li>
            <li> The face brushes are very soft and I love them, the eye makeup brushes are stiff cannot blend with them</li>
            <li> They come in a cute pink carrying case which makes them so much easier to carry along with you, didn&#x27;t take long to be shipped</li>
            <li> Spraying a little Fix+ works very well with these brushes to make a precise application of color.</li>
            <li> Spraying a little Fix+ works very well with these brushes to make a precise application of color.</li>
            <li> The brushes are extremely flimsy and are so cheap.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes, they are soft, washing them got rid of any weird smells.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the case is easy to clean if it becomes dirty and the brushes are true to size based on the photos.</li>
            <li> The brushed were really soft and the color was really pretty!</li>
            <li> , theres only a couple brushes i actually use out of this kit, and for the price its not bad if u really use them</li>
            <li> Within a week of using these brushes, I felt regretful of my new buy.</li>
            <li> I shouldnt need to use glue on my new brushes.</li>
            <li> She lives in Michigan, I live in NJ.  </li>
            <li> It smelled like a new brush roll for a bit, then it faded.</li>
            <li> Just like a new car smell fades over time.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I would have thought these brushes would have fallen apart by now, but they still look fairly new.</li>
            <li> They just smelled like new brushes.</li>
            <li> No I have to order new brushes from someone else</li>
            <li> I live in arizona.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The larger brushes are soft enough for gentle placement and blending, and the smaller ones are stiff enough to work perfectly for eyebrow filling and eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Brushes have a slight smell but other than that its super cute luv</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was a manufacturing mistake or not, but it&#x27;s kind of ridiculous.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nice, especially if you tend to be heavy handed.</li>
            <li> brushes are ONLY cute because they are PINK.</li>
            <li> The brushes are cute with the color pink and white.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and fluffy they are.</li>
            <li> Went out on a limb to try cheap low end brushes...and that&#x27;s what I got..cheap, low end brushes.  </li>
            <li> They all have soft bristles and so far I haven&#x27;t had much shedding.</li>
            <li> I love the pink &amp; white colors.</li>
            <li> I would compare it to the overwhelming smell of fresh paint but worse.</li>
            <li> however is that they smell strongly of chemicals and it worries me slightly to think they might be getting on my face.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and it included everything you need for daily and heavy makeup....very handy.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> These cosmetic makeup brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> They bristles are very very soft.  </li>
            <li> As for the brush they&#x27;re SOOOO soft and seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li> but I did take a couple out and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by these brushes.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and do not shed</li>
            <li> These brushes are very professional</li>

            <li> The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> So for all of you, who are very sensitive to smell, then just be cautious about this one because it may be bothersome or a nuisance.</li>
            <li> very soft bristles and the brushes are packed meaning they put a lot of bristles per brush.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s pretty much every single brush I could ever want in here</li>
            <li> I usually do not mind that smell.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes so far!</li>
            <li> The big blush/ powder brush broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Come in tons of different brushes but some of it fall of after first use</li>
            <li> When I open it the first thing I notice</li>
            <li> Brushes are cheap, and certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and soooooo soft!</li>
            <li> the face brushes are too soft and flimsy!</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> The only think I did not like is that when it first arrived, I tried to wash them and two of them came apart, but that&#x27;s just b/c</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also extremely soft!</li>
            <li> So I hot glued them back on</li>
            <li> they are so soft and do not shed at all!</li>
            <li> But I love all the small ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re soo soft!</li>
            <li> And hair doesnt fall down which i think is really important.</li>
            <li> Pretty pink, large assortment.</li>
            <li> They clean up as well as any other makeup brushes after they&#x27;ve been used a bit and need washed to remove product build-up in the bristles.</li>
            <li> They handle all of the different product types very well, and you get 22 brushes for the price you pay for one brush from a high end brand.  </li>
            <li> There are like ten different eye shadow brushes, two fan brushes, a concealer brush, two powder brushes, one brush with a very flat top, about two lip brushes, one smudge brush, mascara brush, and one eye brow comb.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft but most of them are tiny, i find it difficult to find the proper blending brush out of all 22 of these.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go past the gorgeous baby pink.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, clean, and I detected no odd odor as I have read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> They serve their purpose well, and I can&#x27;t believe I found such great brushes for such a low price, compared to other big name brands.</li>
            <li> these brushes are very pretty but the quality is not what i expected...</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about these brushes but with all the good reviews i couldn&#x27;t help myself!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the pink bag did smell really strong like acetone or something.</li>
            <li> large powder brush and the smaller blush/powder brush work well for the application of those products.</li>
            <li> The case feels a little cheap</li>
            <li> I love pink, these are pink, they are soft and very professional.</li>
            <li> They were soft and worked good, I ordered one for myself, but the bristles on mine were a little uneven, I still use them.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a nice set, with tons of different types and shapes of brushes, but I don&#x27;t hardly use any of them.</li>
            <li> I love the color pink and to come on Amazon and find me some makeup brushes and they are pink</li>
            <li> Packaged in the light pink case and individually wrapped with platic over the bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I may actually return this product, because they brushes seem to be TOO soft and dont work very well because of it.</li>
            <li> Someone in the comments said they&#x27;re brush handles where plastic, mine was wooden with cheap pink paint coming off of the handles.</li>
            <li> They larger brushes are extremely soft and work very well.  </li>
            <li> Now I said I dont loke pink but with these brushes I now love pink.</li>
            <li> then i thought, couldn&#x27;t get a clear pic because of the length</li>
            <li> They dont hold any makeup, there too soft to use.</li>
            <li> They are so soft.</li>
            <li> So far they have held up and have not shed any bristles.</li>
            <li> I aired it out for a day/overnight</li>
            <li> And she has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The so called professional cosmetic brushes dont work the bristles are to soft and fall out.</li>
            <li> The blush &amp; countoring brush are so soft you can&#x27;t pick up any product.</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft but it smells like paint.</li>
            <li> I put them in my bathroom cupboard and the next morning the whole cabinet smelled like Plastic.</li>
            <li> Brush is too soft for powder or creams products.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft, but the hairs continuously fall out while I&#x27;m using the brush, getting all over my face.</li>
            <li> They bristles are not fluffy at all.</li>
            <li> And personally, I don&#x27;t think that the brushes picks up the eye shadow very well.</li>
            <li> The metal ferrule, which leads to the bristle, completely detached from the handle of the brush.</li>
            <li> I would stay sturdy for at home use......not for professional use.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> In trying to get ready for work every day I can&#x27;t stop to glue a brush back on.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes.</li>
            <li> I have brushes from sephora and nyc brushes and they are just as soft as them if not softer than those.</li>
            <li> The case definitely has some sort of scent to it, but I don&#x27;t really mind it since I&#x27;ll just let it air out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and picks up product well.</li>
            <li> I am definelty a EcoTools girl and I would say these are just as soft as my old brushes.</li>
            <li> The hair on the brushes are sooo soft and work wonders .</li>
            <li> These will go to my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> I had it sent directly to her, so</li>
            <li> Brushes are too soft</li>
            <li> And they are so soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased them a year ago and only use about 3 brushes out of the whole set.</li>
            <li> So soft</li>
            <li> got these for my teenage daughter, as i didnt want to invest too much on something for her</li>
            <li> but 6are duplcations really thyy are all the same.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who is trying to achieve that professional look.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much on the quality side because of the low price I had to pay.</li>
            <li> am giving you this review from the perspective of a professional makeup</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t fantastic with picking up or packing shadows, and this set doesn&#x27;t come with any type of fluffy blending brush.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are SO soft and I got all of the 22 brushes.</li>
            <li> Also the brushes are really soft and I have not had a problem with the bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> Soft and well made.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> The brush was glued to the body but not firmly so the brush keeps sliding off the handle.</li>
            <li> but they store so neatly in the case it comes in, which is really soft as well.</li>
            <li> soft brittles</li>
            <li> I am a frequent user of all colors of eye shadows and this allows me the freedom to use them all without going HMMMMMMM which brush..</li>
            <li> the brissles are soft and dont shed.</li>
            <li> and theyre soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and pick up makeup so well.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> soft.</li>
            <li> Looking for a brush set that has a professional feel this is it.  </li>
            <li> the brushes were really soft but because they&#x27;re synthetic</li>
            <li> I was surprised when it got here.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely soft which doesnt allow the product to stay on the brush.</li>
            <li> I used them twice so far, and will say, they would be an alright set for beginners.</li>
            <li> but they get soft after a while of using.</li>
            <li> I order this for my 20 year old bestfriend/roommate for christmas</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes as a gift for my 18 year old niece&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li> As far as the smell, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> but after a wash in some baby shampoo they were smelling ggod and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Out of this whole 22 pc set I can only seem to use 3 of them.</li>
            <li> These brushes were too soft and didn&#x27;t pick up any make up.</li>
            <li> Soft and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li> By the way, it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> She is 20 years old and always watches those makeup tutorials saying things like she wish she could do what they are doing in the video.</li>
            <li> The hair in the brushes don&#x27;t fall out, stay soft &amp;</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and hold whatever makeup you&#x27;re using well.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> they are so dense and soft</li>
            <li> Yes, the brushes were soft - but it collects no makeup so it doesn&#x27;t even serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> They are amazingly soft and a brush for everything.</li>
            <li> The brushes were way too soft.</li>
            <li> I guess if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and you like soft bristles</li>
            <li> One of the brushes was already broke when it arrived in the mail but was easily fixed.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the brushes are soft but some are too soft.</li>
            <li> all the brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> but so far i like them.</li>
            <li> the brushes are too soft that it doesn&#x27;t pick up the pigment of your make up products.</li>
            <li> your are looking for soft brushes this is def.</li>
            <li> I ran my fingers through each brush and they are all amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> All the brushes are soft and the handles are sturdy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also really soft.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li> and they are by far the softest brushes i&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> they are sooooo soft and do not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> These brushes are durable and soft so they will not irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I thought WOW...</li>
            <li> shipped from far</li>
            <li> the brushes are SO SOFT but not too flimsy.</li>
            <li> There was a bit of a plasticky smell when I opened them, but it went away fast enough.</li>
            <li> and there so soft</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t really use it though because I will be transferring ALL of my brushes to a brush belt, or if space is allowed, a rolled out white towel.</li>
            <li> and some are too soft others</li>
            <li> I do use a few of these brushes regularly, however, most of them have been thrown away.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is that it doesnt have a round eyeshadow brush but for the money you save from buying these you can buy one from somewhere else :)</li>
            <li> but you will probably need to pick up a few better eyeshadow brushes, especially for blending, as there is nothing in here that works for that.</li>
            <li> However, for the small price I believe the set is worth it if you&#x27;re interested in temporary brushes.</li>
            <li> looks expensive but the price is fair.</li>
            <li> Not wonderful , the powder brushes are too soft for foundation but good for blending and blush .</li>
            <li> They were good brushes but a few were missing in the pack</li>
            <li> they also font look like expensive brushes but the price is a good for them .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are a little hard to clean, but most makeup brushes I&#x27;ve had are.</li>
            <li> The small brushes are nice and stiff, and the large ones are very soft.</li>
            <li> but I ordered mine in the hot month of July where I live so since they were rollers in a pink bag thingy, the brushes sorta got rolled too.</li>
            <li> there are a few brushes that i will use a lot in this set, but some of them are too stiff for good eye makeup blending.</li>
            <li> Have had for about 3 months use them everyday and for the price very worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for about 2 months now, and they have been very very usefull , I am using these for my every single day makeup</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly soft but hard to maintain for me because it really grabs the pigment and you will have to constantly clean it in between uses.</li>
            <li> You dont even notice the smell unless you put your face right up to the pink bag and try to smell it.</li>
            <li> As far as performance, the brushes are decent, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Some of my brushes broke right after I unpacked them, but I only needed a few new brushes, it&#x27;s not alright to waste your money on broken brushes, but if you want to these will be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Most brushes are made for the average consumer, therefore, the handles are short because they are for personal use.</li>
            <li> I use them almost daily and they are still like new!</li>
            <li> The case does have an odd new plastic smell, but u can&#x27;t smell it until u put ur face right up to it.</li>
            <li> Package came in good condition, the fan brush was the only brush that was a little bent, a little water and some diligent drying fixed that in a jiffy though.</li>
            <li> And surely enough people where not kidding I slightly passed my hand threw the fan brush and sure enough the hairs started falling out!...</li>
            <li> but they actually are pretty big.</li>
            <li> Got these when I first started the only thing I don&#x27;t care for the smaller brushes</li>
            <li> Decent enough quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Had a lot of brushes that did the same thing and were exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised on how soft &amp; professional these brushes actually are!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are awesome brushes especially for the price, but for me they are just a little too soft.</li>
            <li> These pink makeup brushes are very high quality, don&#x27;t shed, and apply makeup as evenly as posssible!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushed.</li>
            <li> would HIGHLY recommend not using this company for any of your purchases, especially around the holidays.</li>
            <li> Most are just similar to eachother and a little too big to be eyeshaow brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes shed like no other!</li>
            <li> Another thing is that the brushes are just way too soft and barely hold the color on them to put anything on your lids.</li>
            <li> I rally wouldn&#x27;t recommend theses brushes to anyone, I could find better brushes at a pharmacy, so that&#x27;s a no good for me,</li>
            <li> As long as you look after and shampoo your brushes, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> it came before expected and was exactly as described</li>
            <li> I was expecting more blending brushes for the eyes but all of the small brushes are flat and not usable for blending.</li>
            <li> Pink is pretty.</li>
            <li> I first ordered them just because i was curious</li>
            <li> nothing a little super glue and 30 seconds can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously not one rounded or fluffy eyeshadow brush in the whole bunch!</li>
            <li> and I will likely get a new one.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend these brushes to anyone who loves makeup or just needs new brushes.</li>
            <li> Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well.</li>
            <li> Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant but not disgusting.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, the only complaint i have is that they should include a guide of what each brush is and what they are used for.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough for all over application but not so soft that they&#x27;re flimsy.</li>
            <li> The brissles are soft and I see myself ordering another set in the near future.</li>
            <li> I do love how soft they are, and they don&#x27;t leave behind any parts of the brush on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product looks nothing like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice and soft, but I&#x27;ve been to angry to use them, plus I still want the purple ones, not the brown I recieved.</li>
            <li> , people were conplaining about a strong smell wich mine dont have , the little pink case looks like its made out of a durable material and is pretty, overall i think not only for the price of it</li>
            <li> The only thing that I dislike about these brushes are that they are VERY SOFT</li>
            <li> they are very soft but about a month later one by one the glue gave out and they fell apart. ) :</li>
            <li> the only problem is the packaging has a very loud plastic smell.</li>
            <li> Big, fluffy, and super soft!</li>
            <li> i would really recommend trying them i use them every single they</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that some of the smaller brushes are almost exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I just bought it for the brushes, so I will probably toss or donate the bag, but if the bag is a major factor in your purchase decision, I would thing twice about getting</li>
            <li> You get several different brushes for a low price and each brush is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> it comes with a pretty pink case and has 22 brushes in it!</li>
            <li> Only downside is the packaging smells like paint when you first get it, but I left them open in my room for a bit and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> a major germs phobic</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t really pick up loose powder at all.</li>
            <li> I Rubbed Coconut Oil Into The Case And Wiped It Down With A Slightly Damp Cloth, That Took Away Most Of The Smell</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who is interested in adding a few more brushes into their collection, instead of going out and buying more expensive ones every few decades.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave this a rating of 2 stars is because the eye shadow brushes are too flat, they do not collect my naked pallet eye shadows even though it is really pigmented.</li>
            <li> The only real complaint is that the glue smell was rather strong when they first arrived.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft, but stiff enough for application.</li>
            <li> The brushes are cheap quality and hardly blend any make up .</li>
            <li> I guess they would be good for someone that uses really subtle makeup, because to apply makeup, specially if you like heavy makeup, you have to apply quite a few times to actually do it to your liking.</li>
            <li> its true that they pick up very little makeup</li>
            <li> makeup beginners are anyone in general</li>
            <li> I put it as an okay for these brushes but not good enough.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft but doesn&#x27;t blend, the handles are way too long to be practical, and the brushes fall apart from the handle as soon as you touch it--22 brushes and so far I haven&#x27;t found one</li>
            <li> ANYONE IN Who&#x27;s INTERESTED IN THESE  BRUSHES SHOULD GET THEM AT CRAZY CART STOREFRONT: )</li>
            <li> bu save your money and just buy 3 or 4 basic professional brushes.</li>
            <li> My only problem is when I went to take one out the package it feel completely apart.</li>
            <li> face brushes barely hold powder.</li>
            <li> The larger powder brushes also have a considerable amount of shedding.</li>
            <li> My bare mineral powder doesn&#x27;t adhere to brush as well as I would like it to</li>
            <li> Firstly....it was shipped much faster than expected....</li>
            <li> The face brushes are extremely soft and hold enough face powder for my liking.</li>
            <li> yep it barely picks up the makeup.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes are really gentle on the face and the other ones are a bit stiffer but still soft!</li>
            <li> I just aired it outside for a couple of days and the smell kinda faded.</li>
            <li> Why do I need four giant powder brushes that are nearly identical?</li>
            <li> came much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I barely use them.</li>
            <li> To compare I have bare mineral brushes and have had them for 3 years.</li>
            <li> The sticks are sturdy, so they&#x27;re not liable to break.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I use to use the Bare Minerals brushes but my puppy got ahold of them and destroyed them.</li>
            <li> on yes some are too soft but even for those u can find use especially for blush</li>
            <li> These, however, spray makeup all over like a sprinkler if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> When I first received my brushes, the pink brush bag spelled like plastic (not necessarily an unbearable smell, but I didn&#x27;t like it).</li>
            <li> The bag had kind of a weird smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending the kit to my daughter, because she knows a little more on the subject.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the pink bag smells like a new shower curtain when you first open the package, so unroll it and let it air out outside for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> there super cute and not so bad for $20 i just hate the brush holder but there pretty good i guess</li>
            <li> Pretty in Pink!!</li>
            <li> Pretty pink just not for me!!</li>
            <li> ONCE , I have already washed them and not a single strand of hair has came out !</li>
            <li> I will NOT be needing to buy any new brushes for a long time</li>
            <li> they have an odd smell at first...</li>
            <li> that b/c one look thru Amazon we were ordering exactly what she wanted for way less than she had seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The handles are pretty big in comparison to my other brushes in terms of the diameter of the handle.</li>
            <li> If its for a young teen that isn&#x27;t very serious about the look or precision, it would be okay.  </li>
            <li> Its smell a little but its not that strong as seen in other comments.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles were sticking out or too long which would not be a good thing for those serious about applying make-up but for me, I just pulled the strays out or cut them down.</li>
            <li> Okay eyeshadow brushes for beginners, but the face brushes are just awful, don&#x27;t waste your money on this like most of the brushes that are really cheap on amazon.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very pretty and very soft, however, they smell like paint, the bristles are not trimmed evenly, and the pink paint on one of the brush have a finger printed like someone touched it before the paint was even dried up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to clean the brushes ..</li>
            <li> I wash these brushes every other week and they&#x27;ve been holding up very well.</li>
            <li> Due to the price you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> I really like the color of the white &amp; pink bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles will hold the color you&#x27;re using (though I only rinsed them with water, this may be different with a professional cleaner)--so basically they stain, but</li>
            <li> This set will basically be my crap set, my mac ones will be saved for more important uses.</li>
            <li> The pink case doesn&#x27;t hold the brushes particularly well, but the flap helps with that.</li>
            <li> the pink color is not that vibrant</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive it based on all of the good reviews, but am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Basically, they&#x27;re all the right amount of soft or hard for what they&#x27;re meant to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell was a little funky too when it first shipped...</li>
            <li> I slot near the larger brushes was empty and the first slt was empty</li>
            <li> enough- no good balance but for everyday simple makeup needs you are good to go.</li>
            <li> The pouch you get with the brushes is nice, the only complaint I have about it is that it smells a little plasticy.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, they&#x27;re kinda hard to clean.</li>
            <li> They are big and soft and do just what I expect them to do.&lt;br /&gt;However, some of the smaller brushes are basically the same</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and the handles are long and sturdy.</li>
            <li> they could be used for something but not professionally I think they&#x27;re soft but feel plastic ish</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I appreciate how long the handles are.</li>
            <li> they looked to be really good quality,plus they aren&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> my only disappointment is it could of had certain brushed that would of made the set better</li>
            <li> and i love the little pink bag they came in with!!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong is that they have a very strong plastic smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box</li>
            <li> Also the brushes do shed a little but only while you first wash them and pull at them.</li>
            <li> It is true that there is a slight smell, almost like a spray paint smell, but the smell is only on the pink bag that comes with the brushes.</li>
            <li> The large fan brush works well for dusting off excess powders and moderately well for blending out powder blushes/contour along with applying highlight down the nose and on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing and the product was shipped very quickly, however, I was very disappointed once I opened the package.</li>
            <li> They dry fast dont shed or loose there</li>
            <li> Package does have slight smell but very un noticable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them long enough to see how well they hold up, but I like them so far.</li>
            <li> if you buy them you won&#x27;t be disappointed that&#x27;s for sure!!</li>
            <li> One of the brushes I use on a daily basis, the handle has become loose, but with a push back in, it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been airing out the brushes and once I wash them, I&#x27;m certain that little &#x27;smell&#x27; will go away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal due to use or not.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a large fluffy blending eyeshadow brush, but it seems all the eyeshadow brushes are pretty stiff ):</li>
            <li> &amp;&amp; i love pink!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t irritate the face; I&#x27;ve used them with a variety of products: pressed shadows and blushes, loose powders, cream shadows, eye primers, foundation, etc.  </li>
            <li> Not a new one, but a really gross, old smell.</li>
            <li> One thing I did not like is that a few jars on the brushes are stray and not perfectly straight, this will not affect make-up application but can be less appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but every single one of the brushes came apart!</li>
            <li> The one thing I would change about this set is I would include a few &#x27;sponge applicators&#x27; for eye shadow and make the handles a little bit shorter so that one or two would fit in my cosmetic bag in my purse.  </li>
            <li> and i was afraid because of the reviews, to many ppl complaining about the smell, and blah blah, ofc if you are a professional make up artist</li>
            <li> The handles have a good MODERATE feel; not a cheap nor expensive feeling to them.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> My only issue is that you have to clean them a lot for some reason they just get clogged and dirty really fast.</li>
            <li> This way I can use half of them for light shadows and the other for dark ones.</li>
            <li> you can uses becase they&#x27;re soft, the little ones super hard</li>
            <li> the brushes are soft on my skin and they are pink!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft, and I didn&#x27;t notice and fallout of bristles or any that were askew!</li>
            <li> Then lastly all of the eyeshadow brushes are flat...</li>
            <li> All the tops keep falling off and don&#x27;t stay on if I push them on really hard, will have to hot glue them all back on.</li>
            <li> Since I luckily had a hot glue gun and could fix them, I wasn&#x27;t too mad, but I did go through and check out the rest of the set.</li>
            <li> The item is VERY pink, brushes are soft, and theres a lot of them....</li>
            <li> All brushes shed slightly when they are brand new, and I have not had any issues.</li>
            <li> I used previously doesn&#x27;t mix with the new.</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY surprised when I got my set because I based the purchase off the other reviews and with such a ratio of positive to negative</li>
            <li> For those having trouble cleaning them, try e.l.f brush shampoo mixed with anti-bacterial soap and they should look brand new.</li>
            <li> They do hold make up very well, and they are quite small.</li>
            <li> I usually use Real Techniques or EcoTools but it started adding up after a while.</li>
            <li> I have a different set that are not nearly as soft.</li>
            <li> the brush bristles are too flat.</li>
            <li> i feel like the majority of the brushes are really flat, and i pufer my brushes to be a lil fuller and fluffyer</li>
            <li> I think anyone wanting a good set of brushes would not be disappointed in these...and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty easy to please and have a hard time finding things wrong with product.  </li>
            <li> I had a few of the larger brush heads fall right off a few times after use.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that they are a little too soft and not dense</li>
            <li> The set cost less than I normally spend on a single brush and</li>
            <li> Also all of the eyemakeup brushes are FLAT!</li>
            <li> the only thing about this is that i took sooo long to get shipped out to me!</li>
            <li> And bad, so I feel a bit far.&lt;br /&gt;Ships fast is fortunate.</li>
            <li> Bought my girlfriend two whole brush sets from mac last year and bought her these this year thinking maybe she would like at least like one or two brushes out of the 22.</li>
            <li> I like the versatility in sizes and angles, but I can only use a couple of the brushes for confident use... disappointing.</li>
            <li> some off the brushes hair started to come off after three day use not impressed cute color though not as pink as I thought</li>
            <li> The stippling brush is not nearly dense enough and the bristles are just too long and &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; to have any practical use.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only cause it white and pink</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and fluffy, I&#x27;ve used them several times and none of the hair has come out of any of them.</li>
            <li> Came coated in a weird kind of dusty film that I could have done without but for their price they were decent.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, but the ones that need to be firm are without feeling like I&#x27;m raking my face.</li>
            <li> this brushes are very soft has everything I need for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> I have actually used every single one of these except for the fan brushes.</li>
            <li> I like the brush set, but I&#x27;m constantly gluing the brush part back onto the wood, it&#x27;s pretty irritating.</li>
            <li> One thing i have to say is the bag it came in has a faint smell of paint which doesnt affect the brushes i just washed mine with baby shampoo and its fine.</li>
            <li> I do not know if they are better than other ones because I have never owned expensive make up brushes, but when I go to stores like sephora and touch the brushes they sell there and then touch the ones I bought.</li>
            <li> Still soft to the touch, no smelly brushes, no hair falling out, and the pink is still pink!</li>
            <li> Be open minded and you can use some brushes for other uses than they are intended, for example I packed on a crease color with a small \\&quot;eyeshadow brush\\&quot; and blended it out gently with the fan brush.</li>
            <li> Be open minded and you can use some brushes for other uses than they are intended, for example I packed on a crease color with a small \\&quot;eyeshadow brush\\&quot; and blended it out gently with the fan brush.</li>
            <li> I hardly use much make-up but learning Estitition work .</li>
            <li> They do not pick up product very well, which makes it hard to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although these brushes are very cute, I was extremely disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> it feels too much like plastic, not nice at all to do your make up.</li>
            <li> Some brushes are totally useless, but it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra to send it back.</li>
            <li> Also, when i first opened them, the pink bag was folded nicely, no cracks, or  rips.</li>
            <li> The case looks the same, but the brushes are like a dark faded red...</li>
            <li> The brush material seems to be on the cheaper side, and obviously synthetic, but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> but I paid for pink and white.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional make up artist</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take too long to arrive</li>
            <li> However, the smaller ones (that I assume are eyeshadow brushes) feel thicker and harder at the tips, it feels like it&#x27;s poking your eyes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to people who do not expect to have a long use out of this product</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothered me was the pink bag/holder they come in smells horrible..like chemicals.</li>
            <li> the pink bag does 😩😩 that&#x27;s the only thing ion like i</li>
            <li> and I just got it, not too long ago.</li>
            <li> Next time I will shed out a few extra bucks for a different brand.</li>
            <li> I had to wait too long.</li>
            <li> I personally dont like pink</li>
            <li> They are the softest brushes I have seen in a long time.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot there not to firm or to soft, the case did smell a bit causing the brushes to smell but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only to be expected.  </li>
            <li> so i cant tell you about long term use</li>
            <li> The &#x27;&#x27;handles&#x27;&#x27; were really long and probly not intended for self use.</li>
            <li> (sometimes several times s a day), and the pouch they come in has been sturdy (with no unusual scent).</li>
            <li> On the face brushes the bristles are too long and flimsy</li>
            <li> My daughter likes them simply cause they are pink...</li>
            <li> The reason I wrote satisfied is because, when I received my package and finally opened it, the brush at the end with the little comb and the little bristles was completely broken.</li>
            <li> most of the brushes were broken and some missing but other</li>
            <li> The little square brush is for tight lining your lashes, where you pack on gel eyeliner right into your lash line for dark, luscious lashes.</li>
            <li> That was the first thing I did when I took it out of the package because of all the other negative reviews about the smell.</li>
            <li> the ONLY little complaint I would have is when I first got them in, they smelt like paint</li>
            <li> Also some of the big brushes are too long and way too soft and that makes it really hard to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like the brushes that I&#x27;m actually using out of this set.</li>
            <li> but does not apply like other brushes such as elf, mac, sephora</li>
            <li> Would love to try sigma brushes but too expensive!</li>
            <li> My only problem is that some of the brush tips fell off when I was unwrapping them but with a little glue and force it goes back on.</li>
            <li> They smell a little weird when you get them, but that&#x27;s more the case then</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Wait For Them To Dry</li>
            <li> These brushes were awful, but they really weren&#x27;t amazing either.</li>
            <li> I also tossed the brush roll into the washer with a load of towels and hung it up to dry.</li>
            <li> After I washed them &amp; let them air dry the smell went away.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set late saturday night and it arrived early tuesday morning with regular shipping!!!</li>
            <li> When you get it, it needs to be left open for a few hours to let the &#x27;womderful&#x27; smell out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had a single issue with the brush roll at all.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because they were a bit stiff and there arent really blending or fluffy brushes.</li>
            <li> They are soft and very little bristle loss.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re too soft and don&#x27;t hold the makeup well, and after you use them it&#x27;s hard to get them back to their pink color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect amazing brushes cause you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue or complaint is that some of the brushes were broken as I detailed above.</li>
            <li> I have brushes from all brands including a very expensive and famous brand whose powder brush sheds like a cat..</li>
            <li> they apply absolutely no product to your face and on the eye brushes the bristles were also too long</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are a little hard bristled at first</li>
            <li> the handles came a loose .</li>
            <li> some of the tops do come loose and come off eventually.</li>
            <li> I Had No Issues With The Heads Coming Loose From The Handles.</li>
            <li> Plus it helped with any loose bristles.</li>
            <li> One or two have since become loose on the stick, but I&#x27;ve traveled and used them quite a bit between the time I purchased them and now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is a little stiff but it may just be because they are brand new!</li>
            <li> Only down fall was</li>
            <li> The only down side is that they do not include a list of what each brush is for so you have to figure it out yourself</li>
            <li> Not high end quality</li>
            <li> The brushes are very VERY soft, and because of that can be hard for product to be picked up (the face brushes).</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers have said that there are quite a few of the same brush in slightly different sizes, but I took a chance and got these anyway.  </li>
            <li> The only thing was that when i first got them they smelled really weird</li>
            <li> No difference between these and super expensive ones.</li>
            <li> the foundation/ blush brush the set comes with is very ineffective and the bristles are weak.</li>
            <li> im so normally not about pink</li>
            <li> I read every single review before getting these because I was just so iffy!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about buying since it was only 13 dollars</li>
            <li> The only thing is that maybe like 2 or 3 brushes had little hairs out.</li>
            <li> The face brushes pick up little product and are not dense enough.</li>
            <li> Do not like that all the little brushes are practically the same shape and density.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone who would use them a little or alot.</li>
            <li> she uses them all the time she is the quiet the little makeup artist by the way she is 11</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical because they were cheap</li>
            <li> The only thing that does smell a little funky is the pink case it comes with.</li>
            <li> there hard and not round.</li>
            <li> Then if you send it back you hardly get your money back because of shipping.</li>
            <li> to get it today because I don&#x27;t want to wait until Monday.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s taken sooooooooooooooooooo long!!!</li>
            <li> They are so soft and finally, no more black loose bristles on my face.</li>
            <li> Truthfully it was not that bad.</li>
            <li> and the bag isnt that cute either and smells like plastic really bad.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that the eye shadow brushes do not work well with Urban Decay shadows.....</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-cute pink leather bag</li>
            <li> Before I purchased these pink brushes I read all the reviews that had been posted</li>
            <li> I am not a professional make-up artist so I am only judging based on an average everyday use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They also came sooner than expected</li>
            <li> But the pink bag?</li>
            <li> so they are not perfect but they are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE THE BRUSHES ARE PINK &amp;</li>
            <li> (The carrying case is made out of faux pink leather type material.)</li>
            <li> it is pink</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> only negative I have with this product is the fact that it&#x27;s missing a couple of vital brushes from the set, and</li>
            <li> The pink set I received did not look like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> but also the brushes are not what I expected I do use them but not like what I wanted them for.</li>
            <li> you have to push harder to get the makeup on the brush.</li>
            <li> I spent 10x the money on else where.</li>
            <li> It came wrapped in a pink holder.</li>
            <li> was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I received all 22 pink tipped brushes.</li>
            <li> I guess, it&#x27;s a bit harder to pick up the product.</li>
            <li> but then again who wants to receive broken brushes..</li>
            <li> but I gave it a few sprays of perfume and hung it outside</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off this item came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> it cause it was pink</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in this pink carry case.</li>
            <li> These brushes I cleaned just before use and some strains have already fallen apart not much</li>
            <li> I admit that the chose them because of the color (so much PINK).  </li>
            <li> There are a few brushes that are very similar in size and shape</li>
            <li> They are pink and the makeup products discolor them which doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the pink bag</li>
            <li> Just leave it open to air out for a few days</li>
            <li> but as I began to use the big fluffy brush the hairs would continuously fall out.</li>
            <li> but they are PINK</li>
            <li> I ended up using about 4-5 of these brushes out of the entire set for my everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they come in a pink pouch thing where it had a compartment for each brush.</li>
            <li> (they still came before the estimated date) which could be expected since they were shipped from another country.</li>
            <li> a little hint use baby shampoo to wash and hangupside down to dry thats with any brushes and they will last.</li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s make it clear that just because i&#x27;m not picky doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t have standards.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones are a bit stiff but they do the work.</li>
            <li> The only brushes that aren&#x27;t stiff and work well is the blush brush and the powder brush.</li>
            <li> Its just like the same brushes over and over again they are stiff and would never work for eye shadow brushes at all.</li>
            <li> although not all of them badly shed, the main ones that i use do, so now the whole pack is just wrapped up on my makeup counter because i cant use them..</li>
            <li> I use them every single day and would recommend them to any novice makeup artist!!</li>
            <li> Whenever I clean my brushes, thoroughly, they still look dirty.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday however there is not really a fluffy blending eye shadow brush :/</li>
            <li> But if your expecting anything more than crappy pink brushes you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I first opened them, there was a a slight weird plastic smell to it, but I just washed the case and brushes with soap and let them air dry</li>
            <li> Also if the ferrel comes off the handle big deal, just paint on a little nail polish &amp; push those suckers back on, they will stay on after that.hat</li>
            <li> Also if the ferrel comes off the handle big deal, just paint on a little nail polish &amp; push those suckers back on, they will stay on after that.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that one of the brushes came off the base, but it was an easy fix.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that there really no good eye shadow blending brush in this kit and the big powder brush is a little too fluffy and not dense enough to apply powder or foundation.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I received these brushes the other day</li>
            <li> and i had noticed there were some paint marks that had gotten on the pink metal!</li>
            <li> Other than that, no biggie.</li>
            <li> just like any other set of brushes some of them shed</li>
            <li> the only problem that one of the brushes was a little squeezed and when i pulled it out the brush was a little out of place..</li>
            <li> it extremely unfortunate and disappointing because they are so soft and its an adorable set</li>
            <li> I should have used caution when other reviews mentioned this.</li>
            <li> I compared it to my other brushes and</li>
            <li> My other brush set</li>
            <li> I was looking for in all and one set and was skeptical at first, I no longer am.</li>
            <li> I had to wash a couple of times before due to lingering smell...</li>
            <li> has a ton of brushes all extremely well kept.</li>
            <li> The other downside is I wish they were labeled what brush is to be used for what.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brush sets and they have shed all over my face everytime.</li>
            <li> the big fan brush just fell of the handle was not pleased</li>
            <li> Other than that i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> but I would not call it &amp;#34;repetitive&amp;#34; as a couple other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any on and to the other reviews that say it sticks,</li>
            <li> And to my surprise I couldn&#x27;t smell anything like the other reviewers talked about.</li>
            <li> I was looking for firm brushes not soft.  </li>
            <li> i had these brushes for several months, and i usually dont write reviews but for this one i just had to.</li>
            <li> This proceeded to happen with about 4 other brushes.</li>
            <li> and she just loves makeup, they do take a little bit of time to dry when you wash them</li>
            <li> Yes, they are soft, but only the face brushes, the eye brushes are too stiff and thin.</li>
            <li> The bag did come with a strong pain scent, but it went away after a day or 2 and it wasn&#x27;t as bad as the people who reviewed it made it to be.</li>
            <li> and they looked cheap also the pink bag so ugly.</li>
            <li> I was going to give it as a gift, but decided it was not only too big of a set but also poor quality.  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for and so far it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> but there not very full</li>
            <li> but it seems a few of the little pots of eye shadow aren&#x27;t glued down properly</li>
            <li> however, most of the brushes are too stiff to use and have a bad smell I just can&#x27;t get rid of regardless of the amounts of time I wash them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a couple months or so and use them everyday and have yet to loose a bristle.</li>
            <li> The only down side was one the the brushes were broken, I had to re-glue, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now, doing heavy theatrical drag makeup looks, and I&#x27;ve had little to no bristle loss - there is nothing more annoying than having to pick a lost bristle out of your foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also I put a little hair gel on my fan brush while it was wet to make it stiffer</li>
            <li> Also I put a little hair gel on my fan brush while it was wet to make it stiffer</li>
            <li> my fan brush was slightly bent due to it being wrapped up.</li>
            <li> The other half were duplicates in size/shape or I had no use for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-the leather makes it hard to put the brushes back in and take out&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can say that 70% of the brushes fell apart and I had a hard time gluing them back together.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes were way to hard.</li>
            <li> My brushes came and they looked sooooo cute until i pulled them out and half the brushes were broken!!!</li>
            <li> Bad quality， and look cheap.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH WHAT I PAYED FOR...</li>
            <li> The fishy smell, at least for me, was really not a big deal.</li>
            <li> The bag still has a faint odor, which is a shame because I really wanted to keep my brushes in it.</li>
            <li> These are not worth the price.</li>
            <li> People complained that they didn&#x27;t know what to use the big fan brush for.</li>
            <li> I wish they came with an eyeshadow blending brush, but that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money for it</li>
            <li> The average size of all the brushes is about 7 INCHES.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft and some were broken.</li>
            <li> So, other than that , i give this set a 5 star!</li>
            <li> Its really shocking but its true!!!</li>
            <li> Although, my large fan brush got packaged terribly, it got smushed and still isn&#x27;t back to normal.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got these in on time and lemme tell you, I WAS WAITING For bad smell of the bag and brushes to lose hair after swiping thru a couple of time and</li>
            <li> I have seen other reviews that mention that the case has a smell and mine did have a chemical smell, but it has gone away after a few days.</li>
            <li> all of them are the same texture the fluffy brush is hard like all the eye brushes but the color and everything else</li>
            <li> However, the makeup doesn&#x27;t wash off the brushes &amp; I have to apply a couple times, because half of it stays on the brush.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for less than six months and ALL of them are coming apart.</li>
            <li> My brushes broke in half....</li>
            <li> yes they do have an odd smell to them, which i read on the reviews and understood because they are in plastic</li>
            <li> and I had them for less than a week.</li>
            <li> comparable to brushes i purchased previously for over $40.</li>
            <li> I noticed they did have the odd smell everyone else commented on</li>
            <li> Shipping and handling was half the price of the gift.</li>
            <li> They would leave black pieces of bristles all over my face.</li>
            <li> Have had this less than a month and three brushes have already broke.  </li>
            <li> It had a slight smell to it, but what do you expect, it&#x27;s not supposed to smell like flowers, it just smelt like rubber which the case is made out of.</li>
            <li> Requires weekly cleaning, they get dirty very fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who is only 6 but completely obsessed with regular everyday makeup as well as costume makeup.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not true</li>
            <li> I was tired of lending her my expensive brushes and having to clean them every time she used them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed but it was cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, they are very firm and pick up minimal amounts of product.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> x Little Point Brush&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> They sheaded a little when u take them out</li>
            <li> Some times it takes I little bit of pressure to pick up the powder from my eye shadow but nothing substantial.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> It gets stray hairs that can get product all over the lid.&lt;br /&gt;The little tools for the eyebrows and lashes work well.</li>
            <li> The brushes need a little &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; picking up the makeup...</li>
            <li> I like the brushes, I wish they were a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll handle a little stank.</li>
            <li> The mascara and eyebrow comber brush snapped off three weeks after I got it because my little sister tried to jerk it out of my hands.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these brushes, but disappointed when I opened them.  </li>
            <li> so they are a little bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> they feel a little flimsy but theyre is no shedding</li>
            <li> Little to no shedding hairs... for the amount of brushes and price, I would recommend to beginners and aspiring artist,...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smelly but endurable.</li>
            <li> The blush brush is a little softer but nothing like I thought.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed and apply makeup with little effort.</li>
            <li> With a little bit of a pull I got tops to pop off about 6</li>
            <li> I know that they&#x27;er synthetic, but the smell was a little over bearing.</li>
            <li> THIS ARE NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I would recommend if you were getting it for a little kid for there play makeup or something, but otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these Brushes for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> super soft and durable, however the bag smelled HORRIBLE, so I threw it out.</li>
            <li> The only concern is that some of the brushes that are supposed to be for eye shadows are way to hard and the shadow is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Granted, I know you def get what you pay for, and it&#x27;s too bad because the brushes themselves are actually quite soft.</li>
            <li> The thing that upset me was that when I got the package I was missing a brush and some of the plastic coverings were gone.</li>
            <li> I just tossed the bag out after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> is that I am missing a brush and 3 of them are brown.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bag there was a missing brush</li>
            <li> I use these brushes everyday</li>
            <li> The blush and bronzer brushes had a few strays that were falling off as well.  </li>
            <li> Just wish there would of been a round fluffy eye brush in the set</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money.</li>
            <li> A few of them broke off when I tried to use them.</li>
            <li> Nothing came missing or damaged, and they came well before they said they were going to which</li>
            <li> However, a fluffy eyeshadow brush could have completed the set</li>
            <li> but these are my everyday brushes and they do not become stained.</li>
            <li> She uses them everyday.  </li>
            <li> After A Few Days</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> There is not really a brush for liquid foundation though I wish there was, at least not like any of the ones I have ever had</li>
            <li> but it wears off after a few days.</li>
            <li> but it was missing one brush.</li>
            <li> I like My brushes but upon opening my package i noticed I was missing two brushes.</li>
            <li> Waste of my $$$.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had any trouble with shedding</li>
            <li> I use them everyday .</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I use them everyday and I recommend them to customers all the time.</li>
            <li> Some brushes broke a few times after they were used.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Brushes feel apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li> If your an everyday make up user this is NOT the set for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to wash your brushes before using them though - after I washed them and they dried they just smelled &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34</li>
            <li> ; - nothing offensive left behind.</li>
            <li> Will not fit into anything.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Three brushes were missing in the bag which is why im not giving it 5 stars, but the rest of the brushes are greatttt</li>
            <li> Although there were a few hairs coming out</li>
            <li> And the same thin with the brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now</li>
            <li> and I still use a few of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Bristles don&#x27;t come out of the brushes, however they do break within a few weeks of having them.</li>
            <li> fell apart after washing a few times.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not have the money to buy her a professional set from a company like Sigma or Mac, so I scoured Amazon until I happened upon this set.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> The rest was a waste, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> They were soft and they didn&#x27;t have a weird odor like some brushes.</li>
            <li> , i thought i was going to receive for another few days.</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes,but the case smelled horrible!!</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive stuff just to pay for the big if you can purchase same thing and pay less!!!</li>
            <li> I tried comparing it to other sites to help label them for personal use as I learned, but found it to be incredibly difficult.  </li>
            <li> my shadow brushes are a bit stiff but again...</li>
            <li> The  case does have a very slight odor</li>
            <li> , the small brushes like the shadow brush are too stiff and some maybe a little too chiseled.</li>
            <li> the brushes were very soft but they smelt horrible which didn&#x27;t bother me that much because they can be washed.</li>
            <li> so when i opened the brush kit for the first time the plastic brush roll smelt alittle bit but not to bad.</li>
            <li> So, if you are giving this product a bad review, you either got a defective product in which case you should contact the seller, or you didn&#x27;t wash the brushes first,</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as bad as when I first opened up the package.</li>
            <li> Although it kinda smells bad when you first get it..</li>
            <li> There are exactly as the picture, they don&#x27;t get ugly when you wash them.</li>
            <li> x Small Round Brush&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I wasted my time and money :s</li>
            <li> Save your money!!...unless ur buying for a little girl.!</li>
            <li> These are really low quality brushes, all the eye brushes are way too stiff and they smell kinda weird.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little hard to tell them all apart</li>
            <li> : same brush is definitely repeated, not very good for eyeshadow blending, smell is actually really, really bad</li>
            <li> they do shed, very little though.</li>
            <li> There might be very little fall outs</li>
            <li> but like I said VERY LITTLE.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t bother me much as it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> and I had to decide which was an eye vs. face (i.e., small concealer) brush.  </li>
            <li> although there is quite a few doubles! ..</li>
            <li> After purchasing a set of brushes that were too small for my needs, I decided to try these out.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if there is any fall out but will def update once I use them.</li>
            <li> I USUALLY WOULD BUY JUST ONE BRUSH FOR THAT PRICE</li>
            <li> And after washing the brushes, no more strays.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were a small size</li>
            <li> :/ :/</li>
            <li> I do not recommend you waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it swallows it up or what.</li>
            <li> I got these for my sister as a xmas gift this past year</li>
            <li> But the only thing wrong about them is that there was ONE brush missing!</li>
            <li> but I just shook them off and no more came out.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about getting them but decided to when I read the reviews, and I would definitely recomend this for my friends.</li>
            <li> When my brushes came in, the big blush brush had some weird sticky stuff on it.</li>
            <li> I did small tugs on the hairs</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually use too faced brushes and they call there brushes \\&quot;teddy bear hair\\</li>
            <li> They kept offering me a generous discount on my next purchase, and refused to aknowledge that my brushes were the wrong color, even when I sent a photo.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing that won&#x27;t fade a way after a few washes!</li>
            <li> use them everyday!</li>
            <li> I use these brushes everyday!</li>
            <li> the case is made of awful gross cheap material, and the smell of the brushes when I first got them was very bad.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes are hard and not easy to use.</li>
            <li> The brush set was sort of what I expected, the only downsides were it smelled really bad of paint, and the brush part of all of the brushes were all bent.</li>
            <li> not very good quality brushes</li>
            <li> i mean for people who is not an expert using makeup burshes , the case looks cheap and uggly, and it smells very bad.</li>
            <li> They are pretty but they are crap.</li>
            <li> Be warned though, these brushes are not ideal for harder make up.</li>
            <li> SInce using this product Ive had to do away with 1 brush due to it falling apart from cleansing, and now experincing a couple with loose heads due to coming unglued at the base....</li>
            <li> The eye brushes were very stiff and made applying eye makeup hard.</li>
            <li> While I was using these brushes every day, I didn&#x27;t force the brush against my skin too hard, it was all on the product.</li>
            <li> the bristles  are hard</li>
            <li> It Was like getting a bunch of hard Concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> The cosmetic makeup brush are too hard and</li>
            <li> are too hard</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so bad for professional  makeup</li>
            <li> I crazy glued the eyebrow brush back together.  </li>
            <li> only problem with these brushes is that you need crazy glue or any glue beside you when you get them.</li>
            <li> when I finally collected my package I immediately rushed opened it and pulled the bristles like crazy on each brush..</li>
            <li> but it was to late to cancel</li>
            <li> it still sheds no matter how delicate i am with it.</li>
            <li> it does come unglued or at least it happen to me but</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing dont leave a negative review.</li>
            <li> Just received these as a x mas gift for my daughter who is a make-up fanatic.</li>
            <li> by at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It still has a faint &amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34; smell as expected -</li>
            <li> (I know some reviewers said the pink went away after using it a few times from it getting dirty)</li>
            <li> only thing that was a surprise to me was that one of the brushes was dirty.</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t late package</li>
            <li> A lot of people complained about shedding</li>
            <li> the powder brushes don&#x27;t at least.</li>
            <li> Another complaint I have is I was billed and sent three of the sets.</li>
            <li> and the foundation brush started slowly coming out after about 5 months</li>
            <li> I wanted it for my lil sis to play with but even so 3 brushes were broken and 2 were missing</li>
            <li> I did detect a slight smell, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily consider it a bad odor, a little weird, it just smells like glue or plastic or something like that.</li>
            <li> I use my friends Mac brushes and they work just as well if not better!</li>
            <li> When I mean I can&#x27;t use these for anything at all</li>
            <li> I mean it.</li>
            <li> but I was highly disappointed when I open the package to find tinny little brushes that look totaly tinier than what it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I want to use them!</li>
            <li> Not sure if im going to even bother fixing them or throw them all out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other expensive makeup brushes and these ones</li>
            <li> The only thing i hated was how long it took toget here since the company ships from china</li>
            <li> it is very unfortunate to go through such a hassle for an order.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone serious about their makeup.</li>
            <li> These seriously rival my sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> nothing serious</li>
            <li> , I thought, &amp;#34;These have to be seriously</li>
            <li> The sizes of the brushes where too big and impossible to handle.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> I absolutely CAN&#x27;T say anything bad about this product at all !</li>
            <li> I got them because there were good reviews, but the quality is really bad, some of the brushes were detached from the sticks and the smell was terrible as well...don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> but when i got them i was shocked, so i ordered same set for my sister for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 of these and the brushes are no good.  </li>
            <li> Not good at all</li>
            <li> Not a good brush set.</li>
            <li> From reading the reviews I had expected smelly, sparse, brushes that shed like mad.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t come with a blending brush :(</li>
            <li> At least not to me!</li>
            <li> when i first opened the packaging i just got the biggest whiff of nasty chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality, broke in my hand on first use..</li>
            <li> They make It very hard to blend out or softn a color.</li>
            <li> I mean 22 is a lot!</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m a little afraid they may fall out and break</li>
            <li> Not a good buy the brushes are very soft and do not pick up any product I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had worse.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow comb/brush combo brush head was broken from the stem upon arrival but the rest were fully intact.  </li>
            <li> for the quality of the brushes, I have no experienced any shedding whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It really annoyed me so I had to pitch it</li>
            <li> And their kinda thin .</li>
            <li> One of the brushes arrived broken.</li>
            <li> When I opened them my whole room smelled of this really disgusting plastic smell.</li>
            <li> dayum brushes kept breaking and some came broken</li>
            <li> I thought it was gonna be like elf cosmetics&#x27; brushes, but no it was way worse.</li>
            <li> When I opened it up one of the eye shadows were broken and had gotten all over all of the others and even all over of the palette itself</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any shedding of the bristles and the case is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> The Only Thing Is ,When i Receive My Brushes 4 Of Them Were broken Off The Base Of The Brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I like the packaging and pink color. :(</li>
            <li> and I would purchase another set of brushes but not right now because I&#x27;m disappointed that 1 of the 22 were broken.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews because it&#x27;s simply not true.  </li>
            <li> the only mad thing is that it smelt terrible when arrived (i just opened the case and positioned it in front of a fan and the smell went away after a few hours)</li>
            <li> These are cheesy plastic brushes.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I had to glue all of the brushes to the sticks.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be tricked because they are not as expensive as sigma</li>
            <li> Anyone who buys them won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really go wrong with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t just one or two random pieces, it was a lot..</li>
            <li> i was wrong.</li>
            <li> Felt nicer than a lot of my expensive brush sets.</li>
            <li> It was so difficult to pick from all of the brushes online</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are not as well made as i had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t order again, sorry.</li>
            <li> weird smell</li>
            <li> They did have a really weird smell to them when I opened them.</li>
            <li> So, when I was looking at these brushes, I was sooo skeptical - even after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;WORRIES-&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> It was total crap!</li>
            <li> It was just stupid and a waste of time getting these.</li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive brushes that don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was skeptical as hell, but I decided to order them anyway.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not perfect though.</li>
            <li> When they admitted they sent it to the wrong address,&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes smell a ill.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, didn&#x27;t like them...</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t glued, we had to glue about 10 brushes, very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Very poor customer service.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very thin.</li>
            <li> AND THE LIQUID BLEND BRUS WAS NO GOOD :(</li>
            <li> Also one of the brushes appeared to be dirty</li>
            <li> but they will do if you dont want to pay the crazy sigma price for their overpriced brushes</li>
            <li> Brushes are also tender.&lt;br /&gt;However, in the case stinks.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and the brushes are well made but you might want to wash them every month they do look dirty</li>
            <li> They shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still a disappointment.</li>
            <li> These were not too small, but I was very disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> so the blending was terrible and also pick up very little product.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I could air them out and the smell would go away, wrong!</li>
            <li> Anyways, it&#x27;s now February, and the brushes are very mediocre.</li>
            <li> but what i dont like i dont want them to get them dirty :(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to receive 3 broken brushes.. very disappointed that happened.</li>
            <li> After taking off the plastic and letting them air out a bit tho, its not as bad</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t.the smell wasent bad though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m warning whoever buys these brushes now how bad they are.</li>
            <li> I think the people who have had bad experiences with that are getting defective brushes, or something.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> , i heard bad reviews on them and i was doubting  them</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad just smells like rubber.</li>
            <li> It was really bad smell</li>
            <li> - $20.00 is like paying $1.00 for each brush, which isn&#x27;t bad at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the people who were writing reviews about how badly the case and brushes smelled were over exaggerating.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> they have a bad smell coming out the bag</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as bad as people say.</li>
            <li> When i got the set they did smell like paint REALLY BAD</li>
            <li> and I feel really bad about the gift I purchased....</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as bad, just wash them and</li>
            <li> I consider myself a make-up guru, and was shocked when the brushes all came apart.</li>
            <li> They also smelled very badly, I ended up throwing them away because they were useless.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t get tangled are bad but one brush sheds :(</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed by an amazon product.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> And they aren&#x27;t crazy out of my budget!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed of the product.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t blend any eyeshadow at all disappointed :&lt;(</li>
            <li> I opened up the package and was immediately disappointed.</li>
            <li> These brushes by crazy cart blew too faced out of the water!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you crazy cart!</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t want to start paying taxes on line shopping. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that there was no guide to tell me what each brush was</li>
            <li> Also, the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is crap quality, doesn&#x27;t hold the powder in it and falls off before I can get it on my face.</li>
            <li> HATED HATED HATED the smell of the case.</li>
            <li> i simply hated it</li>
            <li> no brushes for blending or anything... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just horrible I wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the awful smell of the carrying case that others mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Awful I thought it was gonna be amayzing</li>
            <li> But I must say that this is probably the worst thing I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Horrible brushes.</li>
            <li> Ok...I was always sceptical about ordering brush sets online as my 1st 18 pc set which I paid 20 usd for was a disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are horrible.</li>
            <li> But the smell was HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> The brushes wouldn&#x27;t wash off the make-up residue on it and that are just TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> but it wasnt horrible</li>
            <li> This brush set is awful !</li>
            <li> The case does come in smelling awful</li>
            <li> Terrible brushes.</li>
            <li> these are the worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever worked with.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my sister, but As soon as I saw it, boy do I want one bad!!!!</li>
            <li> The lack of variety of eye brushes is just horrible; They are either concealer-like brushes or eyeliner brushes.</li>
            <li> The smell was so bad it stunk my room!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible!!!</li>
            <li> FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Mymakeupbrush.com has IMPOSSIBLY TERRIBLE customer service.</li>
            <li> I hate them !</li>
            <li> however the roll had a horrible smell</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brushes are vey soft, but they fall apart super quick.  I only have about half of them that I was able to save with some hot glue.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and because many people wrote about the bag smelling I immediately took it out of the package to air it out before giving this to my sister for her birthday. It didn&#x27;t smell as badly as many people made it seem but yes it did smell a bit. The brushed were really soft and the color was really pretty!</li>
            <li> I love it.. But I don&#x27;t like the smell of the case... It smells like gas... But over all.. Worth the price</li>
            <li> The brushes in this set are soft and fine for the price. The only concern is that some of the brushes that are supposed to be for eye shadows are way to hard and the shadow is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this one is worth it. There&#x27;s some kind of glue or tape on the brushes that make them hard and unusable. I don&#x27;t know if this was a manufacturing mistake or not, but it&#x27;s kind of ridiculous. All the material is really cheap, brushes don&#x27;t even apply make up properly. Really, you&#x27;re better off getting a product that actually works. Plus there was a really foul smell that came with the brushes. Not a new one, but a really gross, old smell. Anyways I feel like I was ripped off even for the price we bought it at.</li>
            <li> This brush set has all you need in a nice compact case, I highly recommend it as a nice gift too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a person who might wear make-up once a week, these brushes will work for you. I really just wanted the case but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to have extra brushes. Some of the bristles were sticking out or too long which would not be a good thing for those serious about applying make-up but for me, I just pulled the strays out or cut them down. The brushes are soft and pretty sturdy. The case/brushes do have a smell to them. Reminds me of paint. Overall, love the case and the brushes should last me a while but that&#x27;s just because I don&#x27;t wear make-up often.</li>
            <li> it came before expected and was exactly as described and i love it. now to watch youtube and learn how to use each of them</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t fully used these brushes yet, but they are so pretty, and the bristles are really soft. Only down fall was my fan brush was slightly bent due to it being wrapped up.</li>
            <li> find my info on : http://www.ebay.com/itm/190687490394?ssPageName&#x3D;STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid&#x3D;p3984.m1439.l2649&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 x Powder Brush&lt;br /&gt;9 x Eyeshadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;1 x Eyeshadow Smudge Brush&lt;br /&gt;2 x Fan Brush&lt;br /&gt;2 x Little Point Brush&lt;br /&gt;1 x Eyebrow Comb  Brush&lt;br /&gt;1 x Eyelash Brush&lt;br /&gt;1 x Small Round Brush&lt;br /&gt;1 x Eyeliner Brush&lt;br /&gt;1 x Lip Brush&lt;br /&gt;1 x Oblique Eyebrow Brush&lt;br /&gt;1 x Brush Case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to receive them, but they were 14 dollars, so killer price! If you look around, you find what theyre used for, and look at some tutorials on youtube. I CAN&#x27;T WAIT FOR THEM :3</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived in perfect order.  They work perfectly for blending and doing a variety of makeup.  I have used them mostly for heavier makeup, such as theater and costume work.  It&#x27;s a hobby of mine and these are perfect and extremely affordable.  The only real complaint is that the glue smell was rather strong when they first arrived.  It was fixed easily enough by leaving the brushes out for a day or so on my counter top.  Other than that, these are just wonderful!</li>
            <li> When I got this brush set I had no idea what to do with all the brushes. There was such a big variety to choose from. I loved the color. These brushes are very soft. They pick up just enough color on the brush. The only con that I found on these brushes was that they smelt like fresh paint when I got them. Which was not bad. I usually do not mind that smell. All in all these brushes are amazing and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> SO GREAT! I love them! so much better than wasting 50 bucks on 12 brushes  from Mac. I use my friends Mac brushes and they work just as well if not better! Super genital on skin and a great gift to a makeup loverrrr :)</li>
            <li> This was so worth the money! Brushes are shipped fast and are packaged great. The only thing I noticed is that some of the smaller brushes are almost exactly the same. No crease brush is included either</li>
            <li> They dont hold any makeup, there too soft to use. I recommend not to buy it, unless you want them for display.</li>
            <li> all the brushes are the same, dont buy this if you&#x27;re looking for variety, the only ones I ended up using are the blush and the foundatione ones... I should have bought a cheaper pack with fewer brushes...</li>
            <li> I use these brushes for eye shadow,blush,bronzer, eye liner, my brows, I just love this product no doubts about it</li>
            <li> It might differ vendor to vendor, but when this thing came in, it wreaked of spray paint. I had to wash the brushes and case 3x AND febreezed the cased to get it to stop stinking. Brushes are pretty good. But it doesn&#x27;t really have any nice brushes for brow bone/highlight. A lot of brushes but kinda missed the ones i wanted. This set will basically be my crap set, my mac ones will be saved for more important uses.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They are big and soft and do just what I expect them to do.&lt;br /&gt;However, some of the smaller brushes are basically the same and I had to decide which was an eye vs. face (i.e., small concealer) brush.  I wish they would have had a name or number to them, but the larger brushes are what I use the most and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> these brushes are gorgeous no doubt.&lt;br /&gt;However, they are very firm and pick up minimal amounts of product.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for great brushed for eyeshadow this is NOT it.&lt;br /&gt;Will not be purchasing ever again or recommending.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, the only complaint i have is that they should include a guide of what each brush is and what they are used for.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and works great. These brushes are nice and soft. They look great and are well organized. Would be a great gift.</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazingg. They are so soft. Everyone is complaining about the smell, but all it smells like is plastic, and it doesn&#x27;t  bother me. You dont even notice the smell unless you put your face right up to the pink bag and try to smell it.</li>
            <li> This is a big set, which is what I wanted, so no complaints there. However, the makeup doesn&#x27;t wash off the brushes &amp; I have to apply a couple times, because half of it stays on the brush.</li>
            <li> havent used them yet, but they look fun &amp; pretty. I hardly use much make-up but learning Estitition work .</li>
            <li> I like these brushes so far! The item is VERY pink, brushes are soft, and theres a lot of them.... although there is quite a few doubles! .. no angle brushes, no contouring brushes,</li>
            <li> These are cute and useful. Some look the same. Makes me feel like multiple of same brush but they are nice</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying this item and still chose this over the 4x more expensive similar kits at stores like Sephora and Ulta. It took them awhile to get here, and when I opened them i did notice the fairly strong chemical type smell a lot of people had mentioned smelling. After taking off the plastic and letting them air out a bit tho, its not as bad and I&#x27;m siure will be gone or fade with a wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didnt realize is now cheap the pink bag looks. It&#x27;s a shiny, pleather feeling material. I just bought it for the brushes, so I will probably toss or donate the bag, but if the bag is a major factor in your purchase decision, I would thing twice about getting these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are nice and full and fluffy, I was looking to get this kit to replace a lot of my worn brushes as well as expand the brush options I had before, and this definitely does the trick. The handles are pretty big in comparison to my other brushes in terms of the diameter of the handle. The only thing that would make these better would be if the handles had labels on them such as fan, crease, etc.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly. Brushes are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;-came in good condition&lt;br /&gt;-brushes werent damaged&lt;br /&gt;-soft brushes&lt;br /&gt;-cute pink leather bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-smelled&lt;br /&gt;-repetitive brushes just different shape/size&lt;br /&gt;-bristles were falling off&lt;br /&gt;-the leather makes it hard to put the brushes back in and take out&lt;br /&gt;-no number or name for each brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL , the brushes are ok .  I recommend them for beginners(:</li>
            <li> The brushes are okay. They&#x27;re really soft and some were broken. Overall, they&#x27;re pretty good</li>
            <li> Great quality, brushes are really soft and the product is great for traveling I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to every girl who enjoys wearing make up! it is very beautiful and it looks even better in person! overall very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased these pink brushes I read all the reviews that had been posted, so I was kinda \\&quot;on the fence\\&quot; as to what to expect. Now I am VERY glad I purchased these. They are great!!! The brushes are soft and the handles are long and sturdy. I am not a professional make-up artist so I am only judging based on an average everyday use. So far they have held up and have not shed any bristles. There are so many different sizes and shapes to chose from I can&#x27;t imagine not having the right brush to do the job. I simply love them and will buy another set for my daughter for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;The roll-up pouch does smell of \\&quot;strong plastic\\&quot; but nothing I haven&#x27;t experienced with other products.I think anyone wanting a good set of brushes would not be disappointed in these...and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> for me they are really really good. i love the color and the work really well. i would buy it again</li>
            <li> Love these super soft, affordable and cute will definitely recommend them for anybody, only thing was that most of the brushes didn&#x27;t have the different angles I mainly needed but overall good product!!!</li>
            <li> there super cute and not so bad for $20 i just hate the brush holder but there pretty good i guess</li>
            <li> Brush ends all fell off, need to be glued back on.  Otherwise, the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOODNESS!!! Can I just explain how happy I was when they came in. I was so ecstatic!!! The whole set of brushes work really well!! Great quality!!!! I absolutely love them! The brush case is so cute! The only thing is that it has that plastic smell. I aired it out for a day/overnight and it was just fine. I am soooo happy with this purchase, and I think anyone who purchases these will be too!!!!!</li>
            <li> this brushes are so beautiful!! and they are so soft and high quality! happy to bought them!! i never thought that this would be so good!!</li>
            <li> The bag smells but I love the brushes .I&#x27;ve never have seen a brush so soft.&lt;br /&gt;It easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> These cosmetic makeup brushes are very soft. I washed them and the bristles did not fall out.  They are good quality brushes.  I love the color and the pink bag, The tote makes it much easier to carry in my makeup bag. The brushes are very secure in the tote.  The brushes are vey functional. They allow me to apply my makeup flawlessly.  Love love love these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERYYYY NICE WHEN I GOT IT THREW THE MAIL BUT THE HAIR STARTED FALLING OFF AND THE LIQUID BLEND BRUS WAS NO GOOD :( NOT WORTH WHAT I PAYED FOR...</li>
            <li> I gave this as a B-Day Gift for my sister who loves makeup but only had two brushes LOL. She was soo happy she&#x27;s been wearing makeup everyday feeling so professional with her brushes. And she has sensitive skin but these brushes don&#x27;t irritate it AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li> The so called professional cosmetic brushes dont work the bristles are to soft and fall out. Just horrible I wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product the brushes do an amazing job! they are super soft and are very gentle on skin. i love the way the eyeshadow brushes apply. Overall great product for a great price HIGHLY RECOMEND.</li>
            <li> Had very good brushes inside just stunk when you got it</li>
            <li> This brush kit is great. Just like the picture. Great material on the bristles and very cute.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for the different variety of brushes I saw in the picture. There may be a lot of them bu save your money and just buy 3 or 4 basic professional brushes. These brushes are mostly that sane brush over a iver some in different sizes. The big blush/ powder brush broke the first time I used it. The blush &amp; countoring brush are so soft you can&#x27;t pick up any product. Then lastly all of the eyeshadow brushes are flat... Seriously not one rounded or fluffy eyeshadow brush in the whole bunch! They make It very hard to blend out or softn a color.</li>
            <li> There plastic .and there hard and not round. I thought they would be nice but they weren&#x27;t.the smell wasent bad though.</li>
            <li> These pink makeup brushes are very high quality, don&#x27;t shed, and apply makeup as evenly as posssible! They come in a cute pink carrying case which makes them so much easier to carry along with you, didn&#x27;t take long to be shipped</li>
            <li> Some of my brushes broke right after I unpacked them, but I only needed a few new brushes, it&#x27;s not alright to waste your money on broken brushes, but if you want to these will be perfect for you. Shipping was fast; don&#x27;t expect 22 working brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, and true to color. Each is wrapped in plastic, and the bigger brushes have protective covers. The brush material seems to be on the cheaper side, and obviously synthetic, but that was to be expected. Because of the synthetic fibers, not all the brushes hold makeup as well as others. They&#x27;re hard to clean which is a shame because I loved the beautiful white and pink combo. Overall, I think this is worth buying, and would make a good addition to any brush collection.</li>
            <li> I really like this set...it&#x27;s so cute and the brushes are very soft and durable for the most part..my only disappointment is it could of had certain brushed that would of made the set better and the foundation brush started slowly coming out after about 5 months but other then that good price</li>
            <li> if you really love makeup and doing a great job, these are not for you. These are cheesy plastic brushes. I thought they would be great soft brushes because i read previous comments. Some folks have no idea about brushes i guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about a month and they&#x27;re still so unbelievably soft and work great! You get several different brushes for a low price and each brush is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a set of brushes that were too small for my needs, I decided to try these out. These were not too small, but I was very disappointed with the quality. Three of my brushes were not attached to their handles. I was able to glue them back together, but I should not have to do that. The brushes are very soft &amp; so far I have not noticed much shedding. I really like the color of the white &amp; pink bristles. The storage bag is very nice and sturdy. As far as performance, the brushes are decent, especially for the price. I&#x27;ve had better and I&#x27;ve had worse. My biggest issue or complaint is that some of the brushes were broken as I detailed above.</li>
            <li> I actually got this product before I was suppose to, so I&#x27;m happy about that. Yes, the brushes do have a paint kind of smell, but there sooo soft &amp;&#x27;d so far I&#x27;m loving what I purchased</li>
            <li> It was an okay purchase for me, but that was just preference. There were too many brushes for me to handle. But gave it to my sister and she loves it. She knows what each brushes are.</li>
            <li> The carrying case smelled like spray paint for weeks after purchase.  These brushes are good for beginners, but most of them would probably serve better as painting brushes.  Most are flat filbert style, which you only need so many of.  I do use a few of these brushes regularly, however, most of them have been thrown away.  The handles are not attached very strongly either.  I had a few of the larger brush heads fall right off a few times after use.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you are looking for a very versatile brush set, but would recommend if you are looking for a good value set for learning.</li>
            <li> I really like these! Not only are they really attractive to the eye, but they&#x27;re pretty good too. Some brushes are better than others, but overall they&#x27;re nice. The color is just what you see I&#x27;m the picture. The only thing is, they&#x27;re kinda hard to clean. Which is a shame since they&#x27;re so pretty.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves these.  She mostly loves the pink color.  LOL</li>
            <li> the brushes were very soft but they smelt horrible which didn&#x27;t bother me that much because they can be washed. The thing that upset me was that when I got the package I was missing a brush and some of the plastic coverings were gone. Also one of the brushes appeared to be dirty and I had not used them or even taken them out.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and cute. They sheaded a little when u take them out but once u wash the the promblem is gone. Although the case isnt very good.</li>
            <li> some off the brushes hair started to come off after three day use not impressed cute color though not as pink as I thought</li>
            <li> Great price for a realy good quality ,I told my friends and 2 off them got the set give them a try !!</li>
            <li> they could be used for something but not professionally I think they&#x27;re soft but feel plastic ish, I don&#x27;t like them I just taught they were pretty</li>
            <li> I wish there was a list of how each brush is supposed to be used. Other than that, I like the brushes that I&#x27;m actually using out of this set. I don&#x27;t think one person needs all of them. Good price though!</li>
            <li> I would say half of the brushes are decent.  The other half were duplicates in size/shape or I had no use for.  The brushes may need some fluffing when you get them.  The protective plastic smooshes them.  I just tossed the bag out after a few weeks.  Just better for me to store a different way.  The seller shipped them very fast.  Update 07/12/16: I think I ended up throwing away most of the brushes.  There are one or two that i have kept for cleaning up nail polish or dying my eyebrows.  They aren&#x27;t great for makeup.  Get BS-MALL brushes or others on Amazon instead.</li>
            <li> Love it! BEST AND CHEAPEST</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, and the color is cute! No hair came off and they work nicely. I loved them so much, I recommended them to two friends, who also bought them and loved them! 5/5 &lt;3</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, didn&#x27;t like them...I got them because there were good reviews, but the quality is really bad, some of the brushes were detached from the sticks and the smell was terrible as well...don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Big, fluffy, and super soft! I love these brushes. I&#x27;ve experienced very little shedding. :) I just wish there was a little bit more variety when it comes to the eyeshadow brushes (a blending brush would be awesome!) but of course I&#x27;m not going to count that against this review. The fishy smell, at least for me, was really not a big deal. The smell went away after the first wash.</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft but it smells like paint. Even the bag!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not the most good quality ones. there are some brushes that are similar in shaped .. wish there were blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to clean the brushes ..</li>
            <li> Come in tons of different brushes but some of it fall of after first use</li>
            <li> the brush heads arent as full as i had hoped or as the picture apeared. as far as the quality the brushes were what i expected for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so adorable!! and they work great ive used all of them and i havent had any issues the only thing is that it doesnt have a round eyeshadow brush but for the money you save from buying these you can buy one from somewhere else :)&lt;br /&gt;They also came sooner than expected</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about buying since it was only 13 dollars but I went a head anyways and I love them they are so soft and amazing I keep my brushes in a jar holder type thing so now I gotta find more that will hold all of them. I also order another one for my friend for her birthday in December! Also they arrived earlier than estimated</li>
            <li> This 22 piece set is adorable and very functional. The brushes are soft and pink. I&#x27;ve used them and they don&#x27;t seem to shed like many brushes that are this inexpensive. I love how there is every brush you could possibly need for your make-up including an eyebrow/lash brush. The roll up plastic case is also very durable and a shiny pink and its not cloth so the brushes aren&#x27;t going to fall out easily. There is structure. The stitching holds together nicely and is perfect for traveling as it is compact. The reason for the four stars is the smell of the set. Its a very strong odd plastic smell. It&#x27;s not pleasant but not disgusting. I put them in my bathroom cupboard and the next morning the whole cabinet smelled like Plastic.</li>
            <li> These brushes r simply heavenly I am very pleased with this product I cant think of anything to complain about!  Thumbs up to the price and the seller!</li>
            <li> they are ok to the price they are</li>
            <li> These are all face brushes. They all work really well and are dense. Most of the brushes are really similar, but in different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there were eyeshadow brushes!</li>
            <li> I have no clue what all the different brushes are. I&#x27;m sending the kit to my daughter, because she knows a little more on the subject. Would have been nice if they labeled the brushes.</li>
            <li> LOVING these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for eyeshadow brushes these are not it. But for the price these are great face brushes for foundation, concealer, contouring ect</li>
            <li> Okay so if you want the best brushes don&#x27;t buy these. The big buffer brushes and the foundation brushes are beautiful and soft and very good but the one for the eyes aren&#x27;t that good. Now it did reek BUT if you clean the (which you should) and the brush case, they will not smell anymore. I do recommend if you want to start and for the price they are very good.</li>
            <li> these brushes are so pretty and they are strong but all of them are the same texture the fluffy brush is hard like all the eye brushes but the color and everything else i love i only use some of the brushes</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush set for the price...they do shed, very little though. Did take two weeks for delivery, that was the only problem.</li>
            <li> Brush is too soft for powder or creams products. Leather case is nice expect mine was in okay condition and string was not sewed correctly. I put it as an okay for these brushes but not good enough. Too many of the brush were the same or similar</li>
            <li> absolutely.......totally worth it. the brushes are so much bigger than i thought and so many of them. i love it so thank you!</li>
            <li> It took almost a month just to receive my package. Came well packed and was in a cute pink leather carrier. When I open it the first thing I notice is that I am missing a brush and 3 of them are brown. Idc but I paid for pink and white. There is a strong smell but that&#x27;s common with most brushes. After cleaning them well the smell will go away. The brushes are soft. I didn&#x27;t get to use them yet so I am not sure if there is any fall out but will def update once I use them. You do get what you pay for. They are cute though! Would I recommend these? Prob not. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I love how this set looked, and it seemed to have some good reviews so I wanted to give it a try. However, I&#x27;m not impressed. The brushes are really soft, but the hairs continuously fall out while I&#x27;m using the brush, getting all over my face. They also don&#x27;t seem to work as well as brushes that you can purchase from Ulta.</li>
            <li> Very soft nice quality fine makeup brushes. I love them. The bigger brushes and the fine line brushes are my favorites. Eyeshadow brushes are very nice too. Don&#x27;t see much need for the use of the fan brushes but that&#x27;s just me. Rather of had a couple more powder brushes.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bag there was a missing brush and it was the eyebrow brush. For me, that is the most important.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so lovely and soft. Its smell a little but its not that strong as seen in other comments. In love these brushes a lot.</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes but What I don&#x27;t like is that all the brushes are the same but different sizes I didn&#x27;t get a blending brush n that&#x27;s what I was mainly looking for in this this item it&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
            <li> These brushes suck a lot. They&#x27;re cheap and fall apart. They bristles are not fluffy at all. Seriously do not buy them. Although the bag is cute. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft but most of them are tiny, i find it difficult to find the proper blending brush out of all 22 of these. And personally, I don&#x27;t think that the brushes picks up the eye shadow very well. And i find it more complicated to place any power, eye shadow, etc, anywhere with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do love how soft they are, and they don&#x27;t leave behind any parts of the brush on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the bag it comes with is SUPER cute and easy to use :)</li>
            <li> there are a few brushes that i will use a lot in this set, but some of them are too stiff for good eye makeup blending. not a bad purchase though. the quality seems good, and the case isn&#x27;t overly smelly like some people said.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes the other day they&#x27;re very nice. My only problem is when I went to take one out the package it feel completely apart. I contact the seller for a replacement, but you have yet to hear anything back from them as far as a replacement, but other than that they&#x27;re pretty nice brushes. Don&#x27;t know if I would order from this seller again though. Subtract two stars for lack of communication.</li>
            <li> For the most part I really like this set. However it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold eye shadow as good as some brushes. Also some of the brush seems to fall apart. Not drastically but occasionally it will lose hairs.</li>
            <li> These brushes are sooo soft and work so amazing!! I was shocked at how great they were for the price!! Better then the name brand brush sets in my opinion!!</li>
            <li> Stop while you&#x27;re ahead..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although these brushes are very cute, I was extremely disappointed with my purchase. Within a week of using these brushes, I felt regretful of my new buy. I consider myself a make-up guru, and was shocked when the brushes all came apart. The metal ferrule, which leads to the bristle, completely detached from the handle of the brush. While I was using these brushes every day, I didn&#x27;t force the brush against my skin too hard, it was all on the product. As the brush started to fall apart, I could see that there was some form of cheap glue just barely holding the ferrule and handle together. I have never been so disappointed by an amazon product. So save yourself the time, money, and hassle. DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> so when i opened the brush kit for the first time the plastic brush roll smelt alittle bit but not to bad. the brushes looked nice and cute. but when i had gone to take off the plastic of the large fan brush in the kit the top poped off and i had noticed there were some paint marks that had gotten on the pink metal! i was kinda up set but then i had to remind my self they were only 10 bucks. so i just wanted to let anybody no that if the top pops on any of your brushes just use some good glue and it will fix it right up! anyways so if your looking to purshase these brushes i say go for it there nice soft,cute brushes but just be warned there may be some problems with them because the brushes are so cheap!</li>
            <li> They are very cheap and the bristles are too soft to be useful at all.. they are flimsy and don&#x27;t pick up makeup well. Also all of the eyemakeup brushes are FLAT! no brushes for blending or anything... very disappointed. face brushes barely hold powder. the case is made of awful gross cheap material, and the smell of the brushes when I first got them was very bad. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone serious about their makeup. For a middle schooler - this may be a great product</li>
            <li> These brushes were alright, great deal for the price, but the eyebrow spoolie broke the second week I had it!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the vibrant colours of the brushes, the were extremely soft, I just wish that the set was a little more diverse in what type of brushes it came with; a blending brush would&#x27;ve been nice in it.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE BRUSHES &amp;#34;HAIR&amp;#34; , BUT 3 OF THEM BROKE DURING THE 2ND DAY D;&lt;br /&gt;BAD SMELL BUT NOTHING TO STRONG</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my daughter for Christmas as it was a full size pouch with all of the necessary brushes.  Sadly, I had to glue all of the brushes to the sticks.  Brushes are cheap, and certainly not worth the money. Not worth the extra to send it back.</li>
            <li> sure ONE hair might fall out every couple months but they work amazingly. the blush brush even survived getting chewed by my dog. Id say if you need brushes on a budget these are the way to go, I love them so much I might buy another set in a different color!!</li>
            <li> These  brushes are amazing! and soooooo soft! I also love the case! It is awesome for travel or storage! I love EVERYTHING about these brushes!</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for about 6 or 7 months now and I can honestly say that I still love them and nothing has gone wrong at all. They are supper soft and you get exactly what you see in the picture. I use these brushes everyday and I constantly get compliments from my friends. Also when you wash these I&#x27;ve noticed that the color stays and isn&#x27;t really effected by the make up. Some times it takes I little bit of pressure to pick up the powder from my eye shadow but nothing substantial. And I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the bristles falling out either which is always a plus. Love this product and I&#x27;m so happy I decided to get these!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and i was afraid because of the reviews, to many ppl complaining about the smell, and blah blah, ofc if you are a professional make up artist you should get at least the mac brushed, but for home use they work wonderful, and the smell, it went away over the night! so come on girls, less complain, is a WONDERFUL price, they are so soft and nice, those are a LOT of brushes, i just have to say i really love them!</li>
            <li> So these brushes are actually nicely made and nicely colored. I would stay sturdy for at home use......not for professional use. Most definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them often now actually. But the pink bag? Toss it. Make your own. It smalls like manufacturing and doesn&#x27;t go away....You can make an equally cute one out of some old fabric.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews which almost made me rethink my purchase. I am glad that I didn&#x27;t. The set cost less than I normally spend on a single brush and yet I love it soooo much more than my more expensive brushes. I agree the bag does smell like paint when you open the package but that is a non issue since I don&#x27;t make a habit of holding the bag to my nose which is the only way your going to notice the smell. I am not a professional make up artist but I do wear make up everyday and this set is perfect for everyday use. if your looking for a decent set of makeup brushes then this set would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WHAT I GOT AND FOR THE PRICE... I USUALLY WOULD BUY JUST ONE BRUSH FOR THAT PRICE, THE QUALITY IS PRETTY GOOD, IT JUST HAS A WEIRD SMELL, BUT I GUESS I CAN DEAL WITH THAT. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> they are sooooo soft and cute i got them in a week and was so excited i cant wait to use them!!!!</li>
            <li> Definatley not my type of brushes ! The shadow brushes are not fluffy for my liking and they feel really cheap ! Gave them to my mom she feels the same way. I don&#x27;t recommend !!!</li>
            <li> This makeup brushes are really soft, love the color. There are exactly as the picture, they don&#x27;t get ugly when you wash them.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a Christmas gift for my friend and she loved them! They were soft and worked good, I ordered one for myself, but the bristles on mine were a little uneven, I still use them. I like them, I&#x27;m working as a makeup artist for a local movie and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on these!</li>
            <li> Works very well with makeup and my skin. It picks up makeup excellently and cleans off easily. Its a cute color and goid price for 22 pcs.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow comb/brush combo brush head was broken from the stem upon arrival but the rest were fully intact.  The blush and bronzer brushes had a few strays that were falling off as well.  I crazy glued the eyebrow brush back together.  It looked like the original glue hadn&#x27;t held up.  Not a surprise though.  It was over 100 degrees the day of shipment arrival.  And after washing the brushes, no more strays.  They bristles are very very soft.  I love the color.  I didn&#x27;t notice the awful smell of the carrying case that others mentioned.  Only a mild new plastic smell.  It wore off quickly though.  I&#x27;d buy these for others as gifts too. Great deal!</li>
            <li> they are ok. they fall off the stems easily. I dont like that. I shouldnt need to use glue on my new brushes.</li>
            <li> Awful I thought it was gonna be amayzing I was very disappointed wen I received it the brushes all fell apart after only 2 weeks I was better off going to wall mart I do not recommend this item at all.</li>
            <li> To see what I use each of these brushes for read my blog post:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for these but I do realize they are an extremely low cost set so they are not perfect but they are definitely worth the money. The face brushes don&#x27;t pick up product well, the type of fibers they used are too slippery. I was able to get a light application of blush so that&#x27;s nice, especially if you tend to be heavy handed. It wouldn&#x27;t really pick up loose powder at all. I&#x27;m going to try spraying the ends with MAC Fix+ or the similar one by elf and see if I have better luck. I think these would be good for applying a light dusting of shimmer highlight to your cheekbones. None of the brushes are great for applying eyeshadow or blending, they are more the type for applying cream eyeshadow or highlight. You might be able to use the flat eyeshadow brushes for packing on color, if it is a high pigmented shadow. They would work great wet to get a nice defined edge. These type of stiff flat brushes are great for concealer, primer, cream products, lipstick, gel liner, etc. so you will have a whole array of brushes to fill out your brush collection for that stuff but you will probably need to pick up a few better eyeshadow brushes, especially for blending, as there is nothing in here that works for that. The little square brush is for tight lining your lashes, where you pack on gel eyeliner right into your lash line for dark, luscious lashes. All in all, I am glad I bought these, it is a great starter set or to fill out your collection but you will need to supplement a few other brushes to be really happy with your makeup application. I have 6 different brush sets and I recommend first picking up the Real Techniques Core Collection for face brushes and the Starter set for the eyeshadow brushes. The Elf Studio Brushes are amazing and you can often get them for 50% off, making them $1.50 a brush. If you are like me and you want multiples of every brush this is a great set for that but I just wish it had some softer fluffier eye brushes for blending and eyeshadow. Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT** I decided to try these brushes exclusively as if they were my only brushes and I was able to improvise and get a nice application of makeup. Be open minded and you can use some brushes for other uses than they are intended, for example I packed on a crease color with a small \\&quot;eyeshadow brush\\&quot; and blended it out gently with the fan brush. Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well. Foundation brushes work great for sweeping away fallout and also perfectly blending out an eyeshadow wing if you do a smoky eye. ;) Also I put a little hair gel on my fan brush while it was wet to make it stiffer and now it is much better for sweeping away fallout. Spraying a little Fix+ works very well with these brushes to make a precise application of color. This set is an excellent value and it may not be my preferred brushes but not everyone wants to spend a lot of $$$ on this kind of stuff. I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box I think you will be happy with these. Also if the ferrel comes off the handle big deal, just paint on a little nail polish &amp; push those suckers back on, they will stay on after that.hat but I just wish it had some softer fluffier eye brushes for blending and eyeshadow.

            <li> Despite reading the mixed reviews on this product, I decided to take my chances and hope the positive reviews are accurate. The price was amazing and the product was shipped very quickly, however, I was very disappointed once I opened the package. The case and brushes look exactly as they do in the pictures, however, the case does have a very strong smell of paint. That is not what bothered me. Once I began removing the brushes from their pockets, immediately, two of the brush heads came off as if they were never glued to the handle. The larger powder brushes also have a considerable amount of shedding. I am not a brush snob, I have used the same MAC brush for several years and just wanted to add a variety to my collection without spending $50/brush. Believe me when I say, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼💁🏻💁🏻</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS BRUSHES AND THE PRICE IS GREAT :) I WILL DEFENETLY GET ANOTHER SET I USE BRUSHES ALOT</li>
            <li> It has all I need for a cheap price. The brushes are soft when applying makeup. It is just excellent.</li>
            <li> these brushes are nice if your on a tight budget, but i would honestly pick higher end brushes like sigma</li>
            <li> This brushes work Great!! they are pretty soft and very durable!! It more than met my expectations! I love my brush kit.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes were okay but most of them were no very well made but over all they were okay</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and they really get the job done!! Just wish there would of been a round fluffy eye brush in the set but I still recommend it xx</li>
            <li> There is a brush for everything! Just wish they were labeled to help figure out which is which as they are similar in appearance.</li>
            <li> I love the color pink and to come on Amazon and find me some makeup brushes and they are pink I couldn, t wait to get my package in the mail hay now</li>
            <li> Okay so I never have written a review before on anything, because usually I&#x27;m happy with the product and have nothing to complain about. But I must say that this is probably the worst thing I have ever bought. You really do get what you pay for. I received these brushes and as soon as I opened the package two of the brushes fell apart (the brush part came off of the wooden part revealing the glue holding them together). Another thing is that the brushes are just way too soft and barely hold the color on them to put anything on your lids. When I mean I can&#x27;t use these for anything at all I mean it. I&#x27;m warning whoever buys these brushes now how bad they are. DON&#x27;T waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush set for almost 6 months now. Still no complaints! I love that the important brushes come with &amp;#34;covers&amp;#34;. I love the storage and ease of traveling with it. I absolutely love how soft they are and how easy it is to clean them (I use a coconut/almond oil mix to remove the excess, then wash with a gentle anti-bacterial soap just like I do with my sponges). I have actually used every single one of these except for the fan brushes. I love that it comes with a lot of smaller brushes for eye shadow. This way I can use half of them for light shadows and the other for dark ones. This set comes with every brush you need and then some, for a fraction of the price you&#x27;d pay at a makeup store. I am glad I decided to try these before spending $200+ at Sephora!</li>
            <li> Great brushes easy to clean</li>
            <li> Got here on time. The brushes are so soft and they work very well.</li>
            <li> This set is ok. U can tell the brushes are cheap because the bristles come out easily.  However if you don&#x27;t have enough money for really nice ones, then you will be satisfied with these. They still work fine and I like the color.</li>
            <li> This was nicely packaged, my daughter was so excited, but then she opened it, picked up a brush and they weren&#x27;t glued, we had to glue about 10 brushes, very poor quality.  Will not buy again, product cheap.</li>
            <li> I just got them today, I was bit worried about the brush because a lot of people had negative reviews on them and mine came in great condition, I even gave it a tug to see if it sheds but nope!! There is a plastic smell once you open them but you can wash them and get rid of the smell. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this because I most definitely needed it.</li>
            <li> brushes are ONLY cute because they are PINK. &amp;&amp; i love pink!!!!!!! but the blending brusheS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only good brush was the fan brush .... that about it !&lt;br /&gt;\I REALLY REGRET BUYING THEM FOR SO MUCH... I WOULD HAVE RATHER PAYED $10.&lt;br /&gt;LIKE I SAID THEYRE ONLY CUTE BECAUSE THE BRUSHES ARE PINK &amp;\ SO IS THE BAG, BUT IT HAs a STRONG paint smell! ewwwwww</li>
            <li> I was happy with how my brushes came in. Packaged in the light pink case and individually wrapped with platic over the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;-No chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;-The bristles SOFT!&lt;br /&gt;-Little to no bristles falling out.&lt;br /&gt;- Powder and eyeshadow application smooth and picks up rather nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with these brushes is that you need crazy glue or any glue beside you when you get them. The alluminum where the brushes are attached to come off of the platic handle. No worries easy to fix but just a heads up. That is the reason why I give them a 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However good price for the product and all the brushes you get!</li>
            <li> For the price this is amazing. You get so many brushes AND PINK! What I love is that they are super soft. I didn&#x27;t get a weird smell. The only thing is that maybe like 2 or 3 brushes had little hairs out. It&#x27;s no big deal I snipped them off. Other than that, no biggie. I love them and use them every day!</li>
            <li> Some many to choose from it is fantastic. None of the brushes so far shed and they allow applications to go on smoothly. LoVe It!</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for less than six months and ALL of them are coming apart. The brushes are coming off the handles. In trying to get ready for work every day I can&#x27;t stop to glue a brush back on.  Don&#x27;t buy this unless you only need them for a short period of time. I don&#x27;t leave ratings often but these brushes are NOT &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brushes. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the name. They are pretty but they are crap.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set for my wife and she loved it.  She was pleased with the vast assortment of brushes to match her every need.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes. They&#x27;re really soft. The only downside is that the pink bag did smell really strong like acetone or something. Once I cleaned the brushes they no longer had that odor. The bag still has a faint odor, which is a shame because I really wanted to keep my brushes in it. Overall, I like the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> They are great nice and soft :) love them !! Just little smell like petroleum or something I think it is normal :)</li>
            <li> I was expecting more blending brushes for the eyes but all of the small brushes are flat and not usable for blending. Other brushes are good</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Does have a very strong odor of paint (the makeup bag) . Super soft brushed . Some were repeats but very satisfied for less than 11 bucks!</li>
            <li> Great quality...brushes work very well for everyday use..a must-have in my daily makeup routine now-I am very glad I purchased this! SUPER fast delivery as well..I was using new makeup in just days with many of these super soft brushes..yay</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are so cute and such a good value. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with them falling apart or shedding.</li>
            <li> A few of them broke off when I tried to use them. I like the packaging and pink color. :(</li>
            <li> Awsome set came with a cute roll up pink plether case. Quality brushes and so many to choose from. Having a lot of fun with my makep</li>
            <li> the brushes broke before I got a chance 2 use them have to try 2 glue the brushes back together the handles came a loose .</li>
            <li> Love the color and texture, brushes are soft and feels great on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink case looks very cheap but otherwise its a good product and i would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I think I may actually return this product, because they brushes seem to be TOO soft and dont work very well because of it. I was excited to receive it based on all of the good reviews, but am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set about a year ago, since I was just getting into makeup. I never had any makeup brushes, so I wanted something to test out before I invested in higher end brushes. When I first received my brushes, the pink brush bag spelled like plastic (not necessarily an unbearable smell, but I didn&#x27;t like it). The brushes are very VERY soft, and because of that can be hard for product to be picked up (the face brushes). I do like the eyeshadow brushes for packing on color, but those, the spoolie, and concealer brushes are the only ones I use. For the price, you get a lot of brushes, but some of them look exactly the same and the quality is ok, but something I wouldn&#x27;t use on clients. 3/5 for the price and the quality of the 5 or 6 eye brushes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for inexpensive brushes to use at home and these were perfect.  They are soft and very little bristle loss.  I find a lot of brushes leave bristles all over the place but these brushes do not do that which is great.  Def would recommend to anyone.  They are also super durable as per they stand up to my 3 year old taking them and smashing them on the floor</li>
            <li> This are awesomeee. This is what i was looking for. They may have a smell that first but they come packet with all plastic and everything.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes. Have had for about 3 months use them everyday and for the price very worth it. Gave them a wash today and they looked great after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice on the eye but the brush quality isn&#x27;t good it feels too much like plastic, not nice at all to do your make up.</li>
            <li> Loved this item!! Would for sure recommend. It did smell like paint openin it up, but who cares with time that smell will go away. As for the brush they&#x27;re SOOOO soft and seem to be high quality. Buying this product for my two sister in laws for Christmas. Love love love this product</li>
            <li> Not the greatest brushes, but you do get what you pay for! This came with a ton of different brushes, so for the money it is worth it. If you are looking for top quality brushes then these are not for you.</li>
            <li> Item came in much earlier than the estimated shipping date, and they are just so adorable! They feel like soft bunny paws haha, and they are really nice. I have brushes from sephora and nyc brushes and they are just as soft as them if not softer than those. The case definitely has some sort of scent to it, but I don&#x27;t really mind it since I&#x27;ll just let it air out. Please wash the brushes before you use them though, because you never know what is on them.&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes, I probably won&#x27;t buy more brushes for a long long time because these are just so pretty and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I had bought this for myself a few months ago and love the material! It&#x27;s so soft and picks up product well. I haven&#x27;t seen any fallout. I am definelty a EcoTools girl and I would say these are just as soft as my old brushes. I have a cousin that is going to beauty school and got these for her birthday as well. I think if you are experimenting or learning how to use makeup this is a great set. You get a ton of brushes and they are so cute too!</li>
            <li> I love that I got so many makeup brushes so inexpensively! The brushes work very well for all my needs, and the carrying case is great for traveling. I read the reviews about the brushes shedding, and I have not found that after I cleaned them up a bit before the first use. All brushes shed slightly when they are brand new, and I have not had any issues. I&#x27;m quite happy with them!</li>
            <li> Bristles fall off but good for the price.</li>
            <li> Out all of them only 3 are useful. Buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes very much yet. The bristles are soft enough for all over application but not so soft that they&#x27;re flimsy. I will happily follow up if i have additional input.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Brushes, great bag-sturdy brushes, not too much shedding&lt;br /&gt;I love the case too! I RECOMMEND THIS SET FOR SURE.&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
            <li> The hair on the brushes are sooo soft and work wonders . Best makeup investment ive ever made, and the awesome holder it comes with keeps everything neat and organized.</li>
            <li> this thing is ok.. i mean for people who is not an expert using makeup burshes , the case looks cheap and uggly, and it smells very bad. they are good but uggly looking</li>
            <li> For the price your paying for such a big set they&#x27;re pretty good not great but they will do if you dont want to pay the crazy sigma price for their overpriced brushes</li>
            <li> I received them the very next day (I selected the standard shipping method)! They also came very well wrapped and everything looked as advertised. It&#x27;s also very pink which I love. The brushed are very soft and feel great on the skin. The only thing was that there was a bit of an odor to them. But nothing a good cleaning can&#x27;t help. (To get rid of the smell I used baby shampoo and warm water, I let them dry and now there is no smell.) I most definitely recommend if you love pink &amp; doing make up. (The carrying case is made out of faux pink leather type material.)**</li>
            <li> I loved it all the brushes were soft and made it easy to do my make-up it&#x27;s something I use every time I go out</li>
            <li> I ONLY gave 3 stars because this item was delivered so quick. 2 of them broke upon being taken out of the package. 3 had so much hot glue in the bristles I had to throw them out. The handles weren&#x27;t even painted all the way. Horrible brushes. These will go to my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> this product was soo cheap and cute and the quality of the brushes dont feel cheap although it doesnt have every single brush a professinal kit has but LOVEEE IT</li>
            <li> Love this brush set. The brushes are super soft and durable and for the price it cannot be matched. I would recommend this set to anyone. Very large collection although i did not use the bag it was nice for someone who might travel. I have been using the brushes for a year now and they are perfect.</li>
            <li> This product was not for me..it was for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday.  She lives in Michigan, I live in NJ.  I had it sent directly to her, so I have never seen the Cosmetic Makeup Brush Set.&lt;br /&gt;However. my granddaughter sent me a thank you note, and seem quite pleased with the gift..which is great because I selected if from her Amazon.com wish list.</li>
            <li> I give this product two stars just because, the powder brush is the only one that actually works. I guess everyone has their own opinion, but in mine these brushes are not worth buying. its true that they pick up very little makeup, the small brushes like the shadow brush are too stiff and some maybe a little too chiseled. I guess they would be good for someone that uses really subtle makeup, because to apply makeup, specially if you like heavy makeup, you have to apply quite a few times to actually do it to your liking. Also some of the big brushes are too long and way too soft and that makes it really hard to use. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of complains about the smell of the bag, well for me it didn&#x27;t bother me. it just kind of smelled liked new plastic. some of the tops do come loose and come off eventually. I rally wouldn&#x27;t recommend theses brushes to anyone, I could find better brushes at a pharmacy, so that&#x27;s a no good for me,</li>
            <li> This kit is great! Wife loves it... great quality even for 2-3 times the price! Highly recommended to any one.</li>
            <li> Pretty pink, large assortment. My bare mineral powder doesn&#x27;t adhere to brush as well as I would like it to but maybe that is advantage so it wouldn&#x27;t be absorbed into bristles.</li>
            <li> Great deal for its price. I recommend it. It came very fast and perfect conditions. I thought they were a small size but they actually are pretty big. Other than that, nice product for a synthetic makeup brushes</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who is only 6 but completely obsessed with regular everyday makeup as well as costume makeup. I was tired of lending her my expensive brushes and having to clean them every time she used them. I picked out this set based on the great price, the number of brushes, and the nice roll-up pink case. The set is AWESOME and way above what I expected. The brushes are very soft, clean, and I detected no odd odor as I have read in other reviews. I absolutely recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> great set of pieces and amazing service, it really was what i wanted and need for myself. I&#x27;ll keep buying from you</li>
            <li> For the price I paid these brushes are really soft and nice. Nothing came missing or damaged, and they came well before they said they were going to which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;One of the compaints I have however is that they smell strongly of chemicals and it worries me slightly to think they might be getting on my face. But, I suppose that&#x27;s what cleaning them is for!&lt;br /&gt;Nice color, feel, and application. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> There are so any brushes in this set that I could share them with someone else!  I&#x27;m just getting into how to use the brushes but I like that these don&#x27;t shed.  A nice variety and probably has every brush you could ever need.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and very pretty! The light pink ombre showed exactly how I imagined it! This was a GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE these brushes more than my other ones but i think it was just because these were pink and cute. They dont work great for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;pros)&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a cute bag&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are pretty and clean well&lt;br /&gt;Didnt have a problem with shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller brushes are great for eyebrows &amp; i still use them for my gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons)&lt;br /&gt;The bag spells repulsive&lt;br /&gt;The brushes break, fast.&lt;br /&gt;Face brushes dont collect product unless you force it on.&lt;br /&gt;Isnt great for blending blush or bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush is either too small or my face is just fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these are ok for the price but ive found a better set on amazon, THAT ARE CHEAPER.&lt;br /&gt;If these are your starter brushes, be careful, the face brushes suck and the eye brushes have many duplicates. There are better options that may not be as cute as these pink ones.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, had them 13 months now and still use everyday. There is brush for everything. I took them out of the carrycase and put in a vase in the bathroom so they are more accessible. Good quality brushes. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> My brushes broke in half.... They really aren&#x27;t great quality but they are good okay.... For starting out brushes these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Brushes are too soft don&#x27;t hold my makeup well</li>
            <li> My whole makeup bag got lost at school one day so I had to replace everything including all my brushes. This definitely helped me do that and now I even have more brushes than I had before :-) I kinda wish that the brushes were labeled though cause it&#x27;s a little hard to tell them all apart</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and it included everything you need for daily and heavy makeup....very handy. Recommended. Just the plastic looks very cheap........but the brushes better than I thought.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are good...mainly the eye brushes but the face brushes are too soft and flimsy! I have mixed feelings about this purchase! My only comfort is that I didn&#x27;t pay a ton for the brushes and they came intact!</li>
            <li> This is my 1st product review and I must say that it is well deserved!!! Ok...I was always sceptical about ordering brush sets online as my 1st 18 pc set which I paid 20 usd for was a disappointment!!! I read every revifor this product and finally decided to give it a try... Firstly....it was shipped much faster than expected....when I finally collected my package I immediately rushed opened it and pulled the bristles like crazy on each brush..NOT a SHED on ANY of my brushes!!!! The metal part securing the bristles are also very secure as none of them rocked a bit!!!! The bristles on the powder brushes are very soft and plush!!!! The eye brushes are very firm and nice!!! I fell in LOVE instantly! My only only gripe was that of the shaddow brushes are perfect for blending but it is NOT a problem as I think I will prefer to buy a single blending brush to add to this collection as it was most definately worth the buy! 15 bucks was wayyyyyyy much a smalll price to pay for the quality of these brushes! Veryyy happy camper!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! it is pink and pretty i almost dont want to use the brushes&amp;#62;haha! it comes with a pretty pink case and has 22 brushes in it! the brushes are super soft and are very professional! I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! The quality is very nice. Soft tips and a huge variety. Only downside is the packaging smells like paint when you first get it, but I left them open in my room for a bit and the smell went away. LOVE these!</li>
            <li> You cant beat the price for these brushes. The  case does have a very slight odor but I had to put it right against my nose to smell it. That was the first thing I did when I took it out of the package because of all the other negative reviews about the smell. I couldnt believe how fast the shipping was. I bought these as a christmas present so I havent actually tried to brushes themselves out but I did take a couple out and the brushes are very soft. Overall I am VERY impressed with what I received and am even going to buy one for myself now.</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft, but they don&#x27;t hold the makeup as well as a natural fiber. Cute color, work great for the price. They do off gas for about a day, and then the chemical smell goes away.</li>
            <li> This brush set was ok - for my 15 year old.  Don&#x27;t buy it if you are expecting anything more than cheap drugstore quality.</li>
            <li> I use this on the daily, never had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> :( it&#x27;s so bad for professional  makeup it&#x27;s less than good I wasted my time and money :s :/ :/</li>
            <li> LOVE ITTT OMGGG SO WORTH THE MONEY! There was no weird smell or anything.. I love the pink bag and everything!</li>
            <li> I absolutely CAN&#x27;T say anything bad about this product at all ! I highly recommend this product, even if your a make-up artist ;) I was heading towards getting the $150 sigma set but honestly, this was a better deal &amp; you get so many brushes I&#x27;m still figuring out what most of them are for. I think I&#x27;m going to grab this as a christmas gift for my niece.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes there soft i would definatly recommend someone buying them theres a brush for each use of makeup . great buy  definantly good purchase</li>
            <li> It got this order very fast. The colors are beautiful, and the brush softness and quality are fantastic. The only down side was one the the brushes were broken, I had to re-glue, not a big deal. But, they are great and easy to bring with, easy to clean. I would buy more.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They are so versatile! I can get any look I want from these brushes! They are very easy to clean as well. I recommend using your facial cleanser or Ivory bar soap to clean them.</li>
            <li> Right when I opened it up, one of the brush heads fell out of the handle.  The brushes shed A LOT (as in, I was worried ALL of the bristles were going to fall out), and the other reviewers were correct that there is a really strong odor.  Also, it may be useful to mention that this set is very large.  I was going to give it as a gift, but decided it was not only too big of a set but also poor quality.  Returned it, but only got a portion of the money back because I had to pay for return shipping.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by these brushes. The face brushes are extremely soft and hold enough face powder for my liking. There is a brush for every need. However, a fluffy eyeshadow brush could have completed the set but these are my everyday brushes and they do not become stained. All you need is some baby shampoo and all of the makeup washes right off. I was very impressed and this convinces me I don&#x27;t need to pay a fortune to make my makeup look amazing everyday. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with the brushes, and they work great! A steal for the price!</li>
            <li> love these brushes. they have shifted into the collection of brushes that i use on a daily basis. just like any other set of brushes some of them shed but that&#x27;s expected. the feel is very soft on the skin and they apply cream products very well. however i cant get these clean enough. they stain easily and if you dont wash them right away good luck on getting the stain out. other than that these are great brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using them.  She uses them everyday.  She wants another set for her sister.  I think it is wonderful because they leave my brushes alone</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I had hoped for. I did not have the residue some described, but I also washed the brushes as soon as I received them so they would be nice and clean for usage. I do agree that the case is somewhat flimsy and tacky, but I didn&#x27;t purchase for the case, I wanted decent brushes that I am not paying hundreds for, and I certainly received that. There are so many brushes I know I have one for every use. I just wish they came with some type of guide as to which brush is which since I consider myself a beginner when it comes to makeup.</li>
            <li> This set is so worth the money! I filled my 2 cups with theese amazing brushes! They are easy to clean and very inexpensive! Don&#x27;t be tricked because they are not as expensive as sigma but, they sure feel the same!</li>
            <li> Brushes have a slight smell but other than that its super cute luv this item I would totally recommend this product to all the girly girl like me</li>
            <li> For my make up and such. Its makes my make up even and perfect. Seriously love this product. Thank you hahah</li>
            <li> I was sooooo so happy when I got the whole set. The brushes are cute with the color pink and white. And they are so soft. These brushes a better than the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I use the brushes daily. Brushes I got from Costco were better and lasted for a long time. But considering the price which was very reasonable they were OK +.</li>
            <li> Three brushes are amazing! I&#x27;ve had them for about  6 months and they have not shed once! The brushes are incredibly soft! I definitely recommend this product the only downside is that shipping took about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I give this the 5 star treatment, it is awesome. A great gift for any woman to add to her makeup collection. Brushes are well made the bristles don&#x27;t fall out. A great buy for the price, comparable to the high dollar collections.</li>
            <li> ok so the brushes do smell a little like plastic, but that does not matter. Why? because they are great I do not know if they are better than other ones because I have never owned expensive make up brushes, but when I go to stores like sephora and touch the brushes they sell there and then touch the ones I bought. I am happy with the product I bought, I ordered it like 2 days ago and just got it today! Great service, great product, Iove the brushes, definately recomend it.</li>
            <li> As Others HavePreviously Mentioned, The Case And brushes Smelled Of Dye Upon Opening. I Washed The Brushes With Baby Shampoo And That Immediately eliminated The Smell. I Rubbed Coconut Oil Into The Case And Wiped It Down With A Slightly Damp Cloth, That Took Away Most Of The Smell And I Suspect After A Few Days It Will No Longer Be Noticeable. The Brushes Are Soft With Minimal To No Shedding. I Had No Issues With The Heads Coming Loose From The Handles. Can&#x27;t Wait For Them To Dry So I Can Use Them! I Will Update After I Get Some Use Out Of Them. Totally Happy With My Purchase Thus Far.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my daughter and she received it this morning. 3 brushes had bristles out of place, and 1 of the powder brushes fell apart and she hasn&#x27;t used it yet. These are not worth the price. I could have bought better quality at walmart</li>
            <li> Got these when I first started the only thing I don&#x27;t care for the smaller brushes the bristles  are hard the larger brushes are good. This is good to have for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great! super soft and durable, however the bag smelled HORRIBLE, so I threw it out. Def recommend the product!</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes were good, but they were flat, not rounded like I wanted. They were soft which was good. It was good for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I ORDER THESE BRUSHES AS GIFTS BECAUSE OF THE GREAT QUALITY. IF YOU HAVE A FRIEND IN NEED OF BRUSHES, THESE ARE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT STARTER SET! YOU&#x27;LL LOVE THEM SO MUCH, YOU WON&#x27;T BE ABLE TO APPLY MAKEUP WITHOUT THEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GEO</li>
            <li> Today i received mines and i LOVE THEM!!! the only problem that one of the brushes was a little squeezed and when i pulled it out the brush was a little out of place.. but its okay now.. the brushes are fantastic so soft and excellent for applying a smooth makeup look. love them ! i will totally recommend them!!</li>
            <li> They are awesome and really soft. No difference between these and super expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Nice set for the price. They do shed when first used, but after the first few times, they have stopped and are still full and useable.  I love the nice pink roll up holder.  I do wish the brushes were labeled for use (i.e. eyebrow, shading, kabuki, etc) I use them almost daily and they are still like new!</li>
            <li> These brushes were surprisingly soft and worked better than I had thought they would. I would recommend these to anyone who is interested in adding a few more brushes into their collection, instead of going out and buying more expensive ones every few decades. They serve their purpose well, and I can&#x27;t believe I found such great brushes for such a low price, compared to other big name brands.</li>
            <li> I love love love these brushes! And they aren&#x27;t crazy out of my budget! They grab powders well and I haven&#x27;t had any hairs fall out of the brushes, and I&#x27;ve been using them (and washing them after every use) for weeks now. I think the people who have had bad experiences with that are getting defective brushes, or something.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have with this product is the fact that it&#x27;s missing a couple of vital brushes from the set, and the foundation/ blush brush the set comes with is very ineffective and the bristles are weak.</li>
            <li> These brushes are horrible. I purchased them a year ago and only use about 3 brushes out of the whole set. The brushes are extremely flimsy and are so cheap. 2 of the brushes fell apart upon arrival. I like the brush holder it came with however. There are no blending brushes and the face brushes are so flimsy. ELF has better brushes and are also cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone, not even a beginner.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. Didn&#x27;t take too long to arrive</li>
            <li> Definitely a great price for what you get. Have some superglue handy though, the brushes fall out of the handles.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! This is the very first set of make up brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased online. I&#x27;m barely learning how to use them, so it would have been nice if they were labeled. They are super soft on my face. They come ver well packaged. Anyone who buys them won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> They are so soft! So soft I thought I would be paying more for something like this Irrecommend these soft brushes they are amazing...but that&#x27;s my opinion (;</li>
            <li> Very displeased. Not worth it! The material is all very cheap, the bristles are flimsy! The pink set I received did not look like the one in the picture. I am very disappointed. Someone in the comments said they&#x27;re brush handles where plastic, mine was wooden with cheap pink paint coming off of the handles. I do not recommend you waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> Okay eyeshadow brushes for beginners, but the face brushes are just awful, don&#x27;t waste your money on this like most of the brushes that are really cheap on amazon. Real techniques, sedona lace, and crown brushes are inexpensive and great quality!!</li>
            <li> Love love love. They are so cute and soft the price is unbelievable. I will buy again for my sister</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good for the price, obviously they are not Mac quality brushes but nonetheless they work well. The only problem is that they are a little too soft and not dense enough- no good balance but for everyday simple makeup needs you are good to go. Give them a try!</li>
            <li> got these for my teenage daughter, as i didnt want to invest too much on something for her (cause she loses everything), and i must say, they are quite nice! they have an odd smell at first... it may ne fromt he case, but they work great! great value!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and cute, but they hardly  hold any product or any pigment onto the brushes. I have just used 2 or 3 of the brushes out of the whole set.</li>
            <li> HATED HATED HATED the smell of the case. but also the brushes are not what I expected I do use them but not like what I wanted them for. Would probably be some good paint brushed for my crafts.</li>
            <li> i bought these as my old ones i lost and they are good- but 6are duplcations really thyy are all the same.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter, she loves them. Very soft and cute case, perfect for traveling. Would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Never got the item. Very poor customer service. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time. it is very unfortunate to go through such a hassle for an order.</li>
            <li> I loved the pink color of the brushes and also the quality. They are super soft, and not even one bristle fell after I washed them. I have a ton of brushes now and I don&#x27;t need to wash them very often.. So, it&#x27;s 22 brushes for 10 dollars? That&#x27;s more than perfect to me!</li>
            <li> bought two sets for my cousins, they are going to love them, these brushes are softer than i had expected.</li>
            <li> i love my make up brushes. great simple and useful. I havent had any problems with my brushes. just take care of them</li>
            <li> Purchased these brushes for my wife. She seems to love them and her face doesn&#x27;t look like a wreck so i think they&#x27;re doing their job! Highly recommend if your want your face looking good too!</li>
            <li> Of course the colour isn&#x27;t going to stay, but these brushes are great for beginners. Although, my large fan brush got packaged terribly, it got smushed and still isn&#x27;t back to normal. It&#x27;s do-able though, aha.</li>
            <li> The brushes in this set aren&#x27;t of professional quality very cheap brushes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who is trying to achieve that professional look.</li>
            <li> Brushes were cute and soft. But the smell was HORRIBLE! Gave me a headache. Smells like chemicals. Haven&#x27;t used them  because of that.</li>
            <li> Very gift appropriate. Looked nice in the storage bag. I gifted this set, have had no complaints or remarks. Would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> These Brushes Work Amazing ! ,  i love them (: , i heard bad reviews on them and i was doubting  them but it was to late to cancel but im glad i kept them.</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast. I was in love it did have a plastic smell to it. But air it out and youll be fine. Brushes are amazing. And i love how smooth they feel on my skin. Amazing for shading, smudging, contouring, eyelining.. everything:)</li>
            <li> Bought my girlfriend two whole brush sets from mac last year and bought her these this year thinking maybe she would like at least like one or two brushes out of the 22. She loves all of them and says they are better then all her MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect from this brush set. When I ordered it, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much on the quality side because of the low price I had to pay. However, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are really nicely colored, and have a good aesthetic quality to them if you like loads of pink. The color is actually even a tad brighter in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving you this review from the perspective of a professional makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;My overall view of the product is that it can be a good starting brush set for the young makeup enthusiast who may just be learning and building their makeup kit. It is also a good product to have for people who just like to collect different kinds of brushes. This is not a &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34; brush set. Brushes will need to be added to this. I repeat, THIS IS NOT A STAND ALONE BRUSH SET FOR PROFESSIONALS. Great for young/new makeup enthusiasts/brush collectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[MORE IN DEPTH REVIEW BELOW]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush roll is nice! The color is nice, the brush slots do their job, &amp; I didn&#x27;t have any problem with a smell as others have said. It smelled like a new brush roll for a bit, then it faded. Just like a new car smell fades over time. I&#x27;ve not had a single issue with the brush roll at all. If I was being extremely picky, I might say that I was just wishing it could be more of a brush belt, but that&#x27;s not what the product is advertised as. It&#x27;s a brush roll, so I can&#x27;t complain there.&lt;br /&gt;The large powder brush and the smaller blush/powder brush work well for the application of those products. The large fan brush works well for dusting off excess powders and moderately well for blending out powder blushes/contour along with applying highlight down the nose and on the cheeks. There are a couple smaller brushes that I&#x27;ve used as lip brushes that work well for that.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush is okay for putting the product on the face. I find it&#x27;s best used to help blend out when I do liquid highlightsand contours. The stippling brush is not nearly dense enough and the bristles are just too long and &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; to have any practical use. The eyeshadow brushes didn&#x27;t impress me either. They weren&#x27;t fantastic with picking up or packing shadows, and this set doesn&#x27;t come with any type of fluffy blending brush. The eyeliner brush didn&#x27;t work too well for me as it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold its shape very well. It gets stray hairs that can get product all over the lid.&lt;br /&gt;The little tools for the eyebrows and lashes work well. You can&#x27;t really go wrong with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you pay, these are GREAT products, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re GREAT brushes.</li>
            <li> SuperSoft Brushes. The smaller ones are a bit stiff but they do the work. Super Cute and Soft. The only thing is the pink turns into all different colors with makeup lol but you can clean them and vua-la</li>
            <li> Brushes are of fine quality, so many choices for different effects. Pretty. Cleans easy and the brushes and wood and conectors hold up for regular monthy cleaning with gentle clensers. The case or pink bag is soft and cleans up easy when traveling.</li>
            <li> I waited a while to write this review, but these brushes are just not that great. A couple fell apart after opening the package, and 2 more face brushes shortly after. Granted, I know you def get what you pay for, and it&#x27;s too bad because the brushes themselves are actually quite soft. However, I&#x27;ve bought similar brushes on this site before and was definitely better off. I fixed a couple with a little super glue and still use them, but i&#x27;ll be investing in better brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!! Honestly, I don&#x27;t think you find these many of brushes for this price. The only think I did not like is that when it first arrived, I tried to wash them and two of them came apart, but that&#x27;s just b/c they didn&#x27;t put enough glue. Overall, they are great. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy doing makeup and for starters too</li>
            <li> I would give this five stars if it weren&#x27;t for two brush tips needing to be glued back to their handles upon delivery.  Overall, though,  holy macaroni!  These brushes rock!</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Brushes are soft and pick up just the right amount of colors from any eyeshadow pallette. The brushes can easily be compared to high-end brands. The only thing I didnt&#x27;t like was the smell of the brush bag. It&#x27;s a vinyl ans smells as such, however, if you let it sit out unrolled for a day or so, the smell goes away. I was very happy with my purchase. brushes are high quality. Love that they are pink!</li>
            <li> Very cute brushes, the handles are pink and the brushes themselves ombré from white to pink:) i like the variety, and colors, they are very useful in some instances. Be warned though, these brushes are not ideal for harder make up. They bend too easily to pick up harder pigments. Much more well suited for mineral make up. Package came in good condition, the fan brush was the only brush that was a little bent, a little water and some diligent drying fixed that in a jiffy though. Would&#x27;ve gotten five stars if I were able to use them on my pressed powder makeup</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas.  I was VERY happy with what I received.  Very good quality brushes and the price is amazing!!  She is going to love them!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 12 and I love makeup I ordered them and I love them so much BEST BRUSHES EVER IN THE WORLD</li>
            <li> i suppose you get what you paid for but i&#x27;m not satisfied. yes they do have an odd smell to them, which i read on the reviews and understood because they are in plastic so i wouldn&#x27;t really expect much else. and they are pretty, but thats not saying much when the hair is falling out. the first time i used one of the brushes for blush and mineral powder i was noticing that it was shedding. at that point i haven&#x27;t washed it yet or used it for anything else so i didn&#x27;t understand why it was so much.. it wasn&#x27;t just one or two random pieces, it was a lot.. but i was just figuring it was because it was freshly unwrapped since that does occasionally happen with a new set. i was wrong. it still sheds no matter how delicate i am with it. although not all of them badly shed, the main ones that i use do, so now the whole pack is just wrapped up on my makeup counter because i cant use them.. it extremely unfortunate and disappointing because they are so soft and its an adorable set but i probably wont buy brushes from here anymore.</li>
            <li> Decent enough quality for the price. The brushes need a little &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; picking up the makeup... you have to push harder to get the makeup on the brush. The pouch you get with the brushes is nice, the only complaint I have about it is that it smells a little plasticy. Overall a good product though.</li>
            <li> I Love the brushes they do not fall out and they contain more than what i need super good &amp; nice</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft but doesn&#x27;t blend, the handles are way too long to be practical, and the brushes fall apart from the handle as soon as you touch it--22 brushes and so far I haven&#x27;t found one I like/didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes, I wish they were a little denser.they are very soft and pretty. no foundation brush. great value for the price, i would recommend</li>
            <li> i use these everyday and love love love them!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are beautiful don&#x27;t SMELL AT ALL I saw some people said they had a smell to them that&#x27;s not true what&#x27;s so ever I would recommend these super affordable, and super soft! Definitely 5 STARS!!!</li>
            <li> Very cute, pretty pink brushes, but does not apply makeup well due to the fact that they are way too soft. I will use them as decoration at my salon booth.</li>
            <li> I like the brush set, but I&#x27;m constantly gluing the brush part back onto the wood, it&#x27;s pretty irritating.</li>
            <li> Of all the 22 brushes, there is no foundation brush which is pretty upsetting. But, the rest of the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product, it really wasn&#x27;t what I expected. The brushes are SO soft and I got all of the 22 brushes. Everyone on my dance team loved them and now they want to get some too haha. The bag did come with a strong pain scent, but it went away after a day or 2 and it wasn&#x27;t as bad as the people who reviewed it made it to be. Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> Came in almost 2 weeks ahead of time, did have a light odor of paint but went away after they aired out on my table . The handles on my brush were wooden unlike some reviews said but they are good quality none the less. At just under $8 and free shipping these brushes were a steal !</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes for the price. Also the brushes are really soft and I have not had a problem with the bristles falling out. I would definitely recommend these. There is not really a brush for liquid foundation though I wish there was, at least not like any of the ones I have ever had</li>
            <li> This brush set arrived very quick. However they are best for application not blending. I love them regardless. They are very soft and do not shed</li>
            <li> The brushes were very soft!! The foundation brush is a little stiff but it may just be because they are brand new! They are overall great brushes for being knock offs! And are PERFFF for beginners. One thing i have to say is the bag it came in has a faint smell of paint which doesnt affect the brushes i just washed mine with baby shampoo and its fine. Also the eyebrow brush and comb are really baad quality but all the other brushes are great! IM IN LOVE WITH THE POWDER BRUSH!!! This set is really great and ship super quick its also an amazing price!!</li>
            <li> as stated above, I have decided to let the set sit outside for a while before I start use it. quality is good for the price.</li>
            <li> I immediately check to see if the hair would fall out since I saw many reviews about the hair falling out...And surely enough people where not kidding I slightly passed my hand threw the fan brush and sure enough the hairs started falling out!...</li>
            <li> i have used this item so much since i have gotten it! i love it so much! I definitly reccomend getting this item!</li>
            <li> i am in love! i am picky when it comes to quality of products. and i may say that these brushes are so amazing! they are cute and soft but have a good grip. my powder is applied better than with any other brush. i see the clean finish</li>
            <li> You get a lot of different brushes for cheap. Perfect if you are just starting to use make up and need to learn different uses for all kinds of brushes</li>
            <li> I believe 2 stars were appropriate because one there were a lot of brushes and two the fan brushes applied blush  pretty well.  I will say that none of the eye brushes were good.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great quality and SUPER SOFT!!! They are very comparable to the Too Faced Teddy Bear brushes, but a much better price. Not much fall out and great quality. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> They definitely definitely smell. The pink case doesn&#x27;t hold the brushes particularly well, but the flap helps with that. It is also a more metallic pink then I anticipated, but who cares it&#x27;s a makeup bag. The small brushes are nice and stiff, and the large ones are very soft. All these brushes for $14? I&#x27;ll handle a little stank. Definitely worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Pink is pretty. Brushes are also tender.&lt;br /&gt;However, in the case stinks. And bad, so I feel a bit far.&lt;br /&gt;Ships fast is fortunate.</li>
            <li> Absoultly love. When they came they reeked of what I can only assume was paint. But the smell faded and I love them. Soft and well made. I saw no defect in bristle as I had with sets I spent 10x the money on else where.</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes. The bigger, fluffier ones are very soft and feel nice on the skin. However, the smaller ones (that I assume are eyeshadow brushes) feel thicker and harder at the tips, it feels like it&#x27;s poking your eyes. For the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Well, the quality of the brushes are great, I love the color I just love and like them so much!</li>
            <li> I like the brushes and what is even great about it is that it&#x27;s not expensive at all. I kind of wish it came with labels so I know which brush is used for what. The bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> I actually really like how the brushes look and fell for the most part... the only issue that I have and the reason why I&#x27;m giving it only two stars is because the quality isn&#x27;t that great. The brush was glued to the body but not firmly so the brush keeps sliding off the handle.</li>
            <li> IT WAS CHEAP SO OH WELL, VERY PRETTY IN COLOR NOT PROFESSIONAL THO, GREAT FOR TEENS WHO ARE NOW EXPERIMENTING WITH MAKEUP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> For the price I love it. I use them everyday however there is not really a fluffy blending eye shadow brush :/</li>
            <li> love brushes super soft  smell the only thing is the factory smell when you open it but when you wash ur brushes their good as new</li>
            <li> Came coated in a weird kind of dusty film that I could have done without but for their price they were decent. I&#x27;d still recommend anyone looking for brushes to spring for some better ones.</li>
            <li> Now i am not a make up kind of girl but sometimes it is very necessary! Great purchase high quality brushes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute and it works well.</li>
            <li> You get good brushes for the price. They do come smelling a bit like paint but it wears off after a few days. 4 stars because they were a bit stiff and there arent really blending or fluffy brushes. They work well for the amount paid.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set late saturday night and it arrived early tuesday morning with regular shipping!!! The brushes are so soft and apply makeup very well. Amazing quality for the price, if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap way to expand your brush set and want something \\&quot;professional\\&quot; THIS is just what you need! Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> it took a long time for them to arrive but it was worth it! these brushes are super soft and look exactly like the picture. they did have a bit of a paint smell but its something I can live with! I am so excited to try them out, so glad I ordered and so worth the price!</li>
            <li> When i first received them they DID smell  like plastic. However, everyone is over-exaggerating! They smell like plastic because 1) the case is plastic.  2) the brushes are also wrapped in plastic. Soon as I took them out of the packaging they smelled a little better. After I washed them the smell was gone. They do hold make up very well, and they are quite small. These are good brushes. I do recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the price and color of the brushes, they do their job and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! All of the brushes came individually wrapped in plastic. It came wrapped in a pink holder. The smell was really light and u couldn&#x27;t really smell it. Truthfully it was not that bad. The brushes are very very soft and are good quality. I&#x27;m 13 so I don&#x27;t really need all the brushes, but they are great to have around. They are super cute with the pink handles. I really recommend this product! It also came 4 days after I put in the order.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because my current collection contained only 2 brushes and a sponge. The larger brushes are soft enough for gentle placement and blending, and the smaller ones are stiff enough to work perfectly for eyebrow filling and eyeliner. The plastic smell that was mentioned dissipated after an hour after I opened the package, so no problems there, and the brushes cleaned really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you will not find a better set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush set, really soft. Felt nicer than a lot of my expensive brush sets. Like, a lot better. Wash before you use them. baby shampoo works well. great set</li>
            <li> They are okay brushes. One lost it&#x27;s bristles a week after i got them. However, they are soft, pretty and cheap. Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh the best set of brushes that are a good price I use almost all of them and they are great they apply everything amazingly and I couldn&#x27;t ask for any thing better definitely the package to by it arrived on time and the brushes are well made but you might want to wash them every month they do look dirty but that&#x27;s only cause it white and pink but other then that great brushes</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s cute and a lot of brushes. It was pink and pretty and fits perfect in my purse</li>
            <li> The product was great, and it was in perfect condition when I got it. just try to air on the side of gentle. The mascara and eyebrow comber brush snapped off three weeks after I got it because my little sister tried to jerk it out of my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to spending a lot of money on my makeup and brushes and doubt anything that is too cheap. THESE however, are very impressive brushes. They are not as good as my Urban Decay or Too Faced brushes but they do compare. They pick up pigment quite well. For the price I have no complaints. I say buy them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a while now and I can say that 70% of the brushes fell apart and I had a hard time gluing them back together. They work very well though and they&#x27;re super soft! I would probably buy a smaller amount though next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she really likes it. It came with all the brushes she wanted and its for a good price. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for make up products.</li>
            <li> I got an Amazon giftcard for Christmas, so I thought I&#x27;d try these out. Yes I had to go through and superglue four of the brushes on, but I&#x27;ve used them several times and have no complaints otherwise. Considering my professional makeup artist friend was interested in them after she did my makeup with them, I&#x27;m going to say I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. After two weeks of daily use, there is no shedding or stray hairs.</li>
            <li> This product was exactally as pictured. Good quality .  I would recommend it . The price is very reasonable for the amount of brushes and the quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes hold pigment good but the types of brushes is limited there is no eyeshadow blending brush and all the brushes are shaped the same, I would reccomend.</li>
            <li> Every kind of brush is in this set.  I love how soft they are and how well kept up they have been.</li>
            <li> i picked these because they were the cheapest for the most brushes. overall i love them. they are very soft and work great. and i love the bag and its shimmer. this is my first brush set and i am eager to learn with them. thanks!</li>
            <li> These brushes came really quick, in 3 days. Also, when i first opened them, the pink bag was folded nicely, no cracks, or  rips. I didn&#x27;t smell anything when i firs opened it UNLESS i held the bag up to my nose. It isn&#x27;t a strong smell. But the brushes did smell like that and if you want you could wash them, but i&#x27;m not making a big deal out of it because it isn&#x27;t as strong as people make it out to be. So, other than that , i give this set a 5 star! Adorable, pink &amp; fun! :) OH yeah, and cheap ;)</li>
            <li> i liked the way the brushes worked but the bristles fall out .I have only had this product for about 2 weeks when I could pull out about ten bristles or so at a time. The larger brushes have a plastic guarder around them but when you take it on and off the brushes just get misshaped . I would recommend this product to people who do not expect to have a long use out of this product</li>
            <li> Whats the point of having all of these brushes if you cant use them. I should have used caution when other reviews mentioned this. The brushes do not pick up makeup very well or that at all. Im not sure if it swallows it up or what. I compared it to my other brushes and yep it barely picks up the makeup. The brushes are very appealing to look at and do have a slight smell ( this is a result of the case) This didn&#x27;t bother me much as it wasn&#x27;t that bad. but i would save my money to get some brushes that are worth it.I am looking to returning them and getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Product is very nice but it was missing one brush. I slot near the larger brushes was empty and the first slt was empty</li>
            <li> After initial wash of brushes, the smell of plastic was gone. They are soft and work great..I .would recommend them .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really hold high hopes when first purchasing this brush set because of the really low price. Let me tell you, I am amazed and so happy with the quality of this set, it is almost too beautiful to use!!! My other brush set I use is from Sephora, which I paid close to $100 for. I had no idea I could find such a quality product like this...for SO CHEAP. I like it just as much as my Sephora set, maybe even a little bit more because it is in such a cute color! You really can&#x27;t go past the gorgeous baby pink. The brushes are really soft and fluffy, I&#x27;ve used them several times and none of the hair has come out of any of them. I also LOVE the size of them, they are large and the handles are long in length but they store so neatly in the case it comes in, which is really soft as well. I also want to say the shipping on this item was amazing! I ordered it with standard shipping and it arrived in 3 days! ALSO, I have seen some people mention a smell or odor of plastic on the brushes or case. I have not had this problem, they don&#x27;t smell at all. So so happy with this set, probably one of my favorite beauty purchases. Definitely order this ladies!!!</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are pretty much all the same and none of them work for blending or contouring the lid. The face brushes pick up little product and are not dense enough.</li>
            <li> They are good Brushes</li>
            <li> it is nice. presentable as gift . looks expensive but the price is fair. Ok for personal use. i bought 6 sets of this just to stock at home for future gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> I like My brushes but upon opening my package i noticed I was missing two brushes. Which saddened me.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my package but I was highly disappointed when I open the package to find tinny little brushes that look totaly tinier than what it shows in the picture. It is not even stong enough to aply any thing. Waste of my $$$.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! I get so many compliments and it&#x27;s so handy! I have a brush for every part of a face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made from a cheap material and you can tell. But they work fine for a beginner who&#x27;s learning..</li>
            <li> waited to use item.. its not that great for people who wear daily makeup.. i think its more for kids or minimal use.. does not hold product well.. soft brittles but does not apply like other brushes such as elf, mac, sephora</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these brushes, but disappointed when I opened them.  I know other reviewers have said that there are quite a few of the same brush in slightly different sizes, but I took a chance and got these anyway.  I don&#x27;t really mind that so much, what I do mind is how soft these brushes are! I feel like they don&#x27;t pick up any product at all.  The case and brushes did smell like chemicals when I opened it, but I don&#x27;t really mind that, it will go away.  For the price it was an ok set, and I&#x27;ll probably continue buying different types of cheaper brushes, because I refuse to spend $30 on a single brush.  I&#x27;m sure after a while I&#x27;ll have amassed a collection that I can use for different purposes, and have extras for non-makeup use as well.  I&#x27;m not totally disappointed, didn&#x27;t really expect much from this set to begin with.</li>
            <li> Bad quality， and look cheap. I am so disappointed of the product.  I can get something a lot better from the dollar store. I am not going use them. I  would give no star.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are deformed and look as thought a chunk was taken out of the bristles. Don&#x27;t waste your $. Buy from someone else.</li>
            <li> very nice quality although the selection of brushes is.... well... not that great i guess. for the price, i cannot complain at all. they&#x27;re nice. i haven&#x27;t had any trouble with shedding and ive been using them for a while. my shadow brushes are a bit stiff but again... price. i can go out and buy whatever ones i need to replace. dont expect MAC quality but these are definitely nice</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my brushes. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> When I was considering buying theses brushes, I wasn&#x27;t sure because some reviews were good and some were bad. But when I received it, it was nicely packaged and it was really nice. The brushes were great and SOOO SOFT!!!! It had a really good variety and I thought they were great! I have had no problems with them and I had them for less than a week. The only thing that I dislike about these brushes are that they are VERY SOFT so they are a little bit flimsy. I wanted to use the fan brush for contour but I don&#x27;t think it will turn out so great because the bristles are so soft and flimsy. Only the fan brush and the smaller brushes didn&#x27;t work out awesome. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are awesome brushes especially for the price, but for me they are just a little too soft. The smaller brushes I tried to use as lip brushes but It didn&#x27;t pick up the product that well. But other than that, they are awesome! :)</li>
            <li> I got these for my sister as a xmas gift this past year and she loved them! I did too! They were stincky but she washed them and they were good. But the only thing wrong about them is that there was ONE brush missing! Overall i give them a 7.5</li>
            <li> Awesome! was what I expected. totally recommend it, if i could i would totally buy another one lol its awesome</li>
            <li> The shipping was on time estimated.  But the brushes smell, and only the big one&#x27;s you can uses becase they&#x27;re soft, the little ones super hard but you can uses it for your children manually projects.</li>
            <li> Quality product, love the brushes. They are just what i was looking for.fast shipment will be ordering from them again! Thank you</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are soft and pretty, but they do not work very well. They do not pick up product very well, which makes it hard to apply my makeup. For the price it is a nice set, with tons of different types and shapes of brushes, but I don&#x27;t hardly use any of them. I would say I might use maybe 5 out of the 22 brushes. Would not re-purchase. Would be a good set for a beginner, or a teen looking to just have a first set of brushes, but a medium level to professional level makeup artist would not like them.</li>
            <li> This brushes, are really good, they are really pretty the pink color is not that vibrant, they are the softest brushes i have ever feel wich i am so happy about, they havent shed on me and i already wash them, they are really good material brushes even though not all of them are , theres a couple of them that doesnt pack a lot of product i dont know if thats the way they are supposed to be but i found a good use for them too so i am happy about that too , people were conplaining about a strong smell wich mine dont have , the little pink case looks like its made out of a durable material and is pretty, overall i think not only for the price of it you are getting really good brushes i would really recommend trying them i use them every single they and they have perform pretty amazing.. really happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> These are awesome quality for the price! They don&#x27;t shed at all, they wash well, and most of all, they work well! Love them!</li>
            <li> I was looking for in all and one set and was skeptical at first, I no longer am. These brushes are amazing and clean up in a snap. I am a frequent user of all colors of eye shadows and this allows me the freedom to use them all without going HMMMMMMM which brush.. They are all laid out flat right before your very eyes, then you roll it right back up...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner with makeup. I&#x27;ve purchased these brushes awhile ago but only started implementing them into my makeup routine about four months months ago. These are great for anyone starting off with makeup. There&#x27;s a great variety of brushes. Most of them are flat and small so they&#x27;re great for applying mostly eye makeup and getting product onto the crevices of your face. The only downside is that there really no good eye shadow blending brush in this kit and the big powder brush is a little too fluffy and not dense enough to apply powder or foundation. Nonetheless, the brush set is still very workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the brushes, I have no experienced any shedding whatsoever. I knocked off a star because there are some hairs on the bristles that aren&#x27;t aligned perfectly. I wash these brushes every other week and they&#x27;ve been holding up very well.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, but you get what you pay for. The bristles are awesome! I just wished that the glue held onto the brush more.</li>
            <li> Great deal, a million brushes, no more blush where your bronzer should be going because you are too lazy to wash the brush, you don&#x27;t have to wash that ONE eye shadow brush every time you change colors anymore, pink&#x27;s cute, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Not wonderful , the powder brushes are too soft for foundation but good for blending and blush . but for the money very nice.</li>
            <li> Good product with a variety of brushes. Not high end quality but will definitely get the job done. Perfect for the beginning makeup user</li>
            <li> I just received the mines today and I have to say I am very impressed $10 for these amazing brushes you wont never find brushes like these I say as a make up artist they are better than Mac those people who say that they shred they do not you probably put something on it you probably washed it with hot water are you did something but these brushes are great in order to clean him he needed by a brush set cleaner but there amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them long enough to see how well they hold up, but I like them so far. The color is cute.</li>
            <li> the brissles are soft and dont shed. I love it and i am glad i went with this one instead of the more expensive style.</li>
            <li> My brushes came and they looked sooooo cute until i pulled them out and half the brushes were broken!!! The brushes wouldn&#x27;t wash off the make-up residue on it and that are just TERRIBLE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!!!!! This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star.</li>
            <li> I really like this sets of make up brush, the shipping was fast. Every brush has a cover and its comes out with the nice pink case and the brush was really soft. I would love to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thought it was going to be cheap, but was surprizingly good quality, all brushes were soft and had excellent feel.</li>
            <li> These brushes are more for beginners than experienced people , but I have to say these are quite soft and they work pretty good except for the liquid foundation blender, it was too flimsy and soft for me to blend my foundation :( It really annoyed me so I had to pitch it but overall they&#x27;re good brushes :)</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it&#x27;s a great value for your money.  I will definitely recommend this to my friends and would&lt;br /&gt;definitely repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> i like the variety of different brushes but i dont like the quality in the hair of the brushes is not so good.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical because they were cheap but I am actually very pleased with the quality. Yes the bag did stink like paint but I just hung it outside for a couple days and it is fine now.</li>
            <li> Brushes are true to picture love the quality of the brushes . I use them everyday . Cute and stylish .</li>
            <li> Do not like that all the little brushes are practically the same shape and density. I do like the big brushes though, which is good I love how soft and fluffy they are. I guess it&#x27;s an ok set. Did not fill all my needs though would have liked more eye brushes available.</li>
            <li> Went out on a limb to try cheap low end brushes...and that&#x27;s what I got..cheap, low end brushes.  I have a mixture of drug store and high end brushes...these brushes sit in a drawer untouched. If its for a young teen that isn&#x27;t very serious about the look or precision, it would be okay.  But if your expecting anything more than crappy pink brushes you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like in love with these brushes. they feel a little flimsy but theyre is no shedding and theyre soft. Although it didnt come with an angled bronzer brush and a blending brush so that was a bummer. but great for the price.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes! Work great! Didn&#x27;t have a smell to them either.</li>
            <li> This are really pretty they work really nice</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful brush kit but the brushes where not attached to the Handel correctly and kept falling apart.</li>
            <li> The pictures do not do this product justice.  I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews because it&#x27;s simply not true.  For one, I received this product quickly (with Prime) and it was well packaged.  The bag was inside a plastic, and every brush was protected.  There was absolutely no shedding, and the first thing I did was wash my brushes with warm water and a bit of shampoo.  The brushes are so soft and pick up makeup so well.  So, if you are giving this product a bad review, you either got a defective product in which case you should contact the seller, or you didn&#x27;t wash the brushes first, and/or you don&#x27;t know how to apply makeup properly.</li>
            <li> I received all 22 pink tipped brushes. They are all so cute and wrapped in a cute pink bag which did have some sort of hardware smell to it that I oddly enjoy. I think this is a good starter/beginner kit. The brushes are soft. But some bristles come out. But I cut some of the brushes to the way I like it and that helped a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was an awesome purchase!~</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this set for the price. They don&#x27;t seem to shed at all and it is a really cute set. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> love my brushes. My daughter is teaching how to use each one of them.</li>
            <li> So I was excited to get these brushes and I got them and most of them are great, however the small fan like brush pretty much fell apart, I barely touched it and a hand full of the bristles came out, I have not tried using them yet because I just got them today, but they are very soft and except for the one brush that fell apart I have good expecttations for them.</li>
            <li> great set for it prices and anyone looking for a cheap decent makeup set. it does come unglued or at least it happen to me but great set</li>
            <li> They are so nice I love them</li>
            <li> I love it I use it everyday</li>
            <li> bought for mom. she loved it. comparable to brushes i purchased previously for over $40. soft. must wash before use has funky smell like chemicals but once washed . they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Loveee this set. When you get it, it needs to be left open for a few hours to let the &#x27;womderful&#x27; smell out.&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes though. They really hold on the color. Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t come with a blending brush :(</li>
            <li> I did not notice a funny smell to these brushes or anything. My only issue is that you have to clean them a lot for some reason they just get clogged and dirty really fast. They are great beginner brushes and i&#x27;m glad I got this set!</li>
            <li> Before purchasing I read the one to three star reviews and they are all incorrect. These brushes are very professional so if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing dont leave a negative review. I use them everyday and I recommend them to customers all the time. Each brush has a purpose. Learn how to use them then write reviews. These brushes are a 5/5. The company is fast and amazing. These brushes have lasted forever as well I&#x27;ve had them for 5 months.</li>
            <li> Looking for a brush set that has a professional feel this is it.  Enough brushes to do any style you have in mind, from office day time look to artistic over the top beauty makeup.  Will be ordering another set for my teenage daughter, cause this set is mine!</li>
            <li> IT TOOK LIKE 2 DAYS FOR ME TO GET THEM ,OF COURSE I WAS EXITED!!!ONCE I USED THEM I FELT IN LOVE WITH THEM I SPECIALLY  LOVE MY FAUNDATION BRUSH!!!!</li>
            <li> these brushes are really cute. but they&#x27;re too soft and don&#x27;t hold the makeup well, and after you use them it&#x27;s hard to get them back to their pink color. they&#x27;re cheap. i wouldn&#x27;t even recommend them to beginners because they dont hold the makeup or apply it well. and the bag isnt that cute either and smells like plastic really bad. i highly recommend ecotools brushes, they&#x27;re absolutely great and i love them.</li>
            <li> the brushes were really soft but because they&#x27;re synthetic I guess, it&#x27;s a bit harder to pick up the product. I didn&#x27;t like the foundation brush at all but it wasn&#x27;t really a huge deal for me cause I use a sponge anyway. no shedding at all and all you have to do to get rid of the plastic smell is air it out.</li>
            <li> its amazing for the price...truly!</li>
            <li> Due to the price you can&#x27;t expect much. Some brushes broke a few times after they were used. Had to glue with krazy glue back on.</li>
            <li> these tools would be okay to practice with but the glue for my is coming off and the brushes are falling apart however the brush  holder is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love these but the only problem with them is that they smell. otherwise the brushed are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for more than a year. I love the face brushes, fluffy and easy to clean. They have not shed which i love.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy the brushes are very soft and do not pick up any product I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this from CrazyCart for13.44 the shipping was free because,It was ground and would take 14-25 days , which I could have choose a faster ship but I&#x27;m cheap and didn&#x27;t mind the wait. I got my shipment earlier then I was told that made me. Sooooooo freaking happy and THE BRUSHES ARE PROFOUNDLY BEAUTIFUL AND DID NOT SHED AND ARE VERY SOFT, f ANYONE IN Who&#x27;s INTERESTED IN THESE  BRUSHES SHOULD GET THEM AT CRAZY CART STOREFRONT: )</li>
            <li> I actully really like this set. They have so many brushes in it. And they are all useful. I really like them all. And glad I bought it</li>
            <li> i love them they are everything you need for a beauty guru on a budget they are so nice except for the fan brushes they werent packaged correctly that they made a gap in the middle</li>
            <li> I have the Brush set for alittle over a couple or so months.. So far so good... The product was well packaged and arrived in excellent condition and timely manner... I will say that Washing and sterilizing is a must before use,as with any brush or brush set,they do carry abit of a smell... I had to wash a couple of times before due to lingering smell... SInce using this product Ive had to do away with 1 brush due to it falling apart from cleansing, and now experincing a couple with loose heads due to coming unglued at the base.... Little to no shedding hairs... for the amount of brushes and price, I would recommend to beginners and aspiring artist,...</li>
            <li> Soft durable and application is amazing not to mention it arrived in such a hurry I was surprised when it got here.  I&#x27;d recommend this to any one who is a novice in the world of make up</li>
            <li> The brushes are true to color, extremely soft and i love them!! The only thing was that when i first got them they smelled really weird it wasnt good but it wasnt horrible i ignored it and it has gone away. The only thing i hated was how long it took toget here since the company ships from china</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and I always have used upper end brushes. I saw these online and I devote to try. Tbh they are such a dupe to (---) brushes. They are great quality and definitely worth it</li>
            <li> cute set, soft bristles worth the purchase</li>
            <li> These brushes are AMAZING. So soft and great quality. The only thing that bothered me was the pink bag/holder they come in smells horrible..like chemicals. I got a instant headache..&lt;br /&gt;Honestly that does not really matter, it&#x27;s the brushes that count, which are again AMAZING. :) buy them!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes!!!! They are super soft and really cute being pink! I noticed they did have the odd smell everyone else commented on but I did as one of the comments said and soaked them in shampoo and now they smell just fine!</li>
            <li> The brushes were all good quality and all different usually brushes in a large amount as this is often filled with a lot of the same brushes but I was pleased with this set</li>
            <li> The quality is something I&#x27;m blown away with. Both people who they were gifts for have been raving about the softness. First time I have ordered from you and am impressed!</li>
            <li> Great value for what you get. These are nice brushes and apply makeup well, especially powders. I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of brushes for the price &amp; they&#x27;re a pretty girl - however, most of the brushes are too stiff to use and have a bad smell I just can&#x27;t get rid of regardless of the amounts of time I wash them. The only brushes that aren&#x27;t stiff and work well is the blush brush and the powder brush. I use both on a regular basis. Also, the eyebrow comb is nice to have. The rest just sit in my makeup collection collecting dust...wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this. You can buy better brushes from ELF cosmetics.</li>
            <li> has a ton of brushes all extremely well kept. super awesome to have</li>
            <li> I already have about a month with them and itotally love them they are just so perfect irecomand you to buy them (:</li>
            <li> i absolutely LOVE these brushes! they are super soft and great quality. after reading the reviews about bristles falling out and the smell of the bag, i wasn&#x27;t sure about buying them but for less than 50 cents a piece, it was totally worth it especially since i haven&#x27;t had a problem with either after 2 months of having these brushes. the only thing i wish these brushes had were labels on each brush to say what each brush is for. i labeled them myself though so it wasn&#x27;t a big issue. i HIGHLY RECOMMEND these brushes! they&#x27;re beautiful for a makeup junkie like myself (:</li>
            <li> This brush set is awful ! It is extremely soft which doesnt allow the product to stay on the brush. It sheds soooo much ! I have no idea how some persons said it didnot shed for them , because before I even washed it it started to shed. The smell eventually went away so that was not a problem. But! I will NEVER recommend this set to anyone, not even for beginners! Total wase of money!</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty and very soft they are synthetic for all you animal lovers which I good I guess when you wash them they don&#x27;t get tangled are bad but one brush sheds :( but that doesn&#x27;t matter besides that all the brushes were good I recommend this to makeup beginners are anyone in general well that&#x27;s it bye I tried to make this sound professional I think I did a goog job well I&#x27;ll stop typing now so bye</li>
            <li> I love this item. Great item and brushes are precise and very soft! The smell isn&#x27;t that bad just smells like rubber.</li>
            <li> I had initially purchased this item for my niece from her wish list. She has been using the brushes daily. So I decided to order the brushes. They are great!</li>
            <li> There all beautiful soft and work very well you are getting some of the same ones.but i love the them thank you</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is an amazing value!  The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t irritate the face; I&#x27;ve used them with a variety of products: pressed shadows and blushes, loose powders, cream shadows, eye primers, foundation, etc.  They handle all of the different product types very well, and you get 22 brushes for the price you pay for one brush from a high end brand.  I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now, doing heavy theatrical drag makeup looks, and I&#x27;ve had little to no bristle loss - there is nothing more annoying than having to pick a lost bristle out of your foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing value and definitely a great gift idea for someone looking to learn more about makeup application, experiment with different types of brushes, and any makeup diva who needs a new \\&quot;tool kit\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roll-up bag is also very well made and keeps the brushes protected.</li>
            <li> The Brushes are soft but when you get them they stank like cheap plastic the pink bag does 😩😩 that&#x27;s the only thing ion like ima be spraying some perfume on it before I give it to my sister for Christmas</li>
            <li> Es un kit bastante completo, las brochas son de buena calidad. El bolso rosado es bello. Me encanta.</li>
            <li> Two stars since the brushes are soft but not very well made. Some felt apart already and I just got it, not too long ago. I&#x27;m a little disappointed but it was cheap</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for them at all. Waste of money. They don&#x27;t  put makeup on good  &amp; can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this brush set.  It has been everything I expected and more.  Great for a five minute, everyday make-up and for those of us learning to do more complicated applications.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it I wanted it for my lil sis to play with but even so 3 brushes were broken and 2 were missing so not so happy I&#x27;m sending it back asap</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They are really cute, and work well. The brushes are a little hard to clean, but most makeup brushes I&#x27;ve had are. They come in a wonderful case and the big brushes are even covered. They are very soft, but the ones that need to be firm are without feeling like I&#x27;m raking my face. Fantastic! I love them, and couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist, and I saw these, loved the look and figured why not... even if I don&#x27;t like them it&#x27;s $15. I used them twice so far, and will say, they would be an alright set for beginners. The picture is what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: cute, cheap price, and easy to keep tidy&lt;br /&gt;Cons: same brush is definitely repeated, not very good for eyeshadow blending, smell is actually really, really bad so you will want to clean them and let them air out for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably give them to my little sister to play with because they won&#x27;t do me any good, but again a great buy for beginners!</li>
            <li> not very good quality brushes, I guess I get what I paid for</li>
            <li> Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> Brushes feel apart after a few uses. Handles came apart from the brushes.</li>
            <li> most of the brushes were broken and some missing but other than that they are pretty good</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, and I only use high quality most of the time. So glad I felt cheap and took a risk with these! I have Crown brushes and STILL use a lot of the brushes in this bag. People complained that they didn&#x27;t know what to use the big fan brush for. It is for contouring your cheeks and getting access dust off your face. I love these brushes! I wish they came with an eyeshadow blending brush, but that is my only complaint. These seriously rival my sigma brushes. I love these so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. The brushes are great quality for the your 10 dollars I spent on them. I had no shedding. The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> It was so difficult to pick from all of the brushes online but I&#x27;m glad I bought these. Yes they&#x27;re adorable and pink! They&#x27;re also extremely soft! The bigger brushes are really gentle on the face and the other ones are a bit stiffer but still soft! Basically, they&#x27;re all the right amount of soft or hard for what they&#x27;re meant to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of comments of people complaining that their brushes stunk but so what? It takes like 5 minutes to wash them and I would hope you would wash them anyways because it&#x27;s going on your face. The only thing that does smell a little funky is the pink case it comes with. I just aired it outside for a couple of days and the smell kinda faded. Lastly, one of my handles was disconnected from the brush part but nothing a little super glue and 30 seconds can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the item had its glitches but I&#x27;m not picky. But let&#x27;s make it clear that just because i&#x27;m not picky doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t have standards. The brushes work well when applying make-up and again are super cute.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to receive 3 broken brushes.. very disappointed that happened. luckily I glued them back together but then again who wants to receive broken brushes.. nobody! other than that the brushes are soft and good.</li>
            <li> I just received my package and was amazed with how big it was . I immediately compared my old brushes to this and just laughed at how small my old brushes were compared to these . The powder brushes are soo soft and fluffy; the eye shadow and concealer brushes are stiff (which they should be) and perfect for application!! It does have a scent to it but nothing serious …I actually thought it smelled fresh *shrug*.I love the bag that holds them, the number of brushes I received and how fast my package came . I ordered Thursday it was shipped Friday and I received it on Monday! Anyways the  brushes are awesome and I am very satisfied…don&#x27;t stare so much just buy it! ;-) you won&#x27; t regret it.</li>
            <li> This brush set feels amazing no shredding., and picks up the eyeshadow well also it blends it well. It came on time</li>
            <li> i only found use out of 5 of them. Most are just similar to eachother and a little too big to be eyeshaow brushes. The eyeshadow brushes are a little hard bristled at first but they get soft after a while of using. Its a good price considering that youre getting 22 pieces.</li>
            <li> Very neat and adorable set of make up brushes. They aren&#x27;t attached very well but the work perfectly fine with or without the handle. I&#x27;ve ony had one handle break apart from the brush and I&#x27;ve had this set for over three months. It may just be from over use of the make up brush, which is the most likely answer. I honestly recommend this product to any girl out there. It&#x27;s cheap and very well worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes ( read: I don&#x27;t even know what they&#x27;re all for) but the quality is excellent and I have NO complaints.  There is a kind of off-gassing smell when you first open the package, but it goes away quickly.  Best price online, too!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft.The bag the brushes comes with is kinda flimsy. They are high quality brushes for super cheap.</li>
            <li> Well because my daughter never had that many brushes in her life so she&#x27;s gonna have a blast working with them she&#x27;s an artist and tattoo artist too so she knows her makeup now it&#x27;s on baby</li>
            <li> Two of the tips broke off, but I managed to fix it after gluing it back on. It DOES smell. I&#x27;m letting it air out right now, but I don&#x27;t know if the smell would go away. Some brushes are totally useless, but it was cheap. Also, it looks really nice and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  I got them yesterday, cleaned and conditioned them and they are not only pretty, but they are super soft and other than a few hairs falling out when I cleaned them (that&#x27;s normal), they are perfect.</li>
            <li> I order this for my 20 year old bestfriend/roommate for christmas and she loved it. The brushes were very soft and nothing was sheding off of the and the color was right on. She like they because it had a sense of girlyness to them. This was my first time ever buying anything off the internet.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes as a gift for my 18 year old niece&#x27;s birthday and she loved them. Thank you</li>
            <li> The set looks exactly as shown in the picture. Color was cute. Brush is good to use. It&#x27;s a little smelly but endurable. Hopefully the smell will disappear later.</li>
            <li> So cute and girly love it and the brushes are so soft and are good quality need to get them if you are in a budget it comes with a lot of brushes and the belt case with cover protectors for the big brushes :)</li>
            <li> These are pretty good brushes. I did have to buy a couple more separately for my needs but most of what I need is here. I love the pink. The case does come in smelling awful but I gave it a few sprays of perfume and hung it outside and that helped the smell. I only put them in the case if I am traveling with them so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Took forever to ship. By time it arrived I forgot what I had even purchased. But overall I&#x27;m happy, it&#x27;s nice to have a brush for your every make up need. As far as the smell, I don&#x27;t know. Mine are not that strong smelling</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t professional, but they are soft and nice to use. Really good for painting in acrylic or oil as well.</li>
            <li> These were ok. Some of the brushes fell off. So I hot glued them back on</li>
            <li> I got my brushes very fast. I love them because they are very soft and easy to clean :)&lt;br /&gt;The best thing was the affordable price !!!</li>
            <li> So I got mine today and I&#x27;m so stoked about it. Me and my sister are both in winterguard and these will be perfect for not only everyday makeup but show makeup as we&#x27;ll. the only problem I have with the is that when I got them out of there plastic about 4 or 5 broke. The metal part came off with the applicator. I was able to fix it but I still wish that it didn&#x27;t happen. The brushes in the end are perfect for me and my sister and I&#x27;m happy I got them.</li>
            <li> Excelente el producto. recomendado 100 % a muy buen precio. el envio fue rapido y llego en buenas condiciones. muy bien todo</li>
            <li> These brushes were awful, but they really weren&#x27;t amazing either. I do not think I would recommend this to any one.</li>
            <li> Despite the bad experiences some people had with these brushes, I found them to be awesome. They are cute, soft, and there are tons of them. They were also relatively inexpensive, which I liked a lot.&lt;br /&gt;That is all.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why these are rated so high. Maybe the price. They are cheap and the glue wears of easily. Also no dense at all :c I knew it would be a stretch to get good brushes for so cheap, but i think people need to be honest about these brushes. ELF I think makes better brushes for a cheap line.</li>
            <li> Just received these as a x mas gift for my daughter who is a make-up fanatic. She knows whats good and what isn&#x27;t. She isn&#x27;t going to be happy w there. Maybe 1 or 2. That&#x27;s not enough for $20. Shipping and handling was half the price of the gift. Not satified.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft, they made a great gift for my niece.  The pink is adorable and you just can&#x27;t beat how many brushes you get for the price!</li>
            <li> Terrible brushes. Cheap! Get what u pay for</li>
            <li> I am a college student who does makeup for fashion shows and these are really nice simply because they dont fall apart, they don&#x27;t shed and they&#x27;re soft. The synthetic fibers are better for make up artist because it is very easy to wash without shedding. LOVED IT, and a really good price. Especially for a college student.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t have made a better decision choosing brushes. they are so soft and do not shed at all! I highly reccomend them!</li>
            <li> Brushes are high quality and very pretty. I love them. It was a very very good deal and good buy!</li>
            <li> In love with these brushes I do make up for pageants prom important dates and they&#x27;re amazing I don&#x27;t care what people say I love these brushes even tho my fan brush did fall apart but it&#x27;s nothin. I cant fix and the smell of paint was strong but whatever!</li>
            <li> They look soft and lovely in the photo. They even look soft and lovely when you open the pack. The eye shadow brushes are hard and not easy to use. The hardness keeps you from being able to pick up the powder so you are struggling to apply eye-shadow. The blush brush is a little softer but nothing like I thought. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Save your money!!...unless ur buying for a little girl.! Cheap cheap cheap &amp; stiffer than a dead body.! I don&#x27;t know if in the description it says \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bristles but they are NOT! Next time I will shed out a few extra bucks for a different brand. Would love to try sigma brushes but too expensive!</li>
            <li> These brushes are a very pretty pink, and they are beautiful.! Requires weekly cleaning, they get dirty very fast. But other than that, amazing amazing brushes.</li>
            <li> These are SO cheaply made. Almost all of the heads have fallen off of each. Go with something a bit more expensive, these will definitely disappoint!</li>
            <li> The price for these brushes was what caught my eye.  Unfortunately, they are not as well made as i had hoped.  Had i known these were coming from China, i would have never ordered.  I had to wait too long.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonably priced bundle of brushes to add to my collection. I usually use Real Techniques or EcoTools but it started adding up after a while. These came within a week after ordering which was surprising because I was sure it&#x27;d at least be a few weeks before seeing them, so that was the first plus. The pink bag has a strong plastic odor to it after unrolling, but after you air it out it&#x27;s fine. The bristles are soft as can be, great for sensitive skin like mine! I just love everything about these brushes and WILL buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> these brushes are very pretty but the quality is not what i expected... some of the brushes that i used for the first time came apart so i had to glue them back together. other then that they work fine..it does what they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I ordered these first and foremost because of the color! The brushes are very soft. They do smell a bit but I know that will go away once I remove them from the bag and packaging. I would repurchase this as a gift for a friend or relative.</li>
            <li> I purchased these a few months ago and they work wonderfully! I seen some reviews of people complaining they fall apart and that they wash them, for my brushes I just blow the makeup off or flick them on my palm and they stay in perfect shape and the make up I used previously doesn&#x27;t mix with the new. I don&#x27;t see a need to wash unless your sticking them in things they are not meant to be used with and if they aren&#x27;t the perfect white and pink who cares, no one sees my brushes they see my makeup! I would definately recommend these!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so pretty and soft. Took some time to get here but its worth the wait. They are just as the seller described and i couldnt wait to appy my make-up this morning! Love it!!! Pretty in Pink!!</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. Thought I had ordered a Mac product. Brushes are not that good. Won&#x27;t order again, sorry.</li>
            <li> Many of these brushes are exactly what I wanted and excellent. They all have soft bristles and so far I haven&#x27;t had much shedding. There are too many fan and big powder brushes for my taste, however. Why do I need four giant powder brushes that are nearly identical? I don&#x27;t. But I love all the small ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is a noisy, smelly plastic that I threw out. I have a friend making me a cloth case instead.</li>
            <li> My initial review of this produce is below....I have this item for some months now, and I only use this set not even 5x a month, I have dailiy brush set that I use. So with that in mind, I have had over 4 brushes break...just broke...at first i said okay, no biggie...but as they continue to break I am dissapointed. Yes its a good price, but you will not get your money worth. I will not be buying another set. they are cute, just dont get the job done. If your an everyday make up user this is NOT the set for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off this item came sooner than expected. packaged nicely. I love the pink color and the brush holder it comes with. The brush holder and the brushes had a funny smell to the. but after a wash in some baby shampoo they were smelling ggod and soft to the touch. Very cute, everybody will be asking you..\\&quot;where did you get this\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> These are good if u want good affordable brushes...</li>
            <li> I love the brushes and the case it comes in! Mine did not smell and the brushes work sooooo good! 3 of them came apart but I glued it back together and they where good as new!! I&#x27;m glad I bought these</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. It came in just like it looks in the pictures. :-) Its a fun item to add to your vanity.</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazing. They are super soft and hold product well. weird smell when i first got them but it went away quickly. LOVE.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this set of brushes i wasn&#x27;t really sure but after reading all of your the 5 star reviews i&#x27;m exited... i will follow with a review once i receive them.....</li>
            <li> My older sister was in need of some makeup brushes so i bought these for her. she loved them.  they looked to be really good quality,plus they aren&#x27;t very expensive. i might end up buying myself a set in the future. :)</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife and she absolutely LOVED the brush set.  It was a perfect gift for her, the brushes are soft and the pink bag was the perfect match for the set.  Would not hesitate to order these again.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes and everything but they are already popping the tops off, breaking so I have to super glue them.</li>
            <li> Ordered these brushes and am just in love with them and they are so soft and I live the color!  I&#x27;ve noticed some reviews complaining that they started to fall apart after 6 months or so. But ummm hello! For 15 bucks this is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes suck the only good one its the big blush one. They don&#x27;t blend any eyeshadow at all disappointed :&lt;(</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this for Christmas and the brushes are so soft and I love the bag easy for traveling!</li>
            <li> Okay so like most of you, I was in the business of finding some good quality brushes without having to shell out too much money. I came across these brushes and fell in love with the pink bristles! I read the reviews and decided to go ahead and purchase them. They got to me in less than 5 days which was nice! I opened up the package and was immediately disappointed. They smell as if I opened up a can of paint, ugh. I thought maybe I could air them out and the smell would go away, wrong! Ignoring the smell, I decided to use my new brushes to get ready to go out for the night. Well that was quite a task because these brushes didn&#x27;t seem to pick up any of the product. Reading everyone&#x27;s amazing reviews I was expecting better quality but I didn&#x27;t get that at all... Don&#x27;t expect amazing brushes cause you will be disappointed. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for. Out of this whole 22 pc set I can only seem to use 3 of them. Next time I will spend the extra couple of bucks and buy some higher end brushes :/</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! They did have a really weird smell to them when I opened them. Like a pleather or spray paint smell so I left the bag open for a day or so and let it air out and washed all the brushes and the smell subsided but once in awhile I still catch a whif of it. The other downside is I wish they were labeled what brush is to be used for what. There are so many of them and some so little difference in size that I don&#x27;t know what is for what but all in all not a bristle has been shed when washing them. I&#x27;ve had these for a couple months or so and use them everyday and have yet to loose a bristle. I&#x27;ve bought other brush sets and they have shed all over my face everytime. They would leave black pieces of bristles all over my face. These are the best bang for your buck for no shed, high quality brush set. They didn&#x27;t arrive on time by the estimated delivery date. They showed up like 3 days after but I had ordered another item as well that was shipped in the same box. But if you air out the case and wash the brushes the smell goes away for the most part and they defiantly serve their purpose and then some!! :)</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes. Zero shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Super pretty, I don&#x27;t so much like the case but that&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to clean.. Over all I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> I love this product! it&#x27;s super easy to use clean and store! travels well and is super easy to pack</li>
            <li> These brushes were too soft and didn&#x27;t pick up any make up. They also smelled very badly, I ended up throwing them away because they were useless.</li>
            <li> Soft and in pristine condition. Package does have slight smell but very un noticable.</li>
            <li> alot of the heads on the brushes fell off when i opened it the big fan brush just fell of the handle was not pleased</li>
            <li> I must say, this product is amazing! I love it! Them brushes are super soft and them bag is beautiful. Would make a great birthday or Christmas gift. I&#x27;m a happy girl right now</li>
            <li> I just got these today and I like it. It&#x27;s smell a litlle bit but you got what you paid for so I don&#x27;t mind. By the way, it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> i just got these as a christmas gift and there amazing i love them there really soft and easy to use there also very pretty for any girl that likes pink</li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift for my younger sister. She is 20 years old and always watches those makeup tutorials saying things like she wish she could do what they are doing in the video. So I bought her first REAL makeup brush set and she is in love.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love my new brushes. I gave them a rating of 5 because the brushes were better than I expected. Great for coverage and no shedding of the bristles. The only thing I did not like was the brushes were not labled. Other than that i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> came much faster than expected. by at least 2 weeks. these brushes are great. they are soft, work well, and they are pretty and come inside of a cute case. the only mad thing is that it smelt terrible when arrived (i just opened the case and positioned it in front of a fan and the smell went away after a few hours)</li>
            <li> I bought these cause I read the good reviews I should of known. Not worth the money. I barely use them. They had a funny odor when I received them.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the brush set when I first got it even though there were pretty bad reviews, but once I started using it, I disliked it more and more. The reason why I gave this a rating of 2 stars is because the eye shadow brushes are too flat, they do not collect my naked pallet eye shadows even though it is really pigmented. I only use 3 out of the 18 brushes, which are the brushes for the face. Yes, they are soft, but only the face brushes, the eye brushes are too stiff and thin. Now I see why there are many people giving away similar brush sets. I wouldn&#x27;t re-order it even if the powder brushes broke, but would recommend it to starters even though there are even better brush sets for starters.</li>
            <li> I honestly dont think this is worth it but I only bought it cause it was pink lol . Oh and it smells funny</li>
            <li> Great brushes and the price is well worth it. They don&#x27;t shed and apply makeup with little effort. I would recommended this brushes. I am a makeup artist and have purchased many many brushes. You will love these.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I got the item very quickly. I have prime so it was suppose to come in two days but I got it the very next day which was great. Who doesnt love coming home to packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in this pink carry case. Cute color and cute case except it smells like plastic gel. It was really bad smell but I didnt need the carry bag anyway so I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are very soft and cute pink color (my favorite color). They dont hold up as well as the more expensive ones but pretty good for daily use. To compare I have bare mineral brushes and have had them for 3 years. I clean them every month and they work perfectly fine. These brushes I cleaned just before use and some strains have already fallen apart not much but I doubt they will last over a year but still good brushes for the price and you get different sizes.</li>
            <li> Good set has stayed together and not broken used daily since christmas.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  Yes, the case does an odor when you get it but, once it is out and you remove all of the plastic it is fine.</li>
            <li> Affordable, gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Love the color. Great compact carrying case. Brushes are super soft, but stiff enough for application. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I first got them. they are very soft but about a month later one by one the glue gave out and they fell apart. ) :</li>
            <li> Upon checking around other sites, this set of brushes are a great buy.  They are so soft and finally, no more black loose bristles on my face.</li>
            <li> Product came on time. The brushes were soft and good quality. Customer service was great. Definitely recommend these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and cute! I love the pink &amp; white colors. I didn&#x27;t use the storing case, but it was handy, but cheap looking. The hair in the brushes don&#x27;t fall out, stay soft &amp; straight.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with many tools &amp; I dont even use all of them since there is so many. You will surely have every brush you&#x27;ll need in this bundle. I highly recommend these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan 2016 update: These brushes are still doing me justice! Still soft to the touch, no smelly brushes, no hair falling out, and the pink is still pink! I would have thought these brushes would have fallen apart by now, but they still look fairly new. One of the brushes I use on a daily basis, the handle has become loose, but with a push back in, it&#x27;s back to normal. Still loving them!</li>
            <li> these are the worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever worked with.  I&#x27;ve had better results using the pharmacy store brands.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.  you can get affordable pro brushes thru MorpheBrushes, stigma, etc</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.  I admit that the chose them because of the color (so much PINK).  They larger brushes are extremely soft and work very well.  The smaller brushes aren&#x27;t quite as soft, but still do a nice job.  I did not notice a strong smell that others are commenting on, but I also didn&#x27;t buy them for the case and do not store them in the case (which seems to be the source of everyone&#x27;s complaints).  I also washed the brushes right away before using them, but that should be a given, no?</li>
            <li> this one was okay only because when they opened it one of the brushes was kinda messed up. And their kinda thin . But I like the way they look and I haven&#x27;t used them so I don&#x27;t know how they work it. But overall it was an OK experience</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Have had this less than a month and three brushes have already broke.  Not worth the money for it</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! The case did smell when i got it, but i left it out and the smell went away. I washed the brushes BEFORE i used them on my face, which got off all fallout hairs. None of the hairs on the brushes have come off since. LOVE these!</li>
            <li> I love this set! Very big! Cute. Stylish. Portable.&lt;br /&gt;Works great! I received this in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to receive this!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to any girl teen woman anyone!Great gift as well!</li>
            <li> The brushes are actualy soo soft and dont come off when washing no paint nor hair falls off justt greatt and no smell either totally worth getting :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are just beautiful!!! I personally dont like pink but I bought these because of the price and the # of brushes. Now I said I dont loke pink but with these brushes I now love pink. It comes with a nice pouch for them. There might be very little fall outs but like I said VERY LITTLE. All of the brushes arent the same they can be used for the same things and many many more uses. I am really satisfied with this product&lt;3</li>
            <li> So, when I was looking at these brushes, I was sooo skeptical - even after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;WORRIES-&lt;br /&gt;1) I was worried about the QUALITY.&lt;br /&gt;2) I was worried that the handles would be CHEAP.&lt;br /&gt;3) I was worried about the SIZE!&lt;br /&gt;4) The SMELL everyone was talking about!&lt;br /&gt;REALITY-&lt;br /&gt;1) The quality is GREAT! Brushes are surprisingly SUPER soft!!&lt;br /&gt;2) The handles have a good MODERATE feel; not a cheap nor expensive feeling to them.&lt;br /&gt;3) The average size of all the brushes is about 7 INCHES.&lt;br /&gt;4) The case smells just like PAINT and will eventually fade away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super happy with this purchase! - $20.00 is like paying $1.00 for each brush, which isn&#x27;t bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s super hard to make the decision and take the risk of buying make up brushes online, but honestly, these are worth it! Something affordable and great quality!  I absolutely love the case and the shade of pink that it comes in!&lt;br /&gt;**I ordered these brushes YESTERDAY, and I got them before dinner time today! Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I love these brushs their very soft n I love the bag it came with.. Also it came fast n on time lol so if ur thinking about getting them I promise u won&#x27;t regreat it, because I haven&#x27;t! :-)</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY surprised when I got my set because I based the purchase off the other reviews and with such a ratio of positive to negative, I thought, &amp;#34;These have to be seriously awesome.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Two of the brushes broke as soon as I pulled them out. Literally, the metal piece and brush parts just popped right off. Since I luckily had a hot glue gun and could fix them, I wasn&#x27;t too mad, but I did go through and check out the rest of the set. With a little bit of a pull I got tops to pop off about 6 brushes.&lt;br /&gt;2. The bristles will hold the color you&#x27;re using (though I only rinsed them with water, this may be different with a professional cleaner)--so basically they stain, but oh well.&lt;br /&gt;3. The holder smells, just so you know. I tossed that thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The sticks are sturdy, so they&#x27;re not liable to break.&lt;br /&gt;2. The bristles are soft and hold whatever makeup you&#x27;re using well.&lt;br /&gt;3. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and don&#x27;t seem to fray/spread (you know, like how a toothbrush needs to be replaced after so long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I&#x27;m on on the fence about recommending them, hence the 3 star rating. If you don&#x27;t mind a bit of initial maintenance, it&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> The hairs on these brushes fall out everytime i use them or wash them.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made, but useable.  I will not be ordering this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> It Was like getting a bunch of hard Concealer brushes. It was total crap! Then if you send it back you hardly get your money back because of shipping. It was just stupid and a waste of time getting these.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!  I was scared at first because of the reviews but when i got them! it was in a perfect condition and i love the little pink bag they came in with!!!! totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I have only used the brushes once, but the were great. The pink bag is gorgeous and well constructed. Each brush is well covered.</li>
            <li> arrived super fast, the product is great, soft brushes, nice quality, and the carrying case is super cute. Can&#x27;t wait to use these on clients!</li>
            <li> The price is great! the pink bag is great it is easy to keep the brushes organized.  However, the brushes do shed hair when applying makeup.  I also loved how quickly I received the item.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister who is an avid makeup user. She loves these. They are the softest brushes I have seen in a long time. I have a different set that are not nearly as soft. The case makes them easy to keep together and to store. The are a great buy for the price by far. I would buy the set again if I needed them. We have had them for almost 6 months and they have held up nicely with daily use and routine washing. I don&#x27;t know if she uses all the brushes in the set, but it was still cheaper than buying them individually. These are just great!</li>
            <li> really cute color, I love pink but one of the brushes was like bent idk. Overall good quality</li>
            <li> Love it! Great for beginners!&lt;br /&gt;Take time to clean if you don&#x27;t maintain it well like I do but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> One of the brushes arrived broken.</li>
            <li> love the colors, love the softness of the bristles and its actually A LOT bigger then i thought, couldn&#x27;t get a clear pic because of the length</li>
            <li> im so normally not about pink but i cant stop playing with this brush set. well made and cute and sooo soft heh. now i need to find cute make up to use with these &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love pink, these are pink, they are soft and very professional. I feel ashamed from doing my makeup before I had these. I recommend these 100% They got here fast, and arrived in perfect condition. I had no problems with this seller! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Bought as a gift for my sister, but As soon as I saw it, boy do I want one bad!!!!</li>
            <li> Received my order on time! Very happy with the product. I rated a four star because I have not yet used the brushes. But my first impression they look and feel great! I love the color and style. They look so nice I&#x27;m not sure I want to use them! Lol. But I&#x27;m very satisfied, thank you!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got these in on time and lemme tell you, I WAS WAITING For bad smell of the bag and brushes to lose hair after swiping thru a couple of time and NONE OF THAT HAPPENED! At least not to me! I washed it too and they are jus adorable to have! must buy!</li>
            <li> I adore these brushes! I love the colors, that was the main reason I wanted them. The bristles are very soft. They pick up product well, and my makeup blends so perfectly and effortlessly with these brushes! As I noted in some other reviews when I first opened the package the brush roll and brushes did smell quite strongly like paint. You&#x27;re supposed to wash your brushes before using them though - after I washed them and they dried they just smelled &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; - nothing offensive left behind. I also tossed the brush roll into the washer with a load of towels and hung it up to dry. It still has a faint &amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34; smell as expected - it&#x27;s just the nature of that material - but it&#x27;s not as bad as when I first opened up the package. I have had no issues with shedding. They clean up as well as any other makeup brushes after they&#x27;ve been used a bit and need washed to remove product build-up in the bristles. I do think the set could be a bit more complete if some fluffier eye shadow brushes, a blending brush, and a pencil brush or two were included, perhaps instead of a couple of the smaller brushes that are in the set. There are a few brushes that are very similar in size and shape but I would not call it &amp;#34;repetitive&amp;#34; as a couple other reviewers did. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty well-rounded set that will cover most makeup application needs. I really love the large fan brush, it is perfect for blush and highlighter. I really love this set and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This brushes suck! I am not even going to try and use them instead I&#x27;m just going to return them. When I opened them my whole room smelled of this really disgusting plastic smell. There is 7 almost identical brushes. The lack of variety of eye brushes is just horrible; They are either concealer-like brushes or eyeliner brushes. Just save your money and buy something else...</li>
            <li> I own this brush set for a month now and it have not failed me once! I use it every day and wash them after each use...so far so good! There&#x27;s no shedding just a strong smell when I first took it out of the box but the smell is gone now. Great brush!</li>
            <li> The smell was so bad it stunk my room!!!! I am a major germs phobic I washed all the brushes with a bit of my Mac brush cleaner, mixed with a bit of shampoo in water. The case I threw in my laundry basket I washed it and it doesn&#x27;t  smell anymore. Other than that I have used the brushes and I really love them, if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like harsh brushes then this is good for you! If you do like stiffer brushes then this product would not be for you. The brushes are super super soft almost like cotton lol. I would&#x27;ve given this product 5 stars but I really coyuldnt stand the smell</li>
            <li> My wife got this and she did not like them they are to sheap and she does not use them anymore</li>
            <li> This was well worth the price! Very soft brushes for synthetic! Only complaint I have is that the eye shadow brushes do not work well with Urban Decay shadows.....but I do not regret the buy!</li>
            <li> This are a very cute collection of brushes, like de quality too... I have Mac brushes and too faced brushes and even though the too faced are my favorite this collection it&#x27;s pretty good considering the price...</li>
            <li> What perfect little brushes! Every size, every shape, for every need.  I&#x27;m a student of cosmetology and these have not disappointed me at all.  The brushes are so soft, they blend well, they&#x27;re easy to take care of... I recommend buying a brush shampoo.  It&#x27;ll keep your brushes clean and super soft inbetween applications.</li>
            <li> I love this color so I already love it when I first opened it, has a slight weird smell but honestly, just open up the pouch and let it air for a while and it&#x27;ll be fine. Washed the brushes. They are soft to the touch and works great so far. I would recommend it for its price and quality.</li>
            <li> I use to use the Bare Minerals brushes but my puppy got ahold of them and destroyed them. So I decided I would give some cheaper brushes a shot until I could but some nice ones, but these are by far the best brushes I have ever used they are so dense and soft you would think they came from sephora.  I will NOT be needing to buy any new brushes for a long time</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 sets of these brushes from a different website. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. I found these for 1/2 the price and better quality. I will purchase from this seller again. This set was for my step-daughter and she loves them! Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Where to begin... The sizes of the brushes where too big and impossible to handle. Will not fit into anything. Yes, the brushes were soft - but it collects no makeup so it doesn&#x27;t even serve it&#x27;s purpose. Out of the 22 brushes I&#x27;ve found a good 5 that&#x27;s \\&quot;acceptable\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this brushes are very soft has everything I need for an everyday look. I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the softest things! It kind of feels like a really fluffy dogs tail. 2 of my fan brushes got folded over when it was wrapped up but all of my other brushes are fine. There are like ten different eye shadow brushes, two fan brushes, a concealer brush, two powder brushes, one brush with a very flat top, about two lip brushes, one smudge brush, mascara brush, and one eye brow comb. The smell of the bag smells like very processed plastic so I&#x27;m just going to move it all into a container. The brushes themselves don&#x27;t smell at all. Overall, this was a great purchase and it came right on time :)</li>
            <li> Well for the price amazingly cute by the way and cheap price....first of all yes they are not brand quality but they are workable in my case .... I use them for all things put foundation blush put my night cream on yes some are too soft but even for those u can find use especially for blush i have used mac brushes and they still break ... The best brushes i have ever found to my like are the bamboo brushes they do no break and great quality but i think this ones can match to them they are so cute and no they are not of brand but work perfectly</li>
            <li> I gave this item five stars because this is a great set of brushes. And I love Pink. I would recommend this product to anyone who Loves make-up as much as I do.</li>
            <li> There is such a selection of brushes in this set!! I mean 22 is a lot! They are VERY soft!! Feels like rabbit fur! The bristles are well attached to the handle and the case is very nice as well. I love them!</li>
            <li> I love these!!!!!!! They are amazingly soft and a brush for everything. No need to buy expensive brushes that don&#x27;t do the job. These work amazingly.</li>
            <li> great price and the color is amazing. the only problem is the packaging has a very loud plastic smell. The brissles are soft and I see myself ordering another set in the near future. Oh and they shipped way before the estimated time.</li>
            <li> AMAZING BRUSHES! These brushes work very very well. They get the job done and for a great price as well!</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter for Christmas.  She wanted to have some nice cosmetic brushes.  The brushes are nicely made, work great, and best of all weren&#x27;t to expensive.  She is thrilled with them, and uses them everyday.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES AND THE CASE THEY COME IN! I do my makeup everyday and these brushes are such good quality. They came on time and in great condition..Theyre wonderful! I dont know why some of the reviews complain about the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; as soon as you air them out it goes away.</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself and so far they are great. They look great and I&#x27;ve only gotten the chance to try a couple of the brushes but they don&#x27;t shed and they do their job well.</li>
            <li> Has a lot in it and it is just what I needed to go back to school with. I am so excited to use it when I go to school.</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazingly soft and pretty i havent used them yet because im waiting on my new coastal scents palettes but so far so good :)</li>
            <li> Three brushes were missing in the bag which is why im not giving it 5 stars, but the rest of the brushes are greatttt</li>
            <li> At first the brushes seemed very good but after a few months, the heads started breaking form their handles and since the hair was so dense, product didn&#x27;t stay on as well. The eye brushes were very stiff and made applying eye makeup hard. I would recommend this product to a beginner or someone that doesn&#x27;t care a lot about makeup.</li>
            <li> The brush kit came in a amazing time and they were soft and they work amazingly I would recommend this to any on and to the other reviews that say it sticks, no they don&#x27;t they smell perfect.</li>
            <li> I wish the brushes came with something that has all the brush listings so I can know what some of them are for but I still love them ! They are cute and pink !!</li>
            <li> I love this brushes!! they&#x27;re soo soft! Great quality, super cute and great price. Better than I thought, Totally recommended!</li>
            <li> They came in perfect condition. The brushes are very soft. It had a slight smell to it, but what do you expect, it&#x27;s not supposed to smell like flowers, it just smelt like rubber which the case is made out of. The brushes DO hold the makeup on it. Although there were a few hairs coming out but I just shook them off and no more came out. I looked up a lot of other types of brush kits and read the reviews on them, but this is by far the best you are going to get for CHEAP!!! So if you&#x27;re looking for cheap good brushes, THESE ARE IT!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft. But they do not hold or transfer pigment very well but do they do their job</li>
            <li> If u don&#x27;t have these brushes definitely get them they are soooo amazing and soft and apply makeup on so well!!! People have said that they have a werid smell they didn&#x27;t for me!!! They smelt just fine!!! They r easy to clean and I just love them soo much!!! They r amazingly soft too!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a month now i Like them their great quality havent had any fall outs BUT if your looking for BLENDING brushes for eyeshadow these ARENT the ones. I really love the fan big fan brush for Highlighting. They do work great but would be a 5 star if blending brushes came with the set.</li>
            <li> dayum brushes kept breaking and some came broken smh i tried to make it work but it drove me nuts. sent it back</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable, however you get what you paid for. I opened up the pouch and the brushes were already apart.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the people who were writing reviews about how badly the case and brushes smelled were over exaggerating. The case does have an odd new plastic smell, but u can&#x27;t smell it until u put ur face right up to it. I was so worried about that when I opened the bag that I held my breath. But then I was like, okay just deal with it.  And to my surprise I couldn&#x27;t smell anything like the other reviewers talked about. I put the case right up to my nose and then I could smell it. Who goes around sniffing makeup brush cases? Seriously? So don&#x27;t even fret about the smell. And the same thin with the brushes. U can&#x27;t smell them while d</li>
            <li> The brush set was sort of what I expected, the only downsides were it smelled really bad of paint, and the brush part of all of the brushes were all bent. Also one of the smaller brushes has glue in the brush part of it so I cannot use that one.</li>
            <li> I love this sets of makeup brushes. I was a bit skeptical about getting them but decided to when I read the reviews, and I would definitely recomend this for my friends.</li>
            <li> Love these!!! they are so cute, they clean easily (I know some reviewers said the pink went away after using it a few times from it getting dirty) but if you wash with soap and warm water the pink comes through again. I wish there was a large fluffy blending eyeshadow brush, but it seems all the eyeshadow brushes are pretty stiff ):&lt;br /&gt;but I love the blush brushes! definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, easy on the face. Had the sizes she wanted and a cool pouch with it. Now all she needs is a bigger makeup case.</li>
            <li> The brushes were way too soft. I guess if you have sensitive skin and you like soft bristles then this would be great for you. For me, I like dense brushes that are a bit thicker and fuller. The smell was a strong acetone kind of smell or maybe even acrylic. So for all of you, who are very sensitive to smell, then just be cautious about this one because it may be bothersome or a nuisance.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot there not to firm or to soft, the case did smell a bit causing the brushes to smell but a  wash did help a bit.</li>
            <li> These brushes were very very soft and it is definitely great for the price that you pay. I just wish they have big stippling brush and more of a dome shaped blender brush. But I am very satisfied with my order and would order another one for my sister.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of brushes for a great price and they&#x27;re really cute! I love the color of them. The only thing wrong is that they have a very strong plastic smell but all you need to do is air them out and they&#x27;re fine!</li>
            <li> very soft bristles and the brushes are packed meaning they put a lot of bristles per brush. LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Cute set. One of the brushes was already broke when it arrived in the mail but was easily fixed. Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but every single one of the brushes came apart! Where the \\&quot;metal\\&quot; meets the \\&quot;wood\\&quot; they all seperated! Not sure if im going to even bother fixing them or throw them all out!</li>
            <li> Brushes were not that great and they looked cheap also the pink bag so ugly. Didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> the brushes were great and the case that came in is it really good quality and feels amazing I love having some paint brushes in my set</li>
            <li> Although it kinda smells bad when you first get it..&lt;br /&gt;I had to lay it out for a day and wash every brush with brush cleaner&lt;br /&gt;It is still alright and I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;The gradation of the brush tip is very beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Price is very reasonable too.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been looking at every store we went for make-up brushes. I told her to give me a chance to look on Amazon first and if we didn&#x27;t find anything she was satisfied with i would let her spend a &#x27;reasonable&#x27; amount of money on something she liked.....well it never came to that b/c one look thru Amazon we were ordering exactly what she wanted for way less than she had seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the brushes are soft but some are too soft. The bag had kind of a weird smell but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. When my brushes came in, the big blush brush had some weird sticky stuff on it. A couple bristles fall out every once and a while too. But for the price and the amount of brushes you get I think it&#x27;s still a good product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> all the brushes are soft. love the pink, and im no pink lover! they have a bad smell coming out the bag but i know its because of the wearhouse. i havent used every brush but so far i like them. the eyebrow brush with the comb side just fell off. the top just popped :/ over all the other bushes work great! :)</li>
            <li> This is very well priced and you get a lot of brushes.  I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now and I really like them.  The brushes come in a roll of vinyl that is very nice.  I took out the brushes I use often and set them in a stand up holder.  They are pink and the makeup products discolor them which doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It&#x27;s only to be expected.  They are very attractive, the fibers hold plenty of product and apply it evenly.  It&#x27;s a good value for a set of brushes that are soft and work well.  There are a large selection of brushes of many shapes and uses.  Not all are going to be used of course but the price was low and it still makes it a good value.  I would recommend this set of brushes to anyone.  These are for my own personal use and I would not know if they are of such quality to stand up to professional use.</li>
            <li> These brushes live up to the great reviews they have received.  The bristles don&#x27;t shed and they are well-made.  The one thing I would change about this set is I would include a few &#x27;sponge applicators&#x27; for eye shadow and make the handles a little bit shorter so that one or two would fit in my cosmetic bag in my purse.  I am still giving them a 5 star rating because they are as pictured, have nice case, and are a great value.  I highly recommend these brushed.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister-in-law and she absolutely adored it. If I wore makeup more often, I would buy one for myself. I was thoroughly impressed with this set when it arrived. The bristles are soft and seem very durable and the touches of pink make the set super cute!</li>
            <li> Wouln&#x27;t recommend this product.  Made kind of flimsley.  The brush hairs fall out during cleaning.  Delivered on time, but wouldn&#x27;t buy this product ever again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the pink bag the brushes came in because it caused all the brushes to bend and one of the brushes fell right off the stick when i was going to use it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was gonna be like elf cosmetics&#x27; brushes, but no it was way worse. the brushes are too soft that it doesn&#x27;t pick up the pigment of your make up products.</li>
            <li> This was the first brush set I had ever purchased and I still use a few of the brushes. They are very soft and work very well for inexpensive brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very pretty and very soft, however, they smell like paint, the bristles are not trimmed evenly, and the pink paint on one of the brush have a finger printed like someone touched it before the paint was even dried up. Great on the shipping, that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars. &amp;&amp; last thing I wanted to point out is all the 5 star reviews looks all the same with the excellent grammar and alot of \\&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\&quot; after every sentence &#x3D;D good job ufren. anyways, it&#x27;s great on shipping :))) so don&#x27;t be discourage because you will get what you paid for :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEEHEE :)</li>
            <li> So, it WILL stink when you first receive it (Smells like industrial paint) but trust me it will go away after a while. The brushes are incredibly soft but hard to maintain for me because it really grabs the pigment and you will have to constantly clean it in between uses. But overall I love it and really looks pro one or two did shed but stops if you take good care of it. Love the brushes!</li>
            <li> I spent hours searching reviews and a good set of brushes! I finally decided to go with this one I know you get what you pay for but these really do nothing it just caked my make up on and I spent more time trying to fix my make up from the brushes then I actually did use them! I was kinda happy with them at first but there not very full you can&#x27;t get the look your really going for there great for a in a hurry makeup or a touch up but not for a long that needs to last all day for work and special night out just not my top favorite!</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible!!! After I washed them &amp; let them air dry the smell went away. The only good thing about these brushes was the large brushes. The smaller brushes were way to hard.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews said that the brushes were shedding and they smelt like chemicals, but I decided to go for it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived on time and when I opened it yes it smelled. It wasn&#x27;t as bad as people say. Just leave it open to air out for a few days and you&#x27;ll be fine. I did small tugs on the hairs and yes there was fall out. However only on one of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that was a surprise to me was that one of the brushes was dirty. It seemed like glue of some kind... but its ok I got it off and it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its good. You get what you pay for. Its no MAC but it&#x27;ll do the job you need it to do.</li>
            <li> This brushes feel very nice and apply my makeup on very well. I&#x27;ve tried other expensive makeup brushes and these ones are a little better. They haven&#x27;t fallen apart or anything like that, pretty nice.</li>
            <li> they defiantly have a smell to them, i washed them with baby shampoo twice, and after they smelled great! they are soft,i did get all the brushes, and i got them pretty quick. just air out the bag and the smell will go away.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this! Comes with everything!</li>
            <li> All the tops keep falling off and don&#x27;t stay on if I push them on really hard, will have to hot glue them all back on. Also, the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is crap quality, doesn&#x27;t hold the powder in it and falls off before I can get it on my face. Doesn&#x27;t brush on nicely and I&#x27;m pretty easy to please and have a hard time finding things wrong with product.  This was inexpensive, I should have known better.</li>
            <li> OMG i just got them 2 days ago I&#x27;m inlove they are so soft i havent gotten a chance to try them but seems like they will work very well.&lt;br /&gt;im very excited but what i dont like i dont want them to get them dirty :( they are so pretty lol&lt;br /&gt;if your are looking for soft brushes this is def. it worth it. &lt;3</li>
            <li> A set of 22 brushes + storage bag for under $20?? I must admit I was skeptical as hell, but I decided to order them anyway. I am so glad I did! Let me tell you, ladies and gents, these brushes are soooooo soft and dense, it&#x27;s incredible! From reading the reviews I had expected smelly, sparse, brushes that shed like mad. I opened them and took a sniff, nothing. They just smelled like new brushes. I ran my fingers through each brush and they are all amazingly soft. They&#x27;re like baby bunny rabbits on a stick. lol! None of them have shed either. I even gave the hairs a good tug, and washed them well, and no hairs came out. I am more than satisfied with these babies! (I posted a few photographs in the gallery, so you have a better look before purchasing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Even the bag they came in is of great quality!</li>
            <li> FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m still waiting for my order.  If I could only track my order it would be nice to know.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to get it today because I don&#x27;t want to wait until Monday.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s taken sooooooooooooooooooo long!!!</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes were cheap material but there okay for the price I Paid for them but I did like them I wish they could of tryed another pair of brushes a better cualuty</li>
            <li> Three of the brushes fell apart as soon as I got them</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect those brushes to be so good! they are really soft but not too much just perfect. And hair doesnt fall down which i think is really important. Even if you pull it. Brushes look pretty and i really love them. I have a lot of brushes by MAC and i think they are same quality!!! Its really shocking but its true!!! Brushes are not made of fur so it is also animal friendly!!! PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive stuff just to pay for the big if you can purchase same thing and pay less!!! i love those brushes. I first ordered them just because i was curious but when i got them i was shocked, so i ordered same set for my sister for Christmas. I love those brushes they are really perfect.</li>
            <li> All the brushes are soft and very pretty! I have seen other reviews that mention that the case has a smell and mine did have a chemical smell, but it has gone away after a few days. The brushes did NOT have the smell. It takes awhile to get here because it is shipped from China, but I think it was worth it for the bargain! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> These brushes are cute but....most of the brushes are the same but different sized. out of the 22 brushes about 15 are eyeshadow brushed in different sizes, no blending brush at all. The eyeshadow brushes that they are they don&#x27;t spread very good. All in all would not recommend !</li>
            <li> These brushes are totally amazing!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so incredibly soft and pretty, I just love using them every time I put on my makeup. The bag is so pretty and shiny as well and just has an overall beautiful look to it.</li>
            <li> the product was good. after looking review i was sacred to buy it, and now i am glad to buy those makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> These maybe my favorite brushes ever. I also have a few MAC brushes but these are wonderful. I LOVE THE CONCEALER brush it does wonders! Great buy!</li>
            <li> honestly I bought this set for a gift for my friend but the brushes are so soft that I want one for my self! they came nicely packed and they&#x27;re so cute! for an everyday use they are awesome! it has every brush you&#x27;ll need in there! and all those things in such a good prize! what a bargain! if you buy them you won&#x27;t be disappointed that&#x27;s for sure!! I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love my brushes but all the handles fell off.  Im sure if i buy some hot glue i can glue them back.</li>
            <li> The product is decent for the price, not the best but it&#x27;s as good as it&#x27;s worth. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The brushes came right away! Very soft I&#x27;m in love! Has a strong chemical smell but that&#x27;s no issue. Very cute color &amp; I keep getting asked where I got them from!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because they seemed like a good deal... but they aren&#x27;t as soft as i thought they would be and using these brushed makes you use more makeup or eye shadow than you would if you used a better brush. They shed like crazy. even after washing them. overall I think they&#x27;re okay for beginners. I do recommend the E.L.F studio brushes if you don&#x27;t want to spend much money on brushes. :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a set of makeup brushes, and I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better one.  There are tons of them in so many different shapes, and they&#x27;re super soft!  The only thing is that the pink bag smells like a new shower curtain when you first open the package, so unroll it and let it air out outside for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and apply the make up so evenly and nicely definitely the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> AMAZING QUALITY BRUSH AND REALLY PRETTY. SO WORTH IT FOR SO CHEAP</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  Loved the price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very thin. No eye blending brushes.</li>
            <li> I lobe how there are so many brushes that you don&#x27;t have to worry about reusing the same brush twice when your doing you makeup in the morning. The set is beautiful and i love that it comes with a bag, but i feel that some brushes don&#x27;t pick up the product too well, but for the price these brushes are awesome</li>
            <li> Brushes are cute but they have some downsides... 1) not very pink. The case looks the same, but the brushes are like a dark faded red... 2) the brush bristles are too flat. When I use my &#x27;ecotools&#x27; brushes, makeup NEVER ends up on the side of my face because the brush bristles are full. These, however, spray makeup all over like a sprinkler if you&#x27;re not careful. I like the versatility in sizes and angles, but I can only use a couple of the brushes for confident use... disappointing.</li>
            <li> The brushes in this set are great for beginers. Soft, easy to use, but some of the brushes are repetative so you are getting more than one of the same brush.</li>
            <li> I loved this makeup brush set to begin with but as I began to use the big fluffy brush the hairs would continuously fall out. So, I stopped using that one and my sister uses it. I loved the foundation brush, and yet the hairs continued to fall out of that one as well. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because this came to me quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Yes there&#x27;s a distinct smell when you first get the brushes. WASH THEM! Then let them air out as usual.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are exactly like the picture, I didn&#x27;t get any fall out, and they work well.&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t use all of the brushes since it&#x27;s all eye brushes and some of them are repeats of another. I&#x27;ve tried the eyebrushes and they do pick up a good amount. My favorite brushes are the bigger faces ones. I recommend this set to anyone who is starting out for fun, likes to do primarily eye makeup, and for traveling.</li>
            <li> When I opened it up one of the eye shadows were broken and had gotten all over all of the others and even all over of the palette itself, it was pretty troublesome to clean up and swab each eye shadows not only that but it seems a few of the little pots of eye shadow aren&#x27;t glued down properly so i&#x27;m a little afraid they may fall out and break but that&#x27;s very easy to fix so I suppose it&#x27;s not a problem! But anyway after everything was fixed and cleaned It turned out to be a great palette. The eye shadows goes on quite nicely and blends beautifully plus the range of colors is quite nice!! So overall the product is really nice and I do really like it!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes there soft and no bleading our shedding(: The brush roll smells like plastice but after three our four days it goes away all these brushes work great and you could find a great way to us them (:</li>
            <li> The brushes work great, it was an amazing price for the number of brushes. I only came across one problem, when I received them they had a strong smell of plastic. I know that they&#x27;er synthetic, but the smell was a little over bearing. It went away however, after I washed them with warm water and baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are very high quality, haven&#x27;t had a problem with almost a month of use. Love this brush set.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set, it&#x27;s very nice and good for it&#x27;s price. When i got the set they did smell like paint REALLY BAD but it went away after a couple days. I think they spray painted the case lol you get your moneys worth on this.</li>
            <li> I jut received the brushes a few days ago, they are great. They&#x27;re not perfect though. It is true that there is a slight smell, almost like a spray paint smell, but the smell is only on the pink bag that comes with the brushes. Also the brushes do shed a little but only while you first wash them and pull at them. Otherwise it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. All the brushes are soft and the handles are sturdy. One thing I did not like is that a few jars on the brushes are stray and not perfectly straight, this will not affect make-up application but can be less appealing to the eye. All in all I would purchase these brushes again you get what you pay for and these are a great deal! ALSO HEADS UP DO NOT PURCHASE THESE BRUSHES FOR MORE THAN $16 INCLUDING SHIPPING AND HANDLING ANY PRICES ABOVE THIS ARE NOT WORTH IT! I PAYED ABOUT $15.68 FOR THESE w/S&amp;H. I SAY THIS BECAUSE I SAW THESE PRICED FOR 49.99 without S&amp;H DON&#x27;T BUY IT, WAIT!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loved it.  It came on time and she loved the pouch to store her brushes.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about these brushes but with all the good reviews i couldn&#x27;t help myself! Best purchase i have ever made for makeup brushes. I usually use too faced brushes and they call there brushes \\&quot;teddy bear hair\\&quot; i must say these brushes should be called \\&quot;heaven on a stick!\\&quot;. These brushes by crazy cart blew too faced out of the water! And i paid 16 bucks (20 total for shipping) and the too faced brushes i have are about 30 for just one! I must say i will never use the too faced brushes again and i will buy these brushes again for a gift or myself!!! :) i am thrilled to of found such a amazing product. None of the bristles were loose and they came in a really cute carrying case, so you can always be on the go with these brushes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you crazy cart! You are AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes, they are soft, washing them got rid of any weird smells. The case feels a little cheap and I will likely get a new one.</li>
            <li> These suck and are not makeup brushes although the larger ones are okay. Its just like the same brushes over and over again they are stiff and would never work for eye shadow brushes at all. they arnt even useful for paint brushes!!!</li>
            <li> came in super fast .. love them :) very happy</li>
            <li> Had a lot of brushes that did the same thing and were exactly the same.Bristles don&#x27;t come out of the brushes, however they do break within a few weeks of having them. Also 2 did arrive broken, but for the price they&#x27;re really good brushes and are very very soft.</li>
            <li> These are really low quality brushes, all the eye brushes are way too stiff and they smell kinda weird. I would recommend if you were getting it for a little kid for there play makeup or something, but otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> love the brushes but they do no last. fell apart after washing a few times.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!!!&lt;br /&gt;well worth my money. Came in a timely manner. the brushes are soft on my skin and they are pink! doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
            <li> when you really think about it, if you buy this kit for about 12 bucks your getting each brush for around 50 cents. I believe for the price that these are amazing brushes for someone interested in make up and is just beginning. Are they perfect? No but they are sure as heck amazing for 50 cents a brush.</li>
            <li> Was ordered for my daughter and she loved it. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I love these, they&#x27;re very cute. They&#x27;re also really soft. However, after having them for about a year now and (and using them every day) the bristles are slowly starting to fall out. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal due to use or not. I don&#x27;t know how often you should replace makeup brushes. I have very much loved these so far, though! And I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments from family about them as well.</li>
            <li> used these brushes for over a year:) they were really nice until&lt;br /&gt; i upgraded :)</li>
            <li> the only thing about this is that i took sooo long to get shipped out to me! goshh but other than that i love them they are super soft i havent used them for my make up yet. but i will later today. i was so excited when they arrived. Its a great investment for makeup theyre inexpensive and they work the same as the brand name brushes! hope this helped :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for firm brushes not soft.  So I gave them to my friend!! Pretty pink just not for me!!</li>
            <li> I want to say thank you for my brush set i love them i couldn&#x27;t of order anything better, they were soft &amp;i love the way it works with my favorite make-up!!!</li>
            <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! I love them soo much!&lt;br /&gt;Funky smell when they firdt arrived, but that was just because of packaging!&lt;br /&gt;They are SO soft and the bristles dont fall out at all!! I have and will definitely continue to recommend these to friends!</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing, it has every brsh you need to do your make up. They are extremely soft. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> the brushes are great! good quality for the amount of brushes you get in the case. So far ive only used the big fan brush for my highlighter and it works GREAT! I LOVE IT TO PIECES! Ive also used the spoolie brush for my eye brows and it works great for the job of combing my brows in place before i put brow gel on it. i would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> great quality, i received them very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;fibers are very dense soft and easy to clean..&lt;br /&gt;i have 3 sets and i will gladly buy some and give them as gifts...</li>
            <li> I received these brushes within a week of ordering them.  They are beautiful, I love them!!  They are soft and the case is so cute.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 of these and the brushes are no good.  I ordered one as a Christmas gift for niece in Atlanta and one for myself and they are falling apart and do not apply makeup well.  The brushes are too soft. No I have to order new brushes from someone else and I feel really bad about the gift I purchased....Not good at all</li>
            <li> Very pretty and soft.Love them. Brushes works well with all my makeup.  Some of the brushes did come apart. Just pulled out my trusty hot glue gun and bam. Plus it helped with any loose bristles. Did not experience the smell like some people mentioned. Got them sooner then I thought. Confirmation said march 22, but I got them in three days.</li>
            <li> Great condition, beautiful brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product for any young girl or woman that wants some beautiful makeup brushes&lt;br /&gt;Pink a favorite color, brushes soft.</li>
            <li> If you want to have many high quality brushes. Then buy this!! Because that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll get. (: dammit how many words do j have to put here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ok for now. The brushes are soft and there&#x27;s a lot of options for what brushes you can use and it&#x27;s great for a person like me who is just starting to learn how to do higher up makeup styles. My only problem is that some of the brush tips fell off when I was unwrapping them but with a little glue and force it goes back on.</li>
            <li> my favorite color is pink, and it a shame to say thats the was the main reason i got them, however when i did get them and started trying to use them i feel like the majority of the brushes are really flat, and i pufer my brushes to be a lil fuller and fluffyer, theres only a couple brushes i actually use out of this kit, and for the price its not bad if u really use them but i just dont feel like i get that much out of them</li>
            <li> Mymakeupbrush.com has IMPOSSIBLY TERRIBLE customer service. I ordered their &amp;#34;purple rain&amp;#34; brush set, which was actually brown. They ignored my emails twice until I commented my irritation on their facebook page, they then told me to message them. They kept offering me a generous discount on my next purchase, and refused to aknowledge that my brushes were the wrong color, even when I sent a photo. They then offered to refund my purchase after I pay out of pocket to ship it with a tracking number. What!? The product looks nothing like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice and soft, but I&#x27;ve been to angry to use them, plus I still want the purple ones, not the brown I recieved.</li>
            <li> The reason I wrote satisfied is because, when I received my package and finally opened it, the brush at the end with the little comb and the little bristles was completely broken. When I took it out, it broke even more, however, the brushes are very soft to my liking on my face and I would purchase another set of brushes but not right now because I&#x27;m disappointed that 1 of the 22 were broken. Even though I will not be using that one it&#x27;s still a disappointment. the case is very easy to roll up &amp; transport &amp; protects the brushes very well so I&#x27;m satisfied with that but for the above reason, is why this product recieved 4 stars from me.</li>
            <li> WHAT A PRICE! Can&#x27;t find anything better for the price. Pretty brushes but very synthetic. Fast shipping too, came 3 weeks early!</li>
            <li> Is the best in the world!! My best thing i loveeeeeeeeeeee!&lt;br /&gt;Colors, pack great.&lt;br /&gt;i use always in my handbag is cool</li>
            <li> They were good brushes but a few were missing in the pack</li>
            <li> (Using husbands account) I bought these brushes and I love them. Their soft and apply the makeup very well. I&#x27;m planning on buying another set as a back up. I would recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t even used them at all, but they look exactly like they do in the picture. They&#x27;re packaged wonderfully and I&#x27;m excited to actually use them when I decide to not be lazy and take them out of the pretty packaging.</li>
            <li> These brushes suck! Please do not make the same mistake I made on purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m so in love with my brushes.. super soft.. don&#x27;t shed, and best of all is that they are pinkk..highly recommend..</li>
            <li> This is a really a great set of brushes - extremly soft and seem durable. The smell of the plastic didn&#x27;t bother me that much and i think it wears out after a while. i&#x27;ve had it just a few days and already can&#x27;t really notice the smell. There&#x27;s pretty much every single brush I could ever want in here and they are by far the softest brushes i&#x27;ve ever bought. Very happy with this buy - wish I had bought it years ago! Great value.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my friend who wanted a full set of makeup brushes. Unfortunately I did not have the money to buy her a professional set from a company like Sigma or Mac, so I scoured Amazon until I happened upon this set. I was amazed by the quality when they arrived! The brushes are so soft, and I didn&#x27;t notice and fallout of bristles or any that were askew! My friend says she loves them. I noticed that some reviews mention the brushes being stained after use, but that happens with any light-colored bristles. As long as you look after and shampoo your brushes, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. This is a great starter set because it not only includes the most basic brushes, but some specialty ones as well. If I had the space, I would definitely buy this set for myself.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! Haven&#x27;t used them yet really so i cant tell you about long term use but I already like them. Packaging etc was great. Not pro stylist quality but fantastic for the price!</li>
            <li> I love these make up bashes. They are really nice for the price they are, easy to wash and clean</li>
            <li> I gave the product a four because i love the brushes. they are sooooo soft and do not irritate the skin. BUT!!! when i first opened the packaging i just got the biggest whiff of nasty chemical smell. I would compare it to the overwhelming smell of fresh paint but worse. The brushes in general are great. the smell however is not. i plan on letting them sit in a well ventilated room in hopes to help the smell dissipate some.</li>
            <li> I just got these brushes in the mail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good : very soft , they look really pretty . Got here when they said it will get here they weren&#x27;t late package was ok the product wasn&#x27;t damaged .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad : some of the brushes looka Lil banged up but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all they do smell a Lil but its only cause they are new and we have to clean them before we use them they also font look like expensive brushes but the price is a good for them .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love these brushes very pretty can&#x27;t wait to use them and write another review for them .. if your a beginner and don&#x27;t know what the brushes are for because there are 22 Dont buy these they don&#x27;t have names of what they are for ..</li>
            <li> I got these for Christmas and I LOVE them. They didn&#x27;t smell, they work BEAUTIFULLY,I have NO trouble with shedding, and they&#x27;re so easy to clean just make sure you don&#x27;t soak the handle in water because it will chip off the paint. For those having trouble cleaning them, try e.l.f brush shampoo mixed with anti-bacterial soap and they should look brand new. Also use just a bit of conditioner on them the first time you wash them it&#x27;ll prevent shedding (this tip is for ALL brushes not just these)</li>
            <li> I just got mine yesterday I love them they have no ugly smell like people say it just smells like new. You wont regret getting them they are soo cute and so soft very cute purse even better in person.  I give it 5*</li>
            <li> I love the brushes they look beautiful!, i haven&#x27;t use it yet but i can&#x27;t wait to start after i purchase the cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have to write this for all that attempt to use Maio.  They sent my product to North carolina.  I live in arizona.&lt;br /&gt;It took them a month just to get it to north carolina.  When they admitted they sent it to the wrong address,&lt;br /&gt;they responded as to if or when we would ever get what we ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product may be fine, but, this company has no clue as to how to resolve a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend not using this company for any of your purchases, especially around the holidays.</li>
            <li> These brushes are durable and soft so they will not irritate your skin.  The application of make up with this brushes make your skin look flawless.  I really love them and you get so many brushes on the set.  They come in their own bag and protective individual wrappers.  Some of my friends even want to get their own sets of these brushes.  It&#x27;s a wonderful deal since at the store you pay as much for smaller sets and cheaper quality.  The only down side is that they do not include a list of what each brush is for so you have to figure it out yourself but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I strongly recommend them.  Thanks a lot Amazon and please don&#x27;t charge taxes.  We don&#x27;t want to start paying taxes on line shopping. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these Brushes for a little over a week now. I love them! They work Great! They pick up make up well and they apply make-up well. They are super soft as well. A lot of people complained about shedding but i haven&#x27;t had shedding at all! They do have a smell to them but it&#x27;s nothing that won&#x27;t fade a way after a few washes! All IN all I say they are more then worth buying!</li>
            <li> Love the color, love the appearance of the kit.. they smelled strong when i opened since they were brand new.</li>
            <li> First I want to add that I have never done a review before in my life about any product , but I decided I woukd do one on these brushes because they are that great. I have been using these brushes for about 2 months now, and they have been very very usefull , I am using these for my every single day makeup and I&#x27;m so in love! And the most exiting part its that not only do they work so well but they are PINK (: ! My brushes have NOT SHEDDED ONCE , I have already washed them and not a single strand of hair has came out ! They ARE NOT THAT HARD TO CLEAN , like most people say. All i used was a cup with water and baby shampoo!And they where good as new ! Yes the bag smells funky once it arrives but WHO FREAKIN CARES ! It goes away quick and the brushes work amazing! I read every single review before getting these because I was just so iffy! But its worth every penny . DEFINITELY GET THESE BRUSHES♥ :))!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item after reading all the amazing reviews but after i received this item and Used it i simply hated it The brushes are cheap quality and hardly blend any make up . Waste of money</li>
            <li> For the price, These are AMAZING. They hold powder, they don&#x27;t shed, they&#x27;re perfect! When I first got it, it smelled kinda funny so I threw away the pouch, but the brushes were perfect. Cute color, amazing quality.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes about a year ago. I ended up using about 4-5 of these brushes out of the entire set for my everyday makeup. I never took the brushes anywhere outside of my home yet they shed. Not to mention that the brush tips came unglued from the handles of certain brushes. On the plus side, the case is easy to clean if it becomes dirty and the brushes are true to size based on the photos. All in all, you get what you paid for with these brushes. They&#x27;re made of acrylic hairs so if you&#x27;re looking for quality, I suggest finding a set made of animal hair. However, for the small price I believe the set is worth it if you&#x27;re interested in temporary brushes.</li>
            <li> When I got these brushes in the mail I was so excited so I quickly opened it up. I really liked the brushes at first.&lt;br /&gt;Then I used them.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes shed like no other! It&#x27;s quite ridiculous! This shows that they&#x27;re not of very high quality. Obviously they&#x27;re not going to be great quality but they weren&#x27;t even good quality in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> I bought these in august, and  I think I did a review then, but I cant find it. Anyways, it&#x27;s now February, and the brushes are very mediocre. They work well, yes, however, the tops come off easily, and its hard to make them look clean. Whenever I clean my brushes, thoroughly, they still look dirty. This means that some of the makeup still stays on the brush, no matter how much you wash it. I have other brushes that I&#x27;ve had for years that I found the other day, washed, and they looked perfect. It&#x27;s a really cute set, and a lot of the brushes to work really well. Just updating my review :)</li>
            <li> What an exciting, action-packed set of awesome cosmetic brushes for my teen daughter to color herself with. Blam. Pow. Wham</li>
            <li> i had these brushes for several months, and i usually dont write reviews but for this one i just had to. this shed like nothing! and plus i had to spend time to fix my make up because the brushes didnt do a god job at blending. i honestly wish i had saved my money and investing in a better brand of make up brushes.</li>
            <li> My brushes came quickly, way ahead of schedule, and did not disappoint. I use them every single day and would recommend them to any novice makeup artist!!</li>
            <li> they are so beautiful and work wonders. they also wash very well. remember you have to wash and condition your brushes to keep them in nice condition!</li>
            <li> Love them! So soft and they are the prettiest pink. They are nice and firm and dont fray.  So happy with them. :)</li>
            <li> I hate them ! They fall apart. I have bought brushes for the same price and they are far better quality then this one. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> exactly what they said in the description beautiful and soft exactly what i needed for my cousin to learn how to do her makeup</li>
            <li> I was very surprised on how soft &amp; professional these brushes actually are! TOTALLY WORTH IT !&lt;br /&gt;i love them &amp; the color is to die for.</li>
            <li> The cosmetic makeup brush are too hard and only the big brush are the one I can use.  The rest was a waste, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> As always, wash your brushes before using! Once you do, you will love this product! I am truly pleased! You&amp;#34;ll love it too! Trust me!</li>
            <li> When I saw this product online I thought it would be exactly what I wanted. When it arrived at my front door I opended it up and I thought WOW... how many eye brushes do they think a girl needs. The brushes themselves were ok. The &#x27;&#x27;handles&#x27;&#x27; were really long and probly not intended for self use. The bristles however I thought were good quality. They were soft and they didn&#x27;t have a weird odor like some brushes. But at the end of the day I relized I just didn&#x27;t like the brushes and that I would be sending them back.</li>
            <li> Blending brush is not included. Like really? Is one of the most important brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes are really soft :) but I ordered mine in the hot month of July where I live so since they were rollers in a pink bag thingy, the brushes sorta got rolled too. They don&#x27;t hold powder really wel... the powder brushes don&#x27;t at least. The eyeshadow ones are okay. I don&#x27;t reccomend getting this one buy a SHANY set of 12 those are great! Thanks for reading my review Godbless &amp; Jesus loves you! x</li>
            <li> These brushes do exactly what they are intended to do giving you the control you need when applying makeup and achieving the effect you want!</li>
            <li> The pink brushes are great! I purchased them with standard shipping and received them within 5 days. When I first opened them, there was a a slight weird plastic smell to it, but I just washed the case and brushes with soap and let them air dry and they smelled just fine! They are a great length, cute color, and the bristles don&#x27;t come out when I pull them! I recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these brushes. They are good quality, a brush for every need and are very soft. I  would recommend them to anyone wanting a good set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality, broke in my hand on first use..</li>
            <li> I love it there soft yet sturdy and they came packaged very nicely and they arrived very fast! :) I love my new brush set they are so cute! It came with a beautiful pink bag that the brushes come and where you can store them away just what I need! Overall I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> absolutely like it. I bought this set as a gift for a friend and now I want one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was shipped from far so it took forever, but I still worth it</li>
            <li> Nice easy to wash light weight...however the roll had a horrible smell so i took the brushes out...will order again</li>
            <li> Great brushes, except they fall apart after a while. The smell was a little funky too when it first shipped... But they changed my life for the better! Love them!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. use them everyday!</li>
            <li> The face brushes are very soft and I love them, the eye makeup brushes are stiff cannot blend with them and they don&#x27;t deposit color well.... For the price though I am happy with the face brushes and would expect to pay way more for individual ones so that alone is worth the price. Another complaint I have is I was billed and sent three of the sets. I am not paying for shipping to return them so I guess I am stuck with them and out $40.</li>
            <li> Im a cosmetologist my sister purchased these for me for services i think they r great blend shadows well easy to clean if u dont want them to stain it is best to wash after each use. They dry fast dont shed or loose there shape i would recamend these brushes to anyone a little hint use baby shampoo to wash and hangupside down to dry thats with any brushes and they will last. U allot longer</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and put on make up very well. Overall I love the whole bag.its so much for a good price. The money was really worth it !</li>
            <li> the brushes are very soft and good besides the big fan brush was all bend up because of the packaging</li>
            <li> This was a pretty nice set.  I&#x27;m still using many of the brushes.  They&#x27;ve cleaned really nicely for me with some baby shampoo and warm water.  One or two have since become loose on the stick, but I&#x27;ve traveled and used them quite a bit between the time I purchased them and now.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to use them to help me learn how to work with make-up using brushes.  I was disappointed that there was no guide to tell me what each brush was and it&#x27;s use.  There is a listing of what is included in the description, but that does little good if you have no idea what your looking for.  I tried comparing it to other sites to help label them for personal use as I learned, but found it to be incredibly difficult.  I ended up using which ever brush I thought would work for what I was doing and going with it.  I doubt I&#x27;m really using them properly.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re nice and soft.  They have been great for me as a beginner; I just would have preferred a little more of a guide.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality, for a great price!</li>
            <li> I just got the package not even 20 mins ago, i ordered them on Tuesday and i got them on Saturday, and for having a hurricane the same week, i thought i was going to receive for another few days. i got them quick and i am so happy. i was a bit iffy on buying them but i say the reviews and i just went for it. they are a really great product for the cost. its does have a smell but it isn&#x27;t as bad, just wash them and they are good. everytime i buy from amazon i am never disappointed. Awesome and pretty product.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers I was iffy as to whether I should purchase these brushes. They had no name and had the distinct air of \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know if this is worth it or legit.\\&quot; Yet after reading some of the reviews, I decided to order them and I must say that I am quite happy I did. I have brushes from all brands including a very expensive and famous brand whose powder brush sheds like a cat.. in any case.. these are super soft, cute, and cheaply priced. I cannot attest to the longevity, as I just received them a short while ago but for 16 bucks I am not complaining. THEY DO have a distinct vinyl smell but I do not mind it and anyway just let them air out or wash them and it will go away. The smell seems to be impregnated from the material of the brush roll and probably the heat as they travel. I am loving these brushes; The highlight is definitely how soft they are!!</li>
            <li> My daugther purchased this with her own money.  She absolutely loves it.  Great value.  If you are looking for that something for your makeup queen, this is it!</li>
            <li> perfect! arrived on time.  my daughter loved her birthday present! she had been wanting these brushes for a while! ty</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 15 year old, up and coming makeup artist, and she absolutely loves them. They are super soft, there has been no shedding and she uses them daily (sometimes several times s a day), and the pouch they come in has been sturdy (with no unusual scent). She cleans them about every three days by soaking them in dish detergent and water mixture and are still as good as the day she received them. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who would use them a little or alot.</li>
            <li> Im IN LOVE with these brushes!!! they are AWESOME..&lt;br /&gt;they come in a pink pouch thing where it had a compartment for each brush. the brushes are SO SOFT but not too flimsy. the ONLY little complaint I would have is when I first got them in, they smelt like paint but im thinking it was just from being in the package and being shipped because one I toot them out and used them ONE TIME the smell disappeared!! and they shipped to me sooo quick!!!! I was so impressed:) I would totally recommend these brushes to anyone who loves makeup or just needs new brushes. good luck and have fun with them!! xoxoxo</li>
            <li> I use these brushes everyday!</li>
            <li> me encanto tal como lo pedi. gracias. excelente vendedor llego el articulo en el tiempo esperado y el articulo es tal cual lo describe.</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes are ok. I find myself using several but not all of them. Appearance wise the brushes are very cute and girly. If you&#x27;re a makeup artist I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing these brushes as they are cheaply made. It did take a while for the brushes to arrive (they still came before the estimated date) which could be expected since they were shipped from another country. These brushes would be great for teenage girls who are just starting to experiment with makeup! I hope this review is helpful!</li>
            <li> Nice!!! Super girly!!</li>
            <li> I liked these brushes; they are soft and feel real. The only thing is that one of the brushes came off the base, but it was an easy fix. There was a bit of a plasticky smell when I opened them, but it went away fast enough.</li>
            <li> These are such a great color, they also have a sturdy base. They have really soft bristles and are really easy to work with. They hold the makeup, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of makeup. They smell a little weird when you get them, but that&#x27;s more the case then the brushes! These are a great buy, for such a small value!</li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice and the brushes are soft, however they are a bit flat for my liking, other than that they are good for applying makeup. The bag does however smell like nail polish remover, but that smell goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> I had just got mine today and I was feeling them and there so soft and I love them so much. These are the softest makeup brushes I ever had and they apply makeup on wonderfully I really think you should buy this before they run out it&#x27;s a cheap nice price a very good deal. At the mall these makeup brushes cost $40 dollars and this is the best way to get them. I will soon do a review for these brushes on youtube. :)</li>
            <li> They Are Really Nice Brushes. Very soft ! The Only Thing Is ,When i Receive My Brushes 4 Of Them Were broken Off The Base Of The Brush. But Thanks To The Wonderful Customer Service i Will Be Getting My Money Back. I Would Not Repurchase . Or Recommend Them.</li>
            <li> The brushes I received were very pretty (much prettier in person) and they exceeded my expectations. I am a professional makeup artist and I appreciate how long the handles are. Most brushes are made for the average consumer, therefore, the handles are short because they are for personal use. Not the case with these brushes, GREAT length, great size overall, and very soft bristles. I did detect a slight smell, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily consider it a bad odor, a little weird, it just smells like glue or plastic or something like that. I&#x27;ve been airing out the brushes and once I wash them, I&#x27;m certain that little &#x27;smell&#x27; will go away. I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet so that will be the true testament, but so far, so good. As I&#x27;m continuing to build my kit, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I am actually considering buying a second one, just to have more brushes for bridal parties, etc. Cleaning brushes between clients will eat into your time, not tremendously, but it&#x27;s best to have an abundance of clean brushes. Oh, I love the rolled up case they came in, it&#x27;s a shame I won&#x27;t really use it though because I will be transferring ALL of my brushes to a brush belt, or if space is allowed, a rolled out white towel. Great gift idea for a lady that loves to wear makeup!</li>
            <li> the brushes are too soft and do not hold the powder very well. I am gonna wash it with make-up wash and see if it works...&lt;br /&gt;I bought it, tried it once did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely fashion. The product was exactly what I was looking for and so far it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> USE THESE BRUSHES ON MY CLIENTS AND I LOVE IT SO FAR. IT COMES WITH MANY SIZES AND JUST PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves these she uses them all the time she is the quiet the little makeup artist by the way she is 11 and she just loves makeup, they do take a little bit of time to dry when you wash them but she just loves the kabuki brush with the handle.</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes,but the case smelled horrible!! It made the brushes stink. I washed both three times and the case still smells like paint! The brushes smell a ill.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price... going to purchase a set for a gift or two! &#x3D;) like the color as well</li>
            <li> I received this brush set three days ago. When I took the plastic wrap off the first brush all of the bristles started to fall out. I wasn&#x27;t pulling on them or even using the brush, they just fell out. This proceeded to happen with about 4 other brushes. I&#x27;d spend a little more and get a real professional set if I could do it all over again. Not a good brush set.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these brushes because of the variety and alot of positive reviews, but after receiving them the quality of the brush is good soft and fluffy but they do absolutely NOTHING to your makeup. On the face brushes the bristles are too long and flimsy they apply absolutely no product to your face and on the eye brushes the bristles were also too long and some are too soft others are too hard so the blending was terrible and also pick up very little product. I guess I should&#x27;ve seen this coming for the price. I want to just like give these away or something because I feel that if I sold them I would be ripping somebody off...these suck invest in good brushes!!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very soft and work amazing, i really love them and the price is very well. Better than the brushes i had before. I&#x27;m very glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> great price. and the brushes are so soft and so good to work with. though the glue started to come apart so like 3 of my brushes are just the head and not the handle because the glue didn&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> These brushes are 1 of 2 sets that I bought here on Amazon. Both from different makers. I have yet to try the others because these brushes are great. The brushes I use for eyeshadow hold the color nicely and by the same token, are so soft on my skin. Blush/Finishing powder brushes, the same results. All of the brushes do very well for what they are intended for and I am completely happy with them. I have not experienced any shedding of the bristles and the case is an added bonus. I recommend these as well as the company I got them from through Amazon. They were here quickly and packaged for safety as there weren&#x27;t any problems with any of the brushes upon receipt.</li>
            <li> These cute brushes are just that. They are so cute that if you&#x27;re a girl into pink you will love them because of the color. They are decent material and work well with makeup. They are a good deal for the count and for the materials. My daughter likes them simply cause they are pink...</li>
