            <li>I love this product and won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li>I think perhaps the Moroccan Oil, although I cannot be sure.  </li>
            <li>To be safe, I stopped using it altogether.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I was not so pleased to find an oily package at my doorstep.</li>
            <li>The shipper could have taken the time to ensure that the item was not in the opened position and done more to protect the item, 1/3 of the oil had leaked.  </li>
            <li>I do love the product but will never order from this sender again.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better than the one I use to treat my hair with.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li>and she said &#x27;your hair is so beautiful, it looks just like it did when we were kids, shiny and curly and young!&#x27;</li>
            <li>It does wonders with my hair and is hands down one of the best products I have ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, dyed, curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The oil is light and does not leave my hair looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>yes and still worth it!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, it keeps hair soft, smooth, reduces frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>It is worth the money</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil Treatment has brought back a healthy and shiny luster to my hair.</li>
            <li>this stuff is always awesome and cant go wrong, ever.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it was delivered earlier than promised.</li>
            <li>Thanks Moroccan Oil!</li>
            <li>They cost a bit more than other hair care products, but these are completely worth every cent.</li>
            <li>My hair is in so much better condition since I started using this stuff a long time ago.</li>
            <li>When using the Moroccan Oil I am able blow dry my hair and leave it looking shiny and sooth.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>The distributor was very uncooperative about sending me a new dispenser/plunger.</li>
            <li>When I use Moroccan oil it stays soft and straight and very conditioned.</li>
            <li>I agree with a lot of reveiwes when they say that the regular argan oil just sits on top of your hair but the morrocan oil really absorbed into my hair without it leaving it weighed down</li>
            <li>So ya I would recommend this to anyone , and remember this is only a first time use!</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and curls bouncy and well-formed.</li>
            <li>, I mean I applied more then the recommended amount</li>
            <li>it always looked dry and on hot days it would get frizzy.</li>
            <li>but I really have dry hair.</li>

            <li> Excellent oil. Gives a lot of shine to your hair and helps with tangling</li>
            <li> My hair gets colored, highlighted and lots of sun leading to dryness and a lackluster look. Moroccan Oil Treatment has brought back a healthy and shiny luster to my hair. I love this product and won&#x27;t go without it. I ordered the jumbo size of the oil treatment, hydrating shampoo and conditioner. I recommend it without reservations. Try It and you will love it! [[ASIN:B003AG35US Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Liter DUO! (33.8oz Each)]]</li>
            <li> I use this product exclusively. I have long thick hair and this product works.  I use to have to wash my hair every day but now I can skip a day or two and my hair looks just as good as the day I washed it.  Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a AA/AI/W female and am on a hair journey to grow my hair out from the perms.  I use this after the Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner and I just cannot say enough about this and all of my Moroccanoil products.  They cost a bit more than other hair care products, but these are completely worth every cent.</li>

            <li> I use this product when I straighten my hair. I have very curly hair. When I used to straighten imy hai it always looked dry and on hot days it would get frizzy.

            <li> I was not so pleased to find an oily package at my doorstep. The shipper could have taken the time to ensure that the item was not in the opened position and done more to protect the item, 1/3 of the oil had leaked.
