            <li>I am going to buy more.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>If none then you&#x27;ll be fine in most accounts, otherwise if you do, you&#x27;ll probably want to stop taking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I did read it is good for decalcifying the pineal gland, which really does matter to me.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that taking it every other day works best for me.  </li>
            <li>Stated as organic and was easy to take.</li>
            <li>Recommended by Dr. JV Hebbar (Easy Ayureda), this is a quality product that is always reliable.</li>
            <li>Feeling strong from Inside, some feeling of being protected by the greatness of Neem herb.</li>
            <li>I would need more time to see true results.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant and natural smell.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I will be doing this cleanse each year now from such great results.</li>
            <li>Please feel free to ask for updates....  </li>
            <li>I felt it was a genuine product, and would buy again when the time calls for it.</li>
            <li>just started the product, so far so good</li>
            <li>I read about Neem benefits, I think it does help to maintain good skin and act as natural antibiotic.</li>
            <li>All natural, has to be just as good.</li>
            <li>It helped my scalp folliclities heal...and so far so good thank god for neem</li>
            <li>This one is the &amp;#34;goldilocks&amp;#34; of neem supplements for me, i.e. it&#x27;s juuuuust right :)</li>
            <li>and I notice a difference in my intestinal function, I can breathe better, and I ran outof meds for my shingles and took 2 of the capsule right away when I felt it coming and the symptoms disappeared within the hour.  </li>
            <li>Easy and simple in handling and makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>I am quite familiar with ayurveda.</li>
            <li>for the good: worked on me, helped heal a cut slighty faster than anticipated, and in general felt a bit better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant difference in my skin as yet.</li>
            <li>Old Hindu man in Colombia explained the whole 5,000 year process of humans using this plant and trust me its more than good.</li>
            <li>In conjunction with the milk thistle it seems to clean any impurities out of my system.</li>
            <li>arrived as expected, great job done on packaging.</li>
            <li>That will be the strongest and best formula if your man enough to drink a full glass of light yellow looking vinegar.</li>
            <li>It can help with so many things and this brand is definitely high quality.</li>
            <li>got this and was greatly surprised at the better outlook it created , and I was greatly pleased and have  highly recommended it to family</li>
            <li>I prolly wont buy again because it didn&#x27;t work for what I needed, but still good stuff and would recommend for a detoxifier, or mental sharpening type of thing.</li>
            <li>I also felt more clear headed and just &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So powerful</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made a difference in many of my ailments, but unexpectedly I can also tell it&#x27;s had a really positive impact in the quality of my skin and hair!</li>
            <li>(Except they are big to swallow but totally worth it, even to him!!!)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product would work well for many other conditions.</li>
            <li>It came Ë†n a glass bottle that was broken, so need to find a better package system, otherwise I am sure its ok</li>
            <li>Old Hindu man in Colombia explained the whole 5,000 year process of humans using this plant and trust me its more than good.t to drink the tall glass.&lt;br /&gt;Trust</li>
            <li>yes i like it very much.</li>
            <li>The shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li>I love that it contains different parts of the plant and not just leaves.  </li>
            <li>Really clears up your skin!</li>
            <li>Knowing the goodness of Neem, started taking it for maintaining a good health in general and not for any specific problem.</li>
            <li>It is acting as a potent body cleanser, detoxifying agent.</li>
            <li>I have improved my sleeping after so many different attempts and methods to accommodate with the pump.</li>
            <li>what I found was that it should take a couple of weeks to see real change, but I can see it happening already!  </li>
            <li>and I love you only have to take one a day.  </li>
            <li>These have helped me so much!</li>
            <li>They idea is that with all 90 nutrients: 60 minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 amino acids and 3 fatty acids in healthy balance in the body, 95x out of 100, the body will dispose of all it&#x27;s junk just fine and heal itself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The 10 drops in a short glass of water will do some regeneration to your body internally and skin wise no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can take it on an empty stomach (very important because my Ayurvedic doctor told me neem should be taken BEFORE FOOD first thing in the morning).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price for an organic functional herb, it comes in a long lasting quantity.  </li>
            <li>I am certain my gums have fully recovered.  </li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li>I took this stuff for a while not noticing the effects, but now I have almost taken the whole bottle</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The neem really helps reduce the itching that comes with eczema.  </li>
            <li>Neem gently detoxifies the system, acts as a blood purifier and anti-parasitic.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to write this now</li>
            <li>Really helped skin problems.</li>
            <li>I need to buy three bottles at a time because I run out of this stuff really fast.</li>
            <li>I dont really know what this does for me</li>
            <li>This will give you a good cleansing (at least it did for me) which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>But so far, I&#x27;m feeling pretty positive.</li>
            <li>Even with other herbs I have tried, this brand has always given better results.</li>
            <li>So pretty early to judge</li>
            <li>As a tea water, that tasted 10 times more sour than the x3 concentrate extract drops you can also buy instead of the capsules...</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a decent potency, though not the highest on the market.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend Organic India for any supplements.</li>
            <li>This one is my go-to hands down! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from these capsules which i am no doctor to recommend, i can also say from personal experience that I have definitely had more potent self made doses of neem leaf extract in the past.</li>
            <li>Neem oil is sometimes recommended for eczema, but as anyone knows who has tried it (applied topically), it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like perfume.  </li>
            <li>I recommend taking it first thing in the morning and observing for any itching or red splotches developing in the day.</li>
            <li>I will continue to take it  because of all the&lt;br /&gt;health benefits; however, I haven&#x27;t noticed any specific change in my body that I am aware of.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and feel a new softness in my skin in a short period of time that I have been using it.  </li>
            <li>Though not gone considerably, I now only have the occasional mild blemish.</li>
            <li>But it has only been a little more than a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking them for a month now and noticed, how clear and brighter my skin has become.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well, definitely keeps me reordering it!</li>
            <li>The product definitely meets expectations at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>(Neem 300mg leafs, 15mg soft twigs,</li>
            <li>Finest Natural 1000mg Cinnamon Capsule  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too much, takes like 1-2 minutes of psychological preparation just to drink the tall glass.&lt;br /&gt;Trust</li>
            <li>I will keep using it till it heals completely</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s diabetic and her blood sugar has completely stabilized since she started taking neem oil.</li>
            <li>So far it is working for both.</li>
            <li>Overall, not sure I am taking anything more than a placebo.</li>
            <li>I only write this review after I have felt this way about more than 3 different products that not only have I tried, but tried other brands with.</li>
            <li>This product helps my skin stay clear from adult acne while contributing to my overall health.</li>
            <li>Finally, it has helped my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because my 14 year old son has moderate acne</li>
            <li>I have felt a slight positive difference since i have been taking it .</li>
            <li>Difficult to give an honest review on a pill in such a short time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> But I did read it is good for decalcifying the pineal gland, which really does matter to me.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that taking it every other day works best for me.  </li>
            <li> Stated as organic and was easy to take.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Dr. JV Hebbar (Easy Ayureda), this is a quality product that is always reliable.</li>
            <li> Feeling strong from Inside, some feeling of being protected by the greatness of Neem herb.</li>
            <li> I would need more time to see true results.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant and natural smell.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I will be doing this cleanse each year now from such great results.</li>
            <li> Please feel free to ask for updates....  </li>
            <li> I felt it was a genuine product, and would buy again when the time calls for it.</li>
            <li> just started the product, so far so good</li>
            <li> I read about Neem benefits, I think it does help to maintain good skin and act as natural antibiotic.</li>
            <li> All natural, has to be just as good.</li>
            <li> It helped my scalp folliclities heal...and so far so good thank god for neem</li>
            <li> This one is the &amp;#34;goldilocks&amp;#34; of neem supplements for me, i.e. it&#x27;s juuuuust right :)</li>
            <li> and I notice a difference in my intestinal function, I can breathe better, and I ran outof meds for my shingles and took 2 of the capsule right away when I felt it coming and the symptoms disappeared within the hour.  </li>
            <li> Easy and simple in handling and makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> I am quite familiar with ayurveda.</li>
            <li> for the good: worked on me, helped heal a cut slighty faster than anticipated, and in general felt a bit better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant difference in my skin as yet.</li>
            <li> Old Hindu man in Colombia explained the whole 5,000 year process of humans using this plant and trust me its more than good.</li>
            <li> In conjunction with the milk thistle it seems to clean any impurities out of my system.</li>
            <li> arrived as expected, great job done on packaging.</li>
            <li> That will be the strongest and best formula if your man enough to drink a full glass of light yellow looking vinegar.</li>
            <li> It can help with so many things and this brand is definitely high quality.</li>
            <li> got this and was greatly surprised at the better outlook it created , and I was greatly pleased and have  highly recommended it to family</li>
            <li> I prolly wont buy again because it didn&#x27;t work for what I needed, but still good stuff and would recommend for a detoxifier, or mental sharpening type of thing.</li>
            <li> I also felt more clear headed and just &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So powerful</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made a difference in many of my ailments, but unexpectedly I can also tell it&#x27;s had a really positive impact in the quality of my skin and hair!</li>
            <li> (Except they are big to swallow but totally worth it, even to him!!!)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product would work well for many other conditions.</li>
            <li> It came Ë†n a glass bottle that was broken, so need to find a better package system, otherwise I am sure its ok</li>
            <li> Old Hindu man in Colombia explained the whole 5,000 year process of humans using this plant and trust me its more than good.t to drink the tall glass.&lt;br /&gt;Trust</li>
            <li> yes i like it very much.</li>
            <li> The shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li> I love that it contains different parts of the plant and not just leaves.  </li>
            <li> Really clears up your skin!</li>
            <li> Knowing the goodness of Neem, started taking it for maintaining a good health in general and not for any specific problem.</li>
            <li> It is acting as a potent body cleanser, detoxifying agent.</li>
            <li> I have improved my sleeping after so many different attempts and methods to accommodate with the pump.</li>
            <li> what I found was that it should take a couple of weeks to see real change, but I can see it happening already!  </li>
            <li> and I love you only have to take one a day.  </li>
            <li> These have helped me so much!</li>
            <li> They idea is that with all 90 nutrients: 60 minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 amino acids and 3 fatty acids in healthy balance in the body, 95x out of 100, the body will dispose of all it&#x27;s junk just fine and heal itself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 10 drops in a short glass of water will do some regeneration to your body internally and skin wise no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can take it on an empty stomach (very important because my Ayurvedic doctor told me neem should be taken BEFORE FOOD first thing in the morning).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for an organic functional herb, it comes in a long lasting quantity.  </li>
            <li> I am certain my gums have fully recovered.  </li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li> I took this stuff for a while not noticing the effects, but now I have almost taken the whole bottle</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The neem really helps reduce the itching that comes with eczema.  </li>
            <li> Neem gently detoxifies the system, acts as a blood purifier and anti-parasitic.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to write this now</li>
            <li> Really helped skin problems.</li>
            <li> I need to buy three bottles at a time because I run out of this stuff really fast.</li>
            <li> I dont really know what this does for me</li>
            <li> This will give you a good cleansing (at least it did for me) which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> But so far, I&#x27;m feeling pretty positive.</li>
            <li> Even with other herbs I have tried, this brand has always given better results.</li>
            <li> So pretty early to judge</li>
            <li> As a tea water, that tasted 10 times more sour than the x3 concentrate extract drops you can also buy instead of the capsules...</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a decent potency, though not the highest on the market.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend Organic India for any supplements.</li>
            <li> This one is my go-to hands down! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from these capsules which i am no doctor to recommend, i can also say from personal experience that I have definitely had more potent self made doses of neem leaf extract in the past.</li>
            <li> Neem oil is sometimes recommended for eczema, but as anyone knows who has tried it (applied topically), it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like perfume.  </li>
            <li> I recommend taking it first thing in the morning and observing for any itching or red splotches developing in the day.</li>
            <li> I will continue to take it  because of all the&lt;br /&gt;health benefits; however, I haven&#x27;t noticed any specific change in my body that I am aware of.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and feel a new softness in my skin in a short period of time that I have been using it.  </li>
            <li> Though not gone considerably, I now only have the occasional mild blemish.</li>
            <li> But it has only been a little more than a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking them for a month now and noticed, how clear and brighter my skin has become.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well, definitely keeps me reordering it!</li>
            <li> The product definitely meets expectations at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> (Neem 300mg leafs, 15mg soft twigs,</li>
            <li> Finest Natural 1000mg Cinnamon Capsule  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too much, takes like 1-2 minutes of psychological preparation just to drink the tall glass.&lt;br /&gt;Trust</li>
            <li> I will keep using it till it heals completely</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s diabetic and her blood sugar has completely stabilized since she started taking neem oil.</li>
            <li> So far it is working for both.</li>
            <li> Overall, not sure I am taking anything more than a placebo.</li>
            <li> I only write this review after I have felt this way about more than 3 different products that not only have I tried, but tried other brands with.</li>
            <li> This product helps my skin stay clear from adult acne while contributing to my overall health.</li>
            <li> Finally, it has helped my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my 14 year old son has moderate acne</li>
            <li> I have felt a slight positive difference since i have been taking it .</li>
            <li> Difficult to give an honest review on a pill in such a short time.  </li>
            <li> Various face washes, lemon juice and vinegar have had small amounts of success but not very user-friendly for a teen-ager.  </li>
            <li> The first was too expensive, the second used only neem leaf and not other parts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please Please Please use caution, no matter how little this is possible it is possible, allot of meds present the chance of an allergic reaction, as such exercise caution.</li>
            <li> the wife is a mix, more so bad.</li>
            <li> is the combination, take twice a day or at least once before a meal with a glass of natural juice of your choice:&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has done what I expected .</li>
            <li> I have no real proof it does anything but believing is seeing after all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again I love the product for myself, and find it helps also in boosting my immune system for periods of time I feel I might become sick, But again exercise caution.</li>
            <li> As a word of warning, just be careful of products manufactured in other countries.</li>
            <li> Neem cleanses your blood among other things.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get this on prescribe and save like other organic india products I use.</li>
            <li> : don&#x27;t open up the capsul and drop it into a blender for a smoothie, I learned the hard way, it is disgustingly bitter.</li>
            <li> Not just regular gas, but uncomfortable and loud gas.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 20s with no medical problems.</li>
            <li> I mean she started itching and getting redness in different areas all over her body.</li>
            <li> so it is taking a little while.</li>
            <li> no complaints, i take neem everyday</li>
            <li> I take Neem everyday in lieu of Lysine.</li>
            <li> I am one that used to get sick at least five times a year, and in the last year since I have started using this specific company&#x27;s formula of Neem, I have only been sick one time and it was much shorter than usual as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only difference I have noticed after taking this once a day for 2 months is that I have been getting deep, painful zits that cannot be popped.  </li>
            <li> The topical products work a charm, i figured ill take it up a notch and consume it too.</li>
            <li> Quality counts but, unfortunately can order only one at a time bummer if you like to stock up.</li>
            <li> I am a type one diabetic since juvenile and a pump user for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is a side effect or something else.  </li>
            <li> Claims to assist with psoriasis, it did not help my small patch at all.</li>
            <li> The smell is no where near as bad as the oil.</li>
            <li> May be it is not good for me.</li>
            <li> Stopped used as it did not seem to have any effect and got expensive.</li>
            <li> Ill try to remember to follow up.</li>
            <li> Within days of allergy or cold symptoms coming on, I take Neem and it knocks it out within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I have not yet had a cold sore breakout.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with them!</li>
            <li> I have it really bad on my scalp</li>
            <li> It helped her acne in just one day, by drying out all her pimples a bit, but the bad is she had an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I feel very sick the two times I have tried it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a lot of benefit, gave me a horrible stomach ache.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Difficult to give an honest review on a pill in such a short time.  I would need more time to see true results.</li>
            <li> bomb dot com. I took this stuff for a while not noticing the effects, but now I have almost taken the whole bottle and I notice if I haven&#x27;t taken it. I prolly wont buy again because it didn&#x27;t work for what I needed, but still good stuff and would recommend for a detoxifier, or mental sharpening type of thing.</li>
            <li> This seems to be good stuff.  I&#x27;ve been taking neem supplements for over a year, this being my 3rd company to try.  The first was too expensive, the second used only neem leaf and not other parts.  This one is the &amp;#34;goldilocks&amp;#34; of neem supplements for me, i.e. it&#x27;s juuuuust right :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At under $10 for 3 months supply, it&#x27;s affordable.  Also, it&#x27;s a decent potency, though not the highest on the market.  I had no adverse reactions and I can take it on an empty stomach (very important because my Ayurvedic doctor told me neem should be taken BEFORE FOOD first thing in the morning).  Finally, it has helped my adult acne.  Though not gone considerably, I now only have the occasional mild blemish.</li>
            <li> arrived as expected, great job done on packaging. product seems to be working</li>
            <li> been taking it for 2 weeks I feel better I think it is working, so I do not know what else I can say</li>
            <li> Excellent quality - just like you&#x27;d get from a store. Highly recommend Organic India for any supplements. I will be buying these again and again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and feel a new softness in my skin in a short period of time that I have been using it.  I saw the product reviewed on Dr. Oz.</li>
            <li> Good price for great product!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and I am ordering more today!</li>
            <li> This product is working well for me.  I love that it contains different parts of the plant and not just leaves.  I also love that it&#x27;s a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> just started the product, so far so good</li>
            <li> I feel good with this product. using it for almost a month. I&#x27;m taking one tablet a day. Feeling strong from Inside, some feeling of being protected by the greatness of Neem herb. I read about Neem benefits, I think it does help to maintain good skin and act as natural antibiotic.</li>
            <li> Love Neem this is a great product. I would also recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  I just ran out and ordering again.</li>
            <li> im taking this with honey and turmric and it has made my eyes whiter. yes i like it very much.</li>
            <li> I  have been taking this for a about 10 days and I notice a difference in my intestinal function, I can breathe better, and I ran outof meds for my shingles and took 2 of the capsule right away when I felt it coming and the symptoms disappeared within the hour.  Amazing!  I am now officially rid of Big Pharma.</li>
            <li> lowered by blood sugars.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a lot of benefit, gave me a horrible stomach ache.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you check with your doctor and you know what the effect is going to be.</li>
            <li> I take the product internally and I use in a concoction I use on my face and I use in my tooth powder to brusk my teeth.  I have been very very pleased with the results.  My skin looks and feels fabulous.  Cant wait to go to the dentist. I am certain my gums have fully recovered.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well, definitely keeps me reordering it!</li>
            <li> I am quite familiar with ayurveda. This is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Really clears up your skin!</li>
            <li> This is such a versatile supplement. It can help with so many things and this brand is definitely high quality. I took this as part of a parasite cleanse. I took for 30 days as a sort of an annual spring cleaning just in case I had picked up any parasites. I was also doing papaya smoothies for 7 days as well as part of this protocol. Well...they worked (I&#x27;ll spare you the details!) I also felt more clear headed and just &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;. I will be doing this cleanse each year now from such great results. I&#x27;m sure this product would work well for many other conditions.</li>
            <li> Arrived in 1 piece, swiftly and it&#x27;s kept me healthy for years. In conjunction with the milk thistle it seems to clean any impurities out of my system.</li>
            <li> Have been using for awhile and it is starting to help with the psoriasis.  I have it really bad on my scalp so it is taking a little while.</li>
            <li> I bought this on some recommendations, famous and otherwise, followed the directions and saw no difference. There was no noticeable change from while I was taking this and when I wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company also keeps e-mailing about deals, even when I said I don&#x27;t want to hear from them again.</li>
            <li> Knowing the goodness of Neem, started taking it for maintaining a good health in general and not for any specific problem.</li>
            <li> Bought one to give it a try.  The only affect it had on me was to give me gas.  Not just regular gas, but uncomfortable and loud gas.  Won&#x27;t be buying a second bottle.</li>
            <li> The shipment was very fast. You can taste the supplements. The smell is no where near as bad as the oil. I started seeing benefit. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> It came Ë†n a glass bottle that was broken, so need to find a better package system, otherwise I am sure its ok</li>
            <li> got this and was greatly surprised at the better outlook it created , and I was greatly pleased and have  highly recommended it to family</li>
            <li> I like to take this product. Easy and simple in handling and makes me feel good. Has a pleasant and natural smell.</li>
            <li> Stopped used as it did not seem to have any effect and got expensive.</li>
            <li> Reduced my diabetes dramatically ,,then had my brother try it and worked for him too,highly recommended and natural,and oh my god I needed more words!</li>
            <li> Love Neem and this product is a good quality!</li>
            <li> have used before and like it.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be a great product. I am an avid Neem user because it helps my psoriasis and has greatly improved my immune system. Within days of allergy or cold symptoms coming on, I take Neem and it knocks it out within a couple of days. I am one that used to get sick at least five times a year, and in the last year since I have started using this specific company&#x27;s formula of Neem, I have only been sick one time and it was much shorter than usual as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this brand has been one that seems to always follow through with a good product, without fillers or misguided information to deceive me into buying a product that turns out to not truly be what they say it is. I will never buy any herb from another brand if I can help it. Even with other herbs I have tried, this brand has always given better results. I only write this review after I have felt this way about more than 3 different products that not only have I tried, but tried other brands with. This one is my go-to hands down! :)</li>
            <li> Good product would recommend. I have felt a slight positive difference since i have been taking it . flavour is a bit strong tho so take it with a good amount of water.</li>
            <li> The product definitely meets expectations at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This stuff works GREAT!!!!! It&#x27;s so GREAT I&#x27;ve already bought it again!! :) Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, came as described and on time as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition and is working well for my needs, good product and I would order this product again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Since I started having just one pill a day, I have been observing a  good difference in skin. And pimples are not coming after that. But it is only a month now for which I have been taking them..So pretty early to judge</li>
            <li> The topical products work a charm, i figured ill take it up a notch and consume it too. All natural, has to be just as good. Ill try to remember to follow up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for an organic functional herb, it comes in a long lasting quantity.  But I personally have shifted on from these kinds of products, on to simple nutrition as the ultimate defense on disease and preventing disease.  They idea is that with all 90 nutrients: 60 minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 amino acids and 3 fatty acids in healthy balance in the body, 95x out of 100, the body will dispose of all it&#x27;s junk just fine and heal itself.  But I did read it is good for decalcifying the pineal gland, which really does matter to me.  So, short of a scientific experiement to prove it&#x27;s effectiveness, it&#x27;s a good product...  I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: don&#x27;t open up the capsul and drop it into a blender for a smoothie, I learned the hard way, it is disgustingly bitter.</li>
            <li> Great product and transaction</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  Stated as organic and was easy to take.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Love the product. It is acting as a potent body cleanser, detoxifying agent. I have always been a great believer in the medicinal powers of Neem.</li>
            <li> I do not like the product. I feel very sick the two times I have tried it. May be it is not good for me. I am thinking of throwing it away</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Started taking for stomach &amp; intestinal problems.antiviral, blood cleanser and more. Take several organic India products. Quality counts but, unfortunately can order only one at a time bummer if you like to stock up.</li>
            <li> The neem really helps reduce the itching that comes with eczema.  Neem oil is sometimes recommended for eczema, but as anyone knows who has tried it (applied topically), it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like perfume.  In fact, the smell is rather offensive.  With the pills, it helps the skin and no problem with the smell.  I did notice that taking it every other day works best for me.  If I take it every day, it seems to keep me awake at night.</li>
            <li> These pills really cleans out your system and great for your immune system. This product does everything it states it does. I&#x27;ve been taking them for a month now and noticed, how clear and brighter my skin has become. I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> for the good: worked on me, helped heal a cut slighty faster than anticipated, and in general felt a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the wife is a mix, more so bad. It helped her acne in just one day, by drying out all her pimples a bit, but the bad is she had an allergic reaction to it. By that I mean she started itching and getting redness in different areas all over her body. She finally told me of it when she told me she woke up gasping for air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Please Please use caution, no matter how little this is possible it is possible, allot of meds present the chance of an allergic reaction, as such exercise caution. I recommend taking it first thing in the morning and observing for any itching or red splotches developing in the day. If none then you&#x27;ll be fine in most accounts, otherwise if you do, you&#x27;ll probably want to stop taking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I love the product for myself, and find it helps also in boosting my immune system for periods of time I feel I might become sick, But again exercise caution.</li>
            <li> I have been taking 1-2 tablets each day for almost a week now. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant difference in my skin as yet. Maybe I should give it more time.</li>
            <li> This product helps my skin stay clear from adult acne while contributing to my overall health. I read that there are so many advantages to taking neem.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. A product that actually does was it says! Heard Dr. Oz talk about Neem and how it&#x27;s supposed to help with Digestion and your immune system. But found it also helps to cleanse the blood. Feel better since I encorporated it into my vitamin regamin.</li>
            <li> Quality product, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> no complaints, i take neem everyday</li>
            <li> love organic India. Their supplements are always preferred as they have great quality. You can never go wrong with them!</li>
            <li> Recommended by Dr. JV Hebbar (Easy Ayureda), this is a quality product that is always reliable. Neem gently detoxifies the system, acts as a blood purifier and anti-parasitic. No tummy upset. Can be safely taken long-term. Great for sore throats!!</li>
            <li> I read about neem in searching for remedies to parasites. So glad I did! it&#x27;s made a difference in many of my ailments, but unexpectedly I can also tell it&#x27;s had a really positive impact in the quality of my skin and hair! Great find.</li>
            <li> This product has done what I expected .</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I am a type one diabetic since juvenile and a pump user for over 10 years. Lilly Humalog Insulin has taken a toll in body&lt;br /&gt;Neem Leafs are the only things that have ever lowered my blood sugars instantly and maintained results.&lt;br /&gt;Noni didn&#x27;t do it, for me... this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now take a cocktail of organic pills and they are definitely boosting my metabolism and I feel a good energy burn inside for the every day activities. I have improved my sleeping after so many different attempts and methods to accommodate with the pump. Now I simply sleep like a rock, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the combination, take twice a day or at least once before a meal with a glass of natural juice of your choice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Bring Back Diabetes Capsule Cocktail&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1x Organic Indian NEEM Capsule  |  (Neem 300mg leafs, 15mg soft twigs, flowers 15mg)&lt;br /&gt;1x Nature&#x27;s way Neem Leaves Capsule  |  (Neem 475mg leafs)&lt;br /&gt;1x AlphaBetic specialized nutrition Capsule  |  (Biotin 300mcg, Calcium 20mg, Chromium 600mcg, Cinnamon bark 1g)&lt;br /&gt;1x Finest Natural 1000mg Cinnamon Capsule  |  (Cinnamon bark 1000mg)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from these capsules which i am no doctor to recommend, i can also say from personal experience that I have definitely had more potent self made doses of neem leaf extract in the past. As a tea water, that tasted 10 times more sour than the x3 concentrate extract drops you can also buy instead of the capsules...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 10 drops in a short glass of water will do some regeneration to your body internally and skin wise no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commercially this &amp;#34;x3&amp;#34; is strongest I have tried, but again if you buy neem leafs and boil them your self. That will be the strongest and best formula if your man enough to drink a full glass of light yellow looking vinegar. Once a day around lunch time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried in the morning and it&#x27;s too much, takes like 1-2 minutes of psychological preparation just to drink the tall glass.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, you can&#x27;t overdose. Old Hindu man in Colombia explained the whole 5,000 year process of humans using this plant and trust me its more than good.t to drink the tall glass.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, you can&#x27;t overdose. Old Hindu man in Colombia explained the whole 5,000 year process of humans using this plant and trust me its more than good.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Kept me well all winter!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my 14 year old son has moderate acne and I have been trying to find out what would help him.  Various face washes, lemon juice and vinegar have had small amounts of success but not very user-friendly for a teen-ager.  So I read that neem helps with TONS of ailments and acne MIGHT be helped.  I have given him (and me) one pill, twice daily with food for the last 4 days and I have to tell you that I already see an improvement.  The redness has gone away and now the pores seem to be shrinking....  As for me, I just took it too so he knew it was safe and my chronic back pain is 40% better in day 4!!!!  (Plus my face looks and feels great too!!! )  I really wanted to write this now just incase someone sees this and thinks this may help them or their kid, I think it will and it is easy to take!  (Except they are big to swallow but totally worth it, even to him!!!)  I did some research and what I found was that it should take a couple of weeks to see real change, but I can see it happening already!  Thank you Mother Nature!!!  Please feel free to ask for updates....  (I should have taken pictures....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/31/2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely working for my son, I plan on posting before and after pictures next week!  He has a spring in his step now that he knows he looks so much better!!!!  I know different people have different chemistry so it might not work on everyone like it has on my son, but I would definitely give it a try and take as directed and give it 2 weeks.  But it has only been a little more than a week and it is WORKING for him!!!  YAY!!!!</li>
            <li> This will give you a good cleansing (at least it did for me) which is what I bought it for. After cleansing the skin will look beautiful with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Incredible stuff!  So powerful and I love you only have to take one a day.  I have stocked up on this stuff.  It gives me energy and it is a blood cleanser.  I feel a difference after taking this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have taken Organic India products for 5 years, I love their products!!!  I decided to try Neem because I heard and read so many great things about this product. I was recently in the hospital because of two different infections. I was on  5 different antibiotics for 8 days, and also when I came home for 30 days. Neem cleanses your blood among other things. I feel that after all I have been through, my body needs a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel  the effect of these. but it purifies the blood and good for the skin too.. I like that these are organic.</li>
            <li> Neem is the s***! It helped my scalp folliclities heal...and so far so good thank god for neem I will keep using it till it heals completely</li>
            <li> organic india neem is a great product for holistic use.  I would truly recommend this product to others who are living holistic.</li>
            <li> Really helped skin problems.</li>
            <li> I still need more time to figure out what I think about Neem. But so far, I&#x27;m feeling pretty positive.</li>
            <li> I bought his product for my mother. She lives it and asked me to get her 5 more bottles because she doesn&#x27;t want o run out. She&#x27;s diabetic and her blood sugar has completely stabilized since she started taking neem oil.</li>
            <li> Great for skin, hair &amp; immune system.</li>
            <li> The only difference I have noticed after taking this once a day for 2 months is that I have been getting deep, painful zits that cannot be popped.  My shoulders both hurt as well.  Not sure if that is a side effect or something else.  Overall, not sure I am taking anything more than a placebo.</li>
            <li> Claims to assist with psoriasis, it did not help my small patch at all. Oh well, I tried, won&#x27;t buy again though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it for my skin and birth control. So far it is working for both. I need to buy three bottles at a time because I run out of this stuff really fast.</li>
            <li> I have no real proof it does anything but believing is seeing after all. I felt it was a genuine product, and would buy again when the time calls for it.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get this on prescribe and save like other organic india products I use.</li>
            <li> This product actually gave me dizzy spells. I am in my late 20s with no medical problems. Within a week of taking this product, I started getting dizzy spells. After I stopped taking the capsules, the dizziness went away. I switched to Nature&#x27;s Way neem capsules (made in the US) and the capsules have been effective and have given me no side effects (i.e. the dizziness). I am not a spokesperson for any product. I am simply stating the facts and telling you my experience and what I did. As a word of warning, just be careful of products manufactured in other countries.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Will order more soon.  Thank you, God bless</li>
            <li> I have been taking Neem for several months now.  I will continue to take it  because of all the&lt;br /&gt;health benefits; however, I haven&#x27;t noticed any specific change in my body that I am aware of.</li>
            <li> These have helped me so much! I love Organic India. Very happy customer :D</li>
            <li> I dont really know what this does for me but I like taking these occasionally..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with this product...it has helped a lot with my stomach issues.</li>
            <li> Never noticed any difference from taking this and not taking this product.</li>
            <li> I take Neem everyday in lieu of Lysine. I have not yet had a cold sore breakout. But, only time will tell. I am going to buy more. This is a supplement you can &#x27;taste&#x27;. So take with plenty of water.</li>
