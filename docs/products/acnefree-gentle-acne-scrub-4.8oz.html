            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>If you have sensetive skin this is a great scrub.</li>

            <li>Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for years and haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that successfully clears up acne without damaging my skin in another way.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I have found it!</li>
            <li>I love the AcneFree line!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly blown away.</li>
            <li>It is like liquid soap, working nice if you able to keep it in your hand before putting on your face.</li>
            <li>I can say that this product has been able to do that</li>
            <li>Love this product and it works.</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>This should actually be more of a cleanser, than a scrub</li>
            <li>The cap is very cheaply made and cracks easily.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim and it works great in controlling my skin condition and has improved my skin&#x27;s overall appearance and texture.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a present it smells great</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s wonderful to find this little gem that doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m adding to the ageing process!</li>
            <li>I like the other one better, but I still use this one because it smells good too.</li>
            <li>Does have a mild scent to them.</li>
            <li>The first reason I got this \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; was because of the fantastic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Its gentle enough to use every day and so far its the best cleanser I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving this product, I only use once a week</li>
            <li>and its super gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;the other scrubs i&#x27;ve used were more viscous and scent free</li>
            <li>It smells funny</li>
            <li>Texas is so hot</li>
            <li>This is a great daily scrub that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Scrub works great as a pre-shave cleanser to help prevent pseudofolliculitis, mild scented, not thick like most scrubs, a little goes a long way, highly recommended for those with sensitive, acne prone, or razor bump problem skin.</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin super soft and clears acne</li>
            <li>I think this product works, and my favorite thing is it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or dry it out.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for over a decade and certain products help.</li>
            <li>Its gentle indeed.</li>
            <li>I think it is being discontinued so you may not find it much longer.</li>
            <li>Balanced it, cleansed it, and it&#x27;s so gentle that I can be assured</li>
            <li>and I really like this scrub.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel soft and smooth but didn&#x27;t really help clear blackheads or discourage acne from popping up.</li>
            <li>This is more of a normal face wash for people that don&#x27;t have acne or are just needing to give their skin a break from other chemicals.</li>
            <li>Ity smells like cream or some kind of a icing; I am not sure I like it.</li>
            <li>I wish this scrub was a little more &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; but it says gentle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle on the skin, the beads still exfoliate, and it does in fact, clear up my acne!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this if you have sensitive skin and struggle with acne!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older yet still having adult acne</li>
            <li>Still, my face is clear</li>
            <li>and i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Now I understand how others might not like that it&#x27;s too soft.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>with a few days of using this acnefree gentle scrub, my face has cleared up, skin looks radiant and is soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>So what&#x27;s my secret that helps me keep a low budget, helps my pH (which prevents me from getting lines or wrinkles on my face, plus the acne), and makes it seem like my face is naturally healthy?</li>
            <li>: I got my face wet with water that was between warm and cold, put centimeters of the cleanser on my fingers, and gently did circular motions all over my face.</li>
            <li>i recently started to get acne again at age 29 and was using proactiv which totally caused my skin to dry out completely.</li>

            <li> i recently started to get acne again at age 29 and was using proactiv which totally caused my skin to dry out completely.</li>
            <li> usually buy CVS store brand apricot scrub, but I was placing an order and needed just a little for free shipping.</li>
            <li> A pretty decent scrub overall if you don&#x27;t have really oily skin or have bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> but I think that when I used to press down on what I put on I would actually make it more difficult for the dirt to leave my skin.</li>
            <li> It feels soft, yes, but it also cleared up some small bumps (assuing its those sillia things from oil build up).</li>
            <li> What I really disliked was that it was very liquid and not more viscous like a face wash</li>
            <li> I just bought this tonight at CVS, and with one use (I tried 2 other products from different companies that failed, leaving my skin extremely oily, more so than usual)</li>
            <li> Her face used to get compliments all the time but again, anything rough over your skin will feel like it SHOULD work</li>
            <li> and I can see a difference when coupled with my other products.</li>
            <li> it does not clean or help with the acne.</li>
            <li> it is almost like you put raw cream on your face, not even a sour cream.</li>
            <li> NEVER press down!</li>
            <li> Ive&#x27;s green tea scrub to see how that fares with my complexion.</li>
            <li> What a  mistake, texture hard to describe, maybe like liquid plastic &amp; the smell is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be semi-runny coming out, but it goes on thick.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> They look worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one did not work for me and made it worse instead.</li>
            <li> so it was rather difficult to apply and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> worst facial wash ever.</li>
            <li> Well anyways, this would end with washing my face with cold water.</li>
            <li> However, it was packaged so well, leaking was impossible.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not for those with really bad acne.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was too watery. I haven&#x27;t used product before So unaware if that Is how it comes. Will not order this product again. It smells funny</li>
            <li> I was actually really impressed with this face scrub. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for years and haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that successfully clears up acne without damaging my skin in another way. I can say that this product has been able to do that and I am so glad I have found it! It&#x27;s really gentle on the skin, the beads still exfoliate, and it does in fact, clear up my acne! I would highly recommend this if you have sensitive skin and struggle with acne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this product, I only use once a week and I can see a difference when coupled with my other products. Speedy delivery and I loved the fact that the bottle was wrapped in plastic so there was no concern for the bottle leaking. Texas is so hot and I was worried about this sitting on my porch until I got home from work. However, it was packaged so well, leaking was impossible.</li>
            <li> I love the AcneFree line! I wish this scrub was a little more &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; but it says gentle so I suppose that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not. Still, my face is clear so I guess it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Its gentle indeed. But it&#x27;s not for those with really bad acne. It won&#x27;t take care of it. This is more of a normal face wash for people that don&#x27;t have acne or are just needing to give their skin a break from other chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Does have a mild scent to them.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for over a decade and certain products help. Unfortunately, this one did not work for me and made it worse instead. However, this varies based on the person. What I really disliked was that it was very liquid and not more viscous like a face wash so it was rather difficult to apply and exfoliate. Also the smell to me was rather repugnant and remains on my hands and faced unless masked with something ie scented lotion.&lt;br /&gt;the other scrubs i&#x27;ve used were more viscous and scent free so i was expecting the same.</li>
            <li> I use AcneFree wash, figured for the price I&#x27;d try their scrub. What a  mistake, texture hard to describe, maybe like liquid plastic &amp; the smell is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy CVS store brand apricot scrub, but I was placing an order and needed just a little for free shipping. What a mistake going back to CVS store brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly blown away. I just bought this tonight at CVS, and with one use (I tried 2 other products from different companies that failed, leaving my skin extremely oily, more so than usual) my skin just... cleared up. It feels soft, yes, but it also cleared up some small bumps (assuing its those sillia things from oil build up). Smells great. It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li> If you have sensetive skin this is a great scrub. I think it is being discontinued so you may not find it much longer.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it works.</li>
            <li> Scrub works great as a pre-shave cleanser to help prevent pseudofolliculitis, mild scented, not thick like most scrubs, a little goes a long way, highly recommended for those with sensitive, acne prone, or razor bump problem skin.</li>
            <li> i recently started to get acne again at age 29 and was using proactiv which totally caused my skin to dry out completely. with a few days of using this acnefree gentle scrub, my face has cleared up, skin looks radiant and is soft and hydrated! AMAZING!!!!!! and its super gentle on the skin and i have sensitive skin it did not irritate even the smallest amount!</li>
            <li> This is a great daily scrub that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I was using the Step 1 daily scrub from the 3 step kit but it was drying out my skin during the winter months.  I tried this on a whim and it works great in controlling my skin condition and has improved my skin&#x27;s overall appearance and texture.  I&#x27;m getting older yet still having adult acne so it&#x27;s wonderful to find this little gem that doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m adding to the ageing process!</li>
            <li> I got this as a present it smells great and it makes your skin super soft and clears acne what more could you ask for? (-:</li>
            <li> it is almost like you put raw cream on your face, not even a sour cream. It is like liquid soap, working nice if you able to keep it in your hand before putting on your face. Ity smells like cream or some kind of a icing; I am not sure I like it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for...without the excessive pricetag. What did it do to my skin? Balanced it, cleansed it, and it&#x27;s so gentle that I can be assured I won&#x27;t rip or hurt my skin. Now I understand how others might not like that it&#x27;s too soft. This should actually be more of a cleanser, than a scrub but people have seen a microscopic look at skin that&#x27;s been washed with bigger beads and it&#x27;s not good. My mom has been washing her face and using a cloth to swipe away all the dirt and even cotton has caused her skin to develop the spider veins over her face. Her face used to get compliments all the time but again, anything rough over your skin will feel like it SHOULD work but it&#x27;s actually not. So what&#x27;s my secret that helps me keep a low budget, helps my pH (which prevents me from getting lines or wrinkles on my face, plus the acne), and makes it seem like my face is naturally healthy? Stuff like this. The first reason I got this \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; was because of the fantastic ingredients. These ingredients don&#x27;t include stuff like aloe vera or nut-tree ingredients which I&#x27;m allergic to, so that was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I did: I got my face wet with water that was between warm and cold, put centimeters of the cleanser on my fingers, and gently did circular motions all over my face. NEVER press down! Now maybe this can be a myth for some people but I think that when I used to press down on what I put on I would actually make it more difficult for the dirt to leave my skin. Well anyways, this would end with washing my face with cold water. And that&#x27;s it! So I would suggest this for anyone that had normal-ish still when they were younger, oilier skin from puberty, acne, or they are trying to keep their face from premature wrinkles. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched from this one to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender liquid soap. I like the other one better, but I still use this one because it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I think this product works, and my favorite thing is it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or dry it out. It can be semi-runny coming out, but it goes on thick. The reason for the lower stars is that it smells like vomit. If you can stand the odor, try it.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day in the mornings. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help the acne or blackheads at all. If anything. They look worse. I may switch to St Ive&#x27;s green tea scrub to see how that fares with my complexion.</li>
            <li> A pretty decent scrub overall if you don&#x27;t have really oily skin or have bad breakouts. Made my skin feel soft and smooth but didn&#x27;t really help clear blackheads or discourage acne from popping up.</li>
            <li> worst facial wash ever. it feels as if they have added water to it. it does not clean or help with the acne.</li>
            <li> I have moderate to severe acne and I really like this scrub. Its gentle enough to use every day and so far its the best cleanser I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The product is great!  The smell is wonderful.  It makes your skin so soft and clear.  The downside is the bottle.  It pours out way to fast causing a lot to go to waste.  The cap is very cheaply made and cracks easily.</li>
