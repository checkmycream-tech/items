            <li>This is perfect for a first trial-lamp.)  </li>
            <li>Also, I read that some UV light is great for people who suffer from depression during winter.  </li>
            <li>If they used salon quality lights with more power in this thing it could actually be a good product, shame.</li>
            <li>before I started seeing any kind of improvement, so don&#x27;t dump it&lt;br /&gt;off</li>

            <li>From now on, I will pay more attention to the reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;a month of moving closer and closer to the bulbs and wasting more and more time&lt;br /&gt;trying to get an ounce of \\&quot;glow,\\</li>
            <li>Enjoy!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I have had the tanner for a week now and love it.</li>
            <li>So, it should be OK to use in moderation or don&#x27;t overuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews more closely.  </li>
            <li>per day to be sure you don&#x27;t have a deficiency?</li>
            <li>Using it for this reason, I love it.</li>
            <li>To summarize - super pleased!</li>
            <li>Pretty good value for what&lt;br /&gt;it does.  </li>
            <li>so worth my time!!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t tan easily.  </li>
            <li>I tan easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so easy to use at home.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Return was easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size and has a fairly good strength (just not as powerful as I would like though).  </li>
            <li>and I have a nice light tan which give me beautiful color aside from \\&quot;pale with acne\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have always tanned very easily, and this works very well for me!</li>
            <li>Had to return to Amazon (used Amazon&#x27;s free UPS pre-paid return</li>
            <li>The lamp is covered by two pieces of styrofoam to perfectly fit into a CalSun cardboard box.  </li>
            <li>The UV light is helpful to people with seasonal&lt;br /&gt;depression disorder, too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>I was looking for exposure to UV without damage from \\&quot;intense\\&quot; light.</li>
            <li>Vite D is important for many of our body systems to function right, from what I&#x27;ve read.    </li>
            <li>The instruction booklet is just the right size--2 pages:).  </li>
            <li>machine isn&#x27;t super duper strong so it won&#x27;t give you that desired deep&lt;br /&gt;tan</li>
            <li>i was excited to get this product and start using it.</li>
            <li>Boxed with two boxes, the tanner&#x27;s original box and another box, no space between</li>
            <li>This sun lamp is amazing especially in November when most days are gloomy.</li>
            <li>some clean, oil-free moisturizer on your face before turning it on.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re really fair-skinned or don&#x27;t tan easily, but any more&lt;br /&gt;genetically-blessed people should be fine.  </li>
            <li>you also have to sit really close to it where my nose was just about touching the bulbs to start to see a tan.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it has met all the needs and wants I bought it for.</li>
            <li>a full 20 min.</li>
            <li>and he was VERY positive and thought it a good idea for vite D and light deprivation especially.</li>
            <li>I found I preferred a little closer than 4 inches because I absolutely loved the warmth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use and&lt;br /&gt;comes</li>
            <li>First off, I do want to point out that I do tan fairly easy.</li>
            <li>this is the best product in the whole wide world!!!</li>
            <li>Mirrored foil behind light in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with this product......</li>
            <li>What I do have is nice color or my face, d√©colletage, and shoulders, upper arms.</li>
            <li>My co-workers commented on how healthy, how rested, how young I looked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m feeling a nice tan starting.</li>
            <li>Oh and one last tip: Have the bulbs warm up for about 2 minutes before you sit in front of it.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I made a right decision.</li>
            <li>I, chose this product because the price was right</li>
            <li>(I think my skin looks more greyish now, and husband agrees), so with no base tan I&#x27;m being careful to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>I think it might be good for a slight arthritic ache</li>
            <li>this lamp helped very much on getting her the UV she needed during the winter months...</li>
            <li>Thank, You very much.</li>
            <li>got no color the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>it looks like more of a sunburn, then a deep tan.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and explicit protective use instructions!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in increasing your vitamin d, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>(This is my first lamp of any type</li>
            <li>My first session with this lamp was 10 minutes, and the warmth almost put me to sleep.</li>
            <li>However it works good enough to maintain a tan till you can get back out in the sun or to the salon.</li>
            <li>The heat it emits is not too hot, but a pleasant warmth that lets you know (or at least gives you hope)</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, I didn&#x27;t care about becoming tan</li>
            <li>The only positive was that the return was easy.</li>
            <li>I have only had this product a short time and my face is starting to take on a nice color already. :-)  </li>
            <li>The lamp (bulbs) do not appear to be strong enough ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough.</li>
            <li>Doesnot seem strong enough for tanning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I really like the machine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, I have found that it is really beneficial to use a skin moisturizer afterwards.  </li>
            <li>; beds don&#x27;t give much results.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This lamp does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I use a medical tanning light for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>The whole point of tanning bed&#x27;s and lamps are for fast results in my opinion.</li>
            <li>had 1 for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>VERY well packaged.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to invest much money in one yet until I tested one.</li>
            <li>And who really gets out in sunshine (with arms and legs exposed, as prescribed by experts),</li>
            <li>It made me wish I had a whole body lamp..or a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Feels like your on the beach catching a few rays.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes it leaves your skin feeling warm.</li>
            <li>I really recommend a clean, oil-free moisturizer like a simple aloe vera gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly, I would always use the tanning lamp once I stepped out of the shower and my face was squeaky clean and applied (non sun-screen or non-SPF) moisturizer before sitting in front of the lamp.</li>
            <li>In the summer I brown quick, but in the winter I become a very pasty white.</li>
            <li>Then I tried a the full 20 minutes and currently in the 6th session and am waiting til I finish to see if I got any color or not.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check your shipment for any loose fuses!!!  </li>
            <li>But actually the skin condition is better treated by religiously applying Eucerin hand cream every morning and every night.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for a few reasons, mostly health reasons.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think some of us get out in the real sun enough on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>And I doubt we really get enough D from foods on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>at the nearest Goodwill if you&#x27;re expecting out-of-the-box results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a month and after using it for awhile I pretty pleased with&lt;br /&gt;the subtle light-brown color of my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I used to live in Waikiki and it would take days to build up a tan.  </li>
            <li>Live and Learn I suppose</li>
            <li>I have olive skin that has always been very easy to tan, but for about 3 years now (lifestyle change) have not spent much time actually getting outside enough</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like someone is ringing a very loud bell in your ear.</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews prior to placing my order in the first place.  </li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;definitely not a health risk, especially if you just follow the instructions</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant about buying this after reading all the reviews, but with Amazons easy 30 day return policy I figured I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose.</li>
            <li>But with my blonde hair and dark skin, I can maintain my  bastard love child look of the 80&#x27;s David Lee Roth and Eric Estrada between sessions.&lt;br /&gt;~Joanne</li>
            <li>Medical doctor dermatologist specialists use UV lamps on patients with certain types of skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>Certainly relaxed me totally.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even have return information and address that was clear.</li>
            <li>suggestion for Amazon is to clearly mark all sides of the outer box</li>
            <li>(I think you&#x27;d get at least SOME from it) in more of a natural way than with supplements.</li>
            <li>My 16 yr old son acne cleared up in almost 3 days after 2 years of everything over the counter, as seen on tv, or prescribed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so surprised because the lamp came well packaged in 3 boxes.  </li>
            <li>One of the lights was not working straight out of the Box...sent back.</li>
            <li>The bulbs are clearly marked &amp;#34;UVA&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the 9 months of clouds we get in the Pacific N.W., getting sun-rays is only a summer thing around here.</li>
            <li>I just dropped this useless tanner off at Goodwill, good riddance.</li>
            <li>The price is right and all I need is about 15-20 min daily, an inch or so from the bulbs and my acne has improved immensely.</li>
            <li>I have blue eyes, and dark blonde or very light brown hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an orange color- or super dark brown color either.</li>
            <li>I did not see a big different for the first time</li>
            <li>but i used it for an hour the first day and the second and third</li>
            <li>If I had light skin I&#x27;d be real careful, as you would with actual sunlight.</li>
            <li>My Dr. Said a small amount of exposure to UV light helps kill bacteria in the skin.</li>
            <li>I need tan my face, but not much dark so need it for the winter, it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it also helps with the seasonal disorder if you live where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine for several days at a time.</li>
            <li>Total of three boxes.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived new, not damaged in any way and all bulbs worked.</li>
            <li>Many reviews say it&#x27;s weak.</li>
            <li>i guess i should of just spent the money to buy a real tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked that a product like this can get as many good reviews - totally undeserved.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooooo darn loud that I can hear the second ticker through my headphones and when the timer goes off....</li>
            <li>Heat that same tanning bed up for ten minutes and wow the results.  </li>
            <li>This is the only SUN LAMP that I could now find for sale on the Internet, although the same exact lamp is also sold under other brand names.  </li>
            <li>I have light pale skin and can put this an inch away from my face for over an hour and get absolutely no color or redness.</li>
            <li>The main thing I saw with all the bad reviews is that they never let the it warm up.  </li>
            <li>I was too far away and didn&#x27;t use it for long enough time .I</li>
            <li>In fact, my husband once had a stubborn and painful eczema on his hands (work related) which a dermatologist had cured in just one session with his powerful UVB(?) light.</li>

            <li> per day to be sure you don&#x27;t have a deficiency?</li>
            <li> Using it for this reason, I love it.</li>
            <li> To summarize - super pleased!</li>
            <li> Pretty good value for what&lt;br /&gt;it does.  </li>
            <li> so worth my time!!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t tan easily.  </li>
            <li> I tan easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so easy to use at home.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Return was easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size and has a fairly good strength (just not as powerful as I would like though).  </li>
            <li> and I have a nice light tan which give me beautiful color aside from \\&quot;pale with acne\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have always tanned very easily, and this works very well for me!</li>
            <li> Had to return to Amazon (used Amazon&#x27;s free UPS pre-paid return</li>
            <li> The lamp is covered by two pieces of styrofoam to perfectly fit into a CalSun cardboard box.  </li>
            <li> The UV light is helpful to people with seasonal&lt;br /&gt;depression disorder, too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> I was looking for exposure to UV without damage from \\&quot;intense\\&quot; light.</li>
            <li> Vite D is important for many of our body systems to function right, from what I&#x27;ve read.    </li>
            <li> The instruction booklet is just the right size--2 pages:).  </li>
            <li> machine isn&#x27;t super duper strong so it won&#x27;t give you that desired deep&lt;br /&gt;tan</li>
            <li> i was excited to get this product and start using it.</li>
            <li> Boxed with two boxes, the tanner&#x27;s original box and another box, no space between</li>
            <li> This sun lamp is amazing especially in November when most days are gloomy.</li>
            <li> some clean, oil-free moisturizer on your face before turning it on.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re really fair-skinned or don&#x27;t tan easily, but any more&lt;br /&gt;genetically-blessed people should be fine.  </li>
            <li> you also have to sit really close to it where my nose was just about touching the bulbs to start to see a tan.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it has met all the needs and wants I bought it for.</li>
            <li> a full 20 min.</li>
            <li> and he was VERY positive and thought it a good idea for vite D and light deprivation especially.</li>
            <li> I found I preferred a little closer than 4 inches because I absolutely loved the warmth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use and&lt;br /&gt;comes</li>
            <li> First off, I do want to point out that I do tan fairly easy.</li>
            <li> this is the best product in the whole wide world!!!</li>
            <li> Mirrored foil behind light in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with this product......</li>
            <li> What I do have is nice color or my face, d√©colletage, and shoulders, upper arms.</li>
            <li> My co-workers commented on how healthy, how rested, how young I looked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling a nice tan starting.</li>
            <li> Oh and one last tip: Have the bulbs warm up for about 2 minutes before you sit in front of it.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I made a right decision.</li>
            <li> I, chose this product because the price was right</li>
            <li> (I think my skin looks more greyish now, and husband agrees), so with no base tan I&#x27;m being careful to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I think it might be good for a slight arthritic ache</li>
            <li> this lamp helped very much on getting her the UV she needed during the winter months...</li>
            <li> Thank, You very much.</li>
            <li> got no color the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> it looks like more of a sunburn, then a deep tan.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and explicit protective use instructions!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in increasing your vitamin d, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> (This is my first lamp of any type</li>
            <li> My first session with this lamp was 10 minutes, and the warmth almost put me to sleep.</li>
            <li> However it works good enough to maintain a tan till you can get back out in the sun or to the salon.</li>
            <li> The heat it emits is not too hot, but a pleasant warmth that lets you know (or at least gives you hope)</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I didn&#x27;t care about becoming tan</li>
            <li> The only positive was that the return was easy.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product a short time and my face is starting to take on a nice color already. :-)  </li>
            <li> The lamp (bulbs) do not appear to be strong enough ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough.</li>
            <li> Doesnot seem strong enough for tanning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I really like the machine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I have found that it is really beneficial to use a skin moisturizer afterwards.  </li>
            <li> ; beds don&#x27;t give much results.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This lamp does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I use a medical tanning light for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> The whole point of tanning bed&#x27;s and lamps are for fast results in my opinion.</li>
            <li> had 1 for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> VERY well packaged.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to invest much money in one yet until I tested one.</li>
            <li> And who really gets out in sunshine (with arms and legs exposed, as prescribed by experts),</li>
            <li> It made me wish I had a whole body lamp..or a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Feels like your on the beach catching a few rays.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes it leaves your skin feeling warm.</li>
            <li> I really recommend a clean, oil-free moisturizer like a simple aloe vera gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secondly, I would always use the tanning lamp once I stepped out of the shower and my face was squeaky clean and applied (non sun-screen or non-SPF) moisturizer before sitting in front of the lamp.</li>
            <li> In the summer I brown quick, but in the winter I become a very pasty white.</li>
            <li> Then I tried a the full 20 minutes and currently in the 6th session and am waiting til I finish to see if I got any color or not.</li>
            <li> Be sure to check your shipment for any loose fuses!!!  </li>
            <li> But actually the skin condition is better treated by religiously applying Eucerin hand cream every morning and every night.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for a few reasons, mostly health reasons.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think some of us get out in the real sun enough on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> And I doubt we really get enough D from foods on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> at the nearest Goodwill if you&#x27;re expecting out-of-the-box results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a month and after using it for awhile I pretty pleased with&lt;br /&gt;the subtle light-brown color of my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I used to live in Waikiki and it would take days to build up a tan.  </li>
            <li> Live and Learn I suppose</li>
            <li> I have olive skin that has always been very easy to tan, but for about 3 years now (lifestyle change) have not spent much time actually getting outside enough</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like someone is ringing a very loud bell in your ear.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews prior to placing my order in the first place.  </li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;definitely not a health risk, especially if you just follow the instructions</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about buying this after reading all the reviews, but with Amazons easy 30 day return policy I figured I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose.</li>
            <li> But with my blonde hair and dark skin, I can maintain my  bastard love child look of the 80&#x27;s David Lee Roth and Eric Estrada between sessions.&lt;br /&gt;~Joanne</li>
            <li> Medical doctor dermatologist specialists use UV lamps on patients with certain types of skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> Certainly relaxed me totally.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even have return information and address that was clear.</li>
            <li> suggestion for Amazon is to clearly mark all sides of the outer box</li>
            <li> (I think you&#x27;d get at least SOME from it) in more of a natural way than with supplements.</li>
            <li> My 16 yr old son acne cleared up in almost 3 days after 2 years of everything over the counter, as seen on tv, or prescribed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so surprised because the lamp came well packaged in 3 boxes.  </li>
            <li> One of the lights was not working straight out of the Box...sent back.</li>
            <li> The bulbs are clearly marked &amp;#34;UVA&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the 9 months of clouds we get in the Pacific N.W., getting sun-rays is only a summer thing around here.</li>
            <li> I just dropped this useless tanner off at Goodwill, good riddance.</li>
            <li> The price is right and all I need is about 15-20 min daily, an inch or so from the bulbs and my acne has improved immensely.</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes, and dark blonde or very light brown hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an orange color- or super dark brown color either.</li>
            <li> I did not see a big different for the first time</li>
            <li> but i used it for an hour the first day and the second and third</li>
            <li> If I had light skin I&#x27;d be real careful, as you would with actual sunlight.</li>
            <li> My Dr. Said a small amount of exposure to UV light helps kill bacteria in the skin.</li>
            <li> I need tan my face, but not much dark so need it for the winter, it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it also helps with the seasonal disorder if you live where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine for several days at a time.</li>
            <li> Total of three boxes.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived new, not damaged in any way and all bulbs worked.</li>
            <li> Many reviews say it&#x27;s weak.</li>
            <li> i guess i should of just spent the money to buy a real tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that a product like this can get as many good reviews - totally undeserved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooooo darn loud that I can hear the second ticker through my headphones and when the timer goes off....</li>
            <li> Heat that same tanning bed up for ten minutes and wow the results.  </li>
            <li> This is the only SUN LAMP that I could now find for sale on the Internet, although the same exact lamp is also sold under other brand names.  </li>
            <li> I have light pale skin and can put this an inch away from my face for over an hour and get absolutely no color or redness.</li>
            <li> The main thing I saw with all the bad reviews is that they never let the it warm up.  </li>
            <li> I was too far away and didn&#x27;t use it for long enough time .I</li>
            <li> In fact, my husband once had a stubborn and painful eczema on his hands (work related) which a dermatologist had cured in just one session with his powerful UVB(?) light.</li>
            <li> I am using it to boost up my energy and light exposer since we have had very little sunlight this odd winter on the East coast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to direct it to other parts such as my hands/arms/shoulders.</li>
            <li> We use it very conservatively as we are not looking to have a dark tan face and white body, but to just take away the pale look in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> the bell and ticker are a little loud on it</li>
            <li> I also found the angle of the sun lamp uncomfortable and you have to put your face too close to the light.  </li>
            <li> i was holding on to the positive reviews ive read about this product before which made me buy it, but turned out to be a pretty bad</li>
            <li> So different from the average consumer looking for artifical tanners, I bought it to help kill the bacteria in my skin because I have cystic acne.</li>
            <li> A few days later, it was gone.  </li>
            <li> I was using it for my face and after two weeks, could not tell that it even made my face pink.</li>
            <li> Would it be a total waste of money?  </li>
            <li> I had washed off all traces of makeup and applied a thin coating of Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin prior to the session.</li>
            <li> It arrived 3 days late, and I was worried owing to the frigid temperatures in the NorthEast - so I pursue and was rewarded by your exacting shipping &amp;#34;logs&amp;#34; Since Ihave had it, it has worked beautifully with my meditation CD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> one is on an elastic string and the other is on a rubber band style of lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This has also happened to other customers.  </li>
            <li> Not my usual 5-6 days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of a brown face and a white body</li>
            <li> It also helps cover up my active</li>
            <li> some heavy object inside the unit came loose during shipping.  </li>
            <li> For the price it is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price paid for it.</li>
            <li> Dishydrotic eczema is not a fun condition to have.</li>
            <li> At first I was so afraid of being too close;therefore</li>
            <li> and it got me a little tan.</li>
            <li> the radiation of the product made me a little nervous sitting so close as well.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Well, I must say, this was money wasted.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for almost a month</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> this item does not work not an ounce of color ever do not buy wasted 140.00 dollars  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as it could be, the bulbs are quite weak and the noise is very annoying from the timer.</li>
            <li> Even when you tan for the maximum 30 minutes, there is very little or no result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I like this product.</li>
            <li> not gunna lie, i&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> it takes at least 20 minutes to do it everyday</li>
            <li> It did not occur to me they could get away with selling a product that is this useless relative to its stated purpose.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T waste your money!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> actually, it&#x27;s pretty much worthless for any use.  </li>
            <li> I took the chance to try it out (even after reading all the negative reviews), knowing that I did have 30 days to return the item.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to slowly build up a tan in a controlled setting.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s one bulb that&#x27;s box read, \\&quot;not for human use,\\&quot; scary!</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> The tanning power is way too weak.</li>
            <li> the lights are too weak to provide any results at all.</li>
            <li> Just received this product and it came with broken bulbs.  </li>
            <li> This product is worthless for facial tanning......</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, my lamp arrived with a broken bulb and the reflector foil (behind the bulb) was dented from the inside out.  </li>
            <li> I tend to believe that sun blockers with chemicals are worse for me than ultraviolet rays.    </li>
            <li> only negative thing about this lamp, is the horrible timer.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I need my fix.</li>
            <li> But i think ill stick to a spray/tan salon cocktail.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, no damage in shipment...</li>
            <li> If it were any stronger it&#x27;d be dangerous.</li>
            <li> So just don&#x27;t go crazy with it, is what I&#x27;m saying.  </li>
            <li> place this product in the \\&quot;must have\\&quot; column for anyone who suffers with acne.</li>
            <li> Would the radiation be really bad for me?  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> so disappointed i will never shop amazon .com</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with the results.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this piece of crap!!!!!</li>
            <li> i used to be so uglY!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No good. doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> We have used this item for a couple years and have been very happy with it.  We use it very conservatively as we are not looking to have a dark tan face and white body, but to just take away the pale look in the winter months.  I think it also helps with the seasonal disorder if you live where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine for several days at a time.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and I don&#x27;t tan easily.  I used to live in Waikiki and it would take days to build up a tan.  A few days later, it was gone.  I think it a genetics thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I really like the machine.  It&#x27;s just the right size and has a fairly good strength (just not as powerful as I would like though).  The instruction booklet is just the right size--2 pages:).  Also, it comes with 2 different pairs of UV proof goggles--one is on an elastic string and the other is on a rubber band style of lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is perfect for people who tan very easily.  Also, I read that some UV light is great for people who suffer from depression during winter.  If you are fair skin like me, I use a tan accelerator (available @ Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I have found that it is really beneficial to use a skin moisturizer afterwards.  I really recommend a clean, oil-free moisturizer like a simple aloe vera gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy &amp; Safe Tanning!</li>
            <li> It arrived with a bulb not working.  There are only 4 bulbs do one not working makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for last 3 weeks or so. At first I was so afraid of being too close;therefore I was too far away and didn&#x27;t use it for long enough time .I got no color the first 2 weeks. Then I tried a the full 20 minutes and currently in the 6th session and am waiting til I finish to see if I got any color or not.</li>
            <li> Terrible....loud and doesn&#x27;t tan you at all</li>
            <li> This product sucked!!!! It did not do anything. I tan easily and this product has to be the biggest joke!! It didn&#x27;t even have return information and address that was clear. Do not buy this piece of crap!!!!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this.  I researched for hours on different face tanning appliances. The main thing I saw with all the bad reviews is that they never let the it warm up.  If you have ever gone to a commercial tanning place before, you know &amp;#34; cold&amp;#34; beds don&#x27;t give much results. Heat that same tanning bed up for ten minutes and wow the results.  I recommend this for only those who know how to use a tanning machine.  My 16 yr old son acne cleared up in almost 3 days after 2 years of everything over the counter, as seen on tv, or prescribed.  I feel good again in winter..... Let it heat up for ten minutes, then use as you want.</li>
            <li> Works as designed, no issues</li>
            <li> I have used CalSun face tanner for 1 month and I have to say I made a right decision. It&#x27;s just so easy to use at home.  I did not see a big different for the first time but after I tried it for 3 times and I did see the improvement.  Right now, I have a great tan on my face and I feel more confident. .. A great product...Thanks</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the fact that I have very fair skin... The tanning power is way too weak. Even when you tan for the maximum 30 minutes, there is very little or no result. I even used tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Just received this product and it came with broken bulbs.  I&#x27;m returning and will not be reordering.  I should have read the reviews prior to placing my order in the first place.  Live and Learn I suppose</li>
            <li> Bought this for help with acne. Very unhappy with the results.</li>
            <li> i was excited to get this product and start using it. it works but i used it for an hour the first day and the second and third and it got me a little tan. it looks like more of a sunburn, then a deep tan. i wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.  you need alot of patience. if you use it as directed (30 minutes a day) it will take forever for your tan to show up. you also have to sit really close to it where my nose was just about touching the bulbs to start to see a tan. the radiation of the product made me a little nervous sitting so close as well. you can smell/feel the radiation which i didn&#x27;t think was too safe. not gunna lie, i&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this product. i guess i should of just spent the money to buy a real tanning bed. i was holding on to the positive reviews ive read about this product before which made me buy it, but turned out to be a pretty bad product.(probably why its not that popular) happy shopping.</li>
            <li> Well, I must say, this was money wasted.  From now on, I will pay more attention to the reviews.  This product is worthless for facial tanning......actually, it&#x27;s pretty much worthless for any use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I just dropped this useless tanner off at Goodwill, good riddance. After&lt;br /&gt;a month of moving closer and closer to the bulbs and wasting more and more time&lt;br /&gt;trying to get an ounce of \\&quot;glow,\\&quot; I realized nothing was happening, and nothing&lt;br /&gt;would be happening. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have only had this product a short time and my face is starting to take on a nice color already. :-)  So far I&#x27;m pleased with this product......</li>
            <li> Very convenient and explicit protective use instructions!  Be sure to check your shipment for any loose fuses!!!  Enjoy!  Enjoy!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> the bell and ticker are a little loud on it but it does a great job on my acne and get a nice face colortoo</li>
            <li> This product did not tan me.  Neat looking, compact.  Easy to use but doesn&#x27;t tanI returned it. Return was easy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what skin types the people who wrote the favorable reviews have, but I have blue eyes, blonde hair and I get red after five minutes outdoors. I was hoping to slowly build up a tan in a controlled setting. This lamp does absolutely nothing. I sat inches away for up to 45 minutes before I gave up. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about buying this after reading all the reviews, but with Amazons easy 30 day return policy I figured I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose. I&#x27;m SOOO glad I ordered this!! I have blue eyes, and dark blonde or very light brown hair. I have always tanned very easily, and this works very well for me! I don&#x27;t have an orange color- or super dark brown color either. What I do have is nice color or my face, d√©colletage, and shoulders, upper arms. I am very, very, happy with this product!:-)  I use a medical tanning light for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I need tan my face, but not much dark so need it for the winter, it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;A V</li>
            <li> I had to have some surgery &amp; was out of work for several months.  Once recovered, I went on vacation before returning to work.  My co-workers commented on how healthy, how rested, how young I looked.  I purchased CalSun to keep up that &amp;#34;just vacationed&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> My wife had a skin condition that required UV to heal... this lamp helped very much on getting her the UV she needed during the winter months... Thank you seller, and Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have had the tanner for a week now and love it. I moved from sunny Arizona to not so sunny Kansas. Needless to say I need my fix. This fits the bill perfectly!!</li>
            <li> This is a good concept, but needs to be stronger. I have light pale skin and can put this an inch away from my face for over an hour and get absolutely no color or redness. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for almost a month and I&#x27;m really disappointed. If they used salon quality lights with more power in this thing it could actually be a good product, shame.</li>
            <li> I sat in front of the lamp for 5 days in a row, 4 inches away as instructed, for 30 minutes at a time. Not one tan line, no darker than when I started. Save yourself the time and don&#x27;t purchase. The only positive was that the return was easy.</li>
            <li> I was using it for my face and after two weeks, could not tell that it even made my face pink. I also found the angle of the sun lamp uncomfortable and you have to put your face too close to the light.  For the price it is not worth it.  Would not recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I love it !! I use it almost everyday. It does what it&#x27;s say! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> anyone know who makes this? I have one, tipped over on carpet. now none of the 4 lights go on. Barley fell over</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it a month and one of the bulbs has already burned out.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it has met all the needs and wants I bought it for. It is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I love a tan! But i think ill stick to a spray/tan salon cocktail. But with my blonde hair and dark skin, I can maintain my  bastard love child look of the 80&#x27;s David Lee Roth and Eric Estrada between sessions.&lt;br /&gt;~Joanne O</li>
            <li> OMGGG!!!! I can&#x27;t believe that I have gone 19 years without using this!!!! I love it!!!!!!!! It has made me so much more confident!!! I never knew what a tan could do to you but it makes me look absolutley gorgeous!!!! like, ive never looked soo good that i look like megan fox!!! i used to be so uglY!!! this is the best product in the whole wide world!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! it takes at least 20 minutes to do it everyday but i dont care!!! so worth my time!! and soo cheap!!!</li>
            <li> The lamp (bulbs) do not appear to be strong enough ...after 2 weeks of regular usage (going by instructions given) I see no visable signs of tanning at all.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This sun lamp is amazing especially in November when most days are gloomy. Feels like your on the beach catching a few rays. Recommend this lamp for anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I am using it to boost up my energy and light exposer since we have had very little sunlight this odd winter on the East coast.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the only SUN LAMP that I could now find for sale on the Internet, although the same exact lamp is also sold under other brand names.  Medical doctor dermatologist specialists use UV lamps on patients with certain types of skin conditions.  So, it should be OK to use in moderation or don&#x27;t overuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my lamp arrived with a broken bulb and the reflector foil (behind the bulb) was dented from the inside out.  Seems like some heavy object inside the unit came loose during shipping.  Had to return to Amazon (used Amazon&#x27;s free UPS pre-paid return label).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised because the lamp came well packaged in 3 boxes.  The lamp is covered by two pieces of styrofoam to perfectly fit into a CalSun cardboard box.  Then, that box in placed in another white-colored corrugated box.  Then, that box is placed into an Amazon brown-colored shipping corrugated box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion for Amazon is to clearly mark all sides of the outer box \\&quot;HANDLE WITH CARE - FRAGILE\\&quot;, as there was no such markings.  Sometimes, shipping personnel drop or throw shipping cartons off planes and trucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  This has also happened to other customers.

            <li> Takes forever to see any results. Sat there for 30 min. and barley looked like I sat in the sun for 30 min. I might as well of sat out on my porch. The whole point of tanning bed&#x27;s and lamps are for fast results in my opinion. I guess it could be used for winter time, and for people who lack Vit. D in the winter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a skin condition. It works ok. But actually the skin condition is better treated by religiously applying Eucerin hand cream every morning and every night. Save this money and instead buy Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I, chose this product because the price was right and i just happened to look on-line for facial tanners and saw that amazon .com had 1 for a reasonable price it is awesome i love it, and it gives me a great tan! Thank, You very much.Brenda</li>
            <li> One of the lights was not working straight out of the Box...sent back.</li>
            <li> The bulbs are clearly marked &amp;#34;UVA&amp;#34;. While uva will tan you it does not produce vitamin D. If you&#x27;re interested in increasing your vitamin d, look elsewhere. The lamp does however make you feel like you&#x27;ve been at the beach. I&#x27;m feeling a nice tan starting. Many reviews say it&#x27;s weak. If it were any stronger it&#x27;d be dangerous. After a few minutes it leaves your skin feeling warm. It&#x27;s strong enough. If you use it diligently every day you will develop a tan.</li>
            <li> I had some reservations before buying this, both in terms of its safety and&lt;br /&gt;effectiveness.  Would the radiation be really bad for me?  Would it turn me&lt;br /&gt;into some horror show Oompa Loompa?  Would it just make me look like I got a&lt;br /&gt;bad sunburn?  Would it be a total waste of money?  First off, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;definitely not a health risk, especially if you just follow the instructions&lt;br /&gt;correctly (Which is only two pages, anyway, so c&#x27;mon.) and only do it for 30&lt;br /&gt;minutes a day.  So just don&#x27;t go crazy with it, is what I&#x27;m saying.  Second,&lt;br /&gt;This machine isn&#x27;t super duper strong so it won&#x27;t give you that desired deep&lt;br /&gt;tan if you&#x27;re really fair-skinned or don&#x27;t tan easily, but any more&lt;br /&gt;genetically-blessed people should be fine.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to use and&lt;br /&gt;comes with 2 different pairs of UV-proof goggles.  Good for fall and winter&lt;br /&gt;use during gloomier months.  The UV light is helpful to people with seasonal&lt;br /&gt;depression disorder, too.  I should note that it took about a week (6 or 7&lt;br /&gt;sessions) before I started seeing any kind of improvement, so don&#x27;t dump it&lt;br /&gt;off at the nearest Goodwill if you&#x27;re expecting out-of-the-box results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a month and after using it for awhile I pretty pleased with&lt;br /&gt;the subtle light-brown color of my complexion.  Pretty good value for what&lt;br /&gt;it does.  I would recommend it, overall.  However, I would also suggest&lt;br /&gt;using some clean, oil-free moisturizer on your face before turning it on.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews more closely.  It did not occur to me they could get away with selling a product that is this useless relative to its stated purpose. Finally did 1 hour 4 inches away and was not even slightly red.  Do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T waste your money!</li>
            <li> Doesnot seem strong enough for tanning.  Can only use for face.  Not worth the price paid for it. :/ p</li>
            <li> the lights are too weak to provide any results at all. you could spend days in front of this thing and not get any color. It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> this item does not work not an ounce of color ever do not buy wasted 140.00 dollars  im so disappointed i will never shop amazon .com again</li>
            <li> It arrived 3 days late, and I was worried owing to the frigid temperatures in the NorthEast - so I pursue and was rewarded by your exacting shipping &amp;#34;logs&amp;#34; Since Ihave had it, it has worked beautifully with my meditation CD&#x27;s. To summarize - super pleased!</li>
            <li> However it works good enough to maintain a tan till you can get back out in the sun or to the salon.</li>
            <li> I just got my sun lamp and have used it once. It works perfectly, no damage in shipment...VERY well packaged. I didn&#x27;t recall reading anything in the reviews about the heat it may or may not emit. I was happily surprised to find it let out a wonderful warmth. It felt just like a perfect sun tanning day would feel (IMHO). (This is my first lamp of any type and I didn&#x27;t want to invest much money in one yet until I tested one. This is perfect for a first trial-lamp.)  The heat it emits is not too hot, but a pleasant warmth that lets you know (or at least gives you hope) it is doing something beneficial. I purchased it for a few reasons, mostly health reasons. I have been fighting some sort of stubborn eczema type rash in and around my ear for 3 months, and I read alot about UVB rays healing some types of rashes. In fact, my husband once had a stubborn and painful eczema on his hands (work related) which a dermatologist had cured in just one session with his powerful UVB(?) light. Also, I got the lamp for getting vitamin D (I think you&#x27;d get at least SOME from it) in more of a natural way than with supplements. I don&#x27;t think some of us get out in the real sun enough on a consistent basis. And I doubt we really get enough D from foods on a consistent basis. And who really gets out in sunshine (with arms and legs exposed, as prescribed by experts), a full 20 min. per day to be sure you don&#x27;t have a deficiency? Vite D is important for many of our body systems to function right, from what I&#x27;ve read.    I have olive skin that has always been very easy to tan, but for about 3 years now (lifestyle change) have not spent much time actually getting outside enough (I think my skin looks more greyish now, and husband agrees), so with no base tan I&#x27;m being careful to follow the instructions. My first session with this lamp was 10 minutes, and the warmth almost put me to sleep. Certainly relaxed me totally. It made me wish I had a whole body lamp..or a tanning bed. It may have beenreleasing endorphins or something? as it felt soooo good! I had washed off all traces of makeup and applied a thin coating of Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin prior to the session. I have had allergic reactions to aloe vera and any sun blockers and would never use them again. I tend to believe that sun blockers with chemicals are worse for me than ultraviolet rays.    I found I preferred a little closer than 4 inches because I absolutely loved the warmth! And the closer you are, the warmer it is. If I had light skin I&#x27;d be real careful, as you would with actual sunlight. I have great hope of getting some healthy color again.  When I saw my doctor about my ear issue/rash/infection, I asked him about the lamp idea.......and he was VERY positive and thought it a good idea for vite D and light deprivation especially. When I&#x27;m not using it for my face I plan to direct it to other parts such as my hands/arms/shoulders. I think it might be good for a slight arthritic ache I get now and then in my fingers.</li>
            <li> Dishydrotic eczema is not a fun condition to have. It&#x27;s on my hands, and when I can get sun on them it goes away, but when there&#x27;s no sun it comes back. I use this once a week on hands ( along with ointment) to keep it at bay.</li>
            <li> Could be a bit underpowered</li>
            <li> For me, this lamp had no effect. I could sit there for hours daily and it still didn&#x27;t give any effect. An absolute waste of money and time. Go buy yourself a good tanning cream instead, it saves you a lot of money and time. I&#x27;m shocked that a product like this can get as many good reviews - totally undeserved. I ended up throwing it away...</li>
            <li> Received in excellent condition. Boxed with two boxes, the tanner&#x27;s original box and another box, no space between but I guess it didn&#x27;t matter. Then the Amazon shipping box. Total of three boxes.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived new, not damaged in any way and all bulbs worked. Mirrored foil behind light in perfect condition. Another thing I read in the manual not mentioned is the bulbs have 300hrs life, equivlant to two years they say. Bulbs cost about $15 each to replace I saw.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant buying this item because of the one star comments, but I guess it depends what you buy this product to \\&quot;do\\&quot; for you. I was looking for exposure to UV without damage from \\&quot;intense\\&quot; light. There&#x27;s one bulb that&#x27;s box read, \\&quot;not for human use,\\&quot; scary! So different from the average consumer looking for artifical tanners, I bought it to help kill the bacteria in my skin because I have cystic acne. My Dr. Said a small amount of exposure to UV light helps kill bacteria in the skin. Using it for this reason, I love it. Oddly enough, I didn&#x27;t care about becoming tan and I have a nice light tan which give me beautiful color aside from \\&quot;pale with acne\\&quot;. It also helps cover up my active if I any. Oh, and when I get a pimple now, the tanner zaps it and its gone in about 1-2 days depending on size. Not my usual 5-6 days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of a brown face and a white body so I never looked at this product to do that. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, there&#x27;s an excellent product for about $550. You can also buy that through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I place this product in the \\&quot;must have\\&quot; column for anyone who suffers with acne. The price is right and all I need is about 15-20 min daily, an inch or so from the bulbs and my acne has improved immensely.</li>
            <li> This was the only facial tanning lamp on Amazon that was affordable. I took the chance to try it out (even after reading all the negative reviews), knowing that I did have 30 days to return the item. I figured if it didn&#x27;t work, then I would return it. I have had this item about 3 weeks now and have enjoyed great results. First off, I do want to point out that I do tan fairly easy. In the summer I brown quick, but in the winter I become a very pasty white. Thanks to the 9 months of clouds we get in the Pacific N.W., getting sun-rays is only a summer thing around here. Secondly, I would always use the tanning lamp once I stepped out of the shower and my face was squeaky clean and applied (non sun-screen or non-SPF) moisturizer before sitting in front of the lamp. Finally, I would sit about an inch away from the bulbs, instead of the recommended 3 or 4 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing about this lamp, is the horrible timer. It&#x27;s sooooo darn loud that I can hear the second ticker through my headphones and when the timer goes off....it&#x27;s like someone is ringing a very loud bell in your ear. The bell always makes me jump. Oh and one last tip: Have the bulbs warm up for about 2 minutes before you sit in front of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as it could be, the bulbs are quite weak and the noise is very annoying from the timer. With that said, it does give you some color and good for psoriasis on face. It is a decent product, not salon quality but very good for the price</li>
