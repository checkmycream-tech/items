            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>But it does produce a healthy silky shine and not greasy.</li>
            <li>amazing.i love this oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is better than the brand I had been using...</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>It is a bit thicker but does absorb into the skin and did do a better job for me on my hands an cuticles.</li>
            <li>After using this for several days I&#x27;m very happy and at this price I don&#x27;t have to limit use to my face.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>;) feels nice, barely any scent which is very good.</li>
            <li>am extremely pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing, and plan to continue to use this Kandala argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to their fabulous bottle size and pricing</li>
            <li>There is no scent, goes on easy and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to get out what you want without wasting any.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely fine, vanishes and does not leave my skin oily.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil is fantastic for the skin, hair and nails</li>
            <li>I am turned off when reading reviews where 95% of them are written by those having received the item free for review.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using many lotions, makeup removers, hair products, acne meds and more because I have replaced them all with Argan Oil, which is another reason I love this big bottle (because I use it day and night all over).</li>
            <li>Absorbed easily; does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It is also great for healing scratches or dry brittle nails..</li>
            <li>She told me that it is good for all types of hair, but recommended it especially for me because of all of the chemical hair treatments I get.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried it as a skin moisturizer, but based on how good it made my hair look and feel, I&#x27;d definitely recommend argan oil to others.</li>
            <li>period!&lt;br /&gt;I had been using another brand before switching to this, and have also used the Josie Maran brand.&lt;br /&gt;Josie&#x27;s is true argan oil</li>
            <li>It is what you should be seeing, smelling &amp; feeling from a true argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good for so many personal things; It arrived on time and is mainly for my hair and my finger nails.</li>
            <li>This argan oil help me tremendously with the problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to get the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;....not watered down and just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil made my hair look shiny and healthy, and it also feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair absorbs oil fast so this amount is fine for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no argan oil expert and read extensively to learn the characteristics of a good argan oil hoping I could find a good one for less money, which led me to Kandala.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every day and apply fresh argan oil.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommended this product if you want genuinely want moisturized hair and skin, and</li>
            <li>Apparently all her clients love this stuff by Kandala.</li>
            <li>It went on light and made my skin and hair feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>i like this oil very much.</li>
            <li>Now I did the same amount after I had gotten my super damaged ends cut, so it ended up being too much for my healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night, particularly the ends, and wake up with super conditioned hair.</li>
            <li>This brand actually seems to do more for my hair than any others I used prior.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I saw the results the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin and hair smooth, soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face, neck, chest, arms &amp; hands every morning and it absorbs quickly, my skin feels soft &amp; supple, and makeup glides right on, and stays put.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about this oil is that it smoothed down those little fly away hairs at the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard that it is good for wrinkles; but I may have waited a few years too long for it to get rid of all of my wrinkles.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft !</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised to see that the bottle wasn&#x27;t full, but then I looked through my inbox and saw an email from the seller which explained that it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>I like the opening that restricts the flow to a single drop better than a dropper, which has led me to tip over the bottle and spill.</li>
            <li>Item arrived as describe with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue purchasing Kandala Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Argan oil really does wonders for hair.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it left my hands soft (that wouldn&#x27;t be very manly), but it definitely alleviated the dryness and irritation from the Lava soap.  </li>
            <li>The company sends out helpful emails and  they are very concerned with their customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>but it seems she can never find one she really likes.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>Since I use so much</li>
            <li>The supplier is very concerned with customer satisfaction, which adds to the value.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is much thicker so</li>
            <li>am having to use up to four drops for her hair, her hair is also much longer then mine as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling oily and it seems to soak into the skin very well.  </li>
            <li>my skin feels so much softer and my split ends are practically gone.</li>
            <li>Years of hair coloring, straightening, and highlights have left my hair kind of dry.  </li>
            <li>I like the little nozzle at the top of the bottle because it keeps too much oil from coming out of the bottle</li>
            <li>To compare with the Josie Maran brand, this has a nutty scent compared to the Josie brand that didn&#x27;t have any scent, which leads me to believe this is less refined, which is supposed to be better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Kandala Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Well she had the last laugh because even I could tell a noticeable difference in her hair after she started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this quite long enough to determine if it is going to solve all my skin problems, but I can say that I love the way it feels on my face.  </li>
            <li>Which is nice, but even though I use it on my skin and hair almost everyday, I&#x27;m only on my third bottle, about to start my fourth, and it&#x27;s almost November, and I bought my first bottle in January.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, she promotes the use of natural products, like argan oil.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the oil to be a bid thicker, but it keeps my face and neck soft as I use it along with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so there is no waste (please don&#x27;t change this ever).</li>
            <li>My hair was completely ruined in a salon.</li>
            <li>Thanks to friend, who mentioned this product, I&#x27;ll be back when I run out.  </li>
            <li>This oil makes my hands and my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>So far so food, works as described</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t have over processed hair, you definitely don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
            <li>It makes our hair so soft.</li>
            <li>, however they refined it to remove the natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Two drops is all I need for my face and it feels soft, moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that sad - all of these years without a good solution and embassarred by hair.  </li>
            <li>like the fact the top has a small hole that allows only a drop or two at a time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can definitely tell that this company has high standards.</li>
            <li>It doesnt take much and will last quite awhile, but I like knowing I have enough for my whole body daily.</li>
            <li>I put it on when my hair is still pretty wet and apply a liberal amount.</li>
            <li>This small bottle will last us for many months since only drops are needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems like a minor thing but the bottle has a &amp;quot;reducer&amp;quot; so it&#x27;s easy to get out just a few drops at a time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more bouncier than usual when I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use anywhere near as much of it as I did the other product.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and finally people compliment my hair.  </li>
            <li>brand is 100% argan oil, is nicely viscous, and has that faint and distinctive grassy smell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Packaged perfectly in a dark glass bottle with a small dropper hole in the top</li>
            <li>I bought it based on reviews, and after getting past the slight smell that it has, we&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, 3.4 oz is not a standard size for bottles.  </li>
            <li>I first heard of argan oil from my hairdresser a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>It has completely changed my damaged hair and dry skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Easy to get out what you want without wasting any.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely fine, vanishes and does not leave my skin oily.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is fantastic for the skin, hair and nails</li>
            <li> I am turned off when reading reviews where 95% of them are written by those having received the item free for review.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using many lotions, makeup removers, hair products, acne meds and more because I have replaced them all with Argan Oil, which is another reason I love this big bottle (because I use it day and night all over).</li>
            <li> Absorbed easily; does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It is also great for healing scratches or dry brittle nails..</li>
            <li> She told me that it is good for all types of hair, but recommended it especially for me because of all of the chemical hair treatments I get.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried it as a skin moisturizer, but based on how good it made my hair look and feel, I&#x27;d definitely recommend argan oil to others.</li>
            <li> period!&lt;br /&gt;I had been using another brand before switching to this, and have also used the Josie Maran brand.&lt;br /&gt;Josie&#x27;s is true argan oil</li>
            <li> It is what you should be seeing, smelling &amp; feeling from a true argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good for so many personal things; It arrived on time and is mainly for my hair and my finger nails.</li>
            <li> This argan oil help me tremendously with the problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to get the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;....not watered down and just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil made my hair look shiny and healthy, and it also feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair absorbs oil fast so this amount is fine for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no argan oil expert and read extensively to learn the characteristics of a good argan oil hoping I could find a good one for less money, which led me to Kandala.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day and apply fresh argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommended this product if you want genuinely want moisturized hair and skin, and</li>
            <li> Apparently all her clients love this stuff by Kandala.</li>
            <li> It went on light and made my skin and hair feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> i like this oil very much.</li>
            <li> Now I did the same amount after I had gotten my super damaged ends cut, so it ended up being too much for my healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night, particularly the ends, and wake up with super conditioned hair.</li>
            <li> This brand actually seems to do more for my hair than any others I used prior.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I saw the results the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin and hair smooth, soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my face, neck, chest, arms &amp; hands every morning and it absorbs quickly, my skin feels soft &amp; supple, and makeup glides right on, and stays put.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about this oil is that it smoothed down those little fly away hairs at the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard that it is good for wrinkles; but I may have waited a few years too long for it to get rid of all of my wrinkles.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft !</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised to see that the bottle wasn&#x27;t full, but then I looked through my inbox and saw an email from the seller which explained that it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> I like the opening that restricts the flow to a single drop better than a dropper, which has led me to tip over the bottle and spill.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as describe with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue purchasing Kandala Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Argan oil really does wonders for hair.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it left my hands soft (that wouldn&#x27;t be very manly), but it definitely alleviated the dryness and irritation from the Lava soap.  </li>
            <li> The company sends out helpful emails and  they are very concerned with their customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> but it seems she can never find one she really likes.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> Since I use so much</li>
            <li> The supplier is very concerned with customer satisfaction, which adds to the value.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is much thicker so</li>
            <li> am having to use up to four drops for her hair, her hair is also much longer then mine as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling oily and it seems to soak into the skin very well.  </li>
            <li> my skin feels so much softer and my split ends are practically gone.</li>
            <li> Years of hair coloring, straightening, and highlights have left my hair kind of dry.  </li>
            <li> I like the little nozzle at the top of the bottle because it keeps too much oil from coming out of the bottle</li>
            <li> To compare with the Josie Maran brand, this has a nutty scent compared to the Josie brand that didn&#x27;t have any scent, which leads me to believe this is less refined, which is supposed to be better.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Kandala Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Well she had the last laugh because even I could tell a noticeable difference in her hair after she started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this quite long enough to determine if it is going to solve all my skin problems, but I can say that I love the way it feels on my face.  </li>
            <li> Which is nice, but even though I use it on my skin and hair almost everyday, I&#x27;m only on my third bottle, about to start my fourth, and it&#x27;s almost November, and I bought my first bottle in January.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, she promotes the use of natural products, like argan oil.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the oil to be a bid thicker, but it keeps my face and neck soft as I use it along with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so there is no waste (please don&#x27;t change this ever).</li>
            <li> My hair was completely ruined in a salon.</li>
            <li> Thanks to friend, who mentioned this product, I&#x27;ll be back when I run out.  </li>
            <li> This oil makes my hands and my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> So far so food, works as described</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t have over processed hair, you definitely don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
            <li> It makes our hair so soft.</li>
            <li> , however they refined it to remove the natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Two drops is all I need for my face and it feels soft, moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that sad - all of these years without a good solution and embassarred by hair.  </li>
            <li> like the fact the top has a small hole that allows only a drop or two at a time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can definitely tell that this company has high standards.</li>
            <li> It doesnt take much and will last quite awhile, but I like knowing I have enough for my whole body daily.</li>
            <li> I put it on when my hair is still pretty wet and apply a liberal amount.</li>
            <li> This small bottle will last us for many months since only drops are needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems like a minor thing but the bottle has a &amp;quot;reducer&amp;quot; so it&#x27;s easy to get out just a few drops at a time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more bouncier than usual when I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use anywhere near as much of it as I did the other product.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and finally people compliment my hair.  </li>
            <li> brand is 100% argan oil, is nicely viscous, and has that faint and distinctive grassy smell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Packaged perfectly in a dark glass bottle with a small dropper hole in the top</li>
            <li> I bought it based on reviews, and after getting past the slight smell that it has, we&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, 3.4 oz is not a standard size for bottles.  </li>
            <li> I first heard of argan oil from my hairdresser a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> It has completely changed my damaged hair and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I actually had to have my long hair cut to a short bob after the incident, but starting all over again, and using this has saved me.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit, so it will go a long ways!</li>
            <li> I am glad to see that it is cold pressed (no harsh solvents), organic and that it came in a dark glass</li>
            <li> Used directly on face, and scalp and a few drops into all my hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> my hands are still dry as well as legs and arms.</li>
            <li> My hands are so dry after even just one shift.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife who has been complaining about dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry patchy skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I keep it in our bedroom closet out of sunlight and artificial light.</li>
            <li> And only a few drops take care of my face and hair.  </li>
            <li> Simply put a few drops of oil into your palms and rub into your hair.  </li>
            <li> and I was a bit skeptical after she first bought it.</li>
            <li> I also use a little on my wet hair before blow drying..</li>
            <li> Tried the argan oil on the driest, itchiest part of my leg last night that has been bugging me so much lately.  </li>
            <li> Just drop a little weekly with the wet hair and dry it as usual</li>
            <li> There is no pump or dropper to fool with, and oil doesn&#x27;t drip down the side of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> No more dry patches at all.</li>
            <li> The condition of my hair is now balanced and no more dry ends.</li>
            <li> I am already noticing a slight difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Been dry and flakey lately.</li>
            <li> want a cold pressed virgin oil, that is 100% pure &amp; unrefined.</li>
            <li> I have to pour it on as opposed to a few drops of Josies...</li>
            <li> , so you don&#x27;t waste any.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to walk around with greasy hands, so I just applied a few drops of the argan oil before bedtime and rubbed it in.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few brands of argan oil, but was concerned about their sourcing and the extraction method.  </li>
            <li> My hands sometimes get dry from cleansers and cleaning products, especially when I work on the car or motorcycle and have to scrub off dirty grease.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Josie Maran for several years and wanted a less expensive option.</li>
            <li> Pretty face and bad hair every day.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil in the past and decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my curly, hard to manage hair</li>
            <li> it absorbs readily and that it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens&lt;br /&gt;and sulfates, and other nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> themselves, how they get away with dangerous chemicals in oils, creams, and shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the results of this oil. I bought it based on reviews, and after getting past the slight smell that it has, we&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.  My husband and I both no longer use face lotions and exclusively just use oils. Kandala Argan is on the list as one of our favorites!</li>
            <li> There is no scent, goes on easy and not greasy.  Love how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as describe with fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use this product for deep treatment and conditioning of my hair. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my nails.  It works better than any fancy &amp;quot;cuticle oil&amp;quot; I have used, plus it&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s basically odorless.  (As a guy, I don&#x27;t want to use scented cosmetic items, so this is a BIG plus.)  I tried it on my hair but I&#x27;m going back to my regular conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a minor thing but the bottle has a &amp;quot;reducer&amp;quot; so it&#x27;s easy to get out just a few drops at a time.  Easy to get out what you want without wasting any.</li>
            <li> You need to try this love it.</li>
            <li> While in Morocco I actually saw goats climbing argan trees to get at the nuts. This always fascinated me. They use it for cooking there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw this product for sale as a skin/hair treatment, I asked my daughter (cosmetoligist) about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She very excitedly explained at great length about the beauty product industry, how the government requires them to &amp;#34;self-regulate&amp;#34; themselves, how they get away with dangerous chemicals in oils, creams, and shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, she promotes the use of natural products, like argan oil. So I bought her some. Apparently all her clients love this stuff by Kandala.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil in the past and decided to try this product. I am so disappointed. I have to pour it on as opposed to a few drops of Josies...it doesn&#x27;t eve feel like it is doing anything. my hands are still dry as well as legs and arms.What a waste of my hard earned money. You probably won&#x27;t print this...I cannot even return as I threw out the packaging.</li>
            <li> i like this oil very much. i mixed it with oreganol oil and use it as a hand moisturizer. it works better for me than any hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I liked the product.  I was expecting the oil to be a bid thicker, but it keeps my face and neck soft as I use it along with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice product...not oily. I like that it absorbs readily and that it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens&lt;br /&gt;and sulfates, and other nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  definitely buy it again and recommend it. I also bought a bottle for my daughter and she likes it too. We are now fans of Argan Oil. Thank you.</li>
            <li> As a nurse, I wash my hands a thousand times a day. My hands are so dry after even just one shift.  This oil repairs and just feels good!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This oil is beyond my highest expectations.  And only a few drops take care of my face and hair.  I do keep it in the frig. Plan to buy more when I ran out.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Packaged perfectly in a dark glass bottle with a small dropper hole in the top so there is no waste (please don&#x27;t change this ever). This company is amazing...very concerned for their buyers. They have great communication...making sure the buyer is happy with their product as well as sharing tons of information on use of product. I will absolutely continue purchasing Kandala Argan Oil. I use it all over...I have stopped using many lotions, makeup removers, hair products, acne meds and more because I have replaced them all with Argan Oil, which is another reason I love this big bottle (because I use it day and night all over). The price is very fair too. It truly is my favorite product. Feels amazing! Thank you Kandala...keep up the great work...and Customer Service...A+++</li>
            <li> My hair was completely ruined in a salon. Burnt .  This argan oil help me tremendously with the problem. I was devastated, because my hair is very important to me, as I&#x27;m sure your hair is to you if you are reading this, but this product truly helped me. I actually had to have my long hair cut to a short bob after the incident, but starting all over again, and using this has saved me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to get the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;....not watered down and just what I was looking for.  Thanks to friend, who mentioned this product, I&#x27;ll be back when I run out.  Absorbs into your skin.  Purchased a different brand prior to using this product and there is no comparison.  You pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this oil about a month ago and I was a bit skeptical after she first bought it. Well she had the last laugh because even I could tell a noticeable difference in her hair after she started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can definitely tell that this company has high standards. I am glad to see that it is cold pressed (no harsh solvents), organic and that it came in a dark glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for helping my wife look more beautiful!</li>
            <li> I first heard of argan oil from my hairdresser a few months ago.  She told me that it is good for all types of hair, but recommended it especially for me because of all of the chemical hair treatments I get.  Years of hair coloring, straightening, and highlights have left my hair kind of dry.  Now I&#x27;m happy to have my own bottle at home to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil really does wonders for hair.  Simply put a few drops of oil into your palms and rub into your hair.  A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last a long time.

            <li> Absorbed easily; does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my curly, hard to manage hair and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  I have used another well known product to control frizz and was happy with it but it wasn&#x27;t organic. This priduct is everything I hoped for and I don&#x27;t have to use anywhere near as much of it as I did the other product.</li>
            <li> It is good for so many personal things; It arrived on time and is mainly for my hair and my finger nails. TJ</li>
            <li> Argan oil is fantastic for the skin, hair and nails and I use it every day.  Great smell and fantastic results.</li>
            <li> My wife recently discovered argan oil, which she&#x27;s been using on her hair and skin as a moisturizer.  My hands sometimes get dry from cleansers and cleaning products, especially when I work on the car or motorcycle and have to scrub off dirty grease.  I decided to try some argan oil so I bought this bottle for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see that the bottle wasn&#x27;t full, but then I looked through my inbox and saw an email from the seller which explained that it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.  Apparently, 3.4 oz is not a standard size for bottles.  Anyway, I like that the bottle is glass so I don&#x27;t have to worry if the contents are contaminated by BPA&#x27;s from plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to walk around with greasy hands, so I just applied a few drops of the argan oil before bedtime and rubbed it in.  I won&#x27;t say it left my hands soft (that wouldn&#x27;t be very manly), but it definitely alleviated the dryness and irritation from the Lava soap.  Based on that experience, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product as a skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hands and my hair so soft. I have started using it on my nails and hands and what a difference, my hands are looking younger and it is strengthening my nails. I highly recommend this Kandala Argan Oil. The company sends out helpful emails and  they are very concerned with their customer satisfaction. Great company and a superb product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife who has been complaining about dry skin. I see her go out and buy different skin lotions but it seems she can never find one she really likes. I read good things about argan oil being an excellent skin moisturizer, so I decided to surprise her with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She immediately liked this oil. She said it absorbs very quickly and feels great on her skin. She uses it for her hands and neck primarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife started reading more about argan oil and found out about its hair care application. She is going to try that next.</li>
            <li> Great oil. nice price. Some brands are so much more expensive. This one works just the same as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast. Love it. Makes my skin super soft !</li>
            <li> A very good way to treat my scalp. The itchiness  and dandruff is gone!  I also rub it on my body after shower and can feel smoothness in my skin after 3 uses only..amazing!</li>
            <li> So far so food, works as described</li>
            <li> Tried the argan oil on the driest, itchiest part of my leg last night that has been bugging me so much lately.  It really felt great. I know my skin, hair and nails will benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizer for my skin.  Feels silky, not greasy when applied. I love it</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. Been dry and flakey lately. So far so good. ;) feels nice, barely any scent which is very good. Used directly on face, and scalp and a few drops into all my hair and skin products. Soothing. :)</li>
            <li> I have Italian freezy hair since a child.  That is inbetween my mom&#x27;s fine blond beautiful textured hair and dad&#x27;s Sicilian.  It has never looked so good.  Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  I do not use it sparingly.  I use a lot and a couple times a day.  I am 60 years old and finally people compliment my hair.  Isn&#x27;t that sad - all of these years without a good solution and embassarred by hair.  Pretty face and bad hair every day.  I&#x27;ve been able to grow it longer also and not chop it off.  I also cannot use salon products that run $50 per bottle because I am allegic to fragrances.  Even if not on my face, the scents cause my face to itch and sneezing.  Thank you for an inexpensive great solution.  Since I use so much I appreciate the low cost.  And, my hair never looks greasy.  I&#x27;ve been told to not wash my hair every day to get oil in it.  That does not work for my hair.  I wash my hair every day and apply fresh argan oil.</li>
            <li> It arrived 10/19/14.  I immediately opened the packaged and used the oil on my skin and hair.  It went on light and made my skin and hair feel very soft.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now, and have just received my fourth bottle. It has completely changed my damaged hair and dry skin. I put it on when my hair is still pretty wet and apply a liberal amount. Now I did the same amount after I had gotten my super damaged ends cut, so it ended up being too much for my healthy hair. So if you don&#x27;t have over processed hair, you definitely don&#x27;t need as much. Which is nice, but even though I use it on my skin and hair almost everyday, I&#x27;m only on my third bottle, about to start my fourth, and it&#x27;s almost November, and I bought my first bottle in January. I highly highly recommended this product if you want genuinely want moisturized hair and skin, and not just something that coats it without actually helping.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few brands of argan oil, but was concerned about their sourcing and the extraction method.  Kandala is organic, cold-pressed, and sourced from Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact the top has a small hole that allows only a drop or two at a time.  There is no pump or dropper to fool with, and oil doesn&#x27;t drip down the side of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is 100% argan oil, is nicely viscous, and has that faint and distinctive grassy smell.&lt;br /&gt;The cost beats any brand I have found with all the attributes I wanted.  The supplier is very concerned with customer satisfaction, which adds to the value.  I will definitely purchase again, and I am recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li> Love this Argan oil. I am already noticing a slight difference in the texture of my hair. It&#x27;s a bit more bouncier than usual when I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry. I haven&#x27;t notice a nice sheen on my hair as of yet but I only just started on this and hopefully I&#x27;ll see a gradual change.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I use it on my face and hair.  It is absolutely fine, vanishes and does not leave my skin oily.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> One tiny drop does the job! My hair absorbs oil fast so this amount is fine for me. My daughters hair is much thicker so am having to use up to four drops for her hair, her hair is also much longer then mine as well. But it does produce a healthy silky shine and not greasy. It makes our hair so soft. I keep it in our bedroom closet out of sunlight and artificial light. This small bottle will last us for many months since only drops are needed.</li>
            <li> I love the Kandal Argan oil! My daughter used it for her frizzy hair! She loves it! You only need a tiny bit, so it will go a long ways!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this quite long enough to determine if it is going to solve all my skin problems, but I can say that I love the way it feels on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling oily and it seems to soak into the skin very well.  I heard that it is good for wrinkles; but I may have waited a few years too long for it to get rid of all of my wrinkles.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will write another review after I have used it longer and will let you know if it is the &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynn Smith, Greensboro, NC</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil for 4yrs. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s. I have always had dry patchy skin on my face. Since using argan oil my face is 100% balanced. No more dry patches at all. I also use argan oil on my hands. I mix it in with my daily body lotion as well. I use it on my hair (about 5 drops) massaging into my scalp and hair ends 20 min before shampooing. The condition of my hair is now balanced and no more dry ends. I also use a little on my wet hair before blow drying.. Argan oil is amazing!! It has plumped up the skin on my face and the fine lines around my eyes have improved! Wish I would have known about this product in my 20&#x27;s.. Recommend Argan oil to everyone.. Including men and children. ( I have used this product on my sons eczema flare ups and 100% gone by morning.) It is also great for healing scratches or dry brittle nails..</li>
            <li> I use this argan oil in 3 places knees , elbows and my hair. This oil is great my skin feels so much softer and my split ends are practically gone. My skin feels amazing.i love this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used only Argan oil on my face &amp; body for several years now...it&#x27;s the best moisturizer period!&lt;br /&gt;I had been using another brand before switching to this, and have also used the Josie Maran brand.&lt;br /&gt;Josie&#x27;s is true argan oil, however they refined it to remove the natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;I want a cold pressed virgin oil, that is 100% pure &amp; unrefined. (Plus hers is way overpriced.)&lt;br /&gt;This Kandala is an excellent oil! It is what you should be seeing, smelling &amp; feeling from a true argan oil.&lt;br /&gt; I use this on my face, neck, chest, arms &amp; hands every morning and it absorbs quickly, my skin feels soft &amp; supple, and makeup glides right on, and stays put.&lt;br /&gt;This is better than the brand I had been using...glad I switched.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this in my hair for softness, moisture &amp; sheen. I put it on at night, particularly the ends, and wake up with super conditioned hair. This brand actually seems to do more for my hair than any others I used prior.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing, and plan to continue to use this Kandala argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to their fabulous bottle size and pricing, I can now afford to be using this all over.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has truly made a difference for me. I&#x27;m often mistaken as being 8 years younger than what I am.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say Kudo&#x27;s to the sellers of this oil. Excellent oil, amber bottle &amp; price, and the dispenser is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I researched before choosing this one. I am turned off when reading reviews where 95% of them are written by those having received the item free for review. Sends up a red flag for me that sellers are fishing for reviews. This seller didnt do that.&lt;br /&gt; I want an argan oil that can stand up to an unsolicited review on it&#x27;s own merit.&lt;br /&gt;This oil and the seller impress me.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to purchase another bottle soon just so I can  spoil myself all over with this incredible oil.  It doesnt take much and will last quite awhile, but I like knowing I have enough for my whole body daily. I love how soft my skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;Truly impressed with this one. The best yet:)e best yet:)</li>
            <li> awesome product thanks !!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Josie Maran for several years and wanted a less expensive option. I&#x27;m no argan oil expert and read extensively to learn the characteristics of a good argan oil hoping I could find a good one for less money, which led me to Kandala. To compare with the Josie Maran brand, this has a nutty scent compared to the Josie brand that didn&#x27;t have any scent, which leads me to believe this is less refined, which is supposed to be better. It is a bit thicker but does absorb into the skin and did do a better job for me on my hands an cuticles. This has an organic symbol on the bottle compared to Josie that claims to be organic but doesn&#x27;t have the organic symbol. I like the opening that restricts the flow to a single drop better than a dropper, which has led me to tip over the bottle and spill. After using this for several days I&#x27;m very happy and at this price I don&#x27;t have to limit use to my face. Two drops is all I need for my face and it feels soft, moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so perfect for the hair !!! Just drop a little weekly with the wet hair and dry it as usual , I saw the results the first day I used it. Haven&#x27;t try in the skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin and hair smooth, soft, shiny and manageable.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I just started using this a couple days ago and I can feel the difference.  I put it on my face before I use my face cream.  I am so glad I bought this.</li>
