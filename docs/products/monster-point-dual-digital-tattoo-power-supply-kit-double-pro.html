            <li>i would recommend it to any body what an awesome product</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Just like the title suggests, this is a good power supply box, but it&#x27;s not like the eikon 250/300.  </li>
            <li>What electronic device doesn&#x27;t come with a power chord, and if there is one out there, wouldn&#x27;t you think it was best practice to make certain the customer knew this was the case?&lt;br</li>
            <li>a very good quality product worth every cent i paid for it</li>
            <li>All in all its a nice power supply.</li>
            <li>This power supply is great very accurate and easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>but it does deliver good power and gives me the ability to finally fine adjust my shadier machines for better coverage.</li>
            <li>Live it!works very good</li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>but i needed more.</li>
            <li>Of course it isn&#x27;t top of the line</li>
            <li>The fully digital design allows you to set the perfect voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also discovered that a #16 ink cup fits perfectly over the dial to prevent cross contamination.</li>
            <li>Lesson learned and I purchased a much better Eikon Power Supply.</li>
            <li>I love this power supply.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I like this power supply makes it nice and easy to switch from liner to shader, it runs my machines and a bit higher power than normal but all and all its been a good power supply, the clip cords included are good quality, the foot switch i havent used because i have a custom one of my own</li>
            <li>Good consistent power.</li>
            <li>Easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it delivers a nice consistent flow of power.</li>
            <li>but it did save me in a pinch for how cheap the power source was.</li>
            <li>immediately tried to contact seller, but there was no link available to do so.  </li>
            <li>it didnt run as good as my old one.</li>
            <li>Good enough though.</li>
            <li>When I run the machine it runs my hybrid rotarys pretty good, but it WILL NOT stay at a constant voltage when I set it up it for my Ironhorse machines or my Damascus machines.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money..</li>
            <li>I needed a power source quickly to replace mine that finally went out, had it within 3 business days, good company on shipping, but the power source itself is pretty much junk.</li>
            <li>,i put it in my junk tattoo pile and called it a lost and broke out my eye power that don&#x27;nt even have a ground ,and, i used it for around six mounths and ,decided i wanted to use a needle type, and both of these cheap one worked great no problem ,steady current,its not always the price and bell and whisles,i love my little needle face power supply ,and i ilked the last one i put up.but this machine</li>
            <li>I have been useing a valstard power supply through most of my short career.</li>
            <li>and Im glad its back to being a backup....</li>
            <li>this product is exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>I have a small box White &amp;#34;single digi&amp;#34; for my convention/road kit that I got from Amazon and it works great!</li>
            <li>Good for beginners, but if your using it everyday for work, its junk.</li>
            <li>However my partner in my shop purchased the same one and his is still going strong.</li>
            <li>and it got to my house FAST...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Think of all the time you can save having both machines powered up and ready to go.</li>
            <li>This machine is very flexible and can be used in any country with any voltage from 110-220v\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they made it a point that it could be used in any country, I assumed that the \\&quot;Input:</li>
            <li>BUT i was very surprised when i started using it because it is turning out to be a FIRST rate power supply box</li>
            <li>Looks cool blue led.</li>
            <li>i would have to run it at 14 voltage to make decent lines, which is too high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Digitally controlled output on this machine is from 1.5 to 18v with powerful yet stable current to operate ANY tattoo machine on the market.</li>
            <li>First when I open the box and get the power source out, 2 bolts fell out out from the bottom of the machine, some assembly required</li>
            <li>It does, however, clearly state</li>
            <li>My old power supply had detentes</li>
            <li>I waited a couple days to see if that option became availableafter the transaction had time to complete, still no option to contact seller.  </li>
            <li>Its small enough to fit in my travel kit</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not worth it.</li>

            <li> Perhaps I just got a bad one, but never the less.</li>
            <li> Nothing but a useless machine.  </li>

            <li> Live it!works very good</li>
            <li> Just like the title suggests, this is a good power supply box, but it&#x27;s not like the eikon 250/300.  Good enough though.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a 3rd rate power supply box 4 the price it cost BUT i was very surprised when i started using it because it is turning out to be a FIRST rate power supply box and it got to my house FAST...Well worth the money..</li>
            <li> I havent been tattooing long, but my mentor has been doing it for over 25 years. I have custom coil and rotary machines. So of course i wanted a power supply just like the big boys. So i order this duel \\&quot;pro\\&quot;. They should change the name. I have been useing a valstard power supply through most of my short career. It was ok but i needed more. Now i have a machine that pisses me off every time i hook up. The price you pay is what you get.</li>
            <li> I needed a power source quickly to replace mine that finally went out, had it within 3 business days, good company on shipping, but the power source itself is pretty much junk. First when I open the box and get the power source out, 2 bolts fell out out from the bottom of the machine, some assembly required lol. I finally piece it together, no big I understand stuff happens. When I run the machine it runs my hybrid rotarys pretty good, but it WILL NOT stay at a constant voltage when I set it up it for my Ironhorse machines or my Damascus machines. The power source will jump from 6.08v to 12v then to 8v/etc and never stays where I need it at. I will have to find another power source soon but it did save me in a pinch for how cheap the power source was. Good for beginners, but if your using it everyday for work, its junk.</li>
            <li> a very good quality product worth every cent i paid for it i recommend this product to anyone who is looking to purchase this item or the brand the item represents</li>
            <li> Of course it isn&#x27;t top of the line but it does deliver good power and gives me the ability to finally fine adjust my shadier machines for better coverage. My old power supply had detentes so I was stuck on a whatever voltages those detentes gave me, it was a backup and Im glad its back to being a backup....</li>
            <li> I received the package on time, but upon opening it, there was no power chord.  the description of the item says &#x27;Product Features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Low Maintaince&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;  Quality USA Seller&lt;br /&gt;  Quality construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you can connect both your liner and shader to the power supply and with a simple flip of a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of all the time you can save having both machines powered up and ready to go. The fully digital design allows you to set the perfect voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what you get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Input: AC 60v-250v 50Hz-60Hz&lt;br /&gt;  Output: DC 1.5-18v&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digitally controlled output on this machine is from 1.5 to 18v with powerful yet stable current to operate ANY tattoo machine on the market.This machine is very flexible and can be used in any country with any voltage from 110-220v\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they made it a point that it could be used in any country, I assumed that the \\&quot;Input: AC 60v-250v 50Hz-60Hz) meant that it came with a power chord that could be used with any of these input amounts depending on different country standards.  It does, however, clearly state \\&quot;Here&#x27;s what you get:  Input.....\\&quot; therefore leaving me with the impression that it would at least be coming with a power chord.  What electronic device doesn&#x27;t come with a power chord, and if there is one out there, wouldn&#x27;t you think it was best practice to make certain the customer knew this was the case?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then went to the product reviews to see if anyone else had this issue.  No one had this specific issue, but one person said that they even got a foot pedal with it.  I got nothing but the box.  No power cable.  No foot pedal.  Nothing but a useless machine.  Actually I can&#x27;t even try it out to tell you if it is useless because I have no power chord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately tried to contact seller, but there was no link available to do so.  I waited a couple days to see if that option became availableafter the transaction had time to complete, still no option to contact seller.  I went to the sellers page, no option to contact seller there either.  It seems to me that this seller is a bit shady and knows that they are, so they don&#x27;t even allow customers to contact them with issues.</li>
            <li> All in all its a nice power supply. Its small enough to fit in my travel kit and it delivers a nice consistent flow of power. I also discovered that a #16 ink cup fits perfectly over the dial to prevent cross contamination. However,I didn&#x27;t care for the foot pedal it came with.</li>
            <li> this product is exactly what i was looking for i would recommend it to any body what an awesome product</li>
            <li> Crap. I used it twice. The back of it was pushed it like it was gonna break. I called back to return it and I was getting bunch of bs. So I just threw it away. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this power supply makes it nice and easy to switch from liner to shader, it runs my machines and a bit higher power than normal but all and all its been a good power supply, the clip cords included are good quality, the foot switch i havent used because i have a custom one of my own but i have used that style before and they work well.</li>
            <li> After a month of so so use... it gave out. However my partner in my shop purchased the same one and his is still going strong. Perhaps I just got a bad one, but never the less. Lesson learned and I purchased a much better Eikon Power Supply. I have a small box White &amp;#34;single digi&amp;#34; for my convention/road kit that I got from Amazon and it works great! &amp;#34;Cheers!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> just to let,you know i bought one of these dual rigs around a year and a half ago ,and it never held steady current,the read out dial jump from 10 volt to6 volt , 6 volts to 14 volts,i put it in my junk tattoo pile and called it a lost and broke out my eye power that don&#x27;nt even have a ground ,and, i used it for around six mounths and ,decided i wanted to use a needle type, and both of these cheap one worked great no problem ,steady current,its not always the price and bell and whisles,i love my little needle face power supply ,and i ilked the last one i put up.but this machine did&#x27;nt even look new out of the box,the little white switch cover that i see on all of them was missing,i&#x27;m sticking to my little neddle read out box i don&#x27;nt use the read out any way ,i tune my machines by ear.&lt;br /&gt; .crazy rick&lt;br /&gt;p.s. i think they are alot of rejects in these&#x27;s power supplies</li>
            <li> I love this power supply. Good consistent power. Looks cool blue led. This can run as a minor backup power supply</li>
            <li> LA EMPRESA QUE CONTRATE PARA EL ENVIÓ ME ROBO. Y CON TANTAS GANAS QUE TENIA DE ESPERAR MI PRODUCTO Y NUNCA ME LLEGO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a tattoo artist for 4 years. This power supply is great very accurate and easy to adjust. I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> YUELONG Tattoo Supply is the number one scourge on the tattoo industry! They sell knockoff machines from designs stolen from tattoo machine builders and their Chinese-made supplies are garbage. They endlessly spam tattooers with their useless emails and besides all that, not one of the people who own or work at Yuelong are tattooers. STAY AWAY!!!</li>
            <li> it didnt run as good as my old one. its also inaccurate voltage-wise. i would have to run it at 14 voltage to make decent lines, which is too high.</li>
