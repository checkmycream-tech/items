            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them all but the ones I&#x27;ve used transfer nicely.</li>
            <li>images that I received are mostly full nail designs, which is great for any nail size.</li>
            <li>did a quick stamping with one of the plates and the images seemed to be etched on great, so no problems</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>and I find an old credit card works best to scrape.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good.</li>

            <li>I did finally receive the product and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>They just came today and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I had no duplicates and they came individually packaged in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Most designs im not intetrsted in.</li>
            <li>I love that it come with a stamper and the scraper is plastic and doesn&#x27;t scratch my plates.</li>
            <li>Is OK, My wife like it a lot.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>but I love all the designs on the pallets</li>
            <li>Cute patterns, we were very excited about this kit.</li>
            <li>the scraper is not that great a plan old credit card would do you more justice.</li>
            <li>It does take a lot of practice and I am still working on becoming a stamping pro.</li>
            <li>But for $5 its fine for practise.</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure the plates are ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just hoping a higher quality stamp will make these usable!!</li>
            <li>they are excellent and have many styles to choose from, I can now create styles that look like there were professionally done in a matter of minutes, simple to use,very quick</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got this product until I tried it out and found that the plates were scratched and when I went to use the stamp on it the nail polish wouldn&#x27;t stick or for that matter work at all with the plate.</li>
            <li>So when I started wanting some more nail plates, this seemed like the logical option to use it for.</li>
            <li>These are so worth the price I have bought 4 sets now for friends!</li>
            <li>Thought they came in a sweet velvetish bag they are not covered and are stacked so a couple were already scratched-</li>
            <li>Super cool set.</li>
            <li>It came quick.</li>
            <li>She in late teens and is absolutely loving using these!!  </li>
            <li>These really work and are easy to apply to nails.</li>
            <li>plates came in a package with the stamper and scraper shown-no big since I have my own stamper</li>
            <li>For the price this was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I really had hoped this product would be good from the nice way it was packaged but it is not a good nail art set.</li>
            <li>and i know im doing it right.</li>
            <li>i loved the different designs plus it was really cheap to buy then the regular ones and alot of varity.</li>
            <li>they seems pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>The stamper broke on the first try.  </li>
            <li>I was ready!</li>
            <li>Awhile back Amazon gifted me with a $10 gift card.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it doesn&#x27;t ship from the US if you&#x27;re from there, so</li>
            <li>The nail plates were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I had looked at a lot of stamping kits for my first kit, and this one is the cheapest one I found, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>And she says some designs dont cover her whole thumb</li>
            <li>Thanks cheeky.</li>
            <li>..loved it so much bought one for myself...</li>
            <li>Not too sharp on the edges and mostly stamp</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s like shoes -- can you really ever have too many?!  </li>
            <li>I love this small set of plates.</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t get it to stamp, but 3 youtube videos and 20 mins of trial and error later..</li>
            <li>and only some of the design are good, most of them are ugly.</li>
            <li>positives it goes nicely over the whole nail, flaw if you push on the plat to hard to pick up the pattern your image may become stretched.</li>
            <li>I got 13 plates, mostly full nail designs and tip designs with some little stuff (fruits, bows, cutesie stuff).</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re themed from animal prints, to geometric designs, a few star designs and one cool looking stars and wavy stripes images (</li>
            <li>Took over 2 weeks to get here, but they are wide enough for my large fingers and stamp clearly.  </li>
            <li>and you can barely stamp the designs on with it.</li>
            <li>they have both full pattern and small decals.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend on not ordering this, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> You got to use a deep white nail polish or a dark color of another.</li>
            <li> I will purchase other products in the future.</li>
            <li> The only negative is I didn&#x27;t get the scraper but all the videos I watched everyone uses an old credit card</li>
            <li> I would give it a 4 &amp;1/2 because I didn&#x27;t like a few out of the multiple designs there were but even though I paid for standard shipping it</li>
            <li> took over a month to ship to the east coast, but again, I wasn&#x27;t too worried since it was a gift card, so no real loss to me if they never came.</li>
            <li> Other scrapers are metal</li>
            <li> Pictures on them were hard to get enough polish on in some places</li>
            <li> Leaves a mess.</li>
            <li> bubbles, champagne bottles, and a few abstract designs as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s me or the product...</li>
            <li> But they got here, and a few days before the earliest estimated delivery at that!</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Please disregard my negative feedback.</li>
            <li> The plates are shallow and do not work.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in this product and have tried quite a few different ways to make it work and all were failed attempts.</li>
            <li> There was a lot of plate but Poor quality  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at it</li>
            <li> No good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the stamper/scraper that makes these difficult..</li>
            <li> Or they could be completely random for each person</li>
            <li> , even wt their expensive kits.</li>
            <li> I have never received any bad plates from them and will always buy from them.</li>
            <li> All in all not to bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Never came dont order this!!!</li>
            <li> When i tryed to put the designs on my nail it would transfer to the nail stamper and it wouldnt go on my nail and i know im doing it right. Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> the stamper fell apart as soon as I got it and you can barely stamp the designs on with it. Also the kit I got looked nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> They were ok. Pictures on them were hard to get enough polish on in some places</li>
            <li> Stamper does not work</li>
            <li> Daughter was so thrilled with these.  She had been checking reviews, etc before deciding on brand and such.  She in late teens and is absolutely loving using these!!  Will order more.  I mean, it&#x27;s like shoes -- can you really ever have too many?!  :)</li>
            <li> Cute patterns, we were very excited about this kit. It&#x27;s the stamper/scraper that makes these difficult..they seems pretty flimsy. Hoping to switch this out and try again!! Each disk comes wrapped in plastic in its own bag to avoid scratching, and the variety was great. I&#x27;m just hoping a higher quality stamp will make these usable!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this! The stamper broke on the first try.  The plates are shallow and do not work. Leaves a mess. Very cheap! No good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what others are complaining about, I absolutely loved this purchase! I ordered this to try out stamping and to see if I liked it and man I fell in love! I&#x27;ve been watching tutorials to know what to expect so as so as my package arrived I was ready! Each plate is different, (ch1-10) they have both full pattern and small decals. I can not wait to buy more plates and expand my collection!</li>
            <li> I would like to update my last review. I did finally receive the product and am very happy with it. Please disregard my negative feedback.</li>
            <li> I love this small set of plates. Nice designs for the price. Cheeky always have great stamping plates.I have never received any bad plates from them and will always buy from them. 2 Thumbs up for Cheeky!</li>
            <li> So I got it on time.. Tried using it.  It works sometimes and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Not sure if it&#x27;s me or the product... it also does not look like this.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how quickly these things came Though I bought this for the stamper it did come with some cute stamping plates.Thought they came in a sweet velvetish bag they are not covered and are stacked so a couple were already scratched- I do recommend protective covering of some kind However at the price and with the great shipping I think this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Each 10 plates are all different and I like what every plate has on it as well. The reason why I am giving this only 3 stars is because of the scraper. The scraper is all plastic so it does not scrape off the nail polish properly. Other scrapers are metal so it is easier to scrape off the polish but this isn&#x27;t the case for this one.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got this product until I tried it out and found that the plates were scratched and when I went to use the stamp on it the nail polish wouldn&#x27;t stick or for that matter work at all with the plate. I am really disappointed in this product and have tried quite a few different ways to make it work and all were failed attempts. I highly recommend on not ordering this, it is a waste of money. I really had hoped this product would be good from the nice way it was packaged but it is not a good nail art set.</li>
            <li> Sponge. Part came apart . Took awhile to figure out how to use. All in all not to bad.</li>
            <li> These really work and are easy to apply to nails. I would recommend these it comes with a lot of different designs that will add some creativity to your nails.</li>
            <li> I have given these nail are polish stamps 5/5 they are excellent and have many styles to choose from, I can now create styles that look like there were professionally done in a matter of minutes, simple to use,very quick once you know how to do it, and great price x</li>
            <li> i loved the different designs plus it was really cheap to buy then the regular ones and alot of varity.</li>
            <li> All the plates are scratched this making the product not workable. There is not one plate that is not scratched</li>
            <li> Awhile back Amazon gifted me with a $10 gift card. So when I started wanting some more nail plates, this seemed like the logical option to use it for. Ten plates for $7 or so? Win win for me. I knew I was taking a gamble by not having any idea of what the plates would be (since the image is just an example, something some reviewers don&#x27;t seem to get), but sometimes you get the best stuff if someone else chooses for you.&lt;br /&gt;These took over a month to ship to the east coast, but again, I wasn&#x27;t too worried since it was a gift card, so no real loss to me if they never came. They just came today and I&#x27;m in love. I&#x27;ve never used Cheeky before, but always heard good things about them.&lt;br /&gt;My plates came in a package with the stamper and scraper shown-no big since I have my own stamper and I find an old credit card works best to scrape. They all had the blue protective film on and came in a package, and I received 10 different plates. The sticker on the package says 2012 Collection Set of 13, though I only received ten plates. That&#x27;s what I was expecting though, so no problem there (though I wouldn&#x27;t complain if I got 3 extras). I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re from Cheeky&#x27;s 2012 collection, so if you&#x27;re looking to see the potential images you get, check there. Or they could be completely random for each person&lt;br /&gt;I did a quick stamping with one of the plates and the images seemed to be etched on great, so no problems there.&lt;br /&gt;The images that I received are mostly full nail designs, which is great for any nail size. I didn&#x27;t get any french tip designs, and a handful of tiny characters (one or two a plate). They&#x27;re themed from animal prints, to geometric designs, a few star designs and one cool looking stars and wavy stripes images (hello July 4th!) bubbles, champagne bottles, and a few abstract designs as well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this set and this gamble. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price! Just be aware that it doesn&#x27;t ship from the US if you&#x27;re from there, so itmight take awhile, and there isn&#x27;t any tracking for you to follow. But they got here, and a few days before the earliest estimated delivery at that!</li>
            <li> Super cool set. You got to use a deep white nail polish or a dark color of another. It doesn&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll with sheer or sparkle nail polish.</li>
            <li> they have a nice pattern and the stamper is rather squishy it has it&#x27;s flaws and its positives. positives it goes nicely over the whole nail, flaw if you push on the plat to hard to pick up the pattern your image may become stretched. the scraper is not that great a plan old credit card would do you more justice. but over all i still loved it and feel it was a grand spend of money.</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend. She loves the variety of designs. And she says some designs dont cover her whole thumb but thats invitable. I dont know personally how well it works though.</li>
            <li> I had looked at a lot of stamping kits for my first kit, and this one is the cheapest one I found, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. At first I couldn&#x27;t get it to stamp, but 3 youtube videos and 20 mins of trial and error later.. they stamp perfect! They really are beautiful designs wt a lot of variety. I had no duplicates and they came individually packaged in perfect condition. The only negative is I didn&#x27;t get the scraper but all the videos I watched everyone uses an old credit card, even wt their expensive kits. I recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s big into nail art! It does take a lot of practice and I am still working on becoming a stamping pro.</li>
            <li> Bought this to learn stamping. Most designs im not intetrsted in. Stamper falls apart. Needs a sharper scraper. But for $5 its fine for practise.</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are Good,i got 10 plates of different designs and these plates are from cheeky summer collection Set of 26 from CH1 to CH10</li>
            <li> They are not that great! Didn&#x27;t work like I thought they would!</li>
            <li> The nail plates were exactly as described. I started trying them out as soon as they came in the mail and realized that one or two plates didn&#x27;t work because the images were not carved deep enough. Besides that they all worked and I was very happy with the product. The stamper works well too.</li>
            <li> I have been using cheeky for a while and i like their plates... I purchased it as a gift and the girl loved it... Its a good starter kit and i had purchased stamps separately...</li>
            <li> I never gat it 2 ps Pro White Rubber Bottle Holder For Nail art. Wher is it.????</li>
            <li> There was a lot of plate but Poor quality  and only some of the design are good, most of them are ugly. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> These are so worth the price I have bought 4 sets now for friends! They work great and are such a great way to doll up your nails.</li>
            <li> For the price this was pretty cool. I love that it come with a stamper and the scraper is plastic and doesn&#x27;t scratch my plates.</li>
            <li> I would give it a 4 &amp;1/2 because I didn&#x27;t like a few out of the multiple designs there were but even though I paid for standard shipping it and it came in 18 days rather than the estimated over two months so I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li> Took over 2 weeks to get here, but they are wide enough for my large fingers and stamp clearly.  So many for the price!  What a bargain.  Thanks cheeky.</li>
            <li> Like it. Cheeky has some nice designs.</li>
            <li> Is OK, My wife like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of images included. I haven&#x27;t tried them all but the ones I&#x27;ve used transfer nicely. Good quality plates</li>
            <li> It came quick. I got 13 plates, mostly full nail designs and tip designs with some little stuff (fruits, bows, cutesie stuff). Not too sharp on the edges and mostly stamp ok. I&#x27;m not great at it but I am pretty sure the plates are ok. They seem deeply etched enough and hold polish in the image. Cheap and good.</li>
            <li> Works awesome..me and my niece purchased to try..loved it so much bought one for myself... Very easy to use</li>
            <li> The stamp and the scraper are different from what&#x27;s pictured but I love all the designs on the pallets</li>
            <li> I dont like the stamps</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and it nail stamps great. I look forward to using in the future.  I will purchase other products in the future.</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied. All designs on the stamps are cartoon like, nothing like flowers or anything. Probably never going to use.</li>
