            <li> I don&#x27;t remember reading that part not really worth the price paid</li>
            <li> The product itself seems thick and not like other Essie I have purchased from other stores.  </li>
            <li> However,  I was disappointed because the bottle was half empty.</li>

            <li> .5ml bottles.....these are not average size they are MUCH smaller.  I LOVE this brand but truly expected more polish... I thought I was getting a deal however based on the size it&#x27;s not much of  a deal.  Regardless the colors are nice and I still like the brand... polish stays on much longer and looks much nicer than other brands...</li>

            <li> This is the true &amp;#34;Fantastic Four&amp;#34;! Every color is a true winner here. 3 of 4 are rich, deep fall to winter colors and the 4th is a perfect neutral on its own or as an alternative french tip on any of the other colors. This makes a perfect stocking stuffer for the girls at work!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, long lasting polish. It looks professionally done. One of the best nail polish brands out there.</li>
            <li> Èssie Fall Collection  great colors</li>
            <li> Best nail polish out there.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, but the brushes get stuck in the bottle when I go to open them. The polish is also becoming thicker and thicker each time I paint my nails. I prefer buying the regular size bottles.</li>
            <li> Great way to sample colors from this collection to know if you want to buy the full size!! Also used standard shipping and it was delivered quickly. Highly recommended for essie lovers!</li>

            <li> Great colors, perfect size, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> The gray polish was very pretty. However,  I was disappointed because the bottle was half empty. It looks like it may have spilled during shipment.</li>
