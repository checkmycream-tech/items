            <li>It&#x27;s not annoying inbetween</li>
            <li>(Yes I know it was dirt cheap).  </li>
            <li>Cute for a fun stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>Item fit well.</li>
            <li>The material is very stretchy which is nice.</li>

            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>And comfortable too.....</li>
            <li>doesnt fit a foot  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this for me .</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and love wearing them, I bought two.</li>
            <li>Cute, cheap and gonna look great on my float down the river!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, but I cant wear it due to a SIZING problem.  </li>
            <li>If you have a much shorter foot, then you will LOVE this.</li>
            <li>quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>It would have been pretty however, if it would of fit.</li>
            <li>It makes ur feet look so pretty!</li>
            <li>so they just look looser than this pic.not worth the money</li>
            <li>It took nearly one month to get to me, but I&#x27;m satisfied with it</li>
            <li>Well, I was surprised to receive just that because most ofus have two feet.  </li>
            <li>My set are whole pearl with ring toe rich</li>
            <li>Broke right away.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly even if you have a little bit of a bigger ankle or foot because it&#x27;s stretchy without breaking.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to comfort wise.</li>
            <li>First off it is the cheapest, junkiest thing that I have ever seen</li>
            <li>looks pretty</li>
            <li>Very affordable !</li>
            <li>Simple and sexy.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, but was not exactly the same as the picture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again I know that it is cheap, just don&#x27;t want people buying it for a particular occasion and being surprised when it arrives.</li>
            <li>REALLY large, wrapped around leg twice.</li>
            <li>and I have a large foot.  </li>
            <li>and well done made, thanks</li>
            <li>The material is very stretchy so it will fir around even the widest ankles.</li>
            <li>I bought three of them because the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>and it has not broken yet.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Their nice, not cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with them.</li>
            <li>It is adorable, BUT when wrapped two times (as shown in the pic) it is not long enough and started to cut into my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is comfortable as long as you&#x27;re barefoot.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Very classy</li>
            <li>Pretty in the pic, but kind of uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried them on but it appears to have multiple ways of wearing it...&amp; very decent for price</li>
            <li>The separate ring part is prob my least favorite</li>
            <li>it could barely fit round</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful piece, I unfortunately didn&#x27;t realize it was a single piece and not a pair.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much, just feel a little old for it.</li>
            <li>clearly states that it only comes with one if you want 2</li>
            <li>All around not a good experience or the item was of cheap quality.</li>

            <li> I would not have purchased if I had know there was only a single barefoot sandal.</li>
            <li> is long and you have to wrap it once before putting it on to get the look on the photo</li>
            <li> (otherwise it&#x27;s too long to</li>
            <li> Now, I will tell you that I have a very long foot (size 10.5) , and this may be the cause.</li>
            <li> Little big</li>
            <li> Only thing is that takes a few weeks delivery</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> The other thing that I did not love is that the beads on the toe were just big enough that it made it hard to wear sandles, so if wearing this you must be prepared to not go out in it unless you plan to go out bare foot.</li>
            <li> not really I ordered the second one to match one I had and guess what it was the wrong one it didnt match even though it was the same order number part number</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the &amp;#34;string&amp;#34; used for the ring is not well hidden and can be seen</li>
            <li> comes in a very small clear pouch inside of a small brown envelope.&lt;br /&gt;The anklet</li>
            <li> Why mess with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Wrapping it once looks silly and the entire thing falls off.</li>
            <li> but I have a small foot</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> it runs small</li>
            <li> ring is small and fits well.</li>
            <li> but I have really small ankles</li>
            <li> a small child&#x27;s finger let alone a toe....</li>
            <li> Somehow i missed the detail about it being only one piece, so I was disappointed when it wasn&#x27;t a &#x27;pair&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I got a dumb looking piece of junk that can no way be worn on the ankle/foot.</li>
            <li> the separate toe ring is weird and small</li>
            <li> Not good .made very poor weak.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful!!!</li>

            <li> My set are whole pearl with ring toe rich my expectative are beautiful ! Only thing is that takes a few weeks delivery</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how cute this one , I love it fits me very great and well done made, thanks</li>
            <li> i just opened the litlre pacage and the brasalet broke :C</li>
            <li> The pearls are cheap looking, but it&#x27;ll be cute for the summer</li>
            <li> It is adorable, BUT when wrapped two times (as shown in the pic) it is not long enough and started to cut into my skin. Wrapping it once looks silly and the entire thing falls off. Now, I will tell you that I have a very long foot (size 10.5) , and this may be the cause. If you have a much shorter foot, then you will LOVE this. The other thing that I did not love is that the beads on the toe were just big enough that it made it hard to wear sandles, so if wearing this you must be prepared to not go out in it unless you plan to go out bare foot.</li>
            <li> Wore this on Sunday I love it</li>
            <li> The material is very stretchy so it will fir around even the widest ankles. In fact, My daughter wears one as a necklace (she is 2). I bought three of them because the price was reasonable. I get compliments all the time. People think that I braided a pattern on my ankle. It&#x27;s not annoying inbetween my toes with I wear it with sandals. and it has not broken yet.</li>
            <li> Nice for costume jewelry. Thanks</li>
            <li> This arrived today.  First off it is the cheapest, junkiest thing that I have ever seen (Yes I know it was dirt cheap).  There is no way this will even make it through one festival and it looks nothing like the picture.  It is solid pearls.  No blue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I know that it is cheap, just don&#x27;t want people buying it for a particular occasion and being surprised when it arrives.</li>
            <li> Very cute! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it in Jamaica.</li>
            <li> Was not the one shown in the picture.  However, they fit fine and should work for the beach wedding</li>
            <li> Beautiful, but was not exactly the same as the picture. But it is nice because it stretches out, and you can wrap it around your ankle as you please. Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Great value!  Delivery was 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Little big but I have a small foot but I would totally buy theses for my friends</li>
            <li> Its okay, Nice to wear after a pedicure. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Somehow i missed the detail about it being only one piece, so I was disappointed when it wasn&#x27;t a &#x27;pair&#x27;. Other than that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with them. Their nice, not cheap looking. Very classy</li>
            <li> Bought two and wore them for our wedding. Cute!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the picture and was extremely big. I had to wrap around my ankle twice and hope it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Very cool for the Beach cant wait to get to one</li>
            <li> Was too big for my size 8 foot.</li>
            <li> I ordered this but I received something totally different. I got a dumb looking piece of junk that can no way be worn on the ankle/foot. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I love them &amp; I&#x27;m sure the ladies in my wedding party will also.</li>
            <li> beware....it runs small</li>
            <li> I did not see any blue it was all pearl.</li>
            <li> Just... going to say it looks great... &amp;#62;.&amp;#62; Really great and Durable . . .</li>
            <li> I just received today!&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a very small clear pouch inside of a small brown envelope.&lt;br /&gt;The anklet is long and you have to wrap it once before putting it on to get the look on the photo (otherwise it&#x27;s too long to wear).&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable as long as you&#x27;re barefoot.&lt;br /&gt;The ring is small and fits well. It is not cumbersome in sandals.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the &amp;#34;string&amp;#34; used for the ring is not well hidden and can be seen</li>
            <li> Cute, cheap and gonna look great on my float down the river!!</li>
            <li> Took a while to recieve as it came from China. Not the best quality. Probably wont hold up after a couple of wears. However I like it. Cant wait to wear it to the beach. Would order again.</li>
            <li> It was huge! I couldn&#x27;t wear it at all</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> looks pretty but I have really small ankles so they just look looser than this pic.not worth the money</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried them on but it appears to have multiple ways of wearing it...&amp; very decent for price</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Nothing like the picture. REALLY large, wrapped around leg twice.</li>
            <li> I received a very different thing</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for me . I gave it to my friend&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying 2 more.&lt;br /&gt;It clearly states that it only comes with one if you want 2 you have to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Beautifully Made. My feet look so sexy with them on. Can&#x27;t wait to wear them on the beach this summer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like this at all</li>
            <li> Broke right away.Not good .made very poor weak.</li>
            <li> Finally got them . And I love them . Very comfortable . Thank you for rushing them to me.</li>
            <li> Awful!!! I thought this was per pair price, nope.... it was 1 instead of a pair, &amp; it was really cheap looking!</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t like it .i bought for me but its doesn&#x27;t suits to me .</li>
            <li> Either I did not receive it or it does not look like the picture at all</li>
            <li> These are beautiful !  Very affordable !</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and love wearing them, I bought two.</li>
            <li> quick shipping. Cute for a fun stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> This item did not come as it was shown in photo</li>
            <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t look like this, as you can see from the picture, but it&#x27;s ok. Nothing special but just ok.</li>
            <li> These are really beautiful!</li>
            <li> not really I ordered the second one to match one I had and guess what it was the wrong one it didnt match even though it was the same order number part number</li>
            <li> Kinda too big for me but I still manage to rock it. Very cute</li>
            <li> Item fit well. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Really cute on esp if u have a tan bc the pearl looks nice against darker skin. The material is very stretchy which is nice. It takes a little getting used to comfort wise. The separate ring part is prob my least favorite but I love the ankle ring. Super cute.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and elegant!  Well made. I love wearing this!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This was made for a giant with Gigantic Feet! It would have been pretty however, if it would of fit.</li>
            <li> OK.  Kinda cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I love this,it has an elastic stretch so it fit exact as shown in pic,really nice,</li>
            <li> Simple and sexy. Comfortable to the foot also.</li>
            <li> I love this and it looks amazing on my foot ... My husband also loves it and thinks it&#x27;s sexy</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful piece, I unfortunately didn&#x27;t realize it was a single piece and not a pair.</li>
            <li> Nothing I couldn&#x27;t make myself. But for the price. Why mess with it. I love this. So cute.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. When I buy barefoot sandals, I except a pair; not one.  Who ever heard of anyone only wearing one shoe if they have two feet.  I would not have purchased if I had know there was only a single barefoot sandal.</li>
            <li> It took nearly one month to get to me, but I&#x27;m satisfied with it</li>
            <li> Loved it! It looks really great and it shipped pretty quickly for being overseas! Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Pretty...these are wonderful on my feet. And comfortable too.....the separate toe ring is weird and small it could barely fit round a small child&#x27;s finger let alone a toe....however the main piece is what I wanted and it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s so cute and perfect. A couple bucks? You can&#x27;t beat that price. I love this! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, but I cant wear it due to a SIZING problem.  It is WAY too big and I have a large foot.  Size 10.  It&#x27;s unfortunate because I would have ordered more as gifts.  Glad I didn&#x27;t order a dozen.  Buyer beware because you cannot return the items to China!</li>
            <li> Pretty in the pic, but kind of uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> doesnt fit a foot  n i have a big foot  its literally made fir big foot!</li>
            <li> Got mine and loved it. Think I will order another so that I&#x27;ll have it on both feet. They&#x27;re so cute!</li>
            <li> This is so beautiful. Fits perfectly even if you have a little bit of a bigger ankle or foot because it&#x27;s stretchy without breaking. I loove this!!</li>
            <li> I loved it, looks great in me!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Perfect for my occasion!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, just feel a little old for it. Would definitely buy again for daughter, or younger person.</li>
            <li> The saying, &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34; says it all.  Why would someone buy just ONE?  Well, I was surprised to receive just that because most ofus have two feet.  So I contacted the seller, indeed their reply was not helpful as well.  So I refuse to go back and purchase another because had it indicated on the listing as only one and I must purchase two to make a pair then I would have done so.  All around not a good experience or the item was of cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it... Can&#x27;t wait to wear it on the beach...</li>
            <li> It makes ur feet look so pretty! It was also a great price! Definitely worth it!!!:-)</li>
            <li> Looks just like photo. I have a size 7.5-8 foot and it&#x27;s stretched out a tiny bit, not noticeable! Beautiful though. I wish I ordered two because I didn&#x27;t realize it would only be for one foot; I&#x27;m trying to wear them on the beach! Takes about 3.5 weeks to ship because it&#x27;s from China.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a beach wedding. Everyone was on the beach in the sand and no way can you wear shoes especially heels. It was the perfect alternative to being barefoot cause it dressed up my outfit.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, they were durable and looked pretty.</li>
