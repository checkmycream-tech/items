            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully since then and now that I have my own child, I use this on my boy whenever he falls and develops a scrape here and there.    </li>
            <li>and I was really loving it,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was also kind of scared on how they were going to ship it.</li>

            <li>The pleasant texture has a light silky feel with a nice fragrance that is not overbearing.</li>

            <li>skin is very fair and very sensitive; it breaks out from the simplest of exposures.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light</li>
            <li>&#x3D;).  </li>
            <li>and everyone seems to love it.  </li>

            <li>Now it is much better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and it makes my skin feel so healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li>I wish it were sold in more stores.</li>
            <li>Every day my scar looked better and better.</li>

            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing CHEAP stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li>So Smooth!  </li>
            <li>I tried many creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li>and he said okay -</li>
            <li>Except, it is very sticky, and it makes me like a walking piece of sticky fly paper.</li>
            <li>This product to me is OK..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>Love the vitamin e cream.</li>
            <li>But most of all I use it on my Tattoo&#x27;s  color</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this cream</li>
            <li>am hooked on this fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this soon.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite creams.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it any better than that.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase @ stores.  </li>
            <li>The value is better on-line anyway.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product since the packaging wasn&#x27;t that appealing, but bought it anyways based on the reviews and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Again, personally I love the product, just placing an order for another two jars...</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>its ok not what i want but using it</li>
            <li>so I am pleased with that.  </li>
            <li>Made my hands nice any smooth, too.</li>
            <li>Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>interesting side note -</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was opened.  </li>
            <li>The scent is ok, it reminds me of my mom&#x27;s hand cream or my dad&#x27;s muscle cream.</li>
            <li>I do use it on my hands and feet and love how it makes them feel.</li>
            <li>I have already reordered more.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, which contains no palm oil.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I am sure we&#x27;ll be using it a lot this winter.</li>
            <li>but the other ingredients are awesome - collagen, elastin, vitamin a, coconut oil, wheat germ - just a great blend in just the right porportions to heal my skin.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for walmart and was very excited to use this after my shower.</li>
            <li>Very rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin E is great for your skin and this one is absorbed quickly without any residue/greasiness.</li>
            <li>pretty good doesnt leave you greasy.</li>
            <li>Its not greasy at all and the 2 pack is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>It also has a very pleasant soft, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Very economical and great for healing your skin (thanks to the surplus of VIT E nutrients).  </li>
            <li>Used to be able to buy this in Walgreens, can not any more, so glad to find it here at such a great price</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>feels good on skin and don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price for a nice cream that works well on my son&#x27;s very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent fot Wrinkles, bruises and other skin problems with no lacerations.</li>
            <li>When the original jar was gone I immediately went to Amazon.com to look for more</li>
            <li>I brought the jar to the doctors and she was quite impressed with the ingredients and said she would recommend this product to other patients.</li>
            <li>this stuff is very mild.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is like cocoa butter/sunflower, it glides on easily, absorbs well</li>
            <li>The cream has a nice thick consistency but when you apply it it absorbs perfect.</li>
            <li>I wish it came in unscented, and the lotion scent is strong.  </li>
            <li>It goes on with a very light smell and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I got wrapped up in the great reviews, so I wanted to follow up w/ my own in case other people out there were/ are like me.</li>
            <li>The packaging was fine.  </li>
            <li>The cream is fine</li>
            <li>E  Cream  is really  super!  </li>
            <li>but it makes my hands and feet super soft, was a great price and has added in reducing the colors of my scars.</li>
            <li>This product feels so light and makes your skin lighter.  </li>
            <li>I feel ridiculously smooth after.</li>
            <li>so I could of get free shipping</li>
            <li>This stuff is a gift from the heavens because not only do you get a two-pack for a great price, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t clog pores and makes your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has great absorption, I use it on my face, neck and hands and it has kept me looking, I think, 10 years younger!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s creamy smooth, not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I primarily use is on spots of my face, hands, elbows, and feet.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Immediately and so smooth.</li>
            <li>And the double jars is great, I can use on my hands too.</li>
            <li>Using it on my hands now, with the same great results.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>so she (we both) feel comfortable with it</li>
            <li>But it is not alcohol free.</li>
            <li>Doesnt clog pores, goes on smooth</li>
            <li>When I mow I get chigger bites and they will not bite me anymore when I use this body cream and to me this is fantastic..</li>
            <li>I was having trouble keeping my scars moist and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I am 82 years old and look good.</li>
            <li>Very economical and great value overall.</li>
            <li>Rich, light &amp; pleasant fragrance, great for my dry skin and for my 2 yr old as well.</li>
            <li>The cream works very well, and leaves skin very soft, and it is a great price.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>It smells a bit like I remember my grandmother smelling - a very potent lotion smell - but it still doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or clog my pores.</li>
            <li>Years of working with solvents, oil, gas and greases have made my hands pretty beat up and this helps better than anything else I have found</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve almost gone through the original order, so</li>
            <li>we buy this add on item every time we buy $25 worth of items!</li>
            <li>Still works great for my skin and dryness, but the older container I had before I bought this from amazon didn&#x27;t burn my face after washing/scrubbing it, and these new ones did.</li>
            <li>Great for really dry skin and scars.</li>
            <li>Its great for dry skin all over the body and face.</li>
            <li>and my scar is no longer bright red, it&#x27;s pinkish.</li>
            <li>You definitely get a good bang for your buck with this cream.</li>
            <li>but if they stop, I will order here since FOTE products really aren&#x27;t found in many stores.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about how really good it is.  </li>
            <li>I had a Vitamin E cream that I loved and is almost gone, so I was trying to buy similar.</li>
            <li>stays nice and the art work is soft feeling</li>
            <li>Best stuff we have ever used to clear up dry skin</li>
            <li>While not over-the-top strong, it is still too flowery for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>What a pleasing price and super value.</li>
            <li>It really is a super value.</li>
            <li>Amazon replaced it quickly.</li>
            <li>The  price  too...is  simply  SUPER.  </li>
            <li>Luckily amazon sells it.</li>
            <li>It helped tremendously, and I&#x27;ve now started using it on my feet.</li>
            <li>I have been trying so many drugstore and some high end mostrizers for years now.</li>
            <li>Feels so light on my skin all while really hydrating it, even within one use!</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin, and I feel lucky that I am able to use this</li>
            <li>It takes good care of dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed into the skin without leaving any greasy residue, and  is mild and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Good for healing dry skin and lips.</li>
            <li>I have painfully dry, cracked heels and soles, to the point I can&#x27;t wear socks in the winter unless I glob on a good, rich cream first.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating to your skin!!</li>
            <li>Even the very first night that I put it on after my shower brought me some relief, regardless of what amount of vitamin E or other ingredients are in this cream, to me it is a pleasant and soothing way to treat my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this stuff helped to smooth out my skin and that it kept it very moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy - it leaves my hands feeling smooth and it really helps with the chapping.  </li>
            <li>Simple but effective.</li>
            <li>If you want an effective vitamin E cream look for one that tells you what you are getting in I.U.s and as a refference point one ounce of vitamin E is 28,000 I.U.s (International Units)</li>
            <li>I even use it as a facial moisturizer and people comment on how nice my complexion is as I don&#x27;t use makeup over it...only add mascara.</li>
            <li>The scars are fading at a nice pace with regular applications.  </li>
            <li>I also use the cream on my face regularly and I see a nice difference regarding the smoothness and healthful appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has become incredibly soft, smooth and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li>Although I am 47 years old, most people</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products - from Olay to Clinique and many others.  </li>
            <li>I have keratosis pilaris (&amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) on the back of my arms, and my dermatologist said I would need to find a simple, incredibly moisturizing lotion to use (he suggested a prescription balm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not greasy feeling and absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li>The price was right and shipped in two days.</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>I had a fracture that I didn&#x27;t have treated right away and it abscessed.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>She combines this with a bit of grape oil and not only does it feel good on my skin, but I think it has actually been having a good effect on my skin overall.</li>
            <li>I have a very large incision from surgery and my surgeon said vitamin E would help it heal well</li>
            <li>Absolutely Great Face Cream, Leaves my skin soft and solves the dry look problem  on my face.</li>
            <li>It provides just the right amount of moisture for my skin for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It has very little aroma, absorbs quickly and is great for the whole body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently begun thinning it out with a little aloe vera gel and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Great price especially for the double pack.</li>
            <li>I really like it very much !</li>
            <li>This vitamin cream is moderately priced and very light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>even more so BECAUSE of the mineral oil which creates a light barrier to keep the skin moisturized (but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or super oily like Vaseline would).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The value was good but other than that I dont have much to comment about on this product.</li>
            <li>Great product - hard to find.  </li>
            <li>first jar was a gift, so after not finding another locally I was pleased to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t find it again in local stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered it first when I was a downhill skier.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It did work for me pretty</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion as my daily lotion and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Service was fast!</li>
            <li>I love that I only need to use one product.</li>
            <li>Was delivered fast!</li>
            <li>This product is so reasonably priced, and DOES NOT TEST ON ANIMALS!</li>
            <li>Tried many lotions &amp; creams but this is the only that works.  </li>
            <li>a friend, the cream has a wonderfully thick feel to it, great scent and after&lt;</li>
            <li>My husband said to me one day, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you use on your skin, but it makes you so soft and smooth; keep buying whatever it</li>
            <li>Very creamy and has a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it two stars because I love the product.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and it always feels great and moisturizes my winter dry skin and over washed hands.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to know that the product included OTHER ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been using for about a weak and my scars are healing beautifully.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, spreads well and disappears relatively quickly (within a few minutes),  Makes skin very supple and diminishes fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Absolute favorite.. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else especially at the price I get.</li>
            <li>Disappears quickly and leaves skin soft as it&#x27;s repairing !</li>
            <li>My mother has used vitamin E cream for as long as I can remember so as part of a university project I purchased many E creams to analyze for vitamin E content.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is any good or not, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm anyway.</li>
            <li>and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>Love this product and use it often to make my dry body butter.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, got it to fade some dark spots that acne left over</li>
            <li>not only because mineral oil is NOT a natural ingredient (it&#x27;s petroleum based), but the jury is out on how good it is for our skin; soak a saltine cracker in mineral oil overnight.   </li>
            <li>I assume it is helping to heal my scar a little more quickly</li>
            <li>My mother first introduced me to this lotion (I use it mainly for hands)</li>
            <li>This product is an amazing moisturizer, without a heavy perfume scent.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this in the future too because it doesn&#x27;t break me out &amp; it is seriously cheap.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really about balance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried slathering straight E oil on my skin</li>
            <li>that I  then generously put this cream on and gently massage it into my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it softened my feet, almost to the point of eliminating the cracks &amp; splits in my skin in just 5 days.  </li>
            <li>but then I contacted the company to find out how much vitamin E was in it, as it wasn&#x27;t specified on the label.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or melty, it doesn&#x27;t irrirate, and actually it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li>and this softens my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I used to work as a lifeguard in Daytona Beach, Florida for 8 hours a day in straight sun and water reflecting the sun.  </li>
            <li>As an all over body moisturizer I didn&#x27;t feel like it moisturized very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer as it does not have a lot of fragrance or preservatives.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I use this on a regular daily basis and was happy to order on line when I was running low on it.</li>
            <li>This lotion helps so much, its non greasy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for years, but the &amp;#34;source&amp;#34; dried up locally, and I&#x27;ve been so pleased to be able to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but the truth may be important to some potential users.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing without being oily.</li>
            <li>The price on this item is a real steal.  </li>
            <li>BUT folks should note there is fragrance added to this cream and it stings when put on especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see the benefit of this product for my skin.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t really greasy.</li>
            <li>I am 46 and have always had youthful looking and feeling skin thanks to my mother, but since moving to Colorado from Florida it has definitely been drier and more sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am planning to order  more  in the near  future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I buy this stuff at my local Dollar General where it is super cheap, and sometimes even goes on clearance.</li>
            <li>and wow!!!</li>
            <li>It absorbs right into your skin and keeps it soft.</li>
            <li>It is thick but soaks in quickly, and is great for dry winter skin (or anytime of the year).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it any other place that Amazon.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin softer and with a more even complexion, and has been working wonders in speeding up healing on other scrapes and bug bites as well.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, neck, and eye area at night only, because it is too rich to use under makeup.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer because it actually goes in and moisturizes the dry skin instead of disappearing but doesn&#x27;t leaving you sticky for hours the way my original natural shea butter does.</li>
            <li>I am a newbie at shopping on online and will maintain proper care to  take special attention.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t personally use it on my face as it contains mineral oil and that can clog pores, but I put it on my dry skin and it is amazing</li>
            <li>The jars are rather small, but for the cheap price offered on amazon, well worth it!</li>
            <li>Not too strong a scent, though, and while not particularly my cup of tea, it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li>Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E is a smooth soother for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I apply this cream after my shower and 24 hours later my skin still feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My main purpose in purchasing this Vitamin E cream was to see how it could help a scar I have</li>
            <li>A classic beauty --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found more results than I have from creams five times more expensive.</li>
            <li>This stuff is one of the few Aloe Vera creams that actually has a really good amount of aloe vera.</li>
            <li>Vaseline is not something a very near sighted person wants on their hands, even a speck of dirt on my glasses bothers me, so having something greasy on my hands was not something that I wanted to</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The amount you get and the high quality is why we have used this for years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who has had surgery where an incision is healing.</li>
            <li>(Yes I was using high quality sunscreen, reapplying as often as I could, and not using spray suncreen.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>The cream is great though, I use it to make a homemade body/face cream with a few other ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Your face feels refreshed and young!!</li>
            <li>BOGO does not mean buy one get one in this case.</li>
            <li>This product is made in the USA and I am a big fan of keeping my money right here.</li>
            <li>He burned his face when a radiator cap popped off and the fluid flushed right into his face.  </li>
            <li>The light scent is pleasent, and is not as greasy as other vitamin E</li>
            <li>It made my skin very soft</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with excema problems when I use products that have alcohol in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin very soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old son, who has very dry skin, has been using this product for several months; his skin looks healthy again.</li>
            <li>But it absorbs pretty quickly and does not leave that heavy feeling after it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 18, but I have been using this cream for over three years now after first picking it up at wal-mart.</li>
            <li>Nearly 3 days in advance!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Like the product, but Amazon&#x27;s price is double that of Walmart...should have checked Walmart first.  </li>
            <li>it was when it was a ridiculous bright fiery red.</li>
            <li>They no longer sell Vitamin E cream at my local pharmacies and I decided to try this new brand after seeing the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 2 months every night all over my abdomen and still am only maybe halfway through the first container.  </li>
            <li>I used this (applying liberally to the dry areas, rubbed it in a bit) right before bed and woke up</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my lifeguard bosses to either buy pure vitamin E capsules to break open and put on my skin after work, OR to buy this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant and have extremely itchy legs/arms.</li>
            <li>Physical therapist recommended will see if it really does what she said</li>
            <li>My brown spot is alittle lighter so now I can cover it with makeup and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always baby soft.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had ex boyfriends say they miss how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li>Finally purchased this very Vitamin E cream yesterday, applied it once</li>
            <li>It makes you feel soft and never drys out...</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>No complains so far.</li>
            <li>This product does not have ALL natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is not all natural.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed how soft my skin has become.</li>
            <li>My feet  feels soft;  </li>
            <li>tried several kinds of lotions and could not find anything that really helped.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read closely enough, or pay enough attention that it isn&#x27;t fragrance free or hypoallergenic and ended up irritating my sons skin even more.</li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft and even living in a humid state</li>
            <li>Even on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>I use this on my body after a bath and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>In the interim I would recommend this product unless you are sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li>Your and face is just so soft, people keep telling me how soft my hands are.</li>
            <li>I use this on myself and my two year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re all surprised by it too.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin baby soft; I am not kidding.</li>
            <li>We use this product frequently at our house.</li>
            <li>and my skin was soft, supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin so soft and it keeps the moisture in for days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this cream for a few days, but I am enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend, and also suggest that you only buy one package of it at first if you have sensitive skin and use just a little bit at first to check if you have an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently pregnant and it&#x27;s been such a dry winter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after looking for something to help reduce a scar on a healing facial wound, and it has since become my main lotion for face and body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lived everywhere from the Arizona desert to New Hampshire&#x27;s icy mountains and this cream really works.  </li>
            <li>I have a jar that is over ten years old, and it still looks and smells and feels just like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li>It has very little fragrance, and is light.</li>
            <li>You can also find it at Wal Mart for relatively cheap (usually on the bottom shelf).  </li>
            <li>I dont want to name names, but several companies tested very well including the brand my mom uses and several store brands.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that FotE don&#x27;t advertize more because everyone should know about this cream.  </li>
            <li>i used the lotion for everyday use but the cream for rough areas that need more maintenance like your legs/heel, face, elbow and hands.</li>
            <li>I have tried every major brand of moisturizer from Walgreen&#x27;s/Walmart/Target, etc.</li>
            <li>I have been faithfully applying this cream to my feet each night and have seem major results within just two weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an expensive experiment and you&#x27;ll be glad you did!  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle smell to it and it totally makes my skin feel so smooth!  </li>
            <li>Dollar General carries it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 but have people regularly tell me I look like I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that only included natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Apparently, aloe makes your burn peel.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t perform any better than this - in fact, it performed worse.  </li>
            <li>I am used to a little bit of greasiness for my dry skin which is why I love nivea essentially enriched and their creme in the blue tin from Germany.</li>
            <li>I live in high altitude 7,000+ and this moisturizer sinks in without a greasy, gross feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to put up with it because it&#x27;s the only cream I ever used that both absorbs and still keeps surface skin extremely hydrated.</li>
            <li>Extremely inexpensive, super moisturizing, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Got it at the dollar store on a whim because my other cream, cetaphil, was feeling sticky and wasn&#x27;t absorbing well.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft and not as dry.  </li>
            <li>I think it must be the Vitamin E that is responsible for this, but I&#x27;ve never had any other product last like Fruit Of The Earth cream</li>
            <li>If you think your skin is dry, there is nothing thirstier than african-american natural non-chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>I will put on some of my eye creams or other expensive wrinkle creams, find they get absorbed so quickly  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This cream is amazing...</li>
            <li> Amazing feeling lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully since then and now that I have my own child, I use this on my boy whenever he falls and develops a scrape here and there.    </li>
            <li> and I was really loving it,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also kind of scared on how they were going to ship it.</li>
            <li> I like that the cream is not greasy, like a salve, but rubs in nice.  </li>
            <li> the cream feels nice</li>
            <li> He said it goes on the skin so nicely, it helps to make the skin look and smell nice.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer and works well.</li>
            <li> but I am just being completely honest.</li>
            <li> It helps moisturize my skin and it leaves it feeling fresh!!!</li>
            <li> The pleasant texture has a light silky feel with a nice fragrance that is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> My mother has very sensitive skin, and she is using it on her face and neck with great results too!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this cream!</li>
            <li> Amazon is a great place to buy it in these 2 pack sizes and with a great, low price.</li>
            <li> Most ingredients are plant based and clearly this company got everything perfect with this product.</li>
            <li> skin is very fair and very sensitive; it breaks out from the simplest of exposures.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light</li>
            <li> &#x3D;).  </li>
            <li> and everyone seems to love it.  </li>
            <li> anyway, I LOVE that this product is made in the USA and the \\&quot;value\\&quot; of it, but for me, I would NOT buy it again.   </li>

            <li> Wife loves this stuff and we&#x27;re ordering more.</li>
            <li> Now it is much better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and it makes my skin feel so healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li> I wish it were sold in more stores.</li>
            <li> Every day my scar looked better and better.</li>

            <li> I love this vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li> So Smooth!  </li>
            <li> I tried many creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li> and he said okay -</li>
            <li> Except, it is very sticky, and it makes me like a walking piece of sticky fly paper.</li>
            <li> This product to me is OK..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> Love the vitamin e cream.</li>
            <li> But most of all I use it on my Tattoo&#x27;s  color</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cream</li>
            <li> am hooked on this fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this soon.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite creams.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend it any better than that.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to purchase @ stores.  </li>
            <li> The value is better on-line anyway.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product since the packaging wasn&#x27;t that appealing, but bought it anyways based on the reviews and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Again, personally I love the product, just placing an order for another two jars...</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> its ok not what i want but using it</li>
            <li> so I am pleased with that.  </li>
            <li> Made my hands nice any smooth, too.</li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> interesting side note -</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was opened.  </li>
            <li> The scent is ok, it reminds me of my mom&#x27;s hand cream or my dad&#x27;s muscle cream.</li>
            <li> I do use it on my hands and feet and love how it makes them feel.</li>
            <li> I have already reordered more.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, which contains no palm oil.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I am sure we&#x27;ll be using it a lot this winter.</li>
            <li> but the other ingredients are awesome - collagen, elastin, vitamin a, coconut oil, wheat germ - just a great blend in just the right porportions to heal my skin.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for walmart and was very excited to use this after my shower.</li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin E is great for your skin and this one is absorbed quickly without any residue/greasiness.</li>
            <li> pretty good doesnt leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> Its not greasy at all and the 2 pack is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> It also has a very pleasant soft, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Very economical and great for healing your skin (thanks to the surplus of VIT E nutrients).  </li>
            <li> Used to be able to buy this in Walgreens, can not any more, so glad to find it here at such a great price</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> feels good on skin and don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price for a nice cream that works well on my son&#x27;s very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent fot Wrinkles, bruises and other skin problems with no lacerations.</li>
            <li> When the original jar was gone I immediately went to Amazon.com to look for more</li>
            <li> I brought the jar to the doctors and she was quite impressed with the ingredients and said she would recommend this product to other patients.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very mild.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is like cocoa butter/sunflower, it glides on easily, absorbs well</li>
            <li> The cream has a nice thick consistency but when you apply it it absorbs perfect.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in unscented, and the lotion scent is strong.  </li>
            <li> It goes on with a very light smell and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I got wrapped up in the great reviews, so I wanted to follow up w/ my own in case other people out there were/ are like me.</li>
            <li> The packaging was fine.  </li>
            <li> The cream is fine</li>
            <li> E  Cream  is really  super!  </li>
            <li> but it makes my hands and feet super soft, was a great price and has added in reducing the colors of my scars.</li>
            <li> This product feels so light and makes your skin lighter.  </li>
            <li> I feel ridiculously smooth after.</li>
            <li> so I could of get free shipping</li>
            <li> This stuff is a gift from the heavens because not only do you get a two-pack for a great price, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t clog pores and makes your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has great absorption, I use it on my face, neck and hands and it has kept me looking, I think, 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s creamy smooth, not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I primarily use is on spots of my face, hands, elbows, and feet.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Immediately and so smooth.</li>
            <li> And the double jars is great, I can use on my hands too.</li>
            <li> Using it on my hands now, with the same great results.</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> so she (we both) feel comfortable with it</li>
            <li> But it is not alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Doesnt clog pores, goes on smooth</li>
            <li> When I mow I get chigger bites and they will not bite me anymore when I use this body cream and to me this is fantastic..</li>
            <li> I was having trouble keeping my scars moist and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I am 82 years old and look good.</li>
            <li> Very economical and great value overall.</li>
            <li> Rich, light &amp; pleasant fragrance, great for my dry skin and for my 2 yr old as well.</li>
            <li> The cream works very well, and leaves skin very soft, and it is a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> It smells a bit like I remember my grandmother smelling - a very potent lotion smell - but it still doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Years of working with solvents, oil, gas and greases have made my hands pretty beat up and this helps better than anything else I have found</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve almost gone through the original order, so</li>
            <li> we buy this add on item every time we buy $25 worth of items!</li>
            <li> Still works great for my skin and dryness, but the older container I had before I bought this from amazon didn&#x27;t burn my face after washing/scrubbing it, and these new ones did.</li>
            <li> Great for really dry skin and scars.</li>
            <li> Its great for dry skin all over the body and face.</li>
            <li> and my scar is no longer bright red, it&#x27;s pinkish.</li>
            <li> You definitely get a good bang for your buck with this cream.</li>
            <li> but if they stop, I will order here since FOTE products really aren&#x27;t found in many stores.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how really good it is.  </li>
            <li> I had a Vitamin E cream that I loved and is almost gone, so I was trying to buy similar.</li>
            <li> stays nice and the art work is soft feeling</li>
            <li> Best stuff we have ever used to clear up dry skin</li>
            <li> While not over-the-top strong, it is still too flowery for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> What a pleasing price and super value.</li>
            <li> It really is a super value.</li>
            <li> Amazon replaced it quickly.</li>
            <li> The  price  too...is  simply  SUPER.  </li>
            <li> Luckily amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> It helped tremendously, and I&#x27;ve now started using it on my feet.</li>
            <li> I have been trying so many drugstore and some high end mostrizers for years now.</li>
            <li> Feels so light on my skin all while really hydrating it, even within one use!</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin, and I feel lucky that I am able to use this</li>
            <li> It takes good care of dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed into the skin without leaving any greasy residue, and  is mild and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> Good for healing dry skin and lips.</li>
            <li> I have painfully dry, cracked heels and soles, to the point I can&#x27;t wear socks in the winter unless I glob on a good, rich cream first.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating to your skin!!</li>
            <li> Even the very first night that I put it on after my shower brought me some relief, regardless of what amount of vitamin E or other ingredients are in this cream, to me it is a pleasant and soothing way to treat my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this stuff helped to smooth out my skin and that it kept it very moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy - it leaves my hands feeling smooth and it really helps with the chapping.  </li>
            <li> Simple but effective.</li>
            <li> If you want an effective vitamin E cream look for one that tells you what you are getting in I.U.s and as a refference point one ounce of vitamin E is 28,000 I.U.s (International Units)</li>
            <li> I even use it as a facial moisturizer and people comment on how nice my complexion is as I don&#x27;t use makeup over it...only add mascara.</li>
            <li> The scars are fading at a nice pace with regular applications.  </li>
            <li> I also use the cream on my face regularly and I see a nice difference regarding the smoothness and healthful appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has become incredibly soft, smooth and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li> Although I am 47 years old, most people</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products - from Olay to Clinique and many others.  </li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris (&amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) on the back of my arms, and my dermatologist said I would need to find a simple, incredibly moisturizing lotion to use (he suggested a prescription balm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not greasy feeling and absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li> The price was right and shipped in two days.</li>
            <li> The price was right.  </li>
            <li> I had a fracture that I didn&#x27;t have treated right away and it abscessed.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> She combines this with a bit of grape oil and not only does it feel good on my skin, but I think it has actually been having a good effect on my skin overall.</li>
            <li> I have a very large incision from surgery and my surgeon said vitamin E would help it heal well</li>
            <li> Absolutely Great Face Cream, Leaves my skin soft and solves the dry look problem  on my face.</li>
            <li> It provides just the right amount of moisture for my skin for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It has very little aroma, absorbs quickly and is great for the whole body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently begun thinning it out with a little aloe vera gel and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Great price especially for the double pack.</li>
            <li> I really like it very much !</li>
            <li> This vitamin cream is moderately priced and very light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> even more so BECAUSE of the mineral oil which creates a light barrier to keep the skin moisturized (but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or super oily like Vaseline would).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The value was good but other than that I dont have much to comment about on this product.</li>
            <li> Great product - hard to find.  </li>
            <li> first jar was a gift, so after not finding another locally I was pleased to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t find it again in local stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discovered it first when I was a downhill skier.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It did work for me pretty</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion as my daily lotion and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Service was fast!</li>
            <li> I love that I only need to use one product.</li>
            <li> Was delivered fast!</li>
            <li> This product is so reasonably priced, and DOES NOT TEST ON ANIMALS!</li>
            <li> Tried many lotions &amp; creams but this is the only that works.  </li>
            <li> a friend, the cream has a wonderfully thick feel to it, great scent and after&lt;</li>
            <li> My husband said to me one day, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you use on your skin, but it makes you so soft and smooth; keep buying whatever it</li>
            <li> Very creamy and has a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it two stars because I love the product.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and it always feels great and moisturizes my winter dry skin and over washed hands.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to know that the product included OTHER ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about a weak and my scars are healing beautifully.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, spreads well and disappears relatively quickly (within a few minutes),  Makes skin very supple and diminishes fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Absolute favorite.. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else especially at the price I get.</li>
            <li> Disappears quickly and leaves skin soft as it&#x27;s repairing !</li>
            <li> My mother has used vitamin E cream for as long as I can remember so as part of a university project I purchased many E creams to analyze for vitamin E content.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is any good or not, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm anyway.</li>
            <li> and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it often to make my dry body butter.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, got it to fade some dark spots that acne left over</li>
            <li> not only because mineral oil is NOT a natural ingredient (it&#x27;s petroleum based), but the jury is out on how good it is for our skin; soak a saltine cracker in mineral oil overnight.   </li>
            <li> I assume it is helping to heal my scar a little more quickly</li>
            <li> My mother first introduced me to this lotion (I use it mainly for hands)</li>
            <li> This product is an amazing moisturizer, without a heavy perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this in the future too because it doesn&#x27;t break me out &amp; it is seriously cheap.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really about balance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried slathering straight E oil on my skin</li>
            <li> that I  then generously put this cream on and gently massage it into my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it softened my feet, almost to the point of eliminating the cracks &amp; splits in my skin in just 5 days.  </li>
            <li> but then I contacted the company to find out how much vitamin E was in it, as it wasn&#x27;t specified on the label.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or melty, it doesn&#x27;t irrirate, and actually it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li> and this softens my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I used to work as a lifeguard in Daytona Beach, Florida for 8 hours a day in straight sun and water reflecting the sun.  </li>
            <li> As an all over body moisturizer I didn&#x27;t feel like it moisturized very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer as it does not have a lot of fragrance or preservatives.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I use this on a regular daily basis and was happy to order on line when I was running low on it.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps so much, its non greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for years, but the &amp;#34;source&amp;#34; dried up locally, and I&#x27;ve been so pleased to be able to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but the truth may be important to some potential users.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing without being oily.</li>
            <li> The price on this item is a real steal.  </li>
            <li> BUT folks should note there is fragrance added to this cream and it stings when put on especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see the benefit of this product for my skin.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t really greasy.</li>
            <li> I am 46 and have always had youthful looking and feeling skin thanks to my mother, but since moving to Colorado from Florida it has definitely been drier and more sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am planning to order  more  in the near  future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I buy this stuff at my local Dollar General where it is super cheap, and sometimes even goes on clearance.</li>
            <li> and wow!!!</li>
            <li> It absorbs right into your skin and keeps it soft.</li>
            <li> It is thick but soaks in quickly, and is great for dry winter skin (or anytime of the year).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it any other place that Amazon.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin softer and with a more even complexion, and has been working wonders in speeding up healing on other scrapes and bug bites as well.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck, and eye area at night only, because it is too rich to use under makeup.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer because it actually goes in and moisturizes the dry skin instead of disappearing but doesn&#x27;t leaving you sticky for hours the way my original natural shea butter does.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie at shopping on online and will maintain proper care to  take special attention.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t personally use it on my face as it contains mineral oil and that can clog pores, but I put it on my dry skin and it is amazing</li>
            <li> The jars are rather small, but for the cheap price offered on amazon, well worth it!</li>
            <li> Not too strong a scent, though, and while not particularly my cup of tea, it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li> Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E is a smooth soother for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I apply this cream after my shower and 24 hours later my skin still feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My main purpose in purchasing this Vitamin E cream was to see how it could help a scar I have</li>
            <li> A classic beauty --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found more results than I have from creams five times more expensive.</li>
            <li> This stuff is one of the few Aloe Vera creams that actually has a really good amount of aloe vera.</li>
            <li> Vaseline is not something a very near sighted person wants on their hands, even a speck of dirt on my glasses bothers me, so having something greasy on my hands was not something that I wanted to</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The amount you get and the high quality is why we have used this for years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who has had surgery where an incision is healing.</li>
            <li> (Yes I was using high quality sunscreen, reapplying as often as I could, and not using spray suncreen.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> The cream is great though, I use it to make a homemade body/face cream with a few other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Your face feels refreshed and young!!</li>
            <li> BOGO does not mean buy one get one in this case.</li>
            <li> This product is made in the USA and I am a big fan of keeping my money right here.</li>
            <li> He burned his face when a radiator cap popped off and the fluid flushed right into his face.  </li>
            <li> The light scent is pleasent, and is not as greasy as other vitamin E</li>
            <li> It made my skin very soft</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with excema problems when I use products that have alcohol in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son, who has very dry skin, has been using this product for several months; his skin looks healthy again.</li>
            <li> But it absorbs pretty quickly and does not leave that heavy feeling after it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 18, but I have been using this cream for over three years now after first picking it up at wal-mart.</li>
            <li> Nearly 3 days in advance!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Like the product, but Amazon&#x27;s price is double that of Walmart...should have checked Walmart first.  </li>
            <li> it was when it was a ridiculous bright fiery red.</li>
            <li> They no longer sell Vitamin E cream at my local pharmacies and I decided to try this new brand after seeing the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 2 months every night all over my abdomen and still am only maybe halfway through the first container.  </li>
            <li> I used this (applying liberally to the dry areas, rubbed it in a bit) right before bed and woke up</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my lifeguard bosses to either buy pure vitamin E capsules to break open and put on my skin after work, OR to buy this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have extremely itchy legs/arms.</li>
            <li> Physical therapist recommended will see if it really does what she said</li>
            <li> My brown spot is alittle lighter so now I can cover it with makeup and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always baby soft.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had ex boyfriends say they miss how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li> Finally purchased this very Vitamin E cream yesterday, applied it once</li>
            <li> It makes you feel soft and never drys out...</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> No complains so far.</li>
            <li> This product does not have ALL natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is not all natural.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed how soft my skin has become.</li>
            <li> My feet  feels soft;  </li>
            <li> tried several kinds of lotions and could not find anything that really helped.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read closely enough, or pay enough attention that it isn&#x27;t fragrance free or hypoallergenic and ended up irritating my sons skin even more.</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft and even living in a humid state</li>
            <li> Even on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> I use this on my body after a bath and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> In the interim I would recommend this product unless you are sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li> Your and face is just so soft, people keep telling me how soft my hands are.</li>
            <li> I use this on myself and my two year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re all surprised by it too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin baby soft; I am not kidding.</li>
            <li> We use this product frequently at our house.</li>
            <li> and my skin was soft, supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin so soft and it keeps the moisture in for days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this cream for a few days, but I am enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend, and also suggest that you only buy one package of it at first if you have sensitive skin and use just a little bit at first to check if you have an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently pregnant and it&#x27;s been such a dry winter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after looking for something to help reduce a scar on a healing facial wound, and it has since become my main lotion for face and body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived everywhere from the Arizona desert to New Hampshire&#x27;s icy mountains and this cream really works.  </li>
            <li> I have a jar that is over ten years old, and it still looks and smells and feels just like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> It has very little fragrance, and is light.</li>
            <li> You can also find it at Wal Mart for relatively cheap (usually on the bottom shelf).  </li>
            <li> I dont want to name names, but several companies tested very well including the brand my mom uses and several store brands.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that FotE don&#x27;t advertize more because everyone should know about this cream.  </li>
            <li> i used the lotion for everyday use but the cream for rough areas that need more maintenance like your legs/heel, face, elbow and hands.</li>
            <li> I have tried every major brand of moisturizer from Walgreen&#x27;s/Walmart/Target, etc.</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully applying this cream to my feet each night and have seem major results within just two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an expensive experiment and you&#x27;ll be glad you did!  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle smell to it and it totally makes my skin feel so smooth!  </li>
            <li> Dollar General carries it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 but have people regularly tell me I look like I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that only included natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Apparently, aloe makes your burn peel.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t perform any better than this - in fact, it performed worse.  </li>
            <li> I am used to a little bit of greasiness for my dry skin which is why I love nivea essentially enriched and their creme in the blue tin from Germany.</li>
            <li> I live in high altitude 7,000+ and this moisturizer sinks in without a greasy, gross feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to put up with it because it&#x27;s the only cream I ever used that both absorbs and still keeps surface skin extremely hydrated.</li>
            <li> Extremely inexpensive, super moisturizing, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Got it at the dollar store on a whim because my other cream, cetaphil, was feeling sticky and wasn&#x27;t absorbing well.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very soft and not as dry.  </li>
            <li> I think it must be the Vitamin E that is responsible for this, but I&#x27;ve never had any other product last like Fruit Of The Earth cream</li>
            <li> If you think your skin is dry, there is nothing thirstier than african-american natural non-chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> I will put on some of my eye creams or other expensive wrinkle creams, find they get absorbed so quickly  </li>
            <li> I noted right away that my heels went from being tough and scratchy to soft.</li>
            <li> I have to use 100% pure unrefined raw African Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> The heels of my feet were so dry that I was embrassed to go bare foot at yoga.</li>
            <li> but it is not that strong and probably would be fine with other less crazy people..</li>
            <li> With daily application my legs and arms felt much less itchy and very soft.</li>
            <li> I do admit I have sensitive skin but have used tons of other lotions, creams, etc.</li>
            <li> Cost is a little high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon, PLEASE keep carrying this product and shipping it quick (at least for Prime members)!</li>
            <li> I no longer have to scratch my back all day long.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty thick</li>
            <li> I can wear short skirts and not worry about my legs getting that scaly, dry look halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry that the skin would peel and turn red.</li>
            <li> This product is the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face steel dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> Use it once or twice a day and it definately helps with scars but as all all over moisturizer for body  for extra dry skin it didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> sounds bad but the plus side of this cream more then makes up for it!</li>
            <li> It took several months, but it continued to change eventually from a darker pink to a pink, almost beige-ish skin tone color several months later.</li>
            <li> It is the only face cream that keeps my chronic dry skin from flaking!  </li>
            <li> my skin was dry and red and since I have been useing fruit of the earth cream all my dry skin has vanished and the redness is gone.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the center of my back started itching, 24-7.  </li>
            <li> I basically have spent 6 dollars total just to find out the product is not what it advertised online and to return it.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mom who loves this product and has used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My husband works as a chef and is on his feet for long hours.</li>
            <li> One tub lasts a long time and it soothes my dry, chapped skin.</li>
            <li> The tubs come in a two pack so you can keep one and use the other one as a stocking stuffer because thay last.</li>
            <li> Definitely plan on buying this from Amazon and other parties from this time on.</li>
            <li> My feet have  always been dry  and  have  used  other products  such as  coconut cream  and others  </li>
            <li> I used this cream during my last pregnancy and didn&#x27;t have a single strech mark (on my stomach - wish I&#x27;d used it other places, too).</li>
            <li> It helped my dry skin a lot.</li>
            <li> One day, I googled this concern and found an article stating that dry skin could be the problem.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to this because I had dry cracked toes from wearing my flip-flops all the time.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by a nurse to help cure my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion works fantastically around my eyes where in the winter months my eyes often suffer from severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> A+ for healing dry cracked feet and hands too.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so irritated and dry this winter.  </li>
            <li> My husband was complaining of dry skin too on his face and body.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to use as a cream on my sons dry face, but also to apply to a scar he has on his cheek.</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders on my dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I get terribly dry skin in the winter, and this helped alleviate the dry itchy skin i sometimes get.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing extremely dry and flaky skin around my eyebrows and nose, and used all sorts of products and lotions.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t have to waste money trying more expensive things that just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I try and buy products that have limited chemicals and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> My neck was starting to look a little creapy, and now it is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!  </li>
            <li> I also have chiggers in my back yard and don&#x27;t want to spray or put down poison since I have a dog.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin and have tried just about everything, this works!</li>
            <li> I usually find it only in Wal-Mart but even my local one didn&#x27;t have it this time.  </li>
            <li> but I found the same thing after for half the price at Meijer.</li>
            <li> I also rub a little extra on my dry hands at night which has seemed to help.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for my very dry skin on legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and psoriasis</li>
            <li> My boss gave this to me because I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> We both have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone living in a dry climate; at only $3.50 or so for a jar, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I bought it to work on a nasty cat scratch, and it did it&#x27;d job well, but it has been great as a face and body moisturizer, too.</li>
            <li> I assume I am in my early 30s or late 20s.  </li>
            <li> I used this daily after surgery and found it to be  soothing for dried skin and smoothing for scars.  </li>
            <li> that flaky  rough feeling  </li>
            <li> I would and have spent over a hundred dollars on a 2.5 oz jar of cream from a department store.  </li>
            <li> I have TERRIBLY DRY SKIN!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m alabaster pale, and was born a red head, AND I was taking a medication that warned against being in the sun because of increased sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> On the other end of the scale was a company that claimed to have 100,000 IUs and in reality they had almost no E at all.</li>
            <li> Results are noticeable after one use and with daily use the difference is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> In the ingredients section ( which they do not advertise on the selling page) there is perfume, cetyl alcohol, and other products I can not pronounce.</li>
            <li> , this has other things like aloe.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer, I don&#x27;t have to apply as much as other products.</li>
            <li> Among other ingredients it contains propylene glycol and methyl paraben.</li>
            <li> I am very careful not to have the lotion enter the orbital area.  </li>
            <li> I started using it after my mom told me it was her secret for looking so young and by god it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for quite a few years; I discovered it when I was living in Colorado at 6,000+ feet, where the air is VERY dry in winter.  </li>
            <li> I bought some for my daughter because she suffered with Eczema so badly, and it made her skin baby smooth.</li>
            <li> I have seriously troubled skin thanks to years of acne and  </li>
            <li> My complaint is that it does make my skin a bit red.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would help keep my skin moisturized, wouldn&#x27;t clog, and would also help with dark spots (from acne).</li>
            <li> It smells good and isn&#x27;t terribly greasy.  </li>
            <li> and of course it was half price on Amazon....can you believe $1.50 for a miracle in a jar?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used previously.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a week and a half and my arms and chest where I have applied</li>
            <li> Unlike other expensive products that I&#x27;ve tried, this cream keeps my skin soft without the hefty price tag.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very cold and windy where we live and her cheeks get very dry, red and look like they&#x27;re cracking.</li>
            <li> I tried this when a friend of mine recommended it to me after I complained of chronic dry skin after I moved to a drier climate.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has very little scent, so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with other scented items I might be wearing/using.  </li>
            <li> I found this (originally) at a little corner drug store one day and figured \\&quot;what the heck</li>
            <li> I found that it has a tendency to be a little greasy</li>
            <li> I mix this with a little sunscreen for the day and have been doing so for about 8 months.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a little sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fruit of the Earth for a few months now as a night cream and to see if it might lighten a brown sun spot I have on my face</li>
            <li> Fruit of the Earth Cream works well restoring dried skin.  </li>
            <li> Even in the few days I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday under my make-up,  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li> I felt icky and slimey in the humidity because it&#x27;s thick, but it&#x27;s the only thing that brought me relief.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re as pale as I am, you&#x27;ll burn.)  </li>
            <li> I plan to use both to tame my mane.</li>
            <li> This is my step down, and now I just use the hard stuff for a mask when I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> There are some ingredients that are a little questionable  to me but not enough to stop me from using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick but not at all greasy or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I noted that some had very little vitamin E in them and Fruit</li>
            <li> I have eczyma and it is hard for me to find lotions that do not act harshly to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked by how fast the shipping was.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s in there</li>
            <li> I have used this for the past 50 years and</li>
            <li> probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product otherwise, because I don&#x27;t even see the Vit E units mentioned on the jar so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a small amount.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve peeled in the past without this stuff).  </li>
            <li> She did mention that some patients could not tolerate it, apparently a small percentage of people are allergic to something in this cream.</li>
            <li> I keep jars of it everywhere and have a small bottle of it in my purse.</li>
            <li> Usually it would take about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the Vitamin E contents since there&#x27;s no label</li>
            <li> Its a pleasure to put this product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Not oily not overwhelmingly perfumed...and</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past ten years, it is is difficult to find a Vit E with no fragance.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin from looking so bad as you get older.</li>
            <li> It soothes my skin from the damage cold, dry air causes during our harsh Michigan winters.</li>
            <li> All the stores in our area have stopped carrying this time with was a hard blow for my mother.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to find in retail drugstore/grocery chains.  </li>
            <li> His heels were really hard and his toes so chapped from air mot getting to his feet.</li>
            <li> It just got pulled from Kmart; at least I can&#x27;t find it there anymore.</li>
            <li> It actually was causing my scar and the surrounding skin to itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> Softness for my delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> When I put the cream on my hands they stay off my lap for at least 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Thick and creamer and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li> I found this product too thick for my taste.</li>
            <li> I mean, there is not once trace of scaring whatsoever from his burns.  </li>
            <li> I feel so bad that after using it for 3 days my skin turned red with small bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li> Seriously moisturizes my face.</li>
            <li> but it is not good to use it on your face .</li>
            <li> Not good if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I developed eczema late in life (over 55) and I have always hated putting on creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> Since my skin was making me absolutely miserable, between the eczema, dry skin from the winter, and thin skin from age and numerous courses of treatment with steroids, I felt I had nothing to lose by trying this cream.</li>
            <li> Which sucks!</li>
            <li> I also put it on my face when I&#x27;m going to be outside in very cold</li>
            <li> no more chigger bites!!</li>
            <li> It is truly helpful and I am grateful that painful skin tears and ugly bruising is MUCH reduced.</li>
            <li> I work in nursing homes and the clients who have thin skin always have problems with bruising and skin tears.  </li>
            <li> I use this cream as a base for a pain cream that I make with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> People are always asking me my secret</li>
            <li> Sorry for the negative review</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin and hate using lotions on my face because of the oiliness and shine.  </li>
            <li> I almost bought this product on amazon, but it is less than $4 for a two-pack at Walmart - over $10 for this is crazy!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a tough critic and he approved!  </li>
            <li> I thought it was expensive because it worked so well.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> so I randomly picked this cream</li>
            <li> I was using a Bath &amp; Body Works foot cream until it got too expensive for my budget, so I&#x27;d switched to a store brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is difficult to find in stores!  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product!  </li>
            <li> and some very expensive products from Dillard&#x27;s and Ulta.</li>
            <li> Living in a northern climate we all suffer from chapped hands and the painful cracks that go with the chapping.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed, but still works</li>
            <li> I usually hate scented creams</li>
            <li> I hate scents on creams and this has a scent which makes me a bit nuts</li>
            <li> Use it as a base before I apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base cream and add a tablespoon of cold-pressed sea buckthorn oil per jar.  </li>
            <li> and I was fearful that it would bother me...</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have purchased creams before and the way that they were packaged was horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> feels good on skin and don&#x27;t need much. I mix with coconut oil. :) awesome! Your face feels refreshed and young!!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of vitamin E, mixes well with my lotion for a great winter skin treatment.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try after I seen a lady put 8 of the 2 packs in her cart at Walmart.      I have naturally dry skin and hate using lotions on my face because of the oiliness and shine.  This product feels so light and makes your skin lighter.  The rest of the lotions I have tried make my skin look darker.  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, this is a solid product!  I wish I had found out about this sooner.  I now keep one of the bottles in my car in case I forget to put it on in the morning &#x3D;).  TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 18, but I have been using this cream for over three years now after first picking it up at wal-mart. I have seriously troubled skin thanks to years of acne and  the topical lotions I had to put on them. I&#x27;ve found that this stuff helped to smooth out my skin and that it kept it very moisturized. I plan on using this in the future too because it doesn&#x27;t break me out &amp; it is seriously cheap. My complaint is that it does make my skin a bit red. The redness lasts several hours after application. Thus, I can only apply this at night, shortly before going to bed. When I wake up in the morning, however, my skin looks dewy and wonderful! Also, it refuses to fully absorb into my skin, leaving an oily residue on the surface which I can literally rub off with my fingers...sounds bad but the plus side of this cream more then makes up for it!</li>
            <li> wife uses it and is happy</li>
            <li> My mother first introduced me to this lotion (I use it mainly for hands) and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  It goes on with a very light smell and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve introduced several people to it over the years and everyone seems to love it.  Amazon is a great place to buy it in these 2 pack sizes and with a great, low price.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It helped my dry skin a lot.</li>
            <li> Unlike other expensive products that I&#x27;ve tried, this cream keeps my skin soft without the hefty price tag. You definitely get a good bang for your buck with this cream.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the center of my back started itching, 24-7.  I was always reaching back to scratch my back because of this.  One day, I googled this concern and found an article stating that dry skin could be the problem.  I had never considered this, but since  I never applied cream to this area, it made sense.  I had some Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E cream that I had never used in my bathroom closet.  I started putting this on my back and noticed immediate relief.  I no longer have to scratch my back all day long.  It feels so creamy on the skin and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I work in nursing homes and the clients who have thin skin always have problems with bruising and skin tears.  The nurses use this product daily on these clients, their arms and legs especially, and the skin thickens, lessening the bruising and skin tears.  It is truly helpful and I am grateful that painful skin tears and ugly bruising is MUCH reduced.</li>
            <li> Been using this cream for about two years. Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t smell , I would recommend this cream for anybody who likes to keep their skim moist without any fancy smells lol. Simple but effective.</li>
            <li> I am an african-american who has started using this stuff in my hair. If you think your skin is dry, there is nothing thirstier than african-american natural non-chemically treated hair. While doing web-researching I noticed a lot of people of all races using the FOTE aloe vera gel to control frizziness. I plan to use both to tame my mane. This stuff is so awesome. I think I will also take some reviewers advice and use it as a facial moisturizer and see how that works. There are some ingredients that are a little questionable  to me but not enough to stop me from using this product. Compared to all of the excreted drugs in our drinking water (yuck) this stuff is very mild.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this. The fragrance made her face itch and she had to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will work on burns and such. Be great if it didn&#x27;t have fragrance. Not sure why it&#x27;s in there if you use this on burns and such.</li>
            <li> Physical therapist recommended will see if it really does what she said</li>
            <li> This product is an amazing moisturizer, without a heavy perfume scent. It is thick but soaks in quickly, and is great for dry winter skin (or anytime of the year).</li>
            <li> had I known this product included mineral oil i would not have made the purchase. not only because mineral oil is NOT a natural ingredient (it&#x27;s petroleum based), but the jury is out on how good it is for our skin; soak a saltine cracker in mineral oil overnight.   anyway, I LOVE that this product is made in the USA and the \\&quot;value\\&quot; of it, but for me, I would NOT buy it again.   Further, I was expecting a gel, and it was a white cream. Probably my mistake.   I got wrapped up in the great reviews, so I wanted to follow up w/ my own in case other people out there were/ are like me.</li>
            <li> Same as the vitamin E in the tube. Excellent fot Wrinkles, bruises and other skin problems with no lacerations.</li>
            <li> I have tried every major brand of moisturizer from Walgreen&#x27;s/Walmart/Target, etc. and some very expensive products from Dillard&#x27;s and Ulta. I found this (originally) at a little corner drug store one day and figured \\&quot;what the heck, it&#x27;s only $3.00\\&quot;  My skin is 100% different now. I am 46 and have always had youthful looking and feeling skin thanks to my mother, but since moving to Colorado from Florida it has definitely been drier and more sensitive. I apply this cream after my shower and 24 hours later my skin still feels soft and smooth. When the original jar was gone I immediately went to Amazon.com to look for more and of course it was half price on Amazon....can you believe $1.50 for a miracle in a jar? I can wear short skirts and not worry about my legs getting that scaly, dry look halfway through the day. This is the best cream I have EVER used without a doubt! Bonus: This product is made in the USA and I am a big fan of keeping my money right here.</li>
            <li> I bought it to work on a nasty cat scratch, and it did it&#x27;d job well, but it has been great as a face and body moisturizer, too.</li>
            <li> The VITAMIN E CREAM is just wonderful as I do not use makeup. Just the cream on my face. I have used this for the past 50 years and I&lt;br /&gt;do not have any wrinkles  to speak of. I am 82 years old and look good. I used to be able to buy the VITAMIN E CREAM in any of the stores. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it any other place that Amazon. Thank you. Nancy Bush</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It helps moisturize my skin and it leaves it feeling fresh!!!</li>
            <li> My mother has used vitamin E cream for as long as I can remember so as part of a university project I purchased many E creams to analyze for vitamin E content. She had always wondered if it was possible to confirm that what she was using realy had 28,000 IUs of E in it. I noted that some had very little vitamin E in them and Fruit Of The Earth fell into that category. In laymans terms there is a couple of drops of E between these two jars.    If you want an effective vitamin E cream look for one that tells you what you are getting in I.U.s and as a refference point one ounce of vitamin E is 28,000 I.U.s (International Units) I may at some point poste the results for all of the products I tested and if I do I&#x27;ll post another review and include the results for every brand.    I dont want to name names, but several companies tested very well including the brand my mom uses and several store brands. On the other end of the scale was a company that claimed to have 100,000 IUs and in reality they had almost no E at all. So the moral of the story is read the labels.</li>
            <li> Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E is a smooth soother for dry skin. The pleasant texture has a light silky feel with a nice fragrance that is not overbearing. What a pleasing price and super value.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this because I had dry cracked toes from wearing my flip-flops all the time.  I thought it was expensive because it worked so well.  But happily, I learned it is cheap priced but a very good product for softening hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. The heels of my feet were so dry that I was embrassed to go bare foot at yoga. I have been faithfully applying this cream to my feet each night and have seem major results within just two weeks. I have now started using it as a night cream on my face too. I keep a jar on my night table and one at work so I can use it during the day on my hands. Great product. Give it a try you cannot go wrong. Great price especially for the double pack.</li>
            <li> Works well, but I think there was a change to it&#x27;s ingredients. Still works great for my skin and dryness, but the older container I had before I bought this from amazon didn&#x27;t burn my face after washing/scrubbing it, and these new ones did. Disappointed, but still works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually head over heals for this product. I&#x27;m not fond of the smell though but I use it in conjunction with Coconut Oil. I feel ridiculously smooth after. It did fade some of my stretch mark COLOR but not the texture of it. It is pretty thick so a little goes a long way. I found it at Wal-Mart for around $4 so I would maybe check your local store beforehand.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fruit of the Earth for a few months now as a night cream and to see if it might lighten a brown sun spot I have on my face and I have to say this stuff is amazing !!! My brown spot is alittle lighter so now I can cover it with makeup and my skin is so soft. I love this stuff and I use it twice a day morning and night. I have also noticed that is helps with cracked heals. 5 STARS all the way !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for about 8 years. I started using it after my mom told me it was her secret for looking so young and by god it works! For the price you just can&#x27;t beat it. Its a staple in my home. I use it on my face every morning and at night and I have yet to find another product that works as well. Its not greasy feeling and absorbs right into the skin. Its very moisturizing without leaving your skin feeling heavy. The cream has a nice thick consistency but when you apply it it absorbs perfect. I consider it my miracle product. I use it over Olay regenerist serum and the two products work wonders together. I&#x27;m 32 but have people regularly tell me I look like I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s. LOVE LOVE LOVE this cream! I would be heartbroken if they ever stopped making it.  Also, it&#x27;s made in the USA and when you read the ingredients, there&#x27;s practically nothing in it that&#x27;s chemically and you don&#x27;t know what the heck it is. Most ingredients are plant based and clearly this company got everything perfect with this product. It really is a super value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived everywhere from the Arizona desert to New Hampshire&#x27;s icy mountains and this cream really works.  I keep giving tubs of it to friends and family so they don&#x27;t have to waste money trying more expensive things that just don&#x27;t work.  One reviewer didn&#x27;t like the vitamin E content but it&#x27;s really about balance.  I&#x27;ve tried slathering straight E oil on my skin and it&#x27;s just gross.  My only complaint is that FotE don&#x27;t advertize more because everyone should know about this cream.  I use it immediately after a shower or bath and I&#x27;m always baby soft.    I&#x27;ve even had ex boyfriends say they miss how soft my skin is.  If you&#x27;re unsure just try it.  It&#x27;s not an expensive experiment and you&#x27;ll be glad you did!  The tubs come in a two pack so you can keep one and use the other one as a stocking stuffer because thay last.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Couldn&#x27;t find it in any store!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My husband and I have used it for the last 8 years. We go to Walmart every year or two to buy 10 jars of this cream. (they come in packs of two). It is a perfect creamy consistency, and no scent.    I almost bought this product on amazon, but it is less than $4 for a two-pack at Walmart - over $10 for this is crazy!</li>
            <li> Does nothing for my very dry skin on legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I needed something else so I could of get free shipping so I randomly picked this cream and it&#x27;s so good! I love too put this cream on my face after laser hair removal I&#x27;ve had it for over 3 months now and I love it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Wife loves this stuff and we&#x27;re ordering more.</li>
            <li> All the stores in our area have stopped carrying this time with was a hard blow for my mother. I found this on Amazon and got wonderful service. The amount you get and the high quality is why we have used this for years. Definitely plan on buying this from Amazon and other parties from this time on.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I use it several times a day. It makes you face so moist and youthful looking.  I will put on some of my eye creams or other expensive wrinkle creams, find they get absorbed so quickly  that I  then generously put this cream on and gently massage it into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Fruit of the Earth Cream works well restoring dried skin.  I used this daily after surgery and found it to be  soothing for dried skin and smoothing for scars.  It works well on sun kissed skin, or for hands after household chores.&lt;br /&gt;The first jar was a gift, so after not finding another locally I was pleased to order through Amazon. The price was right and shipped in two days.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamer and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin and have tried just about everything, this works! I have started using this as a night cream as it seems to also heal my skin. My skin was so dry that the skin would peel and turn red. Now it is much better and I also use it under foundation</li>
            <li> I learned about the benefits of vitamin E cream about 20 years ago when my brother had an accident.  He burned his face when a radiator cap popped off and the fluid flushed right into his face.  After coming back from the hospital with a severe burn, the doctors recommended to him to use vitamin e cream once his scabs fell off.  It worked miraculously!  I mean, there is not once trace of scaring whatsoever from his burns.  I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully since then and now that I have my own child, I use this on my boy whenever he falls and develops a scrape here and there.    This is an incredible value!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and it makes my skin feel so healthy and nourished. It&#x27;s pretty thick but not at all greasy or unpleasant. I&#x27;ve recently begun thinning it out with a little aloe vera gel and it works wonderfully. I will never stop using this cream as a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Extremely inexpensive, super moisturizing, and long lasting. I have keratosis pilaris (&amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) on the back of my arms, and my dermatologist said I would need to find a simple, incredibly moisturizing lotion to use (he suggested a prescription balm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Fruit of the Earth! After using this for about a month I noticed my KP dramatically diminished. If I&#x27;m diligent about using it generously daily, it all but disappears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, PLEASE keep carrying this product and shipping it quick (at least for Prime members)!</li>
            <li> I have face allergies. This product is the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face steel dry and scaly. I wish it were sold in more stores. It just got pulled from Kmart; at least I can&#x27;t find it there anymore. So I guess amazon it is.</li>
            <li> My main purpose in purchasing this Vitamin E cream was to see how it could help a scar I have (injury was Jan 2013). It is so so so red. Several months ago I tried Mederma, I used it for 1 month in March, twice daily. It made NO difference. It actually was causing my scar and the surrounding skin to itch like crazy. I was very disappointed. My scar looked the same as it did before trying Mederma.  Finally purchased this very Vitamin E cream yesterday, applied it once and what do you know... not even a day later and my scar is no longer bright red, it&#x27;s pinkish. I am amazed! I can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use of Vitamin E cream will do.  I am so amazed with it that I intend to use this as my everyday cream for my whole body.  I would definitely recommend this cream.  Edit: Every day my scar looked better and better. It took several months, but it continued to change eventually from a darker pink to a pink, almost beige-ish skin tone color several months later. The scar is there, always will be, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out like the eye-sore it was when it was a ridiculous bright fiery red. I now use it as a body lotion as well. I noted right away that my heels went from being tough and scratchy to soft. I don&#x27;t use it on my face though as it tended to leave it shiny. I would definitely recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> This vitamin cream is moderately priced and very light and non greasy. Also, no animal testing is a great plus.</li>
            <li> my skin was dry and red and since I have been useing fruit of the earth cream all my dry skin has vanished and the redness is gone. Im so greatful to have found your product and I hope one day you will come up with the fruit of the earth vitamin e body wash to. I have ordered your fruit of the earth vitamin e foam wash and the sunscreen to. Im waiting for the order to get here and cannot wait to start useing the products. thank you</li>
            <li> A classic beauty -- my mother used it, I use it. Don&#x27;t ever change the ingredients, or stop making it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after looking for something to help reduce a scar on a healing facial wound, and it has since become my main lotion for face and body. It smells a bit like I remember my grandmother smelling - a very potent lotion smell - but it still doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or clog my pores. It leaves my skin softer and with a more even complexion, and has been working wonders in speeding up healing on other scrapes and bug bites as well.</li>
            <li> excellent. not greasy, makes your skin glow. what more can you ask for in a lotion?</li>
            <li> This stuff is a gift from the heavens because not only do you get a two-pack for a great price, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t clog pores and makes your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very fair and very sensitive; it breaks out from the simplest of exposures. I needed something that would help keep my skin moisturized, wouldn&#x27;t clog, and would also help with dark spots (from acne). This is my go-to product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my surgical scar. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Shipping faster than expected&lt;br /&gt;Thx.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. One tub lasts a long time and it soothes my dry, chapped skin. I feel an immediate improvement as soon as I apply! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was visiting my mom while on vacation and had left my Vitamin E cream at home.  I have painfully dry, cracked heels and soles, to the point I can&#x27;t wear socks in the winter unless I glob on a good, rich cream first. I was using a Bath &amp; Body Works foot cream until it got too expensive for my budget, so I&#x27;d switched to a store brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom brought out a jar of this Fruit of the Earth cream which she&#x27;d gotten for a dollar at a local discount store.  I&#x27;d never heard of it, but what a surprise.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it softened my feet, almost to the point of eliminating the cracks &amp; splits in my skin in just 5 days.  We couldn&#x27;t find it again in local stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product otherwise, because I don&#x27;t even see the Vit E units mentioned on the jar so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a small amount. Whatever is in the mix, though, it just works...better than the 28,000 units Vitamin E cream I&#x27;d used previously.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the online reviews, although I purchased it at my local grocery.  It made my skin very soft and I was really loving it, but then I contacted the company to find out how much vitamin E was in it, as it wasn&#x27;t specified on the label. Valarie at Fruit of the Earth informed me that the company \\&quot;under no circumstances\\&quot; would release the vitamin E content of their \\&quot;vitamin E\\&quot; cream, as it was proprietary information.  Needless to say, I found that suspicious enough to prevent me from buying any more of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I have been using it for at least 20 years. I discovered it first when I was a downhill skier. It has great absorption, I use it on my face, neck and hands and it has kept me looking, I think, 10 years younger! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I stumbled onto this product years ago and think it&#x27;s the best. It makes you feel soft and never drys out...although not greasy. I even use it as a facial moisturizer and people comment on how nice my complexion is as I don&#x27;t use makeup over it...only add mascara. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has had surgery where an incision is healing. It works great as it doesn&#x27;t make the area itch. I brought the jar to the doctors and she was quite impressed with the ingredients and said she would recommend this product to other patients. I give it A+++</li>
            <li> WOW THIS IS THE \\&quot;BEST\\&quot; I LOVE THIS Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E Skin Care Cream I ORDER 5 BECUSE EVERY ONE ALWAYS IN MY STUFF SO NOW I HAVE ALOT LOL&lt;br /&gt;YES IT&#x27;S THAT GOOD! ;) Recommended</li>
            <li> This is the bomb! Got it at the dollar store on a whim because my other cream, cetaphil, was feeling sticky and wasn&#x27;t absorbing well. The fragrance is like cocoa butter/sunflower, it glides on easily, absorbs well and my skin is super soft. I usually hate scented creams but I&#x27;m willing to put up with it because it&#x27;s the only cream I ever used that both absorbs and still keeps surface skin extremely hydrated. This is great for all seasons, on body and face, and all ages. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or melty, it doesn&#x27;t irrirate, and actually it&#x27;s very soothing. I&#x27;m so glad Dollar General carries it but if they stop, I will order here since FOTE products really aren&#x27;t found in many stores. Which sucks! Love this cream!</li>
            <li> Chip and good I used for more than 30 years</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon recommended vitamin e cream for scar healing.  I ordered this and am very pleased with the results.  6 weeks out and looking good!</li>
            <li> Recommended by a nurse to help cure my dry skin.  This cream is wonderful.  Can&#x27;t say enough about how really good it is.  Results are noticeable after one use and with daily use the difference is unbelievable.  Blends into the skin well, not greasy, can be used under makeup.  Just purchased several jars and gave as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for quite a few years; I discovered it when I was living in Colorado at 6,000+ feet, where the air is VERY dry in winter.  This cream is not greasy, and is well-absorbed by the skin.  I like the fact that it has very little scent, so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with other scented items I might be wearing/using.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone living in a dry climate; at only $3.50 or so for a jar, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years.  The price was right.  The packaging was fine.  I was totally happy!  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My Mather always use this</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I live in high altitude 7,000+ and this moisturizer sinks in without a greasy, gross feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered it off of amazon several times and one time, th plastic lid chipped and lotion went everywhere. Amazon replaced it quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been trying so many drugstore and some high end mostrizers for years now.And this is absolutely amazing product.Its been 3 months i have been using this product for day and night/No complains so far.Mosturizes pretty good doesnt leave you greasy.It did work for me pretty well!And its so inexpensive come one cant beat that!</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend she loves it uses it for elbows, knees, hands great product</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that only included natural ingredients. This product does not have ALL natural ingredients. In the ingredients section ( which they do not advertise on the selling page) there is perfume, cetyl alcohol, and other products I can not pronounce. It is not all natural. I have very sensitive skin with excema problems when I use products that have alcohol in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - to return the item, they make you pay the shipping fee. I basically have spent 6 dollars total just to find out the product is not what it advertised online and to return it. I would have liked to know that the product included OTHER ingredients. They only mention vitamin e, aloe vera, wheat germ, sunflower seed oil, collagen and elastin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not pleased.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mom who loves this product and has used it for a long time.  Great for skin of all ages.</li>
            <li> The fruit of the earth vitamin E cream absorbs wells,hydrates,is inexpensive and has helped heal my face from a recent chemical peel.</li>
            <li> I still think is Jergen&#x27;s lotion repackaged. It smells awesome and it&#x27;s creamy smooth, not oily at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering and I love this product. I have very dry skin and psoriasis and this softens my skin very well. I primarily use is on spots of my face, hands, elbows, and feet. I will be ordering again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Years of working with solvents, oil, gas and greases have made my hands pretty beat up and this helps better than anything else I have found and I have tried EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> Good cream for the face, although it doesn&#x27;t remove wrinkles.  It absorbs right into your skin and keeps it soft.</li>
            <li> I have eczyma and it is hard for me to find lotions that do not act harshly to my skin.  This lotion works fantastically around my eyes where in the winter months my eyes often suffer from severely dry skin.  I am very careful not to have the lotion enter the orbital area.  Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I used to work as a lifeguard in Daytona Beach, Florida for 8 hours a day in straight sun and water reflecting the sun.  I&#x27;m alabaster pale, and was born a red head, AND I was taking a medication that warned against being in the sun because of increased sensitivity.  I&#x27;m telling you.... I had sun poisoning, blisters, etc. BUT I NEVER peeled because of this stuff.  (I&#x27;ve peeled in the past without this stuff).  It was recommended to me by my lifeguard bosses to either buy pure vitamin E capsules to break open and put on my skin after work, OR to buy this stuff.  Apparently, aloe makes your burn peel.  Vitamin E keeps you from looking like a lizard who is shedding.  I would get home from work, take a shower, then slather this stuff on every part of my skin.  Granted I felt icky and slimey in the humidity because it&#x27;s thick, but it&#x27;s the only thing that brought me relief.  (Yes I was using high quality sunscreen, reapplying as often as I could, and not using spray suncreen.  When you&#x27;re as pale as I am, you&#x27;ll burn.)  Try it!  It&#x27;s amazing CHEAP stuff.  Please, never ever stop making this stuff!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the bottom line: This product actually works.  It&#x27;s not too greasy.  It outlasts a hand washing or two.  It takes good care of dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> This cream is great, I use before bed and I have noticed how soft my skin has become. I love this vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li> So Smooth!  Love it! Several applications per day are necessary and it works!&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles disappear! Immediately and so smooth. This is a hit!</li>
            <li> This cream lacks the offensive smells so prevalent among skin creams.  It&#x27;s soothing without being greasy. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to find in retail drugstore/grocery chains.  If anyone knows of alternate sources, please post a reply.</li>
            <li> This  product...Fruit of the Earth  Vit. E  Cream  is really  super!  I have  a  jar  in the  bathroom  and  at my bedside  table.  I  put  liberal  amount of cream  on  my  feet  and  on  my hands  every  night  and  immediately  after  I take  a shower.  My feet have  always been dry  and  have  used  other products  such as  coconut cream  and others  but this product  has  worked  wonders  for me.  My feet  feels soft;  that flaky  rough feeling  on  my  feet  is  gone  after  using this cream  for  almost a week.  Vit.  E. seems to have  done the job.  The  price  too...is  simply  SUPER.  I am planning to order  more  in the near  future.</li>
            <li> Purchased for walmart and was very excited to use this after my shower. As an all over body moisturizer I didn&#x27;t feel like it moisturized very well. It wasn&#x27;t greasy which I think was the problem for me anyway bc I am used to a little bit of greasiness for my dry skin which is why I love nivea essentially enriched and their creme in the blue tin from Germany. But I definately recommend this product for those who r looking for fading scars. Mys cars are from exzema. Use it once or twice a day and it definately helps with scars but as all all over moisturizer for body  for extra dry skin it didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> Great product - hard to find.  This is convenient - I&#x27;ll order hear again.  Good price and works well for face and skin care.</li>
            <li> This cream is great.  It has softened my skin and is not greasy. A+ for healing dry cracked feet and hands too.</li>
            <li> My boss gave this to me because I have very dry skin. She said that it was a great product. I found that it has a tendency to be a little greasy but it does a great job. But it absorbs pretty quickly and does not leave that heavy feeling after it absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also kind of scared on how they were going to ship it. I have purchased creams before and the way that they were packaged was horrible. This was packaged perfectly so they did not get squished in the shipment process.</li>
            <li> I would say great but I was looking for Vitamin E cream ONLY, this has other things like aloe. I had a Vitamin E cream that I loved and is almost gone, so I was trying to buy similar. I hate scents on creams and this has a scent which makes me a bit nuts but it is not that strong and probably would be fine with other less crazy people.. lol</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to find in stores!  I usually find it only in Wal-Mart but even my local one didn&#x27;t have it this time.  Amazon to the rescue!!  It is the only face cream that keeps my chronic dry skin from flaking!  I have tried many other products - from Olay to Clinique and many others.  And still - this is the one I rely upon to do the job!!</li>
            <li> Softness for my delicate skin.  Who knew this would work?  My skin has been so irritated and dry this winter.  I tried many creams and lotions.  Some would not work and others just gave me rashes.  Enter this gem.  Soothing all the way.  The scent is very light and I was fearful that it would bother me... and it didn&#x27;t.  It obviously has vitamin e but the other ingredients are awesome - collagen, elastin, vitamin a, coconut oil, wheat germ - just a great blend in just the right porportions to heal my skin.  I would and have spent over a hundred dollars on a 2.5 oz jar of cream from a department store.  And you know what?  It didn&#x27;t perform any better than this - in fact, it performed worse.  My husband was complaining of dry skin too on his face and body.  He will not put anything frou-frou girly on himself but I showed him this cream in the utilitarian packaging and let him smell the fragrance and he said okay - I put some on him and he went &amp;#34;Ahhhhhh.&amp;#34;  He&#x27;s a tough critic and he approved!  So get this for your boyfriends too - it&#x27;s good for everyone!  Girls who want to save money and have beautiful skin for life... run and get this... stock up!</li>
            <li> My husband and I can&#x27;t get enough of this. We put it on after showering to lock in moisture. I&#x27;ve seen an improvement on both of our complexions.</li>
            <li> I developed eczema late in life (over 55) and I have always hated putting on creams and lotions. My dermatologist told me to put Vaseline on my hands and wear cotton gloves to bed. Vaseline is not something a very near sighted person wants on their hands, even a speck of dirt on my glasses bothers me, so having something greasy on my hands was not something that I wanted to do.&lt;br /&gt;I tried several kinds of lotions and could not find anything that really helped. I was cleaning out the cabinet in my bathroom and found a jar of this in there. Since my skin was making me absolutely miserable, between the eczema, dry skin from the winter, and thin skin from age and numerous courses of treatment with steroids, I felt I had nothing to lose by trying this cream. Even the very first night that I put it on after my shower brought me some relief, regardless of what amount of vitamin E or other ingredients are in this cream, to me it is a pleasant and soothing way to treat my skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned trying this cream to a friend that also has eczema, and she told me in the burn unit, where she works as a nurse, they use the Fruit of the Earth cream on many of the burn patients! She did mention that some patients could not tolerate it, apparently a small percentage of people are allergic to something in this cream. I do have very sensitive skin, and I feel lucky that I am able to use this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend, and also suggest that you only buy one package of it at first if you have sensitive skin and use just a little bit at first to check if you have an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I use this cream as a base for a pain cream that I make with essential oils.  I like that the cream is not greasy, like a salve, but rubs in nice.  Even after adding in all the oils, the scent of the cream overpowers the oils.  I wish it came in unscented, and the lotion scent is strong.  The cream works very well, and leaves skin very soft, and it is a great price.</li>
            <li> I have TERRIBLY DRY SKIN!! I have to moisturize daily! I have to use 100% pure unrefined raw African Shea Butter. Except, it is very sticky, and it makes me like a walking piece of sticky fly paper. When I walk by the cat I can feel the cat hair flying my way and attaching to my face! Finally, I found this! This is my step down, and now I just use the hard stuff for a mask when I go to sleep. This is my favorite moisturizer because it actually goes in and moisturizes the dry skin instead of disappearing but doesn&#x27;t leaving you sticky for hours the way my original natural shea butter does. Good stuff, I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great skin cream, rubs in good and not greasy or sticky feeling.  Would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I added this to my purchase of the lotion. This product to me is OK.. the cream feels nice but it is not good to use it on your face .</li>
            <li> This vitamin e cream was a great price, is made in the USA, and goes on nicely, but the fragrance is overpowering. I ended up throwing it away. Wish they had an unscented version.</li>
            <li> We use this every day as a cream for scars and as a moisturizer. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it! It has a subtle smell to it and it totally makes my skin feel so smooth!  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face,  but it says you can!</li>
            <li> I use this as an extra ingredient in the hand and body cream I make for the the winter, it has extra moisturizing, soothing properties to heal and keep skin supple during the winter - summer too.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have extremely itchy legs/arms. With daily application my legs and arms felt much less itchy and very soft.</li>
            <li> love it.. it is more concentrated than the lotion which is also great. i used the lotion for everyday use but the cream for rough areas that need more maintenance like your legs/heel, face, elbow and hands. great product.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion as my daily lotion and LOVE it. I used to buy this at Walmart but since then I haven&#x27;t found it there. Luckily amazon sells it. I try and buy products that have limited chemicals and this fits the bill. This keeps my skin hydrated without ever being overly greasy and over time has reduced redness in my skin. I mix this with a little sunscreen for the day and have been doing so for about 8 months. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotion with this and is very good</li>
            <li> Love the vitamin e cream. Service was fast!</li>
            <li> I bought this Vit. E cream to use on my scars from my total knee replacements for both knees.  The scars are fading at a nice pace with regular applications.  I also use the cream on my face regularly and I see a nice difference regarding the smoothness and healthful appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I Luv this cream ..... After a shower I use it on my face and neck But most of all I use it on my Tattoo&#x27;s  color stays nice and the art work is soft feeling</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite.. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else especially at the price I get. Love this product and use it often to make my dry body butter. I will continue to order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this cream for a few days, but I am enjoying it.  I bought it to apply to my blemishes to help them heal faster and leave no scars.  Even in the few days I&#x27;ve been using it I can see that they are healing faster.  It smells good and isn&#x27;t terribly greasy.  So far, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry cracked hands. When my hands are cracked this does not sting! Lasts longer, I don&#x27;t have to apply as much as other products. Love it!</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this cream every day! Seriously moisturizes my face.</li>
            <li> Another good product.</li>
            <li> Use it as a base before I apply makeup. Not greasy at all. Would recommend this product. Cannot be beaten on price.</li>
            <li> This cream is a great value. I&#x27;ve found more results than I have from creams five times more expensive. Use it both on face and body (at this price you can). I love that I only need to use one product.</li>
            <li> I used this cream during my last pregnancy and didn&#x27;t have a single strech mark (on my stomach - wish I&#x27;d used it other places, too). It&#x27;s also a great all purpose moisturizer for the money!</li>
            <li> i am allergic to a lot of skincare products. I really like this moisturizer as it does not have a lot of fragrance or preservatives. And the double jars is great, I can use on my hands too. Was delivered fast!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cream I use it on my feet at night and face in the morning.  It provides just the right amount of moisture for my skin for a very reasonable price.  It&#x27;s neat to use not runny and slimy.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it. He said it goes on the skin so nicely, it helps to make the skin look and smell nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use as a cream on my sons dry face, but also to apply to a scar he has on his cheek. I didn&#x27;t read closely enough, or pay enough attention that it isn&#x27;t fragrance free or hypoallergenic and ended up irritating my sons skin even more. It was a good price, and I got the two pack, just didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> Great for really dry skin and scars.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce redness, flaking on my face.  Soothes irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I use this on a regular daily basis and was happy to order on line when I was running low on it.</li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy.  Very nice cream.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin from looking so bad as you get older.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product!  I use it on my face, neck, and eye area at night only, because it is too rich to use under makeup.  My skin has become incredibly soft, smooth and wrinkle free.  My neck was starting to look a little creapy, and now it is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!  This product is so reasonably priced, and DOES NOT TEST ON ANIMALS! Win-Win!!! I too, purchase it in the double jars, and always end up giving one away to friends and family, because I want them to have the pleasure of discovering it too!  Everyone I&#x27;ve shared it with has loved it also! My mother has very sensitive skin, and she is using it on her face and neck with great results too! She had been using one of the expensive department store creams, and likes this much better. Same with my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked on this fantastic product! Using it on my hands now, with the same great results. Two thumbs up!! Love, Love, Love!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was shocked by how fast the shipping was. Nearly 3 days in advance! Not to mention it was a great price for the quality of this lotion! My skin feels baby soft and even living in a humid state it seems to keep my face from getting oily! Feels so light on my skin all while really hydrating it, even within one use! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I have my massage therapist use this and I have really liked the results. She combines this with a bit of grape oil and not only does it feel good on my skin, but I think it has actually been having a good effect on my skin overall. we&#x27;ve almost gone through the original order, so I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this soon.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite creams. Light weight. Lasts a while.</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders on my dry hands and feet. I keep jars of it everywhere and have a small bottle of it in my purse. I wouldn&#x27;t personally use it on my face as it contains mineral oil and that can clog pores, but I put it on my dry skin and it is amazing even more so BECAUSE of the mineral oil which creates a light barrier to keep the skin moisturized (but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or super oily like Vaseline would).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it says on the jars that it is made in the USA and there is no animal testing. All good things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I buy this stuff at my local Dollar General where it is super cheap, and sometimes even goes on clearance. Look for it at your local dollar store.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overseas and i received this product with in 5 days of ordering. Usually it would take about 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve used this product before and i have always liked it. The light scent is pleasent, and is not as greasy as other vitamin E lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m updating my review above. I use this every night. Even on my 2 year old. We both have very dry skin and i can feel the difference, it&#x27;s very cold and windy where we live and her cheeks get very dry, red and look like they&#x27;re cracking. This lotion helps so much, its non greasy so she (we both) feel comfortable with it and it&#x27;s gentle enough that we use it everyday for our face.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  I am not sure about the Vitamin E contents since there&#x27;s no label but it makes my hands and feet super soft, was a great price and has added in reducing the colors of my scars.</li>
            <li> My husband works as a chef and is on his feet for long hours. His heels were really hard and his toes so chapped from air mot getting to his feet. I started  massage his legs and feet with this and wow!!! It has moistened his legs and feet and brought back the softness in a matter of days. He said it has helped his leg pain also. I use this on my body after a bath and my skin is so soft. So I will definitely keep ordering this prouct.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating to your skin!! We use this on my patients in the elderly homes to prevent skin breakdown. It works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I use this cream day and night and boy does this work wonders!!!! Not only is it moisturizing but it minimizes the appearance of my eczema scars!</li>
            <li> I really like it very much ! it&#x27;s very good and useful! But it is not alcohol free. So I can&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Was given a jar of this at my Dr&#x27;s office to help rehabilitate my hand after surgery. It helped tremendously, and I&#x27;ve now started using it on my feet. I had a fracture that I didn&#x27;t have treated right away and it abscessed. As the damaged tissue works its way to the surface, the skin needs to be debrided repeatedly. I am finding the Vitamin E Cream is also helping the foot wound heal faster as well--seems to prevent lumpy calluses from forming over the site.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> Been using this cream on my face for over 10 years. Can&#x27;t recommend it any better than that.</li>
            <li> I can only get this on-line!  I used to be able to purchase @ stores.  The value is better on-line anyway.  Tried many lotions &amp; creams but this is the only that works.  Not to mention it is made in the &amp;#34;Good&amp;#34; USA !</li>
            <li> Its a pleasure to put this product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Not oily not overwhelmingly perfumed...and wow! What a price!!! Pleased w my happy  vitamin E creamed face!</li>
            <li> Keeps brown marks off hands and face,</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son, who has very dry skin, has been using this product for several months; his skin looks healthy again. It also has a very pleasant soft, clean scent.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday under my make-up,  It is very nice.  Goes on easily, spreads well and disappears relatively quickly (within a few minutes),  Makes skin very supple and diminishes fine lines.  My only wish is that it didn&#x27;t have a scent.  While not over-the-top strong, it is still too flowery for my tastes.  I would say it has a moderate scent.  I wish someone would make an e cream without perfume.  Maybe they need it to mask the smell of the  &amp;#34;E&amp;#34;????  In the interim I would recommend this product unless you are sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li> My step-daughter told me of this product so decided to try it.  It is working out find.  Just need to try for a while yet to see how it works.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for decades. Best skin care for my face I have ever found and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it.  It makes your skin very soft and not as dry.  I have trouble with my feet and the cream has really helped.  Your and face is just so soft, people keep telling me how soft my hands are.</li>
            <li> When my son was twelve he found himself in a burn unit. The hospital used this product for heir patients. It&#x27;s works to repair the skin, of course, and it does work.  The nurses told me to use this as a moisturizer and it is wonderful. I put in on in the morning and it stays on all day. Some creams fade, but this one doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 years and will never give it up.</li>
            <li> This cream is quite effective at moisturizing and eliminating wintertime itch.  We have become regular users of this product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I found this product too thick for my taste. Doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance which I would like. I found it to be a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, absorbs well and moisturises. For the price, its amazin. I be buying again. I use on my neck and face. Doesnt clog pores, goes on smooth</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past ten years, it is is difficult to find a Vit E with no fragance.</li>
            <li> Cost is a little high.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E Cream based on a recommendation&lt;br /&gt;from a friend, the cream has a wonderfully thick feel to it, great scent and after&lt;br /&gt;only a week of using it am seeing results all in all a great product that I will&lt;br /&gt;order again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Me and my wife have been using it for years... Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product since the packaging wasn&#x27;t that appealing, but bought it anyways based on the reviews and am I glad I did.  I&#x27;m currently pregnant and it&#x27;s been such a dry winter.  I use this on myself and my two year old daughter.  I&#x27;ve shared it with everyone in my shop and they&#x27;re all surprised by it too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 10 years. I found it quite by accident at a local drug store. The price was right. I use this product every morning and night on my face and throat after washing my face. Although I am 47 years old, most people I assume I am in my early 30s or late 20s.  I also don&#x27;t smoke, drink or do drugs and drink 2 plus litres of water a day. This product is amazing. I totally swear by it. People are always asking me my secret and I tell them.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product.  I will not buy it again.  The problem lies with me I did not read the ingredients as I should have.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any Vitamin E in the product or at all.  My PROBLEM!  I am a newbie at shopping on online and will maintain proper care to  take special attention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for years, but the &amp;#34;source&amp;#34; dried up locally, and I&#x27;ve been so pleased to be able to buy it on Amazon. This cream is amazing...it NEVER spoils. I have a jar that is over ten years old, and it still looks and smells and feels just like it did when it was new. I think it must be the Vitamin E that is responsible for this, but I&#x27;ve never had any other product last like Fruit Of The Earth cream does. I use this product daily and it always feels great and moisturizes my winter dry skin and over washed hands. HOWEVER: I just read the response to a question that asked if there was fragrance in the cream. YES. There is. It is the last item in the ingredients list...parfum (fragrance). Someone also said it was &amp;#34;all natural.&amp;#34; It is not, nor does it claim to be. Among other ingredients it contains propylene glycol and methyl paraben. Again, personally I love the product, just placing an order for another two jars...but the truth may be important to some potential users.</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion on the planet!</li>
            <li> mom says it&#x27;s good, so, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;I passed one on to a good friend of mine, she also&lt;br /&gt;loves it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> its ok not what i want but using it</li>
            <li> Best vitamin E cream, i had to get 2 this time because I often run out!</li>
            <li> I have used this Vitamin E cream for quite some time because it is a wonderful product. It leaves your skin baby soft; I am not kidding. It has very little fragrance, and is light. A little goes a long way. I bought some for my daughter because she suffered with Eczema so badly, and it made her skin baby smooth. My husband said to me one day, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you use on your skin, but it makes you so soft and smooth; keep buying whatever it is.\\&quot; It is this cream and I will never stop buying it unless they stop making it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect cream for the body, hands and face. It&#x27;s smells nice and is not greasy. The cream smells nice. The product is made in the United Stated.</li>
            <li> I have a very large incision from surgery and my surgeon said vitamin E would help it heal well so I bought this.  I liked the price and the amount of cream that comes with.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 2 months every night all over my abdomen and still am only maybe halfway through the first container.  I assume it is helping to heal my scar a little more quickly and I definitely know that it took care of the itchiness that I had on and surrounding my scar so I am pleased with that.  I also rub a little extra on my dry hands at night which has seemed to help.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, got it to fade some dark spots that acne left over and it did work but it made me breakout as well. Great moisturizer but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time,  great product</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is very moisturizing without being oily.</li>
            <li> The cream is fine but I found the same thing after for half the price at Meijer.</li>
            <li> The price on this item is a real steal.  The quality of the product is excellent.  It is absorbed into the skin without leaving any greasy residue, and  is mild and long-lasting.  I use it as a base cream and add a tablespoon of cold-pressed sea buckthorn oil per jar.  It helps with rosacea and spider veins.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Using it to help heal the skin of my knee after surgery.  Very creamy and has a fresh scent.  Highly recommend.  Great buy, too.  Got two containers for the regular price of one.  Made my hands nice any smooth, too.</li>
            <li> Amazing feeling lotion. Stunning benefits!</li>
            <li> Have looked for this locally for some time and had given up finding it.  Found it again on Amazon.  Will order again.  We use this product frequently at our house.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  It has very little aroma, absorbs quickly and is great for the whole body.  I use it on my face in the morning and evenings.  You can also find it at Wal Mart for relatively cheap (usually on the bottom shelf).  Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of vitamin e products but this one made me breakout like hell. I feel so bad that after using it for 3 days my skin turned red with small bumps everywhere. I will not be using this again.</li>
            <li> Like the product, but Amazon&#x27;s price is double that of Walmart...should have checked Walmart first.  The cream is great though, I use it to make a homemade body/face cream with a few other ingredients.  Vitamin E is great for your skin and this one is absorbed quickly without any residue/greasiness.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all my friends.  Living in a northern climate we all suffer from chapped hands and the painful cracks that go with the chapping.  This cream is the best solution that I&#x27;ve found.  It is not greasy - it leaves my hands feeling smooth and it really helps with the chapping.  I also put it on my face when I&#x27;m going to be outside in very cold conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting side note - I don&#x27;t notice any fragrance in this product but my cats do and they don&#x27;t like it!  When I put the cream on my hands they stay off my lap for at least 30 minutes.  This can be a good thing.</li>
            <li> Great product and service!  Hands are suffering from &amp;#34;old age&amp;#34;, and this helps a bunch with cracking and peeling.&lt;br /&gt; Will be back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;working like results.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this stuff.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is any good or not, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm anyway.</li>
            <li> BOGO does not mean buy one get one in this case. I only got one jar. The  wrapper was so scratched and banged up I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was opened.  I only gave it two stars because I love the product.</li>
            <li> Did not realize it was two jars. Works well for scares or splits on fin . I would recommend this. They sell the same at Walmart..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why, but she is so very pleased with this cream and I got a lot of brownie points when I gave her 4 jars.</li>
            <li> Nice cream, nice feeding for my skin. I will use this cream again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is one of the few Aloe Vera creams that actually has a really good amount of aloe vera. Its great for dry skin all over the body and face. Its not greasy at all and the 2 pack is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer and works well. I got this cream for my eczema, and it seems to help BUT folks should note there is fragrance added to this cream and it stings when put on especially sensitive skin. The scent is ok, it reminds me of my mom&#x27;s hand cream or my dad&#x27;s muscle cream. Not too strong a scent, though, and while not particularly my cup of tea, it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all of the reviews that say how great this stuff is and better yet, how wonderful it is for the money.  I have been using this cream for about a week and a half and my arms and chest where I have applied it are covered in a red rash.  I do admit I have sensitive skin but have used tons of other lotions, creams, etc. and they have never done this.  I bought 4 jars of this stuff but I will never use it again.  Sorry for the negative review but I am just being completely honest.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my doctor told me to purchase vitamin e cream for my surgery scars. I have been using for about a weak and my scars are healing beautifully. I have used this on my face and yes it does moisturize but it is oily. Not good if you have oily skin. I do use it on my hands and feet and love how it makes them feel. I will report back on my surgical scars heal in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Got this last Monday. Used it that night. Face burned by the morning. Will try on my elbows and feet so I don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li> This body cream is excellent! It moisturizes your skin excellent. I also have chiggers in my back yard and don&#x27;t want to spray or put down poison since I have a dog. When I mow I get chigger bites and they will not bite me anymore when I use this body cream and to me this is fantastic..no more chigger bites!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price for a nice cream that works well on my son&#x27;s very dry skin. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this cream! They no longer sell Vitamin E cream at my local pharmacies and I decided to try this new brand after seeing the positive reviews. It&#x27;s the best Vit E cream I&#x27;ve used.  Rich, light &amp; pleasant fragrance, great for my dry skin and for my 2 yr old as well. Made in the USA, not tested on animals, great price and great product! I have already reordered more.</li>
            <li> we buy this add on item every time we buy $25 worth of items!</li>
            <li> Very economical and great for healing your skin (thanks to the surplus of VIT E nutrients).  Keeps skin moist and younger looking.  Very economical and great value overall.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, which contains no palm oil. It also can be found at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see the benefit of this product for my skin. The value was good but other than that I dont have much to comment about on this product. I currently use this on my stomach to help prevent stretch marks from appearing and on my face as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Using it following surgery on eye lid to heal skin and scars.  Seeing results after a couple weeks use.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the skin ! Disappears quickly and leaves skin soft as it&#x27;s repairing !</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It soothes my skin from the damage cold, dry air causes during our harsh Michigan winters.</li>
            <li> This cream is a very nice moisturizer. I get terribly dry skin in the winter, and this helped alleviate the dry itchy skin i sometimes get. The jars are rather small, but for the cheap price offered on amazon, well worth it!</li>
            <li> Good for healing dry skin and lips.</li>
            <li> I tried this when a friend of mine recommended it to me after I complained of chronic dry skin after I moved to a drier climate. I was experiencing extremely dry and flaky skin around my eyebrows and nose, and used all sorts of products and lotions. I used this (applying liberally to the dry areas, rubbed it in a bit) right before bed and woke up and my skin was soft, supple and moisturized. This is a great deal for a great product. I was about to give up hope and see a dermatologist to get their advice!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have very dry hands and i have tried a lot of creams before and none of them worked as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so soft and it keeps the moisture in for days.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my daughter but not as well for me, I guess maybe difference in age!</li>
            <li> This product works like wonder. It lightened the acne scars on my face. I use it as a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got this for my scars and I works wonderful. I was having trouble keeping my scars moist and this is perfect. you don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it isn&#x27;t really greasy.</li>
            <li> Best stuff we have ever used to clear up dry skin I am sure we&#x27;ll be using it a lot this winter.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since I was in my teens. It is great and does not make your face feel greasy but does keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Great Face Cream, Leaves my skin soft and solves the dry look problem  on my face. Thank You</li>
            <li> Used to be able to buy this in Walgreens, can not any more, so glad to find it here at such a great price</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 10 years. It works great even in the driest of weather.</li>
