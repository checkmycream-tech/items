            <li>This will come in handy whenever I feel congested and need to focus on just the problem area.</li>
            <li>It works as stated and is a nice addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I received this product for testing purposes and for an honest review, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li>I loved that I was able to test this product at a promotional rate and be able to give my honest review on it.</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Hopefully once I use it more, I&#x27;ll get used to the temperature a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my facial steamer.</li>
            <li>I kinda wish it could hold more water for a longer steaming session</li>
            <li>This Facial Steamer is awesome!</li>
            <li>saunas work so well for improving my skin&#x27;s appearance in many ways.</li>
            <li>My favorite benefits are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love using a clay masks.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get very much, but it does seem to be fairly good quality oil</li>
            <li>Very powerful and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>Works great, does what is advertised and has a strong steam that helps open my pores.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the warmth of the steam by itself but others may enjoy the aroma therapy of the oils.</li>
            <li>Frankincense is fantastic for it&#x27;s anti-aging properties.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this because it comes with frankincense and myrrh.</li>
            <li>It works great and generates a powerful steam, the oil feels fantastic for my dry skin as well.</li>
            <li>You may have to work up to the full 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this little steamer.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops of the included oil and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I only wish this contraption would be more comfortable when steaming, meaning you have to sit upright with your face inside to get the maximum benefits.</li>
            <li>The essential oils are a nice addition to the spa experience.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels much better afterwards, I bought this primarily to clear my pores and this does it with the added benefit of the oil.</li>
            <li>This facial steamer arrived in the manufacturers box, wrapped in very light brown paper.</li>
            <li>I love the steamer, but I did not receive ANY essential oil as advertised.</li>
            <li>Love the feeling I get from this; wish it was shaped a bit differently as I feel if I get my chin involved</li>
            <li>First of all, let me take about packaging.</li>
            <li>It helped me get rid blackheads on my face and definitely helped my face feel more moisturized in the evening.</li>
            <li>So despite the few problems I had with this product, I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of uses I can tell my skin feels so much smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li>That translates to a very banged up box which you can see from my picture.  </li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t realize it was one bottle of the oils combined together, not that it really matters much</li>
            <li>This does work very well on clearing out the sinuses.</li>
            <li>It can also act as a sedative, promoting feelings of peace and relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this Facial Steamer has two settings you can adjust it so that you&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
            <li>Also, after the first use I did have an outbreak of acne but after that first use my skin seemed to begin to clear up.  </li>
            <li>The essential oil that it comes with has a very pleasent and mild scent.</li>
            <li>The steam lasts for about 30 minutes, even on the high mode (haven&#x27;t tried it on medium).</li>
            <li>You hear so many things about product accidents and whatnot, but after a few times of using this I got used to it.</li>
            <li>I was offered a new bottle of the oil by the company.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on multiple facial steamers and finally decided on this one after days of looking.</li>
            <li>When first opening the box i thought the water resovoir was way too small to be able to have enough water to keep a sustaining amount of steam to come out</li>
            <li>I found the low setting to almost be too hot.</li>
            <li>The package includes a fragrance oil but was a little strong for me.</li>
            <li>So hopefully, if you like to read all the reviews before buying something, you can read this and know this one works great and is very reasonable compared to many others out there that you can spend a small fortune on but has broken after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I found the concept of placing my face over a thing of boiling water mixed with oil to be scary at first.</li>
            <li>This steamer has two heat settings, low and high.</li>
            <li>Not a single one!!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first since there were few reviews, but it turned out to be one of my best purchases which cost a lot less then other steamers in the market.</li>
            <li>I like the sauna but you will need to move your face around the steam as it comes out in a narrow stream and would only hit one area and is hot!  </li>

            <li> 15 minutes later I rinse and moisturize and I feel like I spent a fortune at a spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The directions which came with this were absolutely no help whatsoever, but after watching a few YouTube reviews I learned it is apparently a nose piece which I guess you just place inside the steamer and rest your nose in to focus the steam there.</li>

            <li> don&#x27;t have a single whine!!</li>

            <li> A few ounces goes quite a long way!</li>
            <li> so I spent about half an hour trying to figure out what the spare piece was.</li>
            <li> my forehead is missing and vice versa.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because the bottle I received was just over half full!</li>
            <li> I find that completely ridiculous</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> However I am disappointed that you guys advertised 2 oils with the spa</li>

            <li> I am not one to write a review. I read many reviews on multiple facial steamers and finally decided on this one after days of looking. I am extremely happy with this little steamer.

            <li> I like a lot my Spa Home Facial Steamer. Very powerful and easy to assemble. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I love the steamer, but I did not receive ANY essential oil as advertised.</li>
            <li> The spa works well. However I am disappointed that you guys advertised 2 oils with the spa and I only received one.</li>
            <li> Did not include essential oils as indicated on the package and in item description.  Had I know I would have selected different item at lower price. Retiring today</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I loved that I was able to test this product at a promotional rate and be able to give my honest review on it. When first opening the box i thought the water resovoir was way too small to be able to have enough water to keep a sustaining amount of steam to come out but I was wrong! A few ounces goes quite a long way! The set-up and all is pretty self explanitory, but when I went to look at the instructions, some of it was broken english and a little dificult to understand at first. that was my only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; on this product. The essential oil that it comes with has a very pleasent and mild scent. Perfect for that spa at home feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also lose the smaller &amp;#34;nose cover&amp;#34; piece. This will come in handy whenever I feel congested and need to focus on just the problem area. Also add a little hint of vicks vapo rub, it will clear you up in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this really is an awesome proudct. I am really glad to have it!</li>
            <li> Love the feeling I get from this; wish it was shaped a bit differently as I feel if I get my chin involved my forehead is missing and vice versa.</li>
            <li> I have never had anything quite like this. It&#x27;s like a spa treatment at home for your face. After a couple of uses I can tell my skin feels so much smoother and cleaner. It has two settings, I prefer the lower setting. The package includes a fragrance oil but was a little strong for me. I enjoy the warmth of the steam by itself but others may enjoy the aroma therapy of the oils. It works as stated and is a nice addition to my skin care regimen. It is also a great stress reliever as the warm steam just seams to melt the stress away. I received this product for testing purposes and for an honest review, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.  First of all, let me take about packaging. This facial steamer arrived in the manufacturers box, wrapped in very light brown paper. That translates to a very banged up box which you can see from my picture.  I was excited to try this because it comes with frankincense and myrrh. However, I didn&#x27;t realize it was one bottle of the oils combined together, not that it really matters much but I was expecting two bottles. I was very disappointed because the bottle I received was just over half full! I find that completely ridiculous and I would have been quite upset if I had paid for this product. The bottle claims to be 20 mL so you don&#x27;t get very much, but it does seem to be fairly good quality oil and it did work well.  Moving on, I had never used a facial steamer before so I spent about half an hour trying to figure out what the spare piece was. The directions which came with this were absolutely no help whatsoever, but after watching a few YouTube reviews I learned it is apparently a nose piece which I guess you just place inside the steamer and rest your nose in to focus the steam there. This product was made in China, so let&#x27;s just say the directions are not the best.  To be honest, I found the concept of placing my face over a thing of boiling water mixed with oil to be scary at first. You hear so many things about product accidents and whatnot, but after a few times of using this I got used to it. This steamer has two heat settings, low and high. I found the low setting to almost be too hot. Hopefully once I use it more, I&#x27;ll get used to the temperature a bit. This does work very well on clearing out the sinuses. I found after I used this, my eyes and nose were runny and I had to grab a tissue. Also, after the first use I did have an outbreak of acne but after that first use my skin seemed to begin to clear up.  I&#x27;m grateful to have this on hand at the moment since I do havea sinus infection and whatever other funk is going on with my body. This definitely helps. So despite the few problems I had with this product, I am very satisfied with it.  update: I was offered a new bottle of the oil by the company.</li>
            <li> I like the sauna but you will need to move your face around the steam as it comes out in a narrow stream and would only hit one area and is hot!  The essential oils are a nice addition to the spa experience.  I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my facial steamer.</li>
            <li> This works as expected. I kinda wish it could hold more water for a longer steaming session but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, the steamer holds exactly 50ml of water and lasts about 6-8 minutes. I use a few drops of the included oil and it smells great. My skin feels much better afterwards, I bought this primarily to clear my pores and this does it with the added benefit of the oil. You can use it in your living room to disperse the smell of the oil because the funnel is quite big.</li>
            <li> Works great, does what is advertised and has a strong steam that helps open my pores. I used to exfoliate my face afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first since there were few reviews, but it turned out to be one of my best purchases which cost a lot less then other steamers in the market. It works great and generates a powerful steam, the oil feels fantastic for my dry skin as well. It helped me get rid blackheads on my face and definitely helped my face feel more moisturized in the evening.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b4394d8b67e9c3ad2ef924effcae1d4]] This Facial Steamer is awesome! Everything is enclosed to help you get started like a 2 in 1 combo essential oil Frankincense and Myrrh. Frankincense is fantastic for it&#x27;s anti-aging properties. It is an astringent that can tone and lift the skin to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. It can also act as a sedative, promoting feelings of peace and relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this Facial Steamer has two settings you can adjust it so that you&#x27;re comfortable. Set your timer for 20 minutes. You may have to work up to the full 20 minutes. Just don&#x27;t go over the time limit.&lt;br /&gt;This saunas work so well for improving my skin&#x27;s appearance in many ways. My favorite benefits are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improves overall skin&#x27;s complexion!! A great steam will get rid of toxins and boost blood circulation. Think rosy glow!&lt;br /&gt;This will give your skin a deep cleanse and help to eliminate blackheads and white heads.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will appear fresher, healthier, hydrated and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;A steam helps you de-stress!&lt;br /&gt;After my steam facial I pat my skin dry and immediately add a facial mask. I love using a clay masks. 15 minutes later I rinse and moisturize and I feel like I spent a fortune at a spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a single whine!! Not a single one!! This Facial Steamer does the JOB!! I give it two very enthusiastic thumbs WAY UP!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary/free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way</li>
