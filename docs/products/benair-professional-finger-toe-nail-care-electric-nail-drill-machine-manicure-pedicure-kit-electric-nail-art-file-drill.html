            <li>Works great with its variable speeds setting.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ideal for acrylic filing, but it seems like it would be a good tool for that</li>
            <li>Works good great price.</li>
            <li>Product is good, needs practice to not let file tip roll on cuticle cause</li>

            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered this from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If it remains durable and it is lasting, then it is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Thought it was be more profession looking.</li>
            <li>$20 bucks got me everything I hoped for and more.</li>
            <li>I bought this mostly to rough up the top coat for gel polish removal, and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>Wow I&#x27;m pretty impressed!</li>
            <li>Stick your desired bit in between both top pieces to where the bit is inside comfortably.</li>
            <li>Also, delivery was fast and the packaging was good.</li>
            <li>It is easily salon quality though.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use drill heads.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone interested in saving some money by doing their own home manicures.</li>
            <li>It’s easy to use and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Ally of reviews say that this drill doesn&#x27;t work because the bits don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Then when it comes in the mail I try it out and it seems like the bits don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>The very first time I turned the on/off wheel to on, it broke and spins freely in either direction in a perpetual state of &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Good speed variation and plenty powerful enough.</li>
            <li>So far this tool is superb and does all tasks as expected.</li>
            <li>Slim, easy to hold, and pretty powerful, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>The seller was in contact with me due to a swap out of a part, which I thought was very nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately, they refunded my money right away.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>This nail drill is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly why I was nervous to buy this product.</li>
            <li>The tool worked great for filing down my acrylics and for taking the gel off of my natural nail.</li>
            <li>The silver round top of the drill is supposed to come off for the bits to fit.</li>
            <li>First hold the button in the center while twisting off the silver top.</li>
            <li>Amazing that every once in a while you take a chance on something that seems cheap because if it&#x27;s no good you haven&#x27;t lost much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Now hold the center button again and attach the two top pieces and the bit into the drill.</li>
            <li>Really really really hope this helps everyone out.</li>
            <li>so you have to be very close.</li>
            <li>Very noisy</li>
            <li>Amazing little tool, nice long cord and very powerful,glad I made this purchase, definitely does the job and the unit is pretty quiet</li>
            <li>This drill de-bulked them down to a manageable size in no time, and they look much much better.</li>
            <li>and I probably should have spent a little more to get a more professional style.  </li>
            <li>I even watched a YouTube video on the product to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing a step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Extras that are sent don&#x27;t fit on other parts.</li>
            <li>Amazing, comes fast and works well, look up how to use it if you get confused with the instructions.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a pretty powerful little hand drill.</li>
            <li>I have acrylics and I use gel polish on my acrylics and natural toe nails.</li>
            <li>Tiny 3 foot cord, very noisy, a lot of vibration.</li>
            <li>Do not waste money on this.</li>
            <li>Dissapointed, not really what I expected, I wanted something for my nails, but this product does not have a buffer, and its more for grinding.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this little powerful tool to anyone.</li>
            <li>The directions aren&#x27;t clear enough the explain how to use it.</li>
            <li>but I only do natural nails</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this tool. I have used it at least 4xs since receiving it. I would definitely recommend it. But you will need to take care while using. It is not for the inexperienced. Very powerful. I love it. Great for practicing acrylic nails! Came with everything promised and earlier than expected! Great condition. Great steal for the price. Could even shave down the wood on a pencil! Love this! I&#x27;m glad I ordered this from Amazon. I use it on my toenails and keep them from not being uglier than they are! Good speed variation and plenty powerful enough. I would recommend this little powerful tool to anyone. I was surprisingly impressed with this nail file, I bought it to do my acrylic nails and for the price this works great! -- By the way, I am writing under my husband&#x27;s account. Love it. I have acrylics and I use gel polish on my acrylics and natural toe nails. The tool worked great for filing down my acrylics and for taking the gel off of my natural nail. It’s easy to use and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Product is good, needs practice to not let file tip roll on cuticle cause it is painful. Otherwise works good. Bought this for my wife as the last drill/file didn&#x27;t provide the power she was looking for. She is very pleased with this tool as it gives her the power and in a variable speed. It was also half the price of her previous drill! Win-Win! So far this tool is superb and does all tasks as expected. If it remains durable and it is lasting, then it is perfect. Wow! Wish I bought these product years ago! I have a long history of toenail problems on my big toes. They are thick, cracked and hard to cut. This drill de-bulked them down to a manageable size in no time, and they look much much better. I was thinking of having a procedure to have my big toenails removed, but that&#x27;s unnecessary now thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I use this at home for gel/shellac manicures. It is easily salon quality though. Easy to use. It comes w/everything you need. All included for an amazing price. Fast shipping too! Perfect for me! I do my acrylic nails here n there n this speeds up my work! From shaping to buffing. Works good great price. Amazing little tool, nice long cord and very powerful,glad I made this purchase, definitely does the job and the unit is pretty quiet so that is also a plus, I would definitely recommend this product!!! I really like this product. The second time I used it, it just stopped working. I contacted the seller and in less than a week a new unit arrived. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in saving some money by doing their own home manicures. This nail drill is exactly as advertised. Works great with its variable speeds setting. The seller was in contact with me due to a swap out of a part, which I thought was very nice. I would tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> No way to lock bits. Extras that are sent don&#x27;t fit on other parts. Doesn&#x27;t work...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works great,, would highly recommend,, can get through a whole set with no problem,, very happy. Amazing, comes fast and works well, look up how to use it if you get confused with the instructions. Wow I&#x27;m pretty impressed! Slim, easy to hold, and pretty powerful, even on the lowest setting. I bought this mostly to rough up the top coat for gel polish removal, and it&#x27;s perfect! I&#x27;m a nail tech but I only do natural nails so I won&#x27;t be using this for long periods of time so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ideal for acrylic filing, but it seems like it would be a good tool for that, it&#x27;s a pretty powerful little hand drill. Also, delivery was fast and the packaging was good. Very satisfied. This works great!!! I do my own nails now and they look great - thanks to this tool! Easy to use drill heads. I wish I found this sooner!!!</li>
            <li> Not for fingernails.  Way too harsh.</li>
            <li> Ally of reviews say that this drill doesn&#x27;t work because the bits don&#x27;t fit. That&#x27;s exactly why I was nervous to buy this product. Then when it comes in the mail I try it out and it seems like the bits don&#x27;t fit. But they actually do. The directions aren&#x27;t clear enough the explain how to use it. The silver round top of the drill is supposed to come off for the bits to fit. First hold the button in the center while twisting off the silver top. Inside is another skinny piece. Now remove both. Stick your desired bit in between both top pieces to where the bit is inside comfortably. Now hold the center button again and attach the two top pieces and the bit into the drill. Twist until it closes and now use your drill. Really really really hope this helps everyone out. Don&#x27;t return it&#x27;s a great dril. :))</li>
            <li> I would like to send it back, it does not work. I need to know how to go about doing this. I would like a response to this problem. Thank you</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, not as advertised.  Tiny 3 foot cord, very noisy, a lot of vibration. Very weak motor stalls out if you put even light pressure on it.  I feel like I got something different than what I ordered.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product! The very first time I turned the on/off wheel to on, it broke and spins freely in either direction in a perpetual state of &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;. The bits were all the wrong size as they were too small and there was no way of securing them so they would not fall out. I even watched a YouTube video on the product to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing a step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, they refunded my money right away.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed, not really what I expected, I wanted something for my nails, but this product does not have a buffer, and its more for grinding.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, it didn&#x27;t work - tried multiple outlets but no power :/&lt;br /&gt;Chintzy, returned for refund.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not what I was expecting. Thought it was be more profession looking. The cord is short so you have to be very close. I was expecting that once charged it would be portable, this isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> Package arrives and is listed as mini tile and grout sander... It looks and handles like a power tool instead of a mani-pedi tool. Gave to my dad for&lt;br /&gt;his little projects, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very noisy and I probably should have spent a little more to get a more professional style.  It works - just doesn&#x27;t provide the &#x27;feel&#x27; I expected.</li>
            <li> Works but cord is way too short</li>
            <li> Bits did not fit in the drill, very short cord. Did not come with any instructions. Box came damaged. Extremely dissatisfied with this purchase. Do not waste money on this.</li>
            <li> Could not get to work as advertised so returned it.</li>
            <li> Amazing that every once in a while you take a chance on something that seems cheap because if it&#x27;s no good you haven&#x27;t lost much. I won the bet with this one. $20 bucks got me everything I hoped for and more. Somewhere in the world, in some obscure factory, the workers and the quality control guy should get a raise. Go for it.</li>
