            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Chi, but still does a good job.</li>
            <li>It works great on my hair and leaves it looking just as nice as the hair salons</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re good.</li>

            <li>better cuz it doesnt break my hair   Love FHM great company</li>
            <li>The iron is as good as most say it is.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because your WARRANTY IS EFFECTIVE</li>
            <li>B0055BQZ62 KeratinPerfect PerfectLight Deluxe</li>
            <li>seemed liked would have lasted longer for the price</li>
            <li>After my beloved FHI died, I decided to give a more high-end brand a try, and bought a GHD.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped to me quickly and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>So I did A LOT of research and found out that FHI products were the BEST for course, natural hair.</li>
            <li>I agreed, since the lady was so nice and convincing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as hot as my GHD, but it&#x27;s great for touch ups when the GHD is overkill.</li>
            <li>love love love love love love love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I just dropped it one too many times.</li>
            <li>Over all its and ok iron.</li>
            <li>, I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Better to pay about $100 for this then $100 at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love their product and it works and straightens hair like never before.  </li>
            <li>I have a 1\\&quot; FHI iron and love it.  </li>
            <li>much better than the conair one i had</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>But I do love the iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this, wish it had an auto shut off but no big deal.  </li>
            <li>it remains without a doubt my favorite brand.  </li>
            <li>It would save me from so many \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li>Just glad i didnt pay 100</li>
            <li>These is the best flat irons I ever had in my possession.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron Ive ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>For the price, I think it&#x27;s pretty good; I like it.  </li>
            <li>While their products are good, I wanted something that would reach a higher temperature and keep my hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li>and i loved it so much i bought another one.</li>
            <li>, it heats quickly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>All in all the FHI styling iron is an excellent product, it cost a little more than others</li>
            <li>At the time I couldn&#x27;t find the CHI easily and Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply carried the FHI.</li>
            <li>it makes it look so easy</li>
            <li>It reaches the desired temp and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>As much as I loved this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to be an alarmist but when it comes to high end products that have a warranty when purchased through an authorized reseller, I would point you in that direction if you want an FHI iron.</li>
            <li>its very light in weight, curls nicely has different temperture for adjustement fot the heat great buy, thanks you u</li>
            <li>well made, and runs smoothly through my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have to buy another iron, what kind of deal did you really get?</li>
            <li>It doesnt glide smooth like I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I chose 4 instead of 5 because I believe I read that the light will go off when it reaches it&#x27;s highest temperature.  </li>
            <li>I never saw the light go out.  </li>
            <li>I use to have had a cheap conair one].</li>
            <li>If you want one with a temperature control, I might suggest to buy the upgraded version, which is also available on amazon.</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly through the hair.  </li>
            <li>Does not seem to be a cheaply made item and it does its job.</li>
            <li>No burning smell and my hair was smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>This brand was suggested by a professional stylist and, so far, I have been impressed.  </li>
            <li>This iron is incredibly hot, and is damaging to my fine hair, and I would suspect most hair types.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>this was a great flat iron!</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and easy to handle .</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot (which is great if you&#x27;re between relaxers), left my hair shiny and straight, and it glides very easily over the hair.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it senses my hair needs a higher heat though it&#x27;s advertised as being able to adjust itself for your hair.</li>
            <li>I have had to spend significant money trying to repair my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s a great price for such great quality!</li>
            <li>This is by far the very best flat iron on the market!</li>
            <li>She said that she would let me keep the iron and give me a full refund if i took the feedback off.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from this iron, it wasn&#x27;t any better then a brand i bought for $20, I will pass on it!</li>
            <li>The only down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t have controlled temperature like most, but I find the heat it gets up to is really hot but perfect for my hair, it doesn&#x27;t fry it.</li>
            <li>I think this is my new favorite styling iron.</li>
            <li>They are extremely hot and either  the protective plates aren&#x27;t good enough or it has to be replaced after 1 or 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I bought the FHI Heat Technique G2, I can&#x27;t live without a flat iron, so as soon as mine broke I ordered it off of Amazon</li>
            <li>Once this thing started to really act like a cheap Target iron, I had to admit defeat.</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t worth the money, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>but you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning and love how soft it makes my hair feel and shiny</li>
            <li>the quality is good and leaves your hair soft and shiny, however the actual structure of it is not all that fabulous.</li>
            <li>(I am a brunette and dont bleach my hair and rarely use a blow</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing [but keep in mind</li>
            <li>It says right in the description that it heats up to over 400 degrees.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt work right, heat fully or evenly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right amount of heat for my hair.</li>
            <li>In order for a flat iron to be really effective at straightening hair, it has to get HOT</li>
            <li>I like it because it is lightweight, heats up quickly and does a fast and efficient job of straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>last flat iron was a Solano Sapphire which I had for 9 years and worked GREAT without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>I am all natural and I asked my sister who is in the hair industry about good flat irons for my hair texture</li>
            <li>I loved these when I first got them, but after a little they seemed not to get as hot.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would</li>
            <li>hair was breaking off) and when I used my old cheap blow dryer it takes about 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>and I really do have salon hair quality hair!</li>
            <li>Anywhere else you look, FHI has a stellar reputation.</li>
            <li>but i was looking for one to stay hot so that i could get through my hair a lot faster.</li>
            <li>Gets plenty hot.  </li>
            <li>It gets too hot and there is NO temperature control.  </li>
            <li>It does not get as hot as the details says.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and does a decent job on my unmanageable hair</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron in a retail store, for a lot more than amazon&#x27;s selling price.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron I&#x27;d say is ok....</li>
            <li>My natural hair is super curly by the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first fell love with this flat iron about 2 years ago as a professional stylist.</li>
            <li>Was super excited to get my new fhi flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only owned it two days and am taking it back today; for $100 more, it didn&#x27;t get as hot as my FHI and kept pulling and breaking my hair!  </li>
            <li>but I had heard so much hype about the brand</li>
            <li>I was wondering how did the hair dresser get my hair straight</li>
            <li>Apply another heat protectant(either whole hair or sections)</li>
            <li>(Not so much when purchased here, I cringe to say)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife uses this product and really loves it.</li>
            <li>The item took more then the expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li>the plates heat up really fast and they glide over ur hair.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift for my wife and she told me she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>straight.</li>
            <li>Heats up FAST.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with these, and this one made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can curl it, or keep it bone straight.</li>
            <li>I do like how they straighten my hair and makes it really shinny.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and straightens hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Just opened flat iron and used last night and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super smooth and shiny in half of the time and mother price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li>Well turns out it was my cheap Wal-Mart flat irons I was using.</li>
            <li>The cosmotologist enjoy working with this Flat iron.</li>
            <li>Works 10x better than my other straightener.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Gold &#x27;N Hot, and Hot Tools; this left my hair looking much silkier.</li>
            <li>My original FHI flat iron died and I purchased this one to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe it doesn&#x27;t want to fry my hair... but either way, not a bad straightener, definitely beats any Conair or Revlon</li>
            <li>Wash with shampoo last because this makes sure theres no residue left over like how we sometimes get when conditioning</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace the older one which stopped working after 6 years of use.</li>
            <li>I did research to find out if one was better than the other and found out that they were pretty much the same</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a BAD flat iron..  </li>
            <li>, I guess maybe I just got my hopes up too high.</li>
            <li>I purchased the FHI iron because my hairdresser highly recommends this brand.  </li>
            <li>You never have to adjust the temp or worry about burning your hair because the temperature is to high.</li>
            <li>my recent one was perfect until the day it gave out, but this one top bar is already loose, bending left and right like crazy</li>
            <li>i love this flat iron, i purchased it because this is the one i had for about four years before it finally died</li>
            <li>I have been natural for a few years and have not been able to flat iron my own hair until I got this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>and so it was a nice surprise as usual when it showed up a week early!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t curl it either like you can normally do with the Chi.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough to really straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I washed and blowed dried my hair and let FHI work its magic, even on the spots that was still damp.</li>
            <li>this one weren&#x27;t getting hot enough to really do anything for my head.</li>
            <li>Because I needed a break from paying $130-$140 a month for my natural hair in the salon, I did it!</li>
            <li>Worked well in the first 3 months but then mysteriously stop heating up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working well so far!  </li>
            <li>but boy does that not work with natural hair!</li>
            <li>Other than that it does get hot fast</li>
            <li>Description wasnt clear of that.  </li>
            <li>I just decided to go natural</li>
            <li>and I have natural curly</li>
            <li>Bought this a while back, still works really well.  </li>
            <li>very reliable at a low price</li>
            <li>Price is much lower than on actual FHI website.</li>
            <li>Most seem to be heavy, clunky and never heat up enough.  </li>
            <li>in the same day I decided to get this flat iron along with the \\&quot;Fhi Heat Platform Nano Salon Pro 2000 Powerful Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer, Black\\&quot; from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Seller delivered fast, and flat iron is in quality condition.</li>
            <li>My last FHI hair straightener lasted 8 years and still worked like new!</li>
            <li>i expected the iron to heat up aa little more.</li>
            <li>My Chi straightener broke recently, so I bought this new Fhi straightener.</li>
            <li>I had mine for over 2 years before the cord got a short and am ordering a new one.</li>
            <li>I have to run the flat irons like ten times to get them straight like I like.</li>
            <li>It takes about 10 minutes to heat up and it barely heats up anyway.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft after and actually changes the texture of my hair!</li>
            <li>The only problem I have had so far is with the FHI emblem breaking off.</li>
            <li>I have very thick curly hair(think Scary Spice lol) and this iron does get it pretty  </li>
            <li>I have extremely think wavy hair and looks like I was born with straight hair after using.  </li>
            <li>She says it does not dry out her hair</li>
            <li>Due to the lack of temperature control, however, I do not recommend this particular FHI iron.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I do not see bad reviews about these irons that are purchased at authorized resale dealers, so it does make me question why my iron (which I paid much more than this current Amazon pricing for) did not last.</li>
            <li>Does the job in 1/2 of the time drugstore brand flat irons do &amp; Im African American w/ natural hair.</li>
            <li>I like the flat iron because it doesn&#x27;t get as hot on the outside as some others; less likely to burn myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a remington that was much, much cheaper, and I had just hoped that this one would make flat ironing take less time.  </li>

            <li> After my beloved FHI died, I decided to give a more high-end brand a try, and bought a GHD.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped to me quickly and in great condition.  </li>
            <li> So I did A LOT of research and found out that FHI products were the BEST for course, natural hair.</li>
            <li> I agreed, since the lady was so nice and convincing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hot as my GHD, but it&#x27;s great for touch ups when the GHD is overkill.</li>
            <li> love love love love love love love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I just dropped it one too many times.</li>

            <li> I love their product and it works and straightens hair like never before.  </li>
            <li> I have a 1\\&quot; FHI iron and love it.  </li>
            <li> much better than the conair one i had</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> But I do love the iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this, wish it had an auto shut off but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> it remains without a doubt my favorite brand.  </li>
            <li> It would save me from so many \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li> Just glad i didnt pay 100</li>
            <li> These is the best flat irons I ever had in my possession.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron Ive ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s pretty good; I like it.  </li>
            <li> While their products are good, I wanted something that would reach a higher temperature and keep my hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> and i loved it so much i bought another one.</li>
            <li> , it heats quickly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> All in all the FHI styling iron is an excellent product, it cost a little more than others</li>
            <li> At the time I couldn&#x27;t find the CHI easily and Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply carried the FHI.</li>
            <li> it makes it look so easy</li>
            <li> It reaches the desired temp and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> As much as I loved this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to be an alarmist but when it comes to high end products that have a warranty when purchased through an authorized reseller, I would point you in that direction if you want an FHI iron.</li>
            <li> its very light in weight, curls nicely has different temperture for adjustement fot the heat great buy, thanks you u</li>
            <li> well made, and runs smoothly through my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have to buy another iron, what kind of deal did you really get?</li>
            <li> It doesnt glide smooth like I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> I chose 4 instead of 5 because I believe I read that the light will go off when it reaches it&#x27;s highest temperature.  </li>
            <li> I never saw the light go out.  </li>
            <li> I use to have had a cheap conair one].</li>
            <li> If you want one with a temperature control, I might suggest to buy the upgraded version, which is also available on amazon.</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly through the hair.  </li>
            <li> Does not seem to be a cheaply made item and it does its job.</li>
            <li> No burning smell and my hair was smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This brand was suggested by a professional stylist and, so far, I have been impressed.  </li>
            <li> This iron is incredibly hot, and is damaging to my fine hair, and I would suspect most hair types.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> this was a great flat iron!</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and easy to handle .</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot (which is great if you&#x27;re between relaxers), left my hair shiny and straight, and it glides very easily over the hair.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it senses my hair needs a higher heat though it&#x27;s advertised as being able to adjust itself for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have had to spend significant money trying to repair my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s a great price for such great quality!</li>
            <li> This is by far the very best flat iron on the market!</li>
            <li> She said that she would let me keep the iron and give me a full refund if i took the feedback off.  </li>
            <li> I expected more from this iron, it wasn&#x27;t any better then a brand i bought for $20, I will pass on it!</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t have controlled temperature like most, but I find the heat it gets up to is really hot but perfect for my hair, it doesn&#x27;t fry it.</li>
            <li> I think this is my new favorite styling iron.</li>
            <li> They are extremely hot and either  the protective plates aren&#x27;t good enough or it has to be replaced after 1 or 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I bought the FHI Heat Technique G2, I can&#x27;t live without a flat iron, so as soon as mine broke I ordered it off of Amazon</li>
            <li> Once this thing started to really act like a cheap Target iron, I had to admit defeat.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t worth the money, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> but you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and love how soft it makes my hair feel and shiny</li>
            <li> the quality is good and leaves your hair soft and shiny, however the actual structure of it is not all that fabulous.</li>
            <li> (I am a brunette and dont bleach my hair and rarely use a blow</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing [but keep in mind</li>
            <li> It says right in the description that it heats up to over 400 degrees.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt work right, heat fully or evenly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right amount of heat for my hair.</li>
            <li> In order for a flat iron to be really effective at straightening hair, it has to get HOT</li>
            <li> I like it because it is lightweight, heats up quickly and does a fast and efficient job of straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> last flat iron was a Solano Sapphire which I had for 9 years and worked GREAT without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I am all natural and I asked my sister who is in the hair industry about good flat irons for my hair texture</li>
            <li> I loved these when I first got them, but after a little they seemed not to get as hot.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would</li>
            <li> hair was breaking off) and when I used my old cheap blow dryer it takes about 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li> and I really do have salon hair quality hair!</li>
            <li> Anywhere else you look, FHI has a stellar reputation.</li>
            <li> but i was looking for one to stay hot so that i could get through my hair a lot faster.</li>
            <li> Gets plenty hot.  </li>
            <li> It gets too hot and there is NO temperature control.  </li>
            <li> It does not get as hot as the details says.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and does a decent job on my unmanageable hair</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in a retail store, for a lot more than amazon&#x27;s selling price.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron I&#x27;d say is ok....</li>
            <li> My natural hair is super curly by the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first fell love with this flat iron about 2 years ago as a professional stylist.</li>
            <li> Was super excited to get my new fhi flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned it two days and am taking it back today; for $100 more, it didn&#x27;t get as hot as my FHI and kept pulling and breaking my hair!  </li>
            <li> but I had heard so much hype about the brand</li>
            <li> I was wondering how did the hair dresser get my hair straight</li>
            <li> Apply another heat protectant(either whole hair or sections)</li>
            <li> (Not so much when purchased here, I cringe to say)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and really loves it.</li>
            <li> The item took more then the expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> the plates heat up really fast and they glide over ur hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my wife and she told me she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> straight.</li>
            <li> Heats up FAST.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with these, and this one made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can curl it, or keep it bone straight.</li>
            <li> I do like how they straighten my hair and makes it really shinny.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and straightens hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Just opened flat iron and used last night and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super smooth and shiny in half of the time and mother price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Well turns out it was my cheap Wal-Mart flat irons I was using.</li>
            <li> The cosmotologist enjoy working with this Flat iron.</li>
            <li> Works 10x better than my other straightener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gold &#x27;N Hot, and Hot Tools; this left my hair looking much silkier.</li>
            <li> My original FHI flat iron died and I purchased this one to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe it doesn&#x27;t want to fry my hair... but either way, not a bad straightener, definitely beats any Conair or Revlon</li>
            <li> Wash with shampoo last because this makes sure theres no residue left over like how we sometimes get when conditioning</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the older one which stopped working after 6 years of use.</li>
            <li> I did research to find out if one was better than the other and found out that they were pretty much the same</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a BAD flat iron..  </li>
            <li> , I guess maybe I just got my hopes up too high.</li>
            <li> I purchased the FHI iron because my hairdresser highly recommends this brand.  </li>
            <li> You never have to adjust the temp or worry about burning your hair because the temperature is to high.</li>
            <li> my recent one was perfect until the day it gave out, but this one top bar is already loose, bending left and right like crazy</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron, i purchased it because this is the one i had for about four years before it finally died</li>
            <li> I have been natural for a few years and have not been able to flat iron my own hair until I got this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and so it was a nice surprise as usual when it showed up a week early!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t curl it either like you can normally do with the Chi.</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough to really straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I washed and blowed dried my hair and let FHI work its magic, even on the spots that was still damp.</li>
            <li> this one weren&#x27;t getting hot enough to really do anything for my head.</li>
            <li> Because I needed a break from paying $130-$140 a month for my natural hair in the salon, I did it!</li>
            <li> Worked well in the first 3 months but then mysteriously stop heating up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working well so far!  </li>
            <li> but boy does that not work with natural hair!</li>
            <li> Other than that it does get hot fast</li>
            <li> Description wasnt clear of that.  </li>
            <li> I just decided to go natural</li>
            <li> and I have natural curly</li>
            <li> Bought this a while back, still works really well.  </li>
            <li> very reliable at a low price</li>
            <li> Price is much lower than on actual FHI website.</li>
            <li> Most seem to be heavy, clunky and never heat up enough.  </li>
            <li> in the same day I decided to get this flat iron along with the \\&quot;Fhi Heat Platform Nano Salon Pro 2000 Powerful Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer, Black\\&quot; from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Seller delivered fast, and flat iron is in quality condition.</li>
            <li> My last FHI hair straightener lasted 8 years and still worked like new!</li>
            <li> i expected the iron to heat up aa little more.</li>
            <li> My Chi straightener broke recently, so I bought this new Fhi straightener.</li>
            <li> I had mine for over 2 years before the cord got a short and am ordering a new one.</li>
            <li> I have to run the flat irons like ten times to get them straight like I like.</li>
            <li> It takes about 10 minutes to heat up and it barely heats up anyway.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft after and actually changes the texture of my hair!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had so far is with the FHI emblem breaking off.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair(think Scary Spice lol) and this iron does get it pretty  </li>
            <li> I have extremely think wavy hair and looks like I was born with straight hair after using.  </li>
            <li> She says it does not dry out her hair</li>
            <li> Due to the lack of temperature control, however, I do not recommend this particular FHI iron.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I do not see bad reviews about these irons that are purchased at authorized resale dealers, so it does make me question why my iron (which I paid much more than this current Amazon pricing for) did not last.</li>
            <li> Does the job in 1/2 of the time drugstore brand flat irons do &amp; Im African American w/ natural hair.</li>
            <li> I like the flat iron because it doesn&#x27;t get as hot on the outside as some others; less likely to burn myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a remington that was much, much cheaper, and I had just hoped that this one would make flat ironing take less time.  </li>
            <li> ONLY IF YOU HAVE A VALID RECEIPT FROM A PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY SALON OR OTHER SELECT AUTHORIZED BEAUTY PRODUCTS RESELLER</li>
            <li> I googled them online and almost paid 149.99 for some FHI flat irons on a different site.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had the same one all this time, so I thought they would be long lasting!</li>
            <li> In case anyone is curious -- it has a regular plug (not one of those giant wall thingies), and is 120V only (not dual voltage).  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a number of flat irons from department/drug stores and have been increasingly dissatisfied with them.</li>
            <li> These flat irons is already set at a pre temperature.</li>
            <li> After I got done flat ironing and styling my hair</li>
            <li> I flat iron at home</li>
            <li> Start with a section and apply heat serum to that section and flat iron</li>
            <li> I  do like this flat iron, but  miss the temperature options.</li>
            <li> The FHI Heat Technique G2 flat iron works well.</li>
            <li> An iron is not a &#x27;deal&#x27; if it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that after years of using it I noticed that this product does strip the hair and dry it.  </li>
            <li> I used some crazy glue and was able to put it back on.</li>
            <li> This thing totally blew me away in performance, but I returned it due to a suspected electrical short inside of it, and did not have the guts to buy another.</li>
            <li> So overall if you have normal to medium thick  hair</li>
            <li> I am natural and have thick somewhat coarse hair and these flat irons make my hair look as if I have been to a salon and got a relaxer.</li>
            <li> Yes, it flat irons wet or damp hair.</li>
            <li> After my KQC Red Devil Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron broke only after a year and a half I started to shop around online for reviews on some other hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> Blow dry using the FHI blow dryer with the comb piece attached&lt;br</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything really wrong with it, but there isn&#x27;t anything special about it either.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not really that long, just to my shoulders..</li>
            <li> Despite this iron being hot and destructive, it still doesn&#x27;t take all of the frizz out of my hair like my old iron did.</li>
            <li> Its doesnt work as well as i expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4.Comb through hair with wide tooth comp to detangle before blow-drying&lt;</li>
            <li> Showed up way before expected.</li>
            <li> The first one I owned for almost 4 years, nothing went wrong with it</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I do not damage my hair any other way</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> just switched to all natural after cutting off my dreads and therefore used a regular flat iron and blow dryer</li>
            <li> I usually section all my hair before doing this and apply it to each section before I flat iron it)&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> It took just as much time, and was just as difficult to use (and I&#x27;m no happier with the result than I was with the result from the cheaper one that I&#x27;ve been using).  </li>
            <li> THE WARRANTY IS NOT EFFECTIVE IF THE FHI HEAT STYLING TOOL WAS PURCHASED FROM ANY SOURCE NOT LISTED ABOVE, INCLUDING ANY INTERNET RESELLER OR AUCTION SITE.</li>
            <li> After whole head is blow dried with heat go all over once again with COLD air which closes th hairs cuticle back up to reduce frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you decide whether I have a refurbished, fake, or real product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this styling iron to anyone desiring less frizz after styling.</li>
            <li> , I usually get my orders from Amazon at least 5 days earlier then the date they give me</li>
            <li> I purchased my FHI a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> It straighten each and every one of them including my daughter&#x27;s where a relaxer still leaves little curls at the edges.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt purchase this product again not a good flat iron at all.  </li>

            <li> it is a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I usually use a creamy runny liquid to apply to my damp hair before blowdrying</li>
            <li> I  have  had an  FHI  iron in the past with  temperature settings.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind using an adapter but am not sure if the voltage would ruin the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this small detail is not exactly clear in the product description.</li>
            <li> Months later a lady contacted me saying that she had read the feedback i had left and was sorry that i was unhappy with the item.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for 1.5 years now, and it has broken all of my hair around my crown to where little pieces stick out everywhere.</li>
            <li> I swear with the FHI blow dyer it takes only 5 minutes INCLUDING a cold blast(I&#x27;ll</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in a retail store, for a lot more than amazon&#x27;s selling price.  It&#x27;s not a BAD flat iron..  but I had heard so much hype about the brand, I guess maybe I just got my hopes up too high. My hair is not really that long, just to my shoulders.. it is very thick though, and frizzy/curly.  It takes me forever to straighten my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using a remington that was much, much cheaper, and I had just hoped that this one would make flat ironing take less time.  It took just as much time, and was just as difficult to use (and I&#x27;m no happier with the result than I was with the result from the cheaper one that I&#x27;ve been using).  It just isn&#x27;t worth the money, in my opinion.  There isn&#x27;t anything really wrong with it, but there isn&#x27;t anything special about it either.  I am going to return it.      In case anyone is curious -- it has a regular plug (not one of those giant wall thingies), and is 120V only (not dual voltage).  There&#x27;s just an on/off switch, no temperature control (410F is all you get).</li>
            <li> I bought this because the woman who does my hair uses this and I was pretty disappointed. It didn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would and I have to plug it in and wait to use it. It does a good job once it&#x27;s warmed up but just wish I didn&#x27;t have to wait.</li>
            <li> This iron has no heat control, and heats to over 400.  Unfortunately, this small detail is not exactly clear in the product description. This iron is incredibly hot, and is damaging to my fine hair, and I would suspect most hair types.  Outside of this problem, the iron seems well made, and runs smoothly through my hair.  Due to the lack of temperature control, however, I do not recommend this particular FHI iron.</li>
            <li> My Chi straightener broke recently, so I bought this new Fhi straightener. It was nothing compared to the Chi. It took double the time to straighten my hair. It works horribly on wavy/thick hair.. It takes about 10 minutes to heat up and it barely heats up anyway. You can&#x27;t curl it either like you can normally do with the Chi. I had to straighten my hair several times and it still ended up the way it was before I started. I got very frustrated with this straightener it is a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> This tool works as described and I have recommended it to the women in my family. I would purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I think this is my new favorite styling iron. It gets hot enough to really straighten my hair. Loving this Iron....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to FHI products, this is my second FHI styling iron. The first one I owned for almost 4 years, nothing went wrong with it I just dropped it one too many times. All in all the FHI styling iron is an excellent product, it cost a little more than others but you get your moneys worth. I have no complaints and would purchase another one in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> Its doesnt work as well as i expected. i expected the iron to heat up aa little more. Over all its and ok iron.</li>
            <li> Works well, and I have very thick long hair.  No dial it kinda just adjusts itself....bu better cuz it doesnt break my hair   Love FHM great company</li>
            <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s pretty good; I like it.  It gets very hot (which is great if you&#x27;re between relaxers), left my hair shiny and straight, and it glides very easily over the hair.  I&#x27;ve used Gold &#x27;N Hot, and Hot Tools; this left my hair looking much silkier.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a number of flat irons from department/drug stores and have been increasingly dissatisfied with them. Most seem to be heavy, clunky and never heat up enough.  I purchased the FHI iron because my hairdresser highly recommends this brand.  I like it because it is lightweight, heats up quickly and does a fast and efficient job of straightening my hair.  My only caution would be that it does not have an auto shut-off, so you cannot assume that it will turn off if left plugged in.  Other than that, I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased my FHI a little over a year ago. I had a cousin that was in cosmetology and swore by the CHI. At the time I couldn&#x27;t find the CHI easily and Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply carried the FHI. I did research to find out if one was better than the other and found out that they were pretty much the same so I bought the FHI. I loved it immediately. I have 5 daughters with all different grades of hair. It straighten each and every one of them including my daughter&#x27;s where a relaxer still leaves little curls at the edges. It was dropped several times it held up during moves and 3 people using it almost daily. The finale came when someone stepped on it and broke the hinge. I went to Sally&#x27;s to get a replacement, but they no longer carry the brand so I bought the GVP which is supposed to be the equivalent. I am very disappointed with it. I am returning it and buying a FHI off line!</li>
            <li> It took a lot for me to purchase an item this expensive for my hair. Because I needed a break from paying $130-$140 a month for my natural hair in the salon, I did it! The iron is as good as most say it is. I am actually shampooing my hair at home now, only going to the salon for trims/cuts.</li>
            <li> I am all natural and I asked my sister who is in the hair industry about good flat irons for my hair texture and she recommended these. I googled them online and almost paid 149.99 for some FHI flat irons on a different site. Something told me to try amazon since my husband is always ordering things from here and I came across these. I got them in 3 days and I must say I am very impressed. These is the best flat irons I ever had in my possession. I was wondering how did the hair dresser get my hair straight but I could not. I thought I was doing something wrong. Well turns out it was my cheap Wal-Mart flat irons I was using. I washed and blowed dried my hair and let FHI work its magic, even on the spots that was still damp. Yes, it flat irons wet or damp hair. These flat irons is already set at a pre temperature. You never have to adjust the temp or worry about burning your hair because the temperature is to high. After I got done flat ironing and styling my hair it looked just like I walked out of the salon door. I saved myself hundreds in the future. Best product ever.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product this was a replacement for my chi. Heats quickly and easy to handle . I recommend this product we have 3</li>
            <li> Great price. But the iron Broke within 3 months of the purchase. Worked well in the first 3 months but then mysteriously stop heating up.</li>
            <li> do you know why it says check the enclosed brochure under warranty? That&#x27;s because your WARRANTY IS EFFECTIVE ONLY IF YOU HAVE A VALID RECEIPT FROM A PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY SALON OR OTHER SELECT AUTHORIZED BEAUTY PRODUCTS RESELLER OR IF YOU PURCHASE THE PRODUCT FROM THE CORPORATE WEBSITE LOCATED AT [...] THE WARRANTY IS NOT EFFECTIVE IF THE FHI HEAT STYLING TOOL WAS PURCHASED FROM ANY SOURCE NOT LISTED ABOVE, INCLUDING ANY INTERNET RESELLER OR AUCTION SITE. Just wanted to get that info out there. Otherwise good product, happy with mine. Screwed if breaks. [...]</li>
            <li> My original FHI flat iron died and I purchased this one to replace it.  It was shipped to me quickly and in great condition.  It&#x27;s been working well so far!  :)</li>
            <li> I just decided to go natural and I have natural curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just switched to all natural after cutting off my dreads and therefore used a regular flat iron and blow dryer but boy does that not work with natural hair! So I did A LOT of research and found out that FHI products were the BEST for course, natural hair. My natural hair is super curly by the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the same day I decided to get this flat iron along with the \\&quot;Fhi Heat Platform Nano Salon Pro 2000 Powerful Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer, Black\\&quot; from Amazon. I have never been so satisfied with a product! Using my old flat iron I had HORRIBLE ends (looked like me hair was breaking off) and when I used my old cheap blow dryer it takes about 10-15 minutes I swear with the FHI blow dyer it takes only 5 minutes INCLUDING a cold blast(I&#x27;ll explain later)! I&#x27;m just always amazed at each stroke and hair I flat iron at home it makes it look so easy and I really do have salon hair quality hair! Better to pay about $100 for this then $100 at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my hair routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash with conditioner first&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash with shampoo last because this makes sure theres no residue left over like how we sometimes get when conditioning last&lt;br /&gt;3.Apply a heat protectant (whatever you have that works for you) I usually use a creamy runny liquid to apply to my damp hair before blowdrying&lt;br /&gt;4.Comb through hair with wide tooth comp to detangle before blow-drying&lt;br /&gt;5. Blow dry using the FHI blow dryer with the comb piece attached&lt;br /&gt;6. After whole head is blow dried with heat go all over once again with COLD air which closes th hairs cuticle back up to reduce frizz.&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply another heat protectant(either whole hair or sections) I usually section all my hair before doing this and apply it to each section before I flat iron it)&lt;br /&gt;8. Section hair&lt;br /&gt;9. Start with a section and apply heat serum to that section and flat iron&lt;br /&gt;10. Use a frizz/humidity shine to hold hair if you like..thats what i do.ir if you like..thats what i do.</li>
            <li> Best styling iron ever, not too hot, easy to handle, styles great, would like an automatic shut off, but great anyway</li>
            <li> I have used FHI for years.  I love their product and it works and straightens hair like never before.  The only thing is that after years of using it I noticed that this product does strip the hair and dry it.  They are extremely hot and either  the protective plates aren&#x27;t good enough or it has to be replaced after 1 or 2 years.  Great  but treat your hair regularly or replace after a while.</li>
            <li> Let me preface my review by saying that I do not intend to cast aspersions on the product&#x27;s integrity....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an FHI because my stylist has used one for years and it&#x27;s great. She&#x27;s had the same one all this time, so I thought they would be long lasting! She bought hers at an authorized outlet however. I bought mine on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;So for about a year (not even quite a year) this was a great flat iron! But I noticed that it has been slowly losing heating ability. It may have started a lot earlier and I just didn&#x27;t notice that I was having to make multiple passes over my hair, or that I had to use smaller and smaller swatches, until it became an issue. Once this thing started to really act like a cheap Target iron, I had to admit defeat. For what it&#x27;s worth, I do not see bad reviews about these irons that are purchased at authorized resale dealers, so it does make me question why my iron (which I paid much more than this current Amazon pricing for) did not last. I&#x27;ll let you decide whether I have a refurbished, fake, or real product. Anywhere else you look, FHI has a stellar reputation. (Not so much when purchased here, I cringe to say)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I replaced my FHI with a KeratinPerfect. [[ASIN:B0055BQZ62 KeratinPerfect PerfectLight Deluxe 1.5-Inch Infrared Smoothing Iron 1.5\\&quot;]] This thing totally blew me away in performance, but I returned it due to a suspected electrical short inside of it, and did not have the guts to buy another. As much as I loved this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to be an alarmist but when it comes to high end products that have a warranty when purchased through an authorized reseller, I would point you in that direction if you want an FHI iron. An iron is not a &#x27;deal&#x27; if it doesn&#x27;t last very long. If you have to buy another iron, what kind of deal did you really get?</li>
            <li> its very light in weight, curls nicely has different temperture for adjustement fot the heat great buy, thanks you u</li>
            <li> perfect!  Works great. I use this every morning and love how soft it makes my hair feel and shiny it looks</li>
            <li> i had read reviews and i seen that the one con was that it was only one temp but i bought it any way and not i understand why they gave it that review.  It will work for now but i was looking for one to stay hot so that i could get through my hair a lot faster.</li>
            <li> This flat iron I&#x27;d say is ok....It doesnt glide smooth like I thought it would.  It snags the hair and thats what i didnt want.  I wouldnt purchase this product again not a good flat iron at all.  Its like the bootleg version..</li>
            <li> I expected more from this iron, it wasn&#x27;t any better then a brand i bought for $20, I will pass on it!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and really loves it. She says it does not dry out her hair, it heats quickly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Was super excited to get my new fhi flat iron.  A friend had one and was very impressed by the quality of the iron.  The item took more then the expected delivery date.  Got the iron and it didnt have the heat settings that i thought it would have.  Description wasnt clear of that.  Tried to call the number listed to see if i could return the iron and get my money back but the number was out of order.  Went online and left feedback about what had happened.  Months later a lady contacted me saying that she had read the feedback i had left and was sorry that i was unhappy with the item.  She said that she would let me keep the iron and give me a full refund if i took the feedback off.  I agreed, since the lady was so nice and convincing. She said it would take 48 hours for the refund to be in my account.  I never received the refund.  So this is my last effort to warn people NOT TO BUY from these people.</li>
            <li> I have a 1\\&quot; FHI iron and love it.  I have extremely think wavy hair and looks like I was born with straight hair after using.  It says right in the description that it heats up to over 400 degrees.  It also doesn&#x27;t state that it has a temperature control, which it doesn&#x27;t, and it shouldn&#x27;t.  In order for a flat iron to be really effective at straightening hair, it has to get HOT and this one does.  It is a great iron.  I had mine for over 2 years before the cord got a short and am ordering a new one.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased my hair styling products from Walmart, Target, etc.  While their products are good, I wanted something that would reach a higher temperature and keep my hair from frizzing.  This brand was suggested by a professional stylist and, so far, I have been impressed.  I would recommend this styling iron to anyone desiring less frizz after styling.</li>
            <li> the plates heat up really fast and they glide over ur hair. much better than the conair one i had</li>
            <li> I first fell love with this flat iron about 2 years ago as a professional stylist. Since then, 3 have failed on me, including the one the one I just purchased on 12/20/10. Stay away from this line....</li>
            <li> this is literally the best straightener I have ever had. It makes my hair so soft after and actually changes the texture of my hair!</li>
            <li> Works awesome! Showed up way before expected. Bought it as a gift for my wife and she told me she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron, i purchased it because this is the one i had for about four years before it finally died and i loved it so much i bought another one. the quality is good and leaves your hair soft and shiny, however the actual structure of it is not all that fabulous. my recent one was perfect until the day it gave out, but this one top bar is already loose, bending left and right like crazy and i have only had it about two weeks. i don&#x27;t know if i just got a defective one or what, but I&#x27;m hoping its doesn&#x27;t give out.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron Ive ever owned. Does the job in 1/2 of the time drugstore brand flat irons do &amp; Im African American w/ natural hair. Once Im done I look like I have a relaxer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hot as my GHD, but it&#x27;s great for touch ups when the GHD is overkill. It doesn&#x27;t have manual controls for heat, which I don&#x27;t like, I don&#x27;t think it senses my hair needs a higher heat though it&#x27;s advertised as being able to adjust itself for your hair. Or maybe it doesn&#x27;t want to fry my hair... but either way, not a bad straightener, definitely beats any Conair or Revlon I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned. The tourmaline makes all the difference in the world! It heats up very fast. It makes my hair super smooth and shiny in half of the time and mother price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair(think Scary Spice lol) and this iron does get it pretty  straight. I  wish it was a  bit hotter. I  have  had an  FHI  iron in the past with  temperature settings. I was under the impression that this would  be  the same.So don&#x27;t get  me wrong I  do like this flat iron, but  miss the temperature options. So overall if you have normal to medium thick  hair I think you will love it!</li>
            <li> I chose 4 instead of 5 because I believe I read that the light will go off when it reaches it&#x27;s highest temperature.  I never saw the light go out.  Other than that I love it.  I have been natural for a few years and have not been able to flat iron my own hair until I got this flat iron.  I am still having a little trouble with the ends.  But I do love the iron. I would recommend this iron to anyone that needs one.  Well after I sell the three that I have.</li>
            <li> Bought this a while back, still works really well.  I&#x27;m very happy with this, wish it had an auto shut off but no big deal.  Heats up FAST. Gets plenty hot.  I&#x27;m very picky with these, and this one made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Falling apart, doesnt stay open. Doesnt work right, heat fully or evenly.  Very unhappy and need a new one. UGH!</li>
            <li> I am natural and have thick somewhat coarse hair and these flat irons make my hair look as if I have been to a salon and got a relaxer.</li>
            <li> love love love love love love love love love this product! it is amazing! i recommend it for everyone to try</li>
            <li> The cosmotologist enjoy working with this Flat iron. It reaches the desired temp and is easy to use. Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the older one which stopped working after 6 years of use. very reliable at a low price</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing [but keep in mind I use to have had a cheap conair one]. You can curl it, or keep it bone straight. If you want one with a temperature control, I might suggest to buy the upgraded version, which is also available on amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the flat iron because it doesn&#x27;t get as hot on the outside as some others; less likely to burn myself. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Chi, but still does a good job.</li>
            <li> I loved these when I first got them, but after a little they seemed not to get as hot. seemed liked would have lasted longer for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right amount of heat for my hair. I have very thick hair and the flat irons I was using before this one weren&#x27;t getting hot enough to really do anything for my head. Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for 1.5 years now, and it has broken all of my hair around my crown to where little pieces stick out everywhere. It gets too hot and there is NO temperature control.  I have had to spend significant money trying to repair my damaged hair.  I do not damage my hair any other way (I am a brunette and dont bleach my hair and rarely use a blow dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last flat iron was a Solano Sapphire which I had for 9 years and worked GREAT without damaging my hair. I wish they still made one. I have thick hair which is also wavy. Despite this iron being hot and destructive, it still doesn&#x27;t take all of the frizz out of my hair like my old iron did. I do not recommend purchasing this iron for those that have thin or delicate hair.  Get an iron with temperature control.</li>
            <li> It works great on my hair and leaves it looking just as nice as the hair salons I love it!</li>
            <li> While FHI may not have top-of-the-line hair straighteners - no, it doesn&#x27;t heat up in 4 seconds and no, it doesn&#x27;t adjust temperature to your hair type or automatically turn off if you leave it on - it remains without a doubt my favorite brand.  My last FHI hair straightener lasted 8 years and still worked like new! And even then, the structure itself fell apart before the straightener ever burned out or lost heat.  After my beloved FHI died, I decided to give a more high-end brand a try, and bought a GHD.  I&#x27;ve only owned it two days and am taking it back today; for $100 more, it didn&#x27;t get as hot as my FHI and kept pulling and breaking my hair!  Definitely buying another FHI ASAP!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where to contact the seller but I was wondering if I can use this product in the netherlands with a 2 hole socket. I don&#x27;t mind using an adapter but am not sure if the voltage would ruin the product. Will I have to pay for the postage back to America if I want to return this item?&lt;br /&gt;I hope somebody can help me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron and it&#x27;s great. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. It glides smoothly through the hair.  I wish it would automatically shut off after a bit.  It would save me from so many \\&quot;oh my gosh, did I unplug the iron?\\&quot; return trips home!</li>
            <li> After my KQC Red Devil Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron broke only after a year and a half I started to shop around online for reviews on some other hair straighteners. I&#x27;m happy I bought the FHI Heat Technique G2, I can&#x27;t live without a flat iron, so as soon as mine broke I ordered it off of Amazon, I usually get my orders from Amazon at least 5 days earlier then the date they give me and so it was a nice surprise as usual when it showed up a week early! I have medium-length thick wavy hair, and the G2 takes no time at all to straighten it all. The only down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t have controlled temperature like most, but I find the heat it gets up to is really hot but perfect for my hair, it doesn&#x27;t fry it. Overall I would definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s a great price for such great quality!</li>
            <li> I was under the impression from the description that it has a heat control dial. Sadly it did not and i was unable to return it. Other than that it does get hot fast and i havent had any issue with it. Does not seem to be a cheaply made item and it does its job. Just glad i didnt pay 100+ bucks for it.</li>
            <li> I do like how they straighten my hair and makes it really shinny.  I don&#x27;t like however that it doesn&#x27;t have where you can set the tempature yourself.  I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that it&#x27;s just an on and off switch.  Other than that, they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Just opened flat iron and used last night and the results were amazing. No tugging or snagging. No burning smell and my hair was smooth and shiny. Use a heat protector. Seller delivered fast, and flat iron is in quality condition. Price is much lower than on actual FHI website.</li>
            <li> This is by far the very best flat iron on the market! This is also the best price you will find for an authentic FHI! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It does not get as hot as the details says. I have to run the flat irons like ten times to get them straight like I like.</li>
            <li> The FHI Heat Technique G2 flat iron works well. It heats up fast and straightens hair thoroughly. The only problem I have had so far is with the FHI emblem breaking off. I used some crazy glue and was able to put it back on.</li>
            <li> Bout this about a year ago. Works 10x better than my other straightener. Heats up quickly and does a decent job on my unmanageable hair</li>
    </ol>
