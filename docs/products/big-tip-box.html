            <li>Super useful.</li>
            <li>Numbers 0, an 1 are large and could not all fit.  </li>
            <li>this is nicely spacious and big</li>
            <li>The box is ok for holding most sized nail tips, but when it arrived some of the numbers on the box were missing.  </li>
            <li>Item was a lot smaller than it looked on the picture it took forever to come, but its OK, will I shop from this company again, maybe.</li>

            <li>but this totally works for quick organization.</li>
            <li>Just right for the nails I ordered; however the larger size just made it.  </li>
            <li>i order the 500 count tip nails and it was big enough to fit all of them the only thing is my nails</li>
            <li>Update: did not receive 8 inch box but receive  the 6 inch box clearly not the same box as the first order.</li>
            <li>But the top came broken.  </li>

            <li> Box was smaller then I thought it would be (Big Tip Box). I guess I should have looked for dimensions/or measurments before I purchsed. It will work ok.  I also should have looked to see where it was shipping from. Another bummer, took alomost a month to receive. Oh well</li>
