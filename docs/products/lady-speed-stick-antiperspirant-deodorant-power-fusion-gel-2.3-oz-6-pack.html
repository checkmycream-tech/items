            <li> This is my favorite anti perspirant of all time. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on clothes and works well. The scent is feminine without being cloying and doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a pleasant scent, does it&#x27;s job well. However, I am not sure what is there in the formula that it bleached my shirt in the underarm area to the degree that I have to throw the shirt away!!! As much as I loved that shirt and sorry to let it go, I am more concerned about the health effects the ingredients in the deodorant may induce, including breast cancer. I would not use it again ever!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product.  I don&#x27;t know why you don&#x27;t see it in the stores anymore but it works for me to buy it here.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as their non-gel. There is a higher percentage aluminum too.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for stocking this deodorant.  I cannot always find this type in the stores, so it&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;ve got a place to go!!!</li>

            <li> Never lets me down&lt;br /&gt;I have worn this deodorant for more than 10 years&lt;br /&gt;is the only deodorant that truly doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, I can put it on and no worry&lt;br /&gt;It works really for 24hrs. Sometimes I forget to put it on the next day and still works&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never discontinue this because I always find it hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not overbearing. Both my gal and I use it. I&#x27;m not too particular and having only one stick in the cabinet is convenient. Applies clear and I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining.</li>

            <li> This is becoming harder to find in my area for whatever reason and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s the only deodorant I can use without a reaction. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 15 years now and love the product. Even when I worked as a mechanic in the hot and humid weather this worked well.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! It smells sooo good, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m glad amazon has this, because I can never find it at a drugstore or at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra tip: If your worried about the drying time, and avoiding that wet, sticky feeling, use a blow dryer (it sounds silly, I know) on the COOL setting. Putting some air on it should do the trick, and shorten the drying time (:</li>
