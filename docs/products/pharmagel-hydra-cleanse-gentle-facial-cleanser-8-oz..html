            <li> Awesome product!!! I&#x27;ve used this years ago and thought it was discontinued but I got lucky and found it here. My skin is baby soft and glowing. I call this the fountain of youth in a bottle...</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle on the skin. I have sensitive skin and many other products I used irritated it. This one cleans pretty good without irritating.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used - and I have tried lots. It feels silky, but does a good job of cleansing the face. The scent is light and very appealing, even relaxing. Not drying at all and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Makes washing my face more of a pleasure than a chore.</li>
            <li> I am a cupon girl.  I already use this from a spa.  They closed and I found it on amazon.  It is sooooo much cheaper, Yeah!!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by an esthetician, so I was aware of its quality.   It is gentle but thorough and even takes off eye makeup easily.  I love the pump, too...no messy soap bar.  I also use Pharmagel&#x27;s moisterizer, facial scrub and mask.  I am a woman of age (61) with oily T-zone. Hydra Cleanse works great for me.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works well with my clairsonic. I started noticeing a difference in my complexion right away.  It feels and looks so much cleaner. I like that it stops gunk from building up in my pores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quit sometime....I would recommend...I&#x27;m 66 yrs old my face looks young and pretty....</li>
            <li> This product, which I ordered with the Vitamin-C Treatment, was not gentle to my skin.  I used it only once and broke out with red splotches.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT... exceeded expectations... THANKS, J</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I enjoy this product as much as others. I hated the smell; it reminds of those cheap Dial handsoaps.

The pros to this cleanser - it takes off makeup easily, has a great bottle function with the pump, and it has many natural ingredients that are paraban free. Overall, I will stick to Meaningful Beauty until someone shows me a better one.</li>
            <li> I was sold the first time I used this product. It is amazing on my skin and helps prevent irritation and break outs.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It was recommended by my facialist  and I buy it from amazon every month or so. Great deal. Look for the other product from this line-- fabulous!</li>
            <li> Very silky and gentle.  No residue.</li>
            <li> love this cleanser in the morning just a clean and light cleaner i use this in the mornings so far am loving the products i have tried</li>
            <li> Looking for a alternative to Obagi which is overpriced, I noticed this and since it has great reviews I bought it, glad i did it is great cleanser!</li>
            <li> Cleanse face before bed, and prep before makeup.  Gently removes all makeup and &#x27;life&#x27; from the day; makes &#x27;way&#x27; for fresh application of makeup.</li>
            <li> Exactly as it states  good cleanser</li>
            <li> Excellent facial cleanser specially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Pharmagel @ JC Penny by an esthetician tried it and LOVED it. Its gentle on my face (i have sensitive skin :-() However, they are now discontinuing it :-( I was sooo excited to see Amazon had these products and might I add, at a MUCH lower price than JCP... This find made my morning!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the Pharmagel line when I had a facial done a number of years ago.  I have always thought my skin problematic well into adulthood. I have struggled with enlarged pores, oily skin, cystic acne etc.  After using Hydra Cleanse I discovered that indeed my skin was sensitive (not acne/oily teenage skin that never grew up) and that my former cleansing regimen was counter productive.  I love Hydra Cleanse, it is gentle, but thoroughly cleans my skin w/o over drying it. It is a bit pricier than OTC products but it does not break the bank.  I find it well worth the cost. An occasional break out still occurs but the amount of cover up/make up I am using is way down and there are some days when I find going without make up isn&#x27;t going to scare the store clerk or the bank teller.  I have a hard time finding this brand where I live so thanks to Amazon, what I need arrives in a few days.  Give it a try, I think you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent product  it is a gentle cleanse for my type skin. Will order again with other pharmagel products try it you will like it</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and I have washed my face religiously at night for as far back as I can remember.  This is the BEST cleanser I have ever used. I also use it with my Clarsonic  Mia.  My face is so soft and feels thoroughly clean.  AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser so much. I find that it clears up my skin. It makes my skin feel lovely and smells equally wonderful. Would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and will definitely reorder. I have tried numerous facial products to address my sensitive, aging skin type.  This is the first product that leaves my skin feeling firm, youthful and completely hydrated and has no greasy/oily feeling.  Other products have caused blemishes to appear. I have used the both the  Pharmagel cleaning and lotion and I am well pleased with both.  I intend to try other products from this line as well.</li>
            <li> I give this product a five star as I was having problems with white heads. Well, after using their thus cleanser for 6 weeks I now have nice looking skin once again. I also use their toner and moisturizer. I recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Gigi from Clearlake, Ca.</li>
