            <li>I know there are great clips for your hair out there.</li>
            <li>These however are so great I have used them for over 12 years.</li>
            <li>I knew they wouldn&#x27;t be perfect because they were cheap.</li>
            <li>Good for the purpose it was purchased for.</li>
            <li>A generous supply for a very reasonable price makes for a happy customer!</li>
            <li>, I love them!</li>
            <li>They are OK, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>They are very cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>These clamps are very cheaply made and on most the sides don&#x27;t even line up.</li>
            <li>If I was spending more than $5 bucks for them, I would be pissed.</li>
            <li>Most of them where warped.</li>
            <li>I need too many of them to hold my hair when when I&#x27;m straightening for curling.</li>
            <li>However, if your hair is heavier, then I think you&#x27;d be pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I expect they would okay for coloring hair</li>
            <li>However, I have fine hair so the clips don&#x27;t always stay in place.</li>
            <li>Seem cheap quality.</li>
            <li>They feel cheap, but they do what they need to do and the price was right!</li>

            <li>Spend a few more dollars and get better quality clips!!</li>
            <li>They are great clips, I have hair that is on the thinner side, and they do hold it well, but i find myself adjusting frequently if my hair is pin straight because it slides through easily but other than that</li>
            <li>These butterfly clips hold up nice, tight, and neatly.</li>
            <li>The clamps arrived on time and were packaged very well so no breakage problems.  </li>
            <li>You get enough clamps and price is right.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and have a hard time finding clips to hold my hair.</li>
            <li>So glad I added these small clamps onto my Wahl Clip and Trim order.  </li>
            <li>I do not like any other claw clips simply because my hair is to fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used similar clips in the past that were made of more durable plastic, these just don&#x27;t hold up that well.  </li>

            <li> Definitely what I got them for. I knew they wouldn&#x27;t be perfect because they were cheap. For the price, they do the job. If I was spending more than $5 bucks for them, I would be pissed.</li>

            <li> They feel cheap, but they do what they need to do and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Clamps well without pulling hair</li>
            <li> Most of them where warped. Not to the point that they don&#x27;t work but enough to be annoying.</li>
            <li> Just the size I was looking for. Well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar clips in the past that were made of more durable plastic, these just don&#x27;t hold up that well.  They are very cheap and flimsy.  Spend a few more dollars and get better quality clips!!</li>

            <li> Larger than I realized.  Seem cheap quality.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair back when I&#x27;m trimming it. It does it&#x27;s job and I have no real problem with it at all.</li>
            <li> I know there are great clips for your hair out there. These however are so great I have used them for over 12 years. (Not the same clips just the same style clips) They are not only cheap but don&#x27;t leave those awful clip marks in your hair.</li>
            <li> Came on time as was what it was advertised to be. Good for the purpose it was purchased for. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, choppy hair and these just dont work for me.  I need too many of them to hold my hair when when I&#x27;m straightening for curling.</li>
            <li> The size of the clips was what I was looking for. However, I have fine hair so the clips don&#x27;t always stay in place. For this reason alone, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these Butterfly Clamps. However, if your hair is heavier, then I think you&#x27;d be pleased with this purchase. You get enough clamps and price is right.</li>
            <li> Great for really long hair.</li>
            <li> Basic but gets the job done.  I use them everyday to take care of my hair and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them yet.</li>
            <li> I got these to help me with my morning hair styling routine. They are OK, nothing spectacular. They do catch hair occasionally but not too bad</li>
            <li> These clamps are very cheaply made and on most the sides don&#x27;t even line up. I expect they would okay for coloring hair but that&#x27;s it.</li>
