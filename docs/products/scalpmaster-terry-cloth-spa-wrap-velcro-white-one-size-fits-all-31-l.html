            <li> Very thin, will not help dry. Velcro closure poorly made. I gave it to my wife to wrap our dog in it&lt;br /&gt;after he has a bath.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for my wife and it is much thinner than expected.  She has another wrap towel which is nearly twice as thick.  Other than that it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> This product serves a purpose - covering up in the gym locker room after a shower.  Terry cloth should be absorbent like a towel.  This product is more like a fuzzy t-shirt and absorbs nothing.</li>
            <li> I just ordered one to see if I liked it - after using and washing it a few times, I decided to order more for my esthetics business.  The Velcro is really strong  - which is what I was having trouble with on other wraps I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  I wish the terry cloth was a little better quality, but it is soft and so far is washing good.</li>
            <li> Love it. Washes up great!</li>
            <li> This fits big boosoms. Great XXL size. The quality is a little cheap. I have washed it 3 times and I suggest staying away from HIGH heat in the dryer. It makes the fabric melt and makes it rough feeling.</li>
            <li> The length on this towel is great but it is very thin and hardly absorbs any water. I would not recommend</li>
            <li> service was extremely speedy; price was great; and reviews were correct--my husband loves the wrap for getting out and in from his early morning out on the porch hot tub soak!</li>
            <li> I like this type of wrap to lounge around in. Easy to wash and dry. I use it when sun bathing in my backyard</li>
            <li> This wrap is good fit for men or women of many sizes. It&#x27;s a little in the thin side but it serves it&#x27;s purpose well for what it was purchased for. It&#x27;s held up in several washes. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> its fine, it functions - its NOT what I would call absorbent.  i just use it in the sauna though so it works for me.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this material...very soft!</li>
            <li> This towel is very soft, and the quality is very good too. Feels good on the skin. I haven&#x27;t washed and dried it yet so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll shrink a lot. However, it is a good length, I love it.</li>
            <li> Super soft, great velco and fits most people! Will definately order again</li>
            <li> Product is slightly see through, but I use it to get ready for work and to go out, so its not an issue. I like the product and the Velcro stays on tightly.</li>
            <li> Nice wrap but was a little pricey for the material it made from does not see to absorbent. Prefer Turkish or Egyptian Cottons.</li>
            <li> I like. But not fit heavy women</li>
            <li> This product is Very nice, I embroideried on three of them and gave them as graduation gifts.  Just the perfect&lt;br /&gt;thing.</li>
            <li> Soft and durable. Not ideal for plus size clients.</li>
            <li> This was cheaper than what I thought and fabric was thinner.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose, has not pilled or become inferior in anyway yet. Overall, would repurchase</li>
