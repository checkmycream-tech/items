            <li>over all very happy with my purchase, and i would recommend this product highly.</li>

            <li>It is a gorgeous wig came earlier then expect which made me a very happy camper.</li>
            <li>Very easy to comb-if you know how to comb hair correctly.</li>
            <li>but it can get tangled very easily  </li>
            <li>Very nice quality- quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>, but really, I&#x27;m usually able to get wigs that are really nice for this price.</li>
            <li>Its soooooooooooooooooooooo beautiful and real looking!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to restyle bangs to suit!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really complain it got here on time, and is absolutely beautiful</li>
            <li>The wig has turned out to be very shiny, beautiful and attractive-looking.</li>
            <li>the wig stayed on with ease and was very comfortable,</li>
            <li>Nice and long, shiny, smells good and came in just 13 days!!</li>
            <li>, I would sure hope so).</li>
            <li>Got many compliments and cannot wait to wear it as Marceline at otakon.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with it!</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars, but I would buy wigs from this seller again, mostly for halloween though.</li>
            <li>best to only wear once..</li>
            <li>but it looks ok on.</li>
            <li>Lovely wig.</li>
            <li>LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;Fit</li>
            <li>It would probably be ok if you took it out of the packaging just before you were to wear it.</li>
            <li>just a bit shiny also has a skin top</li>
            <li>Pretty nice wig !</li>
            <li>,  I love it.</li>
            <li>, it was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Trust me, you can do better.</li>
            <li>This item is lovely</li>
            <li>I think the wig is excellent and does the job much better than a wig you can buy at party city for double or triple the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it ended up being an ok texture</li>
            <li>It would have been better</li>
            <li>I think if I had more experience with wigs.</li>
            <li>so if you want a thicker look, make sure to use extensions or clip-</li>
            <li>Positively a wonderful product and actually arrived a week before estimated time.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>you need a wig for a costume you&#x27;re only going to wear once, this suits your needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>You may be able to fix the thinness problem with some extensions.</li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice wig!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love this wig.</li>
            <li>it is made of a better material and that makes a difference.</li>
            <li>15 year old daughter searched all reviews before purchasing this wig for her costume, the price was cheaper than buying and finding the wig within our shopping area even with paying for expedited shipping, it arrived on time and looked great and was easy to manage and keep on, my daughter was very pleased</li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that it came super quickly, the wig itself is great.</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent and really does look very real.</li>
            <li>I loved this wig very much.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is pretty good quality for 10 dollars.</li>
            <li>Used item for a cosplay- was able to braid it easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super shiny and nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got soft strands, and as an experienced cosplayer who owns many wigs, I like this one.</li>
            <li>Shipping was better then I expected and the wig was awesome.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this wig and it was perfect for Marceline from adventure time!</li>
            <li>Glad it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I got this wig a day sooner than expected, which was awesome.</li>
            <li>Being her she got the wig completely ruined lol.</li>
            <li>fast shipping good quality</li>
            <li>but if careful looks very nice :) i liked it over all</li>
            <li>Great customer service when it was a day late, but it was worth it because it is really nice and great quality.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>That said, if you want a wig you&#x27;ll be able to use several times, your best bet is to invest in a higher quality one.</li>
            <li>for the money, it is the best wig compared to other costume wigs that I have bought for my wife.  </li>
            <li>However, it tangles EXTREMELY easily.  </li>
            <li>It tangles way to easy</li>
            <li>it tangles easy and its thinish and its</li>
            <li>and you can easily see the netting.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>But tangles really easy.</li>
            <li>It does knot up but with detangler spray, it comes out easily.</li>
            <li>It gets tangled easily but for cosplaying it gets the job done</li>
            <li>So you can see the mesh is easily visible.</li>
            <li>Easy to move.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>A bit long but very good for the price</li>
            <li>it was off a model;s wish list, she receieved it fast enough, and had good things to say, i&#x27;ll count it as a win in the gift department</li>
            <li>But the hair is silky, brushes smooth and easily braids.</li>
            <li>it were the bangs, which is fine since I need to style them anyway (I&#x27;m cosplaying as Homura and this wig fits it).</li>
            <li>but the length is fine.</li>
            <li>so i am fine with that.</li>
            <li>so if you just brush it after every time you use it, it should be fine.</li>
            <li>It doesnt tangle as easily as most cosplay wigs and a lot of people questioned me if it was my real hair, it&#x27;s VERY good quality, feels like real hair and very affordable.</li>
            <li>The wig itself sheds a lot, but it made a fantastic Marceline the Vampire Queen halloween wig.</li>
            <li>real hair.\\&quot;  Amazing.  </li>
            <li>no, there were no tangles, and I was just lightly running my brush through the wig.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve cut and styled them to your liking, this is a great wig, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very silky and nice quality.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>Overall great quality wig.</li>
            <li>Plus it came with a free wig cap.</li>
            <li>Smooth adn Shiny.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t fit to my head</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find a wig this inexpensive, but it&#x27;s a really good quality wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice wig, yes, but it definitely looks like a wig.</li>
            <li>I was originally shipped a shorter brown wig by accident.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap and easy wig that looks exactly as it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li>It looked good and was comfortable throughout most of the day even if it was a mess by the end.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it fits great and bangs are perfect for cutting!</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels, kinda gets tangled a lot if not hung properly but is really beautiful on</li>
            <li>wig was cheap though, and for the quality, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cheap price, but it nearly isn&#x27;t worth it with how tangled it is.</li>
            <li>i cannot believe how nice and soft the hair was.</li>
            <li>my daughter was doing I will be buying more wigs from this company if my daughters wants to keep cosplaying.</li>
            <li>so it look a bit more real.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s really looks real !!!!</li>
            <li>I cut the bangs of this wig and it was pretty easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>such excellent quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>it looked more realistic that way anyway.</li>
            <li>I even ordered another wig from taobaopit because of their quick service.</li>
            <li>Its still a great wig for such a low price :3</li>
            <li>Because it was my first one I didn&#x27;t realize what a pain it is to keep it tangle free because of the length.</li>
            <li>and doesnt look all that real on certain areas</li>
            <li>However, this wig became tangled VERY easily, with light wear (it was only worn for standing around to take pictures).</li>
            <li>the wig was lovely to work with, and it was easy to style with and alter for my future cosplay.</li>
            <li>The wig is almost super soft and I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li>Amazing wig really soft and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>I now have an amazing wig for Halloween next year!</li>
            <li>It has provided her hours of fun</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try a wig just for fun.</li>
            <li>I mainly use is as a Tsubaki cosplay wig and it is easy to put in a pony tail.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Really long and easy to comb and style, so I was able to cut it exactly how I wanted!</li>
            <li>i take back what i had originally said about this product,though it was a bit thin for my liking after a bit of work,and a trim it was a lovely wig and is still holding up perfectly.</li>
            <li>It feels soft and smooth and smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It was easy to comb through and easy enough to manage.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even the right length.</li>
            <li>I hope so, because right now I have to keep it in a braid to be wearable.</li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW</li>
            <li>Super long (i&#x27;m &#x27;5&#x27;&#x27;8 and the bottom of the hair hits my waist line), super fun, really cheap - no complaints!</li>
            <li>Though, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars simply because it took some effort to style and it tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>The only problem with this wig is that is does tangle very easily.</li>
            <li>Which worked out great because im 5&#x27;10 and the wig reached me at the top part of my thighs in front and a little bit pass my butt in the back.</li>
            <li>The fibers make the wig feel just like silky hair, and the black color has such a delicious, shiny coat to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it gets messy and tangles easily and requires patience to keep looking nice.</li>
            <li>This is the first wig I ever bought and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>The wig is very long and not too hard to work with I was able to great the jasmine look and everyone loved how long the wig is.</li>
            <li>Its very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>it tangles soooo much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what my daughter was after</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like in the pictures.</li>
            <li>The wig is exactly as picture.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as shown</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying a wig</li>
            <li>All if my friend got crazy about it :) it&#x27;s soooo Beautiful...... &amp; soooft</li>
            <li>and it worked very well!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this wig if its your first time getting one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>of course it will tangle like real hair!</li>
            <li>wore this wig for my Marceline cosplay at Phoenix Comic Con.</li>
            <li>its very silky and soft and even though it tangles easy</li>
            <li>Really pleased with how it feels- very soft and natural.</li>
            <li>Though it was easy to get tangled, not to mention it  was super long...</li>
            <li>The only reason anyone knew it wasn&#x27;t my real hair was my friends cause well my hair isn&#x27;t that long lol,</li>
            <li>It was soft and silky, and no matter how hot the room is, it always feels cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you comb it and groom it a lot, because like any long wig, it gets tangled and frizzy after a lot of use.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast too</li>
            <li>Soft, full, shiny, and now she wears it to cosplay.</li>
            <li>I have wigs longer then this one made with  100% Japanese Kanekalon high quality made fiber that have never tangled and feel alot better then</li>
            <li>If im lucky i can repurpose some of this into doll hair since its not worth the work to use on my head.the ONLY good thing i can say is shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a nice, pure black.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most amazing Black long wig ever!!</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft and not overly shinny as most low quality wigs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the hair to be as fine a quality as it did (Very low price, after all)</li>
            <li>The hair is nice and thick, and while it&#x27;s got the unnatural shine, I think it looks good on black hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so  realistic!</li>
            <li>, it was very tangled.</li>
            <li>For a cheaper wig I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>It is really shiny, but that might go away with time.</li>
            <li>It sheds, not too much, but it does shed.</li>
            <li>Wore it for Halloween, people thought it was real.</li>
            <li>and it does not have too much hair</li>
            <li>and it almost felt like real hair</li>
            <li>It tangles fast</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont expect people to think this is your real hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;With fast shipping</li>
            <li>it looks and feels real.</li>
            <li>This DOES happen with real hair this length</li>
            <li>it cause it left room for you to style it to fit your look</li>
            <li>This wig is way better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Everyone thinks its my real hair.</li>
            <li>But for $15 you really can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I used kids de-tangles spray and that really seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>looks and feels like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Terrific fit.</li>
            <li>wig is perfect for anything: Halloween, video game and Anime conventions, daily use, mannequins, etc.</li>
            <li>it looks nice, it&#x27;s super thick, hair is pretty soft..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s far from real hair quality but taken car of right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very thin and doesn&#x27;t look very good .</li>
            <li>This company was quick to send me a replacement wig at no extra cost when my first one was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li>It gets tangled easily but it&#x27;s a long wig</li>
            <li>I would have liked a little more hair on it and less tangle</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very long but easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Also, the cap is really snug so if you have a fairly decent sized head I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying.</li>
            <li>its so soft and looks pretty real to me :D.</li>
            <li>A decent wig for the price with many options for styling due to its length.</li>
            <li>Its very long, go in expecting tangles, however with a nice brush and patience its no big deal.</li>
            <li>It tangles easily, but thats normal for a long wig.  </li>
            <li>Its veeeryy long and smooth</li>
            <li>This wig looks amazing at first, but gets frizzy very quickly, and is slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li>A little on the thin side and gets tangled very easily but otherwise a good wig.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to shape your eyebrows and then fill them in or shade them with a black eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>and it was a decent price as well</li>
            <li>it will work as a fairly realistic wig.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will most likely not make the same mistake</li>
            <li>tangles very easy only cause its very long</li>
            <li>Anyways, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The quality itself is pretty realistic too, and although it does tend to tangle easily, what else can you expect from such a long wig.</li>
            <li>It is a nice wig, and exactly as pictured - including the extremely long bangs in the front, which you will definitely have to pin back or cut in your desired style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very realistic and soft.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was that it tangles up real fast</li>
            <li>It is soft and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>id ship it back but its not even worth the cost of gas to bring it to the post office.</li>
            <li>A single wig provided more than enough material to meet my needs.</li>
            <li>That turned into a big mess and I ended up just throwing the thing in the trash and doing my own hair.  </li>
            <li>it fall down easily</li>
            <li>a great product, it feels like human hair, and is very thick.</li>
            <li>I live it</li>
            <li>Although, my real hair is the same way, so I&#x27;m not complaining too much.</li>
            <li>Color is as depicted, and the fibers feel soft and of high quality.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig is thin and you could see right through the wig it easly gets frized too I was hoping to receive some thing a lot better compared to what I got</li>
            <li>any long wig will, it tangles very easily, so you have to be very careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and then the hair started to fall frequently!</li>
            <li>The only upside to this is that it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>but If you do get it very messy make sure to use a METAL brush instead of a plastic.</li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;m not taking a huge hit in the pocket.</li>
            <li>but when I put it on for the first time the entire bottom of the wig was completely tangled that i&#x27;m going to have to cut it off</li>
            <li>was being super duper rough with this wig&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and thicker than I expected it be, it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all!</li>
            <li>This wig is not bad, but it is just a tiny bit on the shiny side, no big deal though.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>doesnt shed, very soft and looks natural in sunlight.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit the head much, no full coverage .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and natural!</li>
            <li>really nice quality but a little thinner than i expected</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural state!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter to play Adams Family.  </li>
            <li>the teachers comment on how long and pretty my hair was, they had no clue I was wearing a wig till told them.</li>
            <li>still give it 4 stars because for $15, this wig was nearly identical to a wig I purchased the year before for $40.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like picture, soft, long, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Great price!</li>
            <li>i am glad i only pay 10 for this tangled mess of a wig!</li>
            <li>It is soft, thick, and does not tangle easily.</li>
            <li>, tangles easily cause it is so long, down to my butt.</li>
            <li>/&gt; its waay to long to pass off as real hair</li>
            <li>The long part tangles so much, at any and all movement.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t try pulling it tight into a pony tail unless you are careful to spread the hair out to make sure it covers the cap.</li>
            <li>The wig gets tangled really easily and it is hard to brush</li>
            <li>but it sheds, tangles and loses hair when brushing really easily,</li>
            <li>Once we cut it we had no other problems brushing it</li>
            <li>The netting for the wig is large enough for my noggin, as long as I don&#x27;t try to fasten the strap.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels real, and if cared for, will probably last a long time.</li>
            <li>i had to cut the bangs because they covered my entire face, but that gave me complete freedom as to the style of it.</li>
            <li>but in my case, I don&#x27;t think it tangles that much, of course, be careful with the wing&lt;</li>
            <li>Looks real, feels really soft, rubbed some baby powder in it to make it less shiny</li>
            <li>Wig came a little tangled, but less than I expected for the length, and easily solved by gently combing through with your fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shiny black and the only complaint I had about</li>
            <li>It was SUPER long and heavy and kept sliding off my head.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and came sooner than expected.</li>

            <li> It is a gorgeous wig came earlier then expect which made me a very happy camper.</li>
            <li> Very easy to comb-if you know how to comb hair correctly.</li>
            <li> but it can get tangled very easily  </li>
            <li> Very nice quality- quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> , but really, I&#x27;m usually able to get wigs that are really nice for this price.</li>
            <li> Its soooooooooooooooooooooo beautiful and real looking!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to restyle bangs to suit!</li>

            <li> Overall very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars, but I would buy wigs from this seller again, mostly for halloween though.</li>
            <li> best to only wear once..</li>
            <li> but it looks ok on.</li>
            <li> Lovely wig.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;Fit</li>
            <li> It would probably be ok if you took it out of the packaging just before you were to wear it.</li>
            <li> just a bit shiny also has a skin top</li>
            <li> Pretty nice wig !</li>
            <li> ,  I love it.</li>
            <li> , it was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Trust me, you can do better.</li>
            <li> This item is lovely</li>
            <li> I think the wig is excellent and does the job much better than a wig you can buy at party city for double or triple the price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it ended up being an ok texture</li>
            <li> It would have been better</li>
            <li> I think if I had more experience with wigs.</li>
            <li> so if you want a thicker look, make sure to use extensions or clip-</li>
            <li> Positively a wonderful product and actually arrived a week before estimated time.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> you need a wig for a costume you&#x27;re only going to wear once, this suits your needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> You may be able to fix the thinness problem with some extensions.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice wig!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love this wig.</li>
            <li> it is made of a better material and that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> 15 year old daughter searched all reviews before purchasing this wig for her costume, the price was cheaper than buying and finding the wig within our shopping area even with paying for expedited shipping, it arrived on time and looked great and was easy to manage and keep on, my daughter was very pleased</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that it came super quickly, the wig itself is great.</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent and really does look very real.</li>
            <li> I loved this wig very much.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is pretty good quality for 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> Used item for a cosplay- was able to braid it easily.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super shiny and nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got soft strands, and as an experienced cosplayer who owns many wigs, I like this one.</li>
            <li> Shipping was better then I expected and the wig was awesome.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this wig and it was perfect for Marceline from adventure time!</li>
            <li> Glad it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I got this wig a day sooner than expected, which was awesome.</li>
            <li> Being her she got the wig completely ruined lol.</li>
            <li> fast shipping good quality</li>
            <li> but if careful looks very nice :) i liked it over all</li>
            <li> Great customer service when it was a day late, but it was worth it because it is really nice and great quality.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> That said, if you want a wig you&#x27;ll be able to use several times, your best bet is to invest in a higher quality one.</li>
            <li> for the money, it is the best wig compared to other costume wigs that I have bought for my wife.  </li>
            <li> However, it tangles EXTREMELY easily.  </li>
            <li> It tangles way to easy</li>
            <li> it tangles easy and its thinish and its</li>
            <li> and you can easily see the netting.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> But tangles really easy.</li>
            <li> It does knot up but with detangler spray, it comes out easily.</li>
            <li> It gets tangled easily but for cosplaying it gets the job done</li>
            <li> So you can see the mesh is easily visible.</li>
            <li> Easy to move.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> A bit long but very good for the price</li>
            <li> it was off a model;s wish list, she receieved it fast enough, and had good things to say, i&#x27;ll count it as a win in the gift department</li>
            <li> But the hair is silky, brushes smooth and easily braids.</li>
            <li> it were the bangs, which is fine since I need to style them anyway (I&#x27;m cosplaying as Homura and this wig fits it).</li>
            <li> but the length is fine.</li>
            <li> so i am fine with that.</li>
            <li> so if you just brush it after every time you use it, it should be fine.</li>
            <li> It doesnt tangle as easily as most cosplay wigs and a lot of people questioned me if it was my real hair, it&#x27;s VERY good quality, feels like real hair and very affordable.</li>
            <li> The wig itself sheds a lot, but it made a fantastic Marceline the Vampire Queen halloween wig.</li>
            <li> real hair.\\&quot;  Amazing.  </li>
            <li> no, there were no tangles, and I was just lightly running my brush through the wig.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve cut and styled them to your liking, this is a great wig, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very silky and nice quality.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> Overall great quality wig.</li>
            <li> Plus it came with a free wig cap.</li>
            <li> Smooth adn Shiny.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t fit to my head</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find a wig this inexpensive, but it&#x27;s a really good quality wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice wig, yes, but it definitely looks like a wig.</li>
            <li> I was originally shipped a shorter brown wig by accident.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap and easy wig that looks exactly as it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> It looked good and was comfortable throughout most of the day even if it was a mess by the end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it fits great and bangs are perfect for cutting!</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels, kinda gets tangled a lot if not hung properly but is really beautiful on</li>
            <li> wig was cheap though, and for the quality, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cheap price, but it nearly isn&#x27;t worth it with how tangled it is.</li>
            <li> i cannot believe how nice and soft the hair was.</li>
            <li> my daughter was doing I will be buying more wigs from this company if my daughters wants to keep cosplaying.</li>
            <li> so it look a bit more real.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s really looks real !!!!</li>
            <li> I cut the bangs of this wig and it was pretty easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> such excellent quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> it looked more realistic that way anyway.</li>
            <li> I even ordered another wig from taobaopit because of their quick service.</li>
            <li> Its still a great wig for such a low price :3</li>
            <li> Because it was my first one I didn&#x27;t realize what a pain it is to keep it tangle free because of the length.</li>
            <li> and doesnt look all that real on certain areas</li>
            <li> However, this wig became tangled VERY easily, with light wear (it was only worn for standing around to take pictures).</li>
            <li> the wig was lovely to work with, and it was easy to style with and alter for my future cosplay.</li>
            <li> The wig is almost super soft and I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Amazing wig really soft and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> I now have an amazing wig for Halloween next year!</li>
            <li> It has provided her hours of fun</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try a wig just for fun.</li>
            <li> I mainly use is as a Tsubaki cosplay wig and it is easy to put in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Really long and easy to comb and style, so I was able to cut it exactly how I wanted!</li>
            <li> i take back what i had originally said about this product,though it was a bit thin for my liking after a bit of work,and a trim it was a lovely wig and is still holding up perfectly.</li>
            <li> It feels soft and smooth and smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It was easy to comb through and easy enough to manage.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even the right length.</li>
            <li> I hope so, because right now I have to keep it in a braid to be wearable.</li>
            <li> RIGHT NOW</li>
            <li> Super long (i&#x27;m &#x27;5&#x27;&#x27;8 and the bottom of the hair hits my waist line), super fun, really cheap - no complaints!</li>
            <li> Though, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars simply because it took some effort to style and it tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this wig is that is does tangle very easily.</li>
            <li> Which worked out great because im 5&#x27;10 and the wig reached me at the top part of my thighs in front and a little bit pass my butt in the back.</li>
            <li> The fibers make the wig feel just like silky hair, and the black color has such a delicious, shiny coat to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it gets messy and tangles easily and requires patience to keep looking nice.</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I ever bought and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> The wig is very long and not too hard to work with I was able to great the jasmine look and everyone loved how long the wig is.</li>
            <li> Its very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> it tangles soooo much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what my daughter was after</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like in the pictures.</li>
            <li> The wig is exactly as picture.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as shown</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a wig</li>
            <li> All if my friend got crazy about it :) it&#x27;s soooo Beautiful...... &amp; soooft</li>
            <li> and it worked very well!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this wig if its your first time getting one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> of course it will tangle like real hair!</li>
            <li> wore this wig for my Marceline cosplay at Phoenix Comic Con.</li>
            <li> its very silky and soft and even though it tangles easy</li>
            <li> Really pleased with how it feels- very soft and natural.</li>
            <li> Though it was easy to get tangled, not to mention it  was super long...</li>
            <li> The only reason anyone knew it wasn&#x27;t my real hair was my friends cause well my hair isn&#x27;t that long lol,</li>
            <li> It was soft and silky, and no matter how hot the room is, it always feels cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you comb it and groom it a lot, because like any long wig, it gets tangled and frizzy after a lot of use.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast too</li>
            <li> Soft, full, shiny, and now she wears it to cosplay.</li>
            <li> I have wigs longer then this one made with  100% Japanese Kanekalon high quality made fiber that have never tangled and feel alot better then</li>
            <li> If im lucky i can repurpose some of this into doll hair since its not worth the work to use on my head.the ONLY good thing i can say is shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a nice, pure black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most amazing Black long wig ever!!</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and not overly shinny as most low quality wigs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the hair to be as fine a quality as it did (Very low price, after all)</li>
            <li> The hair is nice and thick, and while it&#x27;s got the unnatural shine, I think it looks good on black hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so  realistic!</li>
            <li> , it was very tangled.</li>
            <li> For a cheaper wig I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> It is really shiny, but that might go away with time.</li>
            <li> It sheds, not too much, but it does shed.</li>
            <li> Wore it for Halloween, people thought it was real.</li>
            <li> and it does not have too much hair</li>
            <li> and it almost felt like real hair</li>
            <li> It tangles fast</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont expect people to think this is your real hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;With fast shipping</li>
            <li> it looks and feels real.</li>
            <li> This DOES happen with real hair this length</li>
            <li> it cause it left room for you to style it to fit your look</li>
            <li> This wig is way better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks its my real hair.</li>
            <li> But for $15 you really can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I used kids de-tangles spray and that really seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> looks and feels like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Terrific fit.</li>
            <li> wig is perfect for anything: Halloween, video game and Anime conventions, daily use, mannequins, etc.</li>
            <li> it looks nice, it&#x27;s super thick, hair is pretty soft..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s far from real hair quality but taken car of right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thin and doesn&#x27;t look very good .</li>
            <li> This company was quick to send me a replacement wig at no extra cost when my first one was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li> It gets tangled easily but it&#x27;s a long wig</li>
            <li> I would have liked a little more hair on it and less tangle</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very long but easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Also, the cap is really snug so if you have a fairly decent sized head I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying.</li>
            <li> its so soft and looks pretty real to me :D.</li>
            <li> A decent wig for the price with many options for styling due to its length.</li>
            <li> Its very long, go in expecting tangles, however with a nice brush and patience its no big deal.</li>
            <li> It tangles easily, but thats normal for a long wig.  </li>
            <li> Its veeeryy long and smooth</li>
            <li> This wig looks amazing at first, but gets frizzy very quickly, and is slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li> A little on the thin side and gets tangled very easily but otherwise a good wig.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to shape your eyebrows and then fill them in or shade them with a black eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> and it was a decent price as well</li>
            <li> it will work as a fairly realistic wig.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will most likely not make the same mistake</li>
            <li> tangles very easy only cause its very long</li>
            <li> Anyways, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The quality itself is pretty realistic too, and although it does tend to tangle easily, what else can you expect from such a long wig.</li>
            <li> It is a nice wig, and exactly as pictured - including the extremely long bangs in the front, which you will definitely have to pin back or cut in your desired style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very realistic and soft.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that it tangles up real fast</li>
            <li> It is soft and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li> id ship it back but its not even worth the cost of gas to bring it to the post office.</li>
            <li> A single wig provided more than enough material to meet my needs.</li>
            <li> That turned into a big mess and I ended up just throwing the thing in the trash and doing my own hair.  </li>
            <li> it fall down easily</li>
            <li> a great product, it feels like human hair, and is very thick.</li>
            <li> I live it</li>
            <li> Although, my real hair is the same way, so I&#x27;m not complaining too much.</li>
            <li> Color is as depicted, and the fibers feel soft and of high quality.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig is thin and you could see right through the wig it easly gets frized too I was hoping to receive some thing a lot better compared to what I got</li>
            <li> any long wig will, it tangles very easily, so you have to be very careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and then the hair started to fall frequently!</li>
            <li> The only upside to this is that it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> but If you do get it very messy make sure to use a METAL brush instead of a plastic.</li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;m not taking a huge hit in the pocket.</li>
            <li> but when I put it on for the first time the entire bottom of the wig was completely tangled that i&#x27;m going to have to cut it off</li>
            <li> was being super duper rough with this wig&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and thicker than I expected it be, it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all!</li>
            <li> This wig is not bad, but it is just a tiny bit on the shiny side, no big deal though.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> doesnt shed, very soft and looks natural in sunlight.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit the head much, no full coverage .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and natural!</li>
            <li> really nice quality but a little thinner than i expected</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural state!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter to play Adams Family.  </li>
            <li> the teachers comment on how long and pretty my hair was, they had no clue I was wearing a wig till told them.</li>
            <li> still give it 4 stars because for $15, this wig was nearly identical to a wig I purchased the year before for $40.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like picture, soft, long, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Great price!</li>
            <li> i am glad i only pay 10 for this tangled mess of a wig!</li>
            <li> It is soft, thick, and does not tangle easily.</li>
            <li> , tangles easily cause it is so long, down to my butt.</li>
            <li> /&gt; its waay to long to pass off as real hair</li>
            <li> The long part tangles so much, at any and all movement.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try pulling it tight into a pony tail unless you are careful to spread the hair out to make sure it covers the cap.</li>
            <li> The wig gets tangled really easily and it is hard to brush</li>
            <li> but it sheds, tangles and loses hair when brushing really easily,</li>
            <li> Once we cut it we had no other problems brushing it</li>
            <li> The netting for the wig is large enough for my noggin, as long as I don&#x27;t try to fasten the strap.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels real, and if cared for, will probably last a long time.</li>
            <li> i had to cut the bangs because they covered my entire face, but that gave me complete freedom as to the style of it.</li>
            <li> but in my case, I don&#x27;t think it tangles that much, of course, be careful with the wing&lt;</li>
            <li> Looks real, feels really soft, rubbed some baby powder in it to make it less shiny</li>
            <li> Wig came a little tangled, but less than I expected for the length, and easily solved by gently combing through with your fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shiny black and the only complaint I had about</li>
            <li> It was SUPER long and heavy and kept sliding off my head.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong, but yes, it&#x27;s very long and very easy to get tangled.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the bangs are right in your face so you have to pin them back.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a very long straight black wig.</li>
            <li> Its long enough to reach under my hips.</li>
            <li> I Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> recommend looking up tutorials and such on how to care for and detangle long wigs if you&#x27;ve never had one before.</li>
            <li> got this wig specifically to wear in a long braid, but it may actually be manageable to wear it out and about in</li>
            <li> For my picture I attached, I&#x27;m only 5 foot 5, if that helps with seeing how long the wig may look on you.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t want to deal with that don&#x27;t get such a long wig.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a little awkward, but it&#x27;s good because it allows for customization.</li>
            <li> Sadly it tangles really easily.</li>
            <li> The fibers of this wig are very thin and get tangled easily .</li>
            <li> but if you let it get tangled its hard to get it straight</li>
            <li> I received my wig a day earlier than expected</li>
            <li> The bangs were too long.</li>
            <li> when we pulled it out of the long plastic bag, my daughter and I both said, \\&quot;It feels like</li>
            <li> just needed to cut the bangs since it was too long.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to use it for a homestuck cosplay, you might want to trim the bangs, they&#x27;re rather long.</li>
            <li> but it was really long and the brush would just make it</li>
            <li> The bangs were weirdly long.</li>
            <li> and it is just as long as the picture, so I cut and layered it.</li>
            <li> although it gets tangled pretty quickly but that could be solved by cutting it a few inches or so.</li>
            <li> I should also add the wig is extremely long!</li>
            <li> So I would only buy this to cut and use the hair for other things.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected date!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously it&#x27;s going to come with some problems as seeing as it&#x27;s a very long wig.</li>
            <li> The bangs are VERY long, for me they fall at chin length, I like them as they are, however they do get in your face alot.</li>
            <li> This wig is very long had to cut it</li>
            <li> It was very long</li>
            <li> The bangs are as long as I expected and so was the hair.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected with a long wig.</li>
            <li> its also pretty thin but that helps with the tangles</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t thin and was full and a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Very silky and Thick! .</li>
            <li> Its look is tooo rough and dry!</li>
            <li> Very long not very full.</li>
            <li> It was soft and such, but way thin.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little thicker, but it&#x27;s not so thin that you can see right through it.</li>
            <li> Gets a little tangled, but that is expected with a long wig.</li>
            <li> its a little thin but for my first wig.</li>
            <li> I managed to braid about half of it, and fought with the other half for an hour before finally chopping about a foot off the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bangs is a little long</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the inner net is a little small on my head.</li>
            <li> it shed a lot due to trying to comb out all of the tangles.</li>
            <li> All of my other wigs has a lot of weft layers.</li>
            <li> Trust the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I put an order for this wig.</li>
            <li> use(with plans to change it out with other wigs as I felt the desire to change my hair style)</li>
            <li> i have since put it in a long braid to keep it from getting messy again.</li>
            <li> other then that THIS WIG ISHIT.</li>
            <li> I am going to assume that is due to the length.</li>
            <li> So I ended up getting frustrated with it and twisting it into a side ponytail which looked fabulous.</li>
            <li> not worth the aggravation</li>
            <li> It goes down to just below my butt</li>
            <li> The wig is also very long i&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and it falls to just past my butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However if its in China it will take less than 15 days.</li>
            <li> Now we have to find an alternative lighter less tangleable solution.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was thicker and the wefting less spaced out.</li>
            <li> Ive been considering dying my hair black</li>
            <li> , tangles slightly</li>
            <li> I got this for a cosplay, and after walking around for less than an hour all the fibers were tangled together hopelessly.</li>
            <li> Shipped in less than two days.</li>
            <li> When this wig arrived the first thing I noticed was just how THICK it was!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems thin at first especially if you yourself have thick hair, but it&#x27;s not unrealistically thin.</li>
            <li> It was an abaolute mess.</li>
            <li> i expected it to be longer like past my hips</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its a little thin in the back</li>
            <li> Bangs seem a little shorter than the picture, but I can work with it.</li>
            <li> It is also too heavy to wear.</li>
            <li> I bought it for everyday</li>
            <li> Its heavy takes some time getting used too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this to facebook,twitter and Tumblr to ensure nobody wastes their money on this wig.</li>
            <li> But this wig is so thin that each weft has only a strand or two of hair.</li>
            <li> but I cut a few inches off and that helped.</li>
            <li> It is extremely long and silky, but unfortunately that also translates to extremely tangly.</li>
            <li> cap!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very long, and it gets a bit thin</li>
            <li> Another wig we purchased from a different company for the same event was not tangled as badly.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of complements on it, but I wish I could have had the whole length without the impossible tangle.</li>
            <li> My thick hair was easily hidden in the wig cap.</li>
            <li> After a half a year, it started to badly tangle and needed to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and the wig ends just past my bum.</li>
            <li> My sister and I bought this wig a couple of months ago and found it to be past her knees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6 and the wig reaches well past my butt.</li>
            <li> i had to comb it as it had got very messy.</li>
            <li> It is a real mess it gets everywhere</li>
            <li> The bangs are really thick and annoying when you first take it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I looked at the wefts and there is hardly any towards the bottom.</li>
            <li> It is too hard to comb and tooo tangly....</li>
            <li> its not to hard to brush.</li>
            <li> to comb out and hard to put on</li>
            <li> Although even though it wasn&#x27;t that hard to brush it out but the fibers seemed to be fried after that...</li>
            <li> Its a little thin feeling at the cap</li>
            <li> A little thin</li>
            <li> IT SUCkS ASS</li>
            <li> The bangs were kinda thick</li>
            <li> This wig isnt as thick as it looks in the picture.  </li>
            <li> However, after cutting of about half of it and using half a bottle of hair detangler it started looking wearable.</li>
            <li> I mean as soon as u try it on</li>
            <li> Overall, it isn&#x27;t bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Wig was very very thin for the length, i ended up cutting it shoulder length and using it only on the rarest occasion.</li>
            <li> wish i had believed the negative reviews for once!</li>
            <li> This wig is very hard to salvage and make presentable again after it has been worn hard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but, I didn&#x27;t like how thin it was.</li>
            <li> The bottom was a mass of knots and brushing it made it worse.</li>
            <li> It was really thin, nothing like the pic or description.</li>
            <li> Even when I saw it in the package it looked thin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying from here unless u want a non-covering thin wig.</li>
            <li> but it is too thin that I can&#x27;t style it the way I planned so now I have to but another and harvest this one for its wefts.</li>
            <li> I opened the box to find a tangled nasty wig that was completely unusable.</li>
            <li> It makes it difficult to even get the wig on to cut them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing specially terrible in total.</li>
            <li> it is very thin and a lot of the hair keeps falling out.</li>
            <li> The wig is very thin and sheds a lot, as well as knots.</li>
            <li> We ended up cutting it -</li>
            <li> The bangs were cut a bit awkward</li>
            <li> I also recommend cutting it shorter as it gets caught in EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> save the wig by cutting the frayed parts off.</li>
            <li> It was also getting tangled in knots and was impossible to comb, so I decided to cut it.  </li>
            <li> for the bad things.</li>
            <li> The length caused the wig to tangle a bit but not too badly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s freakishly thin, has this eyesore of a shine, and it&#x27;s just really horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and has some nasty tangles coming out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> So disappointing to get ripped off and not hear anything from the company!</li>
            <li> AS WE SPEAK I JUST HATE THE WAIT FOR IT</li>
            <li> Very, Very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> it is horrible, doesnt feel like kanelakon :(</li>
            <li> this wig is very badly made.</li>
            <li> Very bad!!</li>
            <li> Its horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The wig was perfect! It is soft, thick, and does not tangle easily.</li>
            <li> This company was quick to send me a replacement wig at no extra cost when my first one was lost in the mail. Very professional and helpful company with a great product; this wig is for use in an Alice: Madness Returns Costume, and it will be perfect. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the hair to be as fine a quality as it did (Very low price, after all) But the hair is silky, brushes smooth and easily braids. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably rate this product at about 3.5 stars.  The hair is nice and thick, and while it&#x27;s got the unnatural shine, I think it looks good on black hair.  However, it tangles EXTREMELY easily.  I managed to braid about half of it, and fought with the other half for an hour before finally chopping about a foot off the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig was cheap though, and for the quality, it&#x27;s worth it.  I bought it intending to chop the length off for a style I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.  The netting for the wig is large enough for my noggin, as long as I don&#x27;t try to fasten the strap. (My scalp measures at 23.5 inches)  It arrived about 2 weeks before the delivery date (though, considering the estimate was about 2 months after my order, I would sure hope so).</li>
            <li> Its very long, go in expecting tangles, however with a nice brush and patience its no big deal. Got many compliments and cannot wait to wear it as Marceline at otakon.</li>
            <li> I received my wig a day earlier than expected so that was great! I think it looks great on me, it really is a gorgeous wig. However, it tangles A LOT. Although, my real hair is the same way, so I&#x27;m not complaining too much. I give this three stars. Its still a great wig for such a low price :3 I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> When the wig arrived, it was rather matted. However, after cutting of about half of it and using half a bottle of hair detangler it started looking wearable. I do wear it out in public, and people think it is my actual hair. I get a lot of complements on it, but I wish I could have had the whole length without the impossible tangle.</li>
            <li> it looks nice, it&#x27;s super thick, hair is pretty soft.. but. it tangles soooo much! and it  wasn&#x27;t packed well when i received it, it was very tangled. it shed a lot due to trying to comb out all of the tangles. it&#x27;s a cheap price, but it nearly isn&#x27;t worth it with how tangled it is.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a Halloween costume.  It was SUPER long and heavy and kept sliding off my head.  It was also getting tangled in knots and was impossible to comb, so I decided to cut it.  That turned into a big mess and I ended up just throwing the thing in the trash and doing my own hair.  Glad it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what my daughter was after and it was a decent price as well so it was a win win!</li>
            <li> Very easy to comb-if you know how to comb hair correctly. Very silky and Thick! . Color is perfect (as depicted in item picture.) and it&#x27;s easy to restyle bangs to suit! Overall very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Wig was very very thin for the length, i ended up cutting it shoulder length and using it only on the rarest occasion.</li>
            <li> The wig is thin and you could see right through the wig it easly gets frized too I was hoping to receive some thing a lot better compared to what I got</li>
            <li> Very Happy with my Purchase.  I will definitely use this seller in the future..</li>
            <li> For a cheaper wig I didn&#x27;t expect much. Though I am impressed. The wig stays on great, my baby cousin was running around the house with it on and spinning. It was easy to comb through and easy enough to manage. The bangs are as long as I expected and so was the hair. It wasn&#x27;t thin and was full and a bit heavy. It came with a nice wig cap and is perfect for my halloween costume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad things. It is really shiny, but that might go away with time. It looks like barbie hair. It sheds, not too much, but it does shed. And it itches and pokes my head a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave it three stars, but I would buy wigs from this seller again, mostly for halloween though.</li>
            <li> such excellent quality, especially for the price. i cannot believe how nice and soft the hair was. this is probably one of the cheapest and nicest wigs i&#x27;ve gotten!</li>
            <li> tangles very easy only cause its very long but I wont buy this wig again.. best to only wear once..</li>
            <li> It tangles way to easy but it looks ok on.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a very long straight black wig. This was the one to meets my requirements. Its long enough to reach under my hips. I loved this wig very much. It looks exactly like in the pictures. Its very soft and smooth. The bangs is a little long I can&#x27;t see from it so I&#x27;ll just have to cut from it. I am very satisfied with this wig.  If you want to order it let them ship it to China its way faster than US or UK, it will take about 15 to 30 days if your shipment address is there. However if its in China it will take less than 15 days.</li>
            <li> Lovely wig. I trimmed it and put some hair smoothing serum to prevent the tangles, which worked great! Wore it for Halloween, people thought it was real.</li>
            <li> THIS WIG IS AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;Fit well!, Great length!&lt;br /&gt;I loved the bangs and it didn&#x27;t shed at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this again and again for cosplay!&lt;br /&gt;I was Marceline  the Vampire Queen for Halloween and people loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my sister&#x27;s Halloween costume! It&#x27;s very realistic and soft. Though, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars simply because it took some effort to style and it tangles very easily. But, it is amazing for the price!</li>
            <li> 15 year old daughter searched all reviews before purchasing this wig for her costume, the price was cheaper than buying and finding the wig within our shopping area even with paying for expedited shipping, it arrived on time and looked great and was easy to manage and keep on, my daughter was very pleased</li>
            <li> IT SUCkS ASS -.- it tangles easy and its thinish and its not that long....goood for one day wear</li>
            <li> Real great wig. Very long not very full.</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that it came super quickly, the wig itself is great. The bangs are a little awkward, but it&#x27;s good because it allows for customization. I got it for a Marceline cosplay and it&#x27;s too perfect. It goes down to just below my butt (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2) The quality itself is pretty realistic too, and although it does tend to tangle easily, what else can you expect from such a long wig. Anyways, I highly recommend it. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it five stars. It was purchased for my wife to wear for a cover image for a book I&#x27;m publishing. We basically bought it for one use, but I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality. It looks and feels real, and if cared for, will probably last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is a real mess it gets everywhere and it does not have too much hair it is horrible, doesnt feel like kanelakon :(</li>
            <li> This tangled and we could not untangle it. It is not wearable. It is also too heavy to wear. The bangs were too long. It would probably be ok if you took it out of the packaging just before you were to wear it. I think you would only get one use out of it. As it stands it tangled and is not usable for the costume. Now we have to find an alternative lighter less tangleable solution.</li>
            <li> The wig is exactly as picture. It was also packed in a way it didn&#x27;t tangled. My bougth it for a friend that was doing a cosplay and deffinetly going to buy one for myself too.</li>
            <li> I was originally shipped a shorter brown wig by accident. There was a litle miscommunication but once it was cleared up, they sent me the correct wig at no extra charge. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more! The wig itself sheds a lot, but it made a fantastic Marceline the Vampire Queen halloween wig.</li>
            <li> The wig was a good length but, I didn&#x27;t like how thin it was. I looked at the wefts and there is hardly any towards the bottom. The bangs were kinda thick but the back wasn&#x27;t. All of my other wigs has a lot of weft layers. These were spaced out and you can easily see the netting. It also sheds a lot. It tangles but that&#x27;s to be expected with a long wig. I just wish it was thicker and the wefting less spaced out.</li>
            <li> has nice depth and the advertised length as well . lays very nice and requires no hair underneath. I recommend this one</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my daughter who is going to be Marceline for Halloween.  The wig is perfect, and at her being around 5&#x27; tall, it is the perfect length.  The wig was packaged wonderfully with a rubberband to keep the hair from tangling, a hairnet around the top of the wig as well.  The quality...wow...when we pulled it out of the long plastic bag, my daughter and I both said, \\&quot;It feels like real hair.\\&quot;  Amazing.  Great product and great price.  We couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as shown but it sheds, tangles and loses hair when brushing really easily, which is what you can expect for the price. It&#x27;s a great steal if you&#x27;re just looking for a good looking long wig for an awesome price though.</li>
            <li> I got the wig and it was wrapped up really nicely and it almost felt like real hair but when I put it on for the first time the entire bottom of the wig was completely tangled that i&#x27;m going to have to cut it off</li>
            <li> fit perfect quality awesome can use for more too&lt;br /&gt;cannot wait to wear it in May in Las Vegas Nevada</li>
            <li> Ordered for a Marceline cosplay, and it&#x27;s perfect! Great length- I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and the wig ends just past my bum. Wig came a little tangled, but less than I expected for the length, and easily solved by gently combing through with your fingers. Color is as depicted, and the fibers feel soft and of high quality. 10/10 would recommend, and would buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> So disappointing to get ripped off and not hear anything from the company! Buyer beware when getting shipments thru China post office. Once I processed order shipping terms said totally different dates and I didn&#x27;t get wig for my Cosplay Convention. I had to stress out and buy a gross wig the day before. Very bad!!</li>
            <li> After a half a year, it started to badly tangle and needed to get a new one. Worked amazing when I had it.</li>
            <li> This wig is not bad, but it is just a tiny bit on the shiny side, no big deal though.&lt;br /&gt;As any long wig will, it tangles very easily, so you have to be very careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend looking up tutorials and such on how to care for and detangle long wigs if you&#x27;ve never had one before.</li>
            <li> Its veeeryy long and smooth&lt;br /&gt;its just a bit shiny also has a skin top&lt;br /&gt;defiantly good for costumes&lt;br /&gt; its waay to long to pass off as real hair sadly&lt;br /&gt;  and doesnt look all that real on certain areas&lt;br /&gt; but its reaally good quality for the length</li>
            <li> Its horrible! After some time it started to tangle up and then the hair started to fall frequently! If you are gonna buy this wig, u r totally putting ur money into hell! Just dont go for it! Its not like picture! Its look is tooo rough and dry!</li>
            <li> Used item for a cosplay- was able to braid it easily. Good quality item, comes with a good wig cap too.</li>
            <li> This wig isnt as thick as it looks in the picture.  I should&#x27;ve sent it back</li>
            <li> Nice and long, shiny, smells good and came in just 13 days!!</li>
            <li> Very soft and came sooner than expected. Sadly it tangles really easily. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Pretty nice wig ! looks exactly as it&#x27;s pictured , feels great !!! and also great price ,  I love it.</li>
            <li> The wig is wonderful! a great product, it feels like human hair, and is very thick. i had to cut the bangs because they covered my entire face, but that gave me complete freedom as to the style of it. over all very happy with my purchase, and i would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> My sister and I bought this wig a couple of months ago and found it to be past her knees. Within a day it was tangled beyond belief- we hadn&#x27;t even done anything to it! The bottom was a mass of knots and brushing it made it worse. We ended up cutting it - it looked more realistic that way anyway. Once we cut it we had no other problems brushing it, it was nice and smooth. Beside that pesky habit of tangling though, we found it very nice.</li>
            <li> the wig does look as advertized but something with the material the wig itself is made from causes it to tangle almost constantly, if you get this wig be prepared for the upkeep of it.</li>
            <li> I got this wig a day sooner than expected, which was awesome. Overall, it isn&#x27;t bad for the price. I thought it might be a little thicker, but it&#x27;s not so thin that you can see right through it.</li>
            <li> I opened the box to find a tangled nasty wig that was completely unusable. It was an abaolute mess.</li>
            <li> This wig looks amazing at first, but gets frizzy very quickly, and is slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li> A decent wig for the price with many options for styling due to its length.</li>
            <li> Trust the other reviews. The wig shown is nothing like the wig you&#x27;ll receive. It&#x27;s not even the right length. It&#x27;s freakishly thin, has this eyesore of a shine, and it&#x27;s just really horrible. The hair of it also started to come out as soon as I started to work with it. And not in a &amp;#34;I was being super duper rough with this wig&amp;#34; type of coming out. Like, you know, if there&#x27;s tangles in a wig, and you&#x27;re struggling to remove those, yeah, no, there were no tangles, and I was just lightly running my brush through the wig. The only upside to this is that it&#x27;s pretty soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, but really, I&#x27;m usually able to get wigs that are really nice for this price. This was not one of those nice wigs. Trust me, you can do better.</li>
            <li> The wig is great and all and has the perfect length but it tangles way too easiky. I had to chop off a lot of the hair to fix it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! The hair is beautiful and the cap is adjustable for a perfect fit. I received it way ahead of schedule too.</li>
            <li> I use it for cosplay and it was tangled when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;I just needed to cut the bangs since it was too long.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect wig for what I wanted to do! My only complaint would be that the bangs are right in your face so you have to pin them back. Other than that, I love this wig and it was perfect for Marceline from adventure time!</li>
            <li> I cut the bangs of this wig and it was pretty easy to deal with. It&#x27;s got soft strands, and as an experienced cosplayer who owns many wigs, I like this one. Good quality, I would recommend it. Just make sure you comb it and groom it a lot, because like any long wig, it gets tangled and frizzy after a lot of use. It&#x27;s also a nice, pure black.</li>
            <li> This item is lovely but if you let it get tangled its hard to get it straight I suggest braiding it to keep it from getting tangled</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig because I was dressing up as princess jasmine for a costume party and I didn&#x27;t like the costume wigs sold in stores. The wig is very long and not too hard to work with I was able to great the jasmine look and everyone loved how long the wig is.I would have liked a little more hair on it and less tangle thats the only reason its not 5 stars but for the price I think the wig is excellent and does the job much better than a wig you can buy at party city for double or triple the price. Shipping was pretty fast too I even ordered another wig from taobaopit because of their quick service.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is pretty good quality for 10 dollars. It&#x27;s thin and has some nasty tangles coming out of the packaging. Just use patience and a wig brush to get them out.Also, the cap is really snug so if you have a fairly decent sized head I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying. If you&#x27;re looking to use it for a homestuck cosplay, you might want to trim the bangs, they&#x27;re rather long. hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The bangs are really thick and annoying when you first take it out of the box. It makes it difficult to even get the wig on to cut them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve cut and styled them to your liking, this is a great wig, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously it&#x27;s going to come with some problems as seeing as it&#x27;s a very long wig. It tangles fast but it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to detangle. It is very soft and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this wig specifically to wear in a long braid, but it may actually be manageable to wear it out and about in it&#x27;s natural state!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems thin at first especially if you yourself have thick hair, but it&#x27;s not unrealistically thin. You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont expect people to think this is your real hair. It&#x27;s a very nice wig, yes, but it definitely looks like a wig.</li>
            <li> The length caused the wig to tangle a bit but not too badly. You should probably brush it often though. It&#x27;s not to course and it&#x27;s super shiny and nice.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a wig and I&#x27;m glad it ended up being an ok texture and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> Shipping was better then I expected and the wig was awesome.  Very silky and nice quality.  Could brush and braid to match a look for a costume.  Could not be happier with the quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap and easy wig that looks exactly as it&#x27;s pictured. It gets the job done right.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s far from real hair quality but taken car of right it will work as a fairly realistic wig.</li>
            <li> It would have been better I think if I had more experience with wigs. It kept sliding off and had to get bobbypins to anhcor it but it was perfect for the costume</li>
            <li> this wig is very badly made. it is very thin and a lot of the hair keeps falling out. don&#x27;t think I will ever use it.</li>
            <li> Came on time, packaged well, great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig looks great with some styling and it comes with a wig cap!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very long, and it gets a bit thin so if you want a thicker look, make sure to use extensions or clip-ins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use this for my next cos-play/costume/etc.!</li>
            <li> i take back what i had originally said about this product,though it was a bit thin for my liking after a bit of work,and a trim it was a lovely wig and is still holding up perfectly. even though i ordered it in Feb.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter to play Adams Family.  She loves it!  It has provided her hours of fun and it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality- quick shipping.  Really pleased with how it feels- very soft and natural.</li>
            <li> Great wig, easily cut into a Mikasa wig from Attack on Titan. Soft, full, shiny, and now she wears it to cosplay.</li>
            <li> Super long (i&#x27;m &#x27;5&#x27;&#x27;8 and the bottom of the hair hits my waist line), super fun, really cheap - no complaints!</li>
            <li> The fibers of this wig are very thin and get tangled easily . It&#x27;s also very thin and doesn&#x27;t look very good . Don&#x27;t buy it .</li>
            <li> It was really thin, nothing like the pic or description. It&#x27;s alright but nothing like I thought</li>
            <li> Was going to use it for halloween but once I got it it became all tangled up. Tried to fix it but it was really long and the brush would just make it staticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a nice wig it just kept getting stuck to my arms and become tangled. Luckily I&#x27;m not taking a huge hit in the pocket.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I put an order for this wig. Even when I saw it in the package it looked thin. However, as soon as I put it on it filled out beautifully! It&#x27;s a nice shiny black and the only complaint I had about it were the bangs, which is fine since I need to style them anyway (I&#x27;m cosplaying as Homura and this wig fits it).</li>
            <li> It was soft and such, but way thin. You could see the cap. Didn&#x27;t fit the head much, no full coverage . It ony went to the head, not the sides. I don&#x27;t recommend buying from here unless u want a non-covering thin wig.</li>
            <li> Amazing wig really soft and it looks like real hair. But tangles really easy. It looks just like in the picture.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig to wear to a 70s party. Which worked out great because im 5&#x27;10 and the wig reached me at the top part of my thighs in front and a little bit pass my butt in the back. The only problem I had was that it tangles up real fast I mean as soon as u try it on it starts getting tangled. So I ended up getting frustrated with it and twisting it into a side ponytail which looked fabulous.</li>
            <li> It took time for me to cut it and it has good quality though. Nothing specially terrible in total. This is what I actually what.</li>
            <li> Positively a wonderful product and actually arrived a week before estimated time. Really great!!!</li>
            <li> Ive been considering dying my hair black so I wanted to try a wig just for fun. I love it. But for those ordering the wig for theater I definitely recommend. Just make sure to shape your eyebrows and then fill them in or shade them with a black eyebrow pencil. It completes the look ladies!! I should also add the wig is extremely long! I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6 and the wig reaches well past my butt.</li>
            <li> All if my friend got crazy about it :) it&#x27;s soooo Beautiful...... &amp; soooft I live it &amp; it&#x27;s really looks real !!!! It&#x27;s amazing...!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With fast shipping</li>
            <li> fast shipping good quality</li>
            <li> A bit long but very good for the price</li>
            <li> This Wig was perfect for a Marceline (Adventure Time) Cosplay my daughter was doing I will be buying more wigs from this company if my daughters wants to keep cosplaying.</li>
            <li> This wig is awesome. It is soft and feels like real hair. I mainly use is as a Tsubaki cosplay wig and it is easy to put in a pony tail. It gets tangled easily but it&#x27;s a long wig so what do you expect. Overall great quality wig. Plus it came with a free wig cap.</li>
            <li> Feels like the perfect length. I bought this for my Izuru (from dangan ronpa) cosplay and it worked very well! Gets a little tangled, but that is expected with a long wig. Bangs seem a little shorter than the picture, but I can work with it. Lots of room for styling. I would recommend this wig if its your first time getting one. For my picture I attached, I&#x27;m only 5 foot 5, if that helps with seeing how long the wig may look on you.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really complain it got here on time, and is absolutely beautiful it looks and feels real.I bought it for everyday use(with plans to change it out with other wigs as I felt the desire to change my hair style) Its a little thin feeling at the cap and i keep checking thinking the cap is visible, but its not. I wouldn&#x27;t try pulling it tight into a pony tail unless you are careful to spread the hair out to make sure it covers the cap. The bangs are VERY long, for me they fall at chin length, I like them as they are, however they do get in your face alot. The wig is also very long i&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and it falls to just past my butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the tangle issue: I wore it outside (no wind just walking to the store and back) for about 20 minuets, when i got back inside i had to comb it as it had got very messy. i have since put it in a long braid to keep it from getting messy again. This DOES happen with real hair this length, it gets messy and tangles easily and requires patience to keep looking nice. So if you plan to use this daily I would recommend carrying a comb and periodically combing it throughout the day, otherwise it will become a nightmare.</li>
            <li> It is too hard to comb and tooo tangly....Never buying it again. Very, Very disappointed. :( I couldnt comb it one bit</li>
            <li> A little on the thin side and gets tangled very easily but otherwise a good wig. Works well for my cosplay.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for halloween i was going as marceline the vampire queen from adventure time and it was perfect. it&#x27;s very long but easy to handle. It doesnt tangle as easily as most cosplay wigs and a lot of people questioned me if it was my real hair, it&#x27;s VERY good quality, feels like real hair and very affordable. The bangs were cut a bit awkward but i liked it cause it left room for you to style it to fit your look, i had my cosmo teacher cut the bangs in a marceline fringe for me and it was perfect. the wig stayed on with ease and was very comfortable,</li>
            <li> We used this wig for a cosplay, going as Marceline. It was perfect. Looked good, held it&#x27;s style, and was the perfect color. My daughter wore it 3 days in a row and it&#x27;s still going strong. I highly recommend it. When this one wears out, we&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> This wig is very long had to cut it but it can get tangled very easily  other wise this product was very good</li>
            <li> It is a gorgeous wig came earlier then expect which made me a very happy camper. Its heavy takes some time getting used too, tangles easily cause it is so long, down to my butt. Looks real, feels really soft, rubbed some baby powder in it to make it less shiny so it look a bit more real. The only reason anyone knew it wasn&#x27;t my real hair was my friends cause well my hair isn&#x27;t that long lol, but when I wore it to my kids parent teacher conference the teachers comment on how long and pretty my hair was, they had no clue I was wearing a wig till told them. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Really long and easy to comb and style, so I was able to cut it exactly how I wanted!</li>
            <li> This wig is way better than I expected it to be. It&#x27;s long and thicker than I expected it be, it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all! It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig, brushes out easy, doesn&#x27;t tangle easily. lots of hair. amazing product.</li>
            <li> really nice quality but a little thinner than i expected, tangles slightly but if careful looks very nice :) i liked it over all</li>
            <li> It is a nice wig, and exactly as pictured - including the extremely long bangs in the front, which you will definitely have to pin back or cut in your desired style. It is extremely long and silky, but unfortunately that also translates to extremely tangly. The long part tangles so much, at any and all movement. I will try shampooing it and see if that helps. I hope so, because right now I have to keep it in a braid to be wearable.</li>
            <li> doesnt shed, very soft and looks natural in sunlight. although it gets tangled pretty quickly but that could be solved by cutting it a few inches or so.</li>
            <li> wish i had believed the negative reviews for once! i am glad i only pay 10 for this tangled mess of a wig! I have wigs longer then this one made with  100% Japanese Kanekalon high quality made fiber that have never tangled and feel alot better then this one and are thicker,this is stringy and just nothing like the pic. defiantly NEVER BUY AGAIN!  not worth the aggravation you&#x27;ll get every time you put it on. Hell id ship it back but its not even worth the cost of gas to bring it to the post office. If im lucky i can repurpose some of this into doll hair since its not worth the work to use on my head.the ONLY good thing i can say is shipping is fast. other then that THIS WIG ISHIT. I&#x27;m posting this to facebook,twitter and Tumblr to ensure nobody wastes their money on this wig.</li>
            <li> I got this for a cosplay, and after walking around for less than an hour all the fibers were tangled together hopelessly. If i got this type of wig again i&#x27;d get one shorter.. shoulder length at max. anything longer is bound to tangle</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!!! Its soooooooooooooooooooooo beautiful and real looking! Everyone thinks its my real hair. It does knot up but with detangler spray, it comes out easily.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for my Marceline cosplay. I was surprised to find a wig this inexpensive, but it&#x27;s a really good quality wig. It&#x27;s the same quality as my more expensive wigs and i&#x27;m really happy about that. I would recommend this wig and seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my Marceline costume to wear to a convention. By the end of the day it was kinda frazzled even though I stopped several times during the day to untangle it. This wig is very hard to salvage and make presentable again after it has been worn hard.&lt;br /&gt;I still give it 4 stars because for $15, this wig was nearly identical to a wig I purchased the year before for $40. It looked good and was comfortable throughout most of the day even if it was a mess by the end.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a wig for a costume you&#x27;re only going to wear once, this suits your needs perfectly. Even if you wanted to wear the costume again and had to buy a second wig, it&#x27;d still be cheaper to get two of these wigs than one of the fancier wigs. That said, if you want a wig you&#x27;ll be able to use several times, your best bet is to invest in a higher quality one.</li>
            <li> This wig was perfect for my daughter&#x27;s Marceline costume.  We received it much earlier than anticipated.</li>
            <li> not the greatest quality. It gets tangled easily but for cosplaying it gets the job done</li>
            <li> Great customer service when it was a day late, but it was worth it because it is really nice and great quality.</li>
            <li> The wig is very thin and sheds a lot, as well as knots. I do not recommend it for cosplay but if you want to wear it for a one time event it will be perfect. The hair is very soft and not overly shinny as most low quality wigs. You may be able to fix the thinness problem with some extensions. I also recommend cutting it shorter as it gets caught in EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> The fibers are good, length is good. But this wig is so thin that each weft has only a strand or two of hair. So you can see the mesh is easily visible. So I would only buy this to cut and use the hair for other things. I would never wear this, and wont recommend anyone wear this, unless you want people to see the net under.</li>
            <li> The bangs were weirdly long. I cut them and it saved this. However, this wig became tangled VERY easily, with light wear (it was only worn for standing around to take pictures). Another wig we purchased from a different company for the same event was not tangled as badly.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality wig for the price. It was perfect when I first took it out of the bag and tried it on, fabulous! The only problem with this wig is that is does tangle very easily. I am going to assume that is due to the length. But for $15 you really can&#x27;t complain too much. I used kids de-tangles spray and that really seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was perfect for the goth character I was playing, bonus I now have an amazing wig for Halloween next year!</li>
            <li> Though it was easy to get tangled, not to mention it  was super long... the wig was lovely to work with, and it was easy to style with and alter for my future cosplay. The wig is almost super soft and I love the feel of it. Lovely product.</li>
            <li> i love it! its so soft and looks pretty real to me :D. i expected it to be longer like past my hips but the length is fine. its also pretty thin but that helps with the tangles so i am fine with that. its very silky and soft and even though it tangles easy its not to hard to brush. so if you just brush it after every time you use it, it should be fine. perfect cosplay wig!</li>
            <li> Pretty nice wig!  hair looks nice, feels nice too.  had my friend cut the bangs for a photo shoot and it photographed well. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong, but yes, it&#x27;s very long and very easy to get tangled.  i would recommend a wig brush for this one.</li>
            <li> very nice wig.  looks and feels like the real thing.  goes well with anything that will match it.  would order again from seller</li>
            <li> This wig arrived on time for me, which made me extremely happy and satisfied. The wig has turned out to be very shiny, beautiful and attractive-looking. It feels soft and smooth and smells clean and fresh. The fibers make the wig feel just like silky hair, and the black color has such a delicious, shiny coat to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is perfect for anything: Halloween, video game and Anime conventions, daily use, mannequins, etc. Perfect, fantastic, and very silky, shiny, healthy, and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its a little thin in the back but the style is great, absolutely love it otherwise!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Great quality. Easy to move. Tangles somewhat but I cut a few inches off and that helped. Also having a wig brush is key. Great Quality. Smooth adn Shiny. Terrific fit. My thick hair was easily hidden in the wig cap.</li>
            <li> it was off a model;s wish list, she receieved it fast enough, and had good things to say, i&#x27;ll count it as a win in the gift department</li>
            <li> The wig gets tangled really easily and it is hard to brush out.&lt;br /&gt;Hair gets everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to comb out and hard to put on</li>
            <li> I built a rocking horse and needed a mane and tail.  A single wig provided more than enough material to meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for cosplay that requires a lot of hair and I thought it would save me money from having to buy two wigs, not the case. The wig is an awesome length but it is too thin that I can&#x27;t style it the way I planned so now I have to but another and harvest this one for its wefts.</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I ever bought and it was worth the money. Because it was my first one I didn&#x27;t realize what a pain it is to keep it tangle free because of the length. So if you don&#x27;t want to deal with that don&#x27;t get such a long wig. The quality is excellent and really does look very real. Shipped in less than two days. If I want another wig I will buy from this seller without a second thought.</li>
            <li> A little thin but it fits great and bangs are perfect for cutting! Arrived earlier than expected date! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Texture is nice, cut is nice.  It tangles easily, but thats normal for a long wig.  Only complaint is the inner net is a little small on my head.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS THE SUGER HONEY ICE TEA!&lt;br /&gt;HONESTLY BABY IT LOOKS LIKE,SMELLS LIKE,FEELS LIKE, REAL HUMAN HAIR I LOVE IT IN FACT IM ORDERING A SECOND ONE RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK I JUST HATE THE WAIT FOR IT BUT BESIDES THAT ITS A AMAZING WIG.</li>
            <li> This wig is just what I wanted. It was soft and silky, and no matter how hot the room is, it always feels cool to the touch. I love it and it&#x27;s so  realistic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like picture, soft, long, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Great price! 100% recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luce exactamente como la imagen. Es suave, larga, es perfecta!&lt;br /&gt;El precio es genial, 100% recomendado.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most amazing Black long wig ever!! It&#x27;s soft and natural! no shine on it! it&#x27;s exactly like the picture. I know people say: &amp;#34;it tangles a lot&amp;#34; WELL GUESS WHAT? it&#x27;s a wig! of course it will tangle like real hair! but in my case, I don&#x27;t think it tangles that much, of course, be careful with the wing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it arrived like in 2 days!!! 2 days guys!!!! the fastest wig I&#x27;ve ever get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will totally buy it again ^^</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels, kinda gets tangled a lot if not hung properly but is really beautiful on</li>
            <li> Awesome, but tangled almost immediately.</li>
            <li> When this wig arrived the first thing I noticed was just how THICK it was!!! It was very long also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this wig for my Marceline cosplay at Phoenix Comic Con. Although by mistake I let my friend wear this wig. Being her she got the wig completely ruined lol. Although even though it wasn&#x27;t that hard to brush it out but the fibers seemed to be fried after that...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will most likely not make the same mistake but If you do get it very messy make sure to use a METAL brush instead of a plastic. This will prevent frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I save the wig by cutting the frayed parts off. Oh well</li>
            <li> love this wig. I need to get another one. its a little thin but for my first wig. I loved it. and it is just as long as the picture, so I cut and layered it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this wig maybe because of size . the hair it self is good but it didn&#x27;t fit to my head it fall down easily , it is good if u want just take pictures.</li>
            <li> for the money, it is the best wig compared to other costume wigs that I have bought for my wife.  it is made of a better material and that makes a difference.</li>
