            <li>how do you get these amazing automatic curls</li>
            <li>She thought it was amazing</li>
            <li>After a couple hours everything relaxed into a really nice, looser curl.  </li>
            <li>Those curls just kind of fell apart.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to be honest here.</li>
            <li>to use on your own hair in the back&lt;br /&gt;-large and clunky to hold when using on self</li>
            <li>After using it, I have to say everyone I used it on was really thrilled at how their hair turned out.  </li>
            <li>to use on your own hair in the back&lt;br /&gt;-large and clunky to hold when using on self</li>
            <li>After using it, I have to say everyone I used it on was really thrilled at how their hair turned out.  </li>
            <li>and I did get a nice curl that stayed curly for a day.  </li>
            <li>My daughters are loving this curler now that they&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is that you can adjust it for which side of your head</li>
            <li>Since we have gotten this product she has decided to play with it on her own.  </li>
            <li>Since we have gotten this product she has decided to play with it on her own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a nice device</li>
            <li>(almost like you&#x27;re talking on the phone) and get a nice curl that doesn&#x27;t start too close to the root.  </li>
            <li>(almost like you&#x27;re talking on the phone) and get a nice curl that doesn&#x27;t start too close to the root.  </li>
            <li>I Don&#x27;t own this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was grav3yardgirl&#x27;s youtube video, she is always honest about the things she try&#x27;s</li>
            <li>: The device itself has a very effective burn guard, and an automatic shut-off sensor that worked great when I used too much hair, and when I forgot to let go of the section of hair that was being curled.  </li>
            <li>I bought the original instyler &amp; it works great.  </li>
            <li>The Tulip also comes with a handy users&#x27; manual and style guide to help you figure out which settings is most appropriate for your hair-type and desired style, and (bonus!)</li>
            <li>The curls are beautiful on the right texture of hair.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy for her to learn to use.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I watched the review by Grav3yardgirl on YouTube and Bunny is usually alarmingly honest.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what an amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li>I have to say this is by far the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever gotten .</li>
            <li>I gave it a shot and the first 5 curls were beautiful.</li>
            <li>She has enjoyed styling her own hair and seeing immediate results.  </li>
            <li>She has enjoyed styling her own hair and seeing immediate results.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product because it curls my hair quickly, effectively, and safely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that when she first tried it, the curl it created looked great.</li>
            <li>When it came to using it on my own hair, I did not have as easy of a time of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it came to using it on my own hair, I did not have as easy of a time of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t burn myself a single time, which, lets be honest, is the best feature ever.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t burn myself a single time, which, lets be honest, is the best feature ever.  </li>
            <li>It works ok.  </li>
            <li>And boy, was I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>have been getting more compliments on my hair then ever</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is how it alternates the directions of the curls instead of just curling all in one direction.</li>
            <li>(make sure you follow the picture of how your hair goes in the curler or else it can get tangled)</li>
            <li>It does all the timing and work for you, and most of all I DIDNT BURN MYSELF.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter like the Tulip, but my daughter&#x27;s friend wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it, one reason being that it pulled her hair several times the one time she used it (at one point pulling some out!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought the Tulip Instyler and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the result</li>
            <li>Yet again, I love the results and didn&#x27;t mind the smell.  </li>
            <li>I will try this again on myself after my hair grows out some more.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t able to curl her hair at all.  </li>
            <li>My brave niece has almost waist length thick hair and her results were positively breathtaking.  </li>
            <li>Bought one, LOVE IT for so many reasons and here are some of them:</li>
            <li>she looks adorable.</li>
            <li>We just got 2 more Tulips to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>Also,  there should be a length and thickness restriction; either that,  or you should plan on spending much more time curling your hair as it is now a meticulous process.</li>
            <li>so I feel confident using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Looking at this product you will find that most people bought this and used it without fully understand what it was.</li>
            <li>The auto curler is so much better than the manual ones</li>
            <li>Most of her curls are on the  top of her hair and does not flow downward like the photos shown on the box for the curling iron.</li>
            <li>and I know she will just love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Works great - love going from straight to curly...</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>daughter keep hogging the Tulip, defiantly will buy one for her with my Amazon gift card.:)</li>
            <li>I love hair gadgets</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to learn how to use it yet.</li>
            <li>There is no need for a resting wire as the unit does not touch a table top while it heats</li>
            <li>/&gt;The way that I found it best to use it is to use the lowest setting on the temperature, timer, and the individual settings for rotation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using it on myself was more challenging.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using it on myself was more challenging.  </li>
            <li>Her curls look fantastic!</li>
            <li>If she gets better results, I&#x27;ll update the review.</li>
            <li>If you put more hair in the curler than this it will get stuck and start burning.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I need more practice?</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;ll be able to return it.</li>
            <li>The machine stopped and i was able to pull the curler away</li>
            <li>This happened to about 3 more strands after this one too.  </li>
            <li>Hair, make up, skin care, I love it all.  </li>
            <li>that I know and love when going for a curly style.  </li>
            <li>More like auto tangler.</li>
            <li>There are safety guards to keep your hairs from touching the ceramic barrel that heats up.  </li>
            <li>Do not try to rush the process by using more hair than is recommended at a time.  </li>
            <li>but I would imagine if you put more hair into the curler than it was designed for you could have that</li>
            <li>It made it look like she had a lot more hair than she already has.  </li>
            <li>It made it look like she had a lot more hair than she already has.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many products, and this one is perfect to do it by yourself, just add hair spray after and the curls will last longer.</li>
            <li>In my experience, it tangled when I used more than the recommended amount.  </li>
            <li>user-friendly, especially good for the occasional curler user</li>

            <li>Ok, so I got this, read the manual and followed the directions</li>
            <li>and I wish it took more than an inch.</li>
            <li>And make sure to separate the hair as recommended.</li>
            <li>I got two and am looking to buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Make sure you take out some time to learn how to operate the machine.  </li>
            <li>I made sure, after reading some of the disaster tangles on this site, that I used the cardboard thickness measure.  </li>

            <li>With the Tulip, it is easy to rest the device against your head</li>
            <li>I found that the button you push to start the winding of the hair can get pushed too easily while trying to get your hair into the guide.  </li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>Those results weren&#x27;t as strong.  </li>
            <li>Another review site strongly advised not purchase this hair burner/tangler.</li>
            <li>She has very long beautiful hair &amp; has received many compliments since using it.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of coordination at first, and using it on your own hair is not as easy as doing it on someone else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pretty darn amazing.</li>
            <li>she figured that was a nice touch to begin with, as her hair can tend to burn with some others as they may get to hot.</li>
            <li>With the Tulip, I now have lots of beautiful curls that last for hours!</li>
            <li>She is constantly getting comments about how beautiful her hair is</li>
            <li>Was able to return for full refund.</li>
            <li>To this girl, that&#x27;s a huge benefit, if it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li>The curl seemed not to take as well to her fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this curling iron in any way for individuals with fine hair.way for individuals with fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I was fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair must be too fine to use with this sort of system.</li>
            <li>There is a warning in the instruction book about using the highest heat on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The InStyler Tulip Auto Curler forms beautiful, bump free curls the likes of which I&#x27;ve seen only in a salon do.  </li>
            <li>I can also remove more quickly if I want to, but will have to wait for the unit to cycle through before I can hit the button again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>, I am going to confess that the very first section of hair that I tried to curl did end up mostly yanked out OF my head.  </li>
            <li>VERY neat concept for better curl control!</li>
            <li>I love love love this new curling hair tool.</li>
            <li>and she has been very satisfied with how this particular curler  has done with her hair.</li>
            <li>The Tulip is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>If the hair fits in the triangle, then it will fit in the machine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am really happy with this thing overall.  </li>
            <li>found it too cumbersome, too time consuming, and the potential for hair damage, too great.</li>
            <li>It gives smooth curls.</li>
            <li>, I would have missed one of the most exciting experiences I have had in a while with working with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curler stopped pulling, but there was no &amp;#34;reverse&amp;#34; switch to free up her hair.</li>
            <li>The process is finicky because of the relatively precise amount of hair that can be curled and the fact that stray hairs will get caught in the curler and stop it (thankfully it stops).</li>
            <li>Great concept, just needs some further refinement.</li>
            <li>My curls were smooth and had the body I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this automated curling iron, I thought it would be perfect to make waves and a few curls around the face.</li>
            <li>Do use a fine-tooth comb to de-tangle and smooth your hair just before inserting a section into the curler.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to follow the directions to avoid tangling.</li>
            <li>Day two was nice also, I could have gone out with some nice beachy waves on day two, but I wash daily.  </li>
            <li>I loved how cute the curls looked in my hair individually</li>
            <li>The instructions say that it will beep 3 times when your curl is ready to release, and I never did get it to beep after spending a good 20 minutes curling my whole head - even having timed it for more than 30 seconds on some sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but right now it is doing ok</li>
            <li>Meanwhile the iron was still hot and burning her hair?!?!</li>
            <li>I bought this because it looked so easy to use and gave you a head of curls quickly.  </li>
            <li>Its super easy to use once you get the hang of</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and she loves how easy it is to make nice professional looking curls in her hair for any style outfit she is wearing.</li>
            <li>Said it simplifies the process so well and is super fast and effective.</li>
            <li>I was still willing to keep trying because I was sure it was probably an error on my part and not the product.</li>
            <li>It would take all day to do my entire head even if I was successful.  </li>
            <li>The best part about it is no more burning yourself like you</li>
            <li>I have had the original instyler and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>Call me lazy but gets my hair looking perfect all the time.</li>
            <li>It states it is “perfect for Fine, Medium, and Thick hair”.</li>
            <li>This curler makes it easy and it makes it fun to do.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure how that works but its pretty cool and removed the scare factor.</li>
            <li>I was positive when I ordered this curing iron as I knew my spouse would literally love it.</li>
            <li>However, after 15 minutes of trying (and yes, I used the cardboard petal to measure and make sure I wasn&#x27;t loading too much hair), I only ended up with one successful curl.</li>
            <li>(This is a long detailed review for those who are worried about using this unit like I was)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest with you, I was very excited to have the ability to get this curler.  </li>
            <li>If you get to learn this unit, you can really do hair beautifully and more quickly than with other implements ON SOMEONE ELSE.  </li>
            <li>If you get to learn this unit, you can really do hair beautifully and more quickly than with other implements ON SOMEONE ELSE.  </li>
            <li>I also have a great stylist who showed me how to carefully add waves without frying my</li>
            <li>It takes my stick straight hair and turns it into sexy, flirty, beachy waves in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I have quite short shoulder length hair  at the moment and it still manages to give some really good results.</li>
            <li>Now that it is growing out, I have straight hair at the roots and top and curls at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Use the measuring tool to collect your stand of hair to make sure you do not have too much.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the directions and don&#x27;t put too much hair in the curler at one time.  </li>
            <li>when the hair does get caught into the rolling device, it is still heating the hair, so you can&#x27;t take too much time to get the hair uncaught or it will burn even more.  </li>
            <li>but, I will use this to touch up the bottom and sides of my hair--the results were a far neater hair style, which I liked.  </li>
            <li>It produces beautiful curls when you get the process down.</li>
            <li>Any more than that and the curling iron won&#x27;t be as effective on the hair, but you can just do a smaller strand again if you don&#x27;t get it right at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the naked  clean hair, my shinning curls  stayed for more than 3 days &amp; got so many</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product and honestly had never spent this amount of money on a styling product before.</li>
            <li>She uses it daily just because ITS JUST SO EASY!!</li>
            <li>but you pick it up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The open barrel design allows you to slide a section of your hair into the open barrel and push a button to get a perfect curl.  </li>
            <li>a feature most traditional curlers do not possess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use it: You are provided a &amp;#34;sectioning petal,&amp;#34; which is basically a hair-section measurer, and it gives you an idea of the appropriate amount of hair you can feed into the curler without it tangling.  </li>
            <li>You will hear a beep every two seconds and then 3 quick beeps at the end, letting you know the process has finished.  </li>
            <li>and it has a burn guard I love it and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Effortless and easy to use, picked it up and seemed to be able to get the hang of it straight away, gives those salon quality curls that you only seem to get when you pay top dollar....</li>
            <li>My advice, try out the device on the lowest settings first and then work your way up if you feel comfortable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a nice deviceit worked better on her thick hair and gave more bounce to the curl.  </li>
            <li>I used it on medium weight hair, fine hair, and slick hair all with great</li>
            <li>I used it on medium weight hair, fine hair, and slick hair all with great</li>
            <li>so it needs to be a bit more warm than a conventional iron.  </li>
            <li>so it needs to be a bit more warm than a conventional iron.  </li>
            <li>but once you do it&#x27;s fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I needed a curler that was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>and I wanted an easy way to add waves when I didn&#x27;t feel like doing much else to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I never heard of the  InStyler, this is a great product and easy you use once you follow the directions or go to you tube for help, I use this at least 2 times per week, my hair looks stylishe with those bouncing curls.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and its shoulder length shouldn&#x27;t have caused this much problem.</li>
            <li>Great curls, little time in the morning.</li>
            <li>I think that for a different hair type than my fine hair it might work better.  </li>
            <li>I think that for a different hair type than my fine hair it might work better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 10-15 minutes to do my entire head, and the results is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Last all day and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>in all, if you curl your hair  a lot it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was ready to use after reading the instructions once and using the hair sectioner to make sure I wasn&#x27;t trying to use too much hair at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figure out a way to use this on my own hair in the back</li>
            <li>I figure out a way to use this on my own hair in the back</li>
            <li>So I thought this would be a fun thing to try.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning myself like I would with a traditional curing iron or wand.  </li>
            <li>This is worth every penny once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the Right, Left, or Alternating curl.  </li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the Right, Left, or Alternating curl.  </li>
            <li>I have super long hair right now and it works great-- much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Now, anything that will help get my long, straight hair perfectly curled in a short period of time is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li>also read reviews on right here</li>
            <li>This scared two of my six test subjects off right away.  </li>
            <li>Takes awhile to get the right feel for the direction you want to curl</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Friday night right now</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of practice to get it right without stopping the unit and burning your hair all the time.    </li>
            <li>It broke right away.  </li>
            <li>Salon results right in the comfort of my home.&lt;br /&gt;Looking</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone looking for salon results right at home!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t make it work quite right.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and they came right out, tried again,</li>
            <li>I GOT IT AND OPENED IT RIGHT AWAY TO USE IT .I</li>
            <li>love that it has 3 style options.&lt;br /&gt;You can choose for your curl to be left, right, or alternate (Alternate really is the best</li>
            <li>Then you should be able to thoroughly use it to its full potential.</li>
            <li>When it does work as it is suppose to, the curls are great, but does not last as many days as it states it will when put on the tight curl.  </li>
            <li>each curl was great - I didn&#x27;t have any limp ones!  </li>
            <li>It is so east and works great no more guess work</li>
            <li>Hey beauty takes time and money but we are worth it ;)</li>
            <li>Bottom line for me is if you have fine to medium thick hair, I think it will be good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the curls I was able to get were loose, smooth, and quite pretty.</li>
            <li>If you actually read the instructions then you would know how to properly this this great curler.</li>
            <li>but it was quick to learn and my hair really curled and stayed curled without hairspray.  </li>
            <li>But makes beautiful curls that last a long time.</li>
            <li>We used this almost weekly to just give a fresh new look or for special occasions.</li>
            <li>and they curl took very, very well.  </li>
            <li>Was super easy to learn to use even doing the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair that is fine, but I have a ton of it, therefore my hair is straight, substantial (not coarse), and so smooth it’s almost slippery.  </li>
            <li>When it gets tangled, there is the higher risk of hair getting burned.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, don&#x27;t be skeptical, buy this curler, its the best auto curler of my life!</li>
            <li>it would be more time consuming than a traditional wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not that big of a deal once you get used to the appropriate Amount of hair</li>

            <li>I really recommend this to anyone, once you give it a chance you are hooked!</li>
            <li>thought it was pretty and the style lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was given this as a gift and today was the first day I tried it.  </li>
            <li>This thing really really does work!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t let it get too hot...</li>
            <li>Not so fast fellow!</li>
            <li>Read the instructions and follow the guide lines and make sure you place your hair properly in between the guard as this ensures it will not get tangled.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this tool!</li>
            <li>SURE THAT THERE IS NOT A LOT OF EXTRA HAIR SURROUNDING THIS PIECE</li>
            <li>The timer does not have to be adhered to exactly.  </li>
            <li>The timer does not have to be adhered to exactly.  </li>
            <li>I figured this InStyler would buy me more time until my next apportionment to get my hair</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very impressed with this!blend it with the other parts of my hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has beautiful, thick hair, but it&#x27;s straight as a pin.</li>
            <li>the first time out my hair got tangled, tried the recommendation of removal which did not help.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like it was working pretty well.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>I think you will be happy with the results if you use some common sense and follow the instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>short, was she pleased with the results?  </li>
            <li>she had when she first put them in.  </li>
            <li>she had when she first put them in.  </li>
            <li>the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this to compliment the InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron which I gifted to my teenage nieces.</li>
            <li>My learning time was kicked off with Bunny&#x27;s review on YouTube--she tests out the Curler in front of her mirror and her comments will help guide you when you try out the Curler for the first time.</li>
            <li>A faster succession of beeps indicates that its time to slide the curler down--and out the comes the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is layered, I do not think I will try this on the top part of my head--its just too short--</li>
            <li>So I looked up reviews and the first video I saw</li>
            <li>Very good, I just wish it could do a larger section at a time, it would take a lot less time.</li>
            <li>Other than that its pretty good and give very professional results!</li>
            <li>It is soo easy to curl the back of the head and it will not snag or get stuck in your hair if you just use the curler right and put the hair in like</li>
            <li>have rated this four stars due to the price point and the clumsiness of using it on your own head.  </li>
            <li>have rated this four stars due to the price point and the clumsiness of using it on your own head.  </li>
            <li>The versatility was interesting also being able to get curly or wavy hair in a flash and not have to work hard at it.</li>
            <li>According to them, the curler is easy to use and functions well for the different types of hair that they have--also, they love the possible variations that they can do for their hair.</li>
            <li>and/or watched several reviews, and one that stands out is titled, \\&quot;I Tried The InStyler Tulip Auto Curler, And It Turned Out To Be A Clumsy Beauty Addict&#x27;s Best Friend.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;After doing part of her hair we decided to change the timer to 5 seconds and it worked better on her thick hair and gave more bounce to the curl.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to use this type with my thick hair, but it is worth it if I really want my to look nice for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>I have no clue how anyone is rating this positively.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not particularly good at curling my hair, but the Tulip is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot and the potential for hair damage is greater than a normal  iron.</li>
            <li>It really takes my process of doing hair on others to a much higher level of performance.</li>
            <li>The trick is to be  careful not to put too much hair in the thing at a time and to make sure all the hair goes in the right place--if there are strays they get stuck.</li>
            <li>She loves the curls, how easy it is and especially that it doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>This machine also has an anti - tangle device which means it will stop rotating if you tug at it while the barrel is turning so you can easily take your hair out if you want the curl in a different direction or somewhere else.  </li>
            <li>It is only good for long hair.  </li>
            <li>Instyler Auto Curler is a rather large contraption.  </li>
            <li>She unplugged the curler, and my wife was able to work her loose from the curler, but her hair was burnt in places.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t recommend this curler very highly.</li>
            <li>She liked the soft loose curls that using this device gave her.  </li>
            <li>She liked the soft loose curls that using this device gave her.  </li>
            <li>When I placed the hair in the notch and tapped the button to create the perfect curl, the barrel simply spun around my hair but didn’t hold it tight enough to curl.  </li>
            <li>The tulip comes with a cardboard shaped triangle which includes a tiny hole, you are supposed to put you hair into the hole to see how much hair you can fit in the device.</li>
            <li>The whole thing about &amp;#34;only</li>
            <li>The curls took very well.  </li>
            <li>It takes 3 to 4 seconds just to load your hair, making contact with the heat the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable too.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>There is no way you can do your whole head of hair without help.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to curl your hair with this product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much easier it was when I used this product.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and always wanted to have curls but have never had the patience for curling irons or rollers.  </li>
            <li>The kit comes with a cardboard thing that has a hole in it so that you can estimate how much hair can be put into the unit at one time.  </li>
            <li>and I don’t know anyone who has that sort of time getting ready.</li>
            <li>At that rate it would take a whole day to curl my hair and I am not exaggerating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you put too much hair in the slot, it will get hung up.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Not to mention, how much practice we&#x27;ve had and how well we can use the tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holding the hair straight, but over to the side, you&#x27; e now ready to start your curl.  </li>
            <li>really do like the InStyler.  </li>
            <li>I was like really you can turn your hair from blah to yah with this tulip iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Do pay close attention to how much hair you curl at one time.  </li>
            <li>but i had to much hair in it.</li>
            <li>DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK?&amp;#34; and it really helped me.</li>
            <li>and then press the button, you really have to watch it a couple of times and understand.</li>
            <li>and it really works on all sorts of hair types.</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.</li>
            <li>One star is too much.</li>
            <li>I love my hair enough to know that cannot be fixed.</li>
            <li>It was a real challenge to get it into the right position to actually pull any of my hair into it, and once it did, it kind of sat around the barrel very loosely.</li>
            <li>the blue light stays steady and you know that you are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 23 years old, and as long as you have common sense, and can read instructions, this product will work perfect for you!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have never had this much problem using a new tool!  </li>
            <li>That means that you separate each section out as cleanly from the rest of the hair as possible.  </li>
            <li>If I find that the hair needs a brief second to curl more, I can count to ten after the beep and it is fine.  </li>

            <li>have long fine hair.</li>
            <li>So, it took me just as long as it does with the regular curling iron I use (the kind with the clip on the barrel) and didn&#x27;t save me any time at all.  </li>
            <li>This is for special occasions when you have set aside time, and maybe have someone help with the back of your head.  </li>

            <li>About me (the reviewer): I am in my mid-twenties, I don&#x27;t normally curl my hair, as it is VERY voluminous, but I decided to try this curler anyway, as it was a gift.  </li>
            <li>With some exploring, I can go from beachy waves to 70&#x27;s disco queen to classic movie star</li>
            <li>I love this thing and the curls last through to the next day.</li>
            <li>I found that using a mirror, keeping the slot facing out from me and the iron as upright as possible, I was able to do the front and sides of my hair, but needed help with the back.  </li>

            <li>It has always and still is naturally streaked blonde, light brown</li>
            <li>It does look completely simple and quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I find that using it on others (I happened to get this in time for Christmas special occasions and was able to use it on a few different heads of hair)</li>

            <li>You can also use the enclosed chart to properly curl by your hair&#x27;s texture, (ie fine, medium, or thick) to choose how much heat would be appropriate for the style you&#x27;re trying to achieve.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will buy me a few months before I have to get my hair permed again but to get the full effects, I would recommend that you hair is more of the same length and that you have time to dedicate to getting it styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Keeps grabbing more hair and wraps too tight.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Still I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend watching a YouTube tutorial before using this product to quell any concerns, and of course, read the user manual.  </li>
            <li>5 stars really recommend for young ladies who want a easier method with curling without the hassle</li>
            <li>However, I am a more than a few months overdo.</li>
            <li>I picked this up for my daughter and my wife to use, and hoped it would let them have some fun styling their hair, and get them away from the standard curling iron.</li>
            <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t find the Tulip to be any lighter than the curling iron I normally use.  </li>
            <li>Is it a fun and different way to curl your hair?</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Is it a fun and different way to curl your hair?</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>So overall, its pretty good, my only complain is its confusing to use at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super fun to play with and I feel giddy like when I was a little girl playing hair saloon with my besties.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There  are rotation settings so you can get either a left or right curl.</li>
            <li>switch is for right rotation, left rotation, or alternating rotation&lt;br /&gt;-Top</li>
            <li>/&gt;The styler has three heat settings, three timer setting, and three rotation settings – right, left, and one that switches from left to right after each curl.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;R\\&quot; for Right, \\&quot;L\\&quot; for Left, and \\&quot;A\\&quot; which will automatically switch rotation from left to right after each completed curl.  </li>
            <li>We started out the lowest heat setting, with a 3 second timer and turning the curls to the right.  </li>
            <li>The curl falls out extremely quick and it doesn&#x27;t curl all the way to your ends if you have really long hair.</li>
            <li>My stepdaughter has fine, short blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Based on the other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;d want to use it on super-long hair either because it seems to get stuck inside the barrel mechanism.</li>
            <li>I see her she shows off a new style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always up to trying new beauty products.  </li>
            <li>I have serious doubts that any of them did their own hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, fine , shoulder length hair and was having trouble loading my hair into the barrel, but I expected a learning curve at first.</li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day and it gets gives my hair shinier curls than I could ever have imagined!</li>
            <li>I used the tulip and it lasted until the next day and so much faster too!</li>
            <li>Umm no way I&#x27;m not exposing myself or my young child to this!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a funny demo you tube video of a girl having the same problem.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using it and felt like I could barely wait to get it..</li>
            <li>When I wore my hair straight and used a flat iron to keep it straight, I would use the heat setting at 400.</li>
            <li>Just bought the tulip for my fianc&amp;eacute; as an early Chrismicah gift!</li>
            <li>Upon receiving my InStyler, it first instructed me to watch a short video.  </li>
            <li>This tool looks cool too makes me want to use it, not really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and requires little to no effort.</li>
            <li>I usually only curl my hair for a special night out not because I don&#x27;t like to do it, but because I need a lot of extra time.  </li>
            <li>It took a little practice &amp; was pretty much awkward to hold at first, but I eventually started curling my daughter&#x27;s hair better with more practice.  </li>
            <li>It gave a nice curl to some of my head but others were half curled, half straight with the perm at the bottom.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the button you push to spin the thing is easy to push prematurely (while you&#x27;re still trying to get your hair situated in it) but it quickly shut off the one time that it got a snag (didn&#x27;t pull or hurt or anything, shut off as soon as it felt any tension)</li>
            <li>I have tried may different curling apparatuses--Curl formers, Curl Genius, curling wand, curling iron, hot rollers, hot long twisty thingies...</li>
            <li>a learning curve at first, but if are careful is worth extra effort to learn it</li>
            <li>a learning curve at first, but if are careful is worth extra effort to learn it</li>
            <li>I twist the top of each strand slightly to make it easier for me to properly place the strands.  </li>
            <li>It has wet dry also which ladies love it for their hair.</li>
            <li>My own hair is very thick and shoulder length.</li>
            <li>Had a hard time using it plus when I was able to get it to wind up</li>
            <li>I have curly hair but the back isn&#x27;t very curly and when I tried the Tulip it curls it well and leaves it looking natural like the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter got this for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It took about 20 minutes to completely curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>It would only really appeal to some one who likes all hair gadgets, or who needs a product to assist in styling.  </li>
            <li>Bought for 12 yr old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>waves look soft and natural.</li>
            <li>There is a plastic card, and it has a notched area, you can only put that much hair that fits in the cut out section.</li>
            <li>And its not heavy.</li>
            <li>It went directly to the bin.</li>
            <li>I didn’t have time to do much until the next day</li>
            <li>It now looks like one of those Brillo pads and smells completely burned.</li>
            <li>But, once I actually did it, it was very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say that I will use it to completely replace my wand or curling iron</li>
            <li>This thing tangled and burnt my 10 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Now, Addison&#x27;s hair is natural curly</li>
            <li>It has a burn guard unlike the traditional curlers, which is very intuitive .</li>
            <li>I can only think that it would work very well on hair of one length.  </li>
            <li>I was going to cut the strand, but was able to slowly maneuver the strand out.</li>
            <li>For those that have thicker hair this product might be nice -- however for my thin hair it does not hold the curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really takes my process of doing hair on others to a much higher level of performance.ir for various occasions from pageants and photo shoots and other special occasions to casual situations where you can take more time.  </li>
            <li>That means that the slot has a right side and a left side, with the entry point in the middle.</li>
            <li>I have very long, 6-7 inches below my shoulders, fine, dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It does the job, but you have to be very careful about how much hair you put in the curler, and if your hair tangles, be ready to pull the plug before your hair burns.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use (although took me a few tries to figure out how hold it</li>
            <li>and usually described as fine.  </li>
            <li>Hair massively stuck after FIRST TIME use and now it&#x27;s totally burnt.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, after one particular jam in the barrel, the silver metal part around the barrel that actually twirls your hair became stuck in the &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; position.</li>
            <li>It is also comfortable to use, I could keep my arm down in a resting position, whereas with a traditional curler, my arm would be jutting out.  </li>
            <li>It is also comfortable to use, I could keep my arm down in a resting position, whereas with a traditional curler, my arm would be jutting out.  </li>
            <li>curler has three slide switches and a button on it:&lt;br /&gt;-Bottom switch is Off, Low Medium, High</li>
            <li>Buy it only if you have long hair without those extensions which can be “jerked” right off.</li>
            <li>I have super long hair so anything that will hold a curl for a long period of time...</li>
            <li>You do have to use it a few times practicing and getting the fluid motion of handling it which is true of anything that is new</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t possibly be a woman who actually has to use it, that I am certain of.</li>
            <li>I have the original Instyler and then the Wet Dry also.  </li>
            <li>In fact we had my extended family over for a New Years Celebration (a couple weeks late) and I was able to test this curling iron out on several different types and length of hair!  </li>
            <li>my 13-year-old is happy that it is almost impossible to get burned by this iron.</li>
            <li>but at least it&#x27;s easy to return</li>
            <li>It also left my hair smelling burnt the whole day and the next day until I washed it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You could quickly become impatient, causing tangles or burning.  </li>
            <li>If you take some time to figure the machine out, watch a few Youtube videos, you will quickly catch on to the operation of it while looking in a mirror to style.  </li>

            <li>but they last all day and are so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Overall, this takes too long to be useful in daily use.</li>
            <li>Before we used the auto-curler for the first we read the instructions carefully!</li>
            <li>You could probably do just as good a job with a small curling iron or small hot curlers in half the time.</li>
            <li>As long as you keep it reasonable and simple.</li>
            <li>it clearly states in the commercial that it is not suppose to tangle your hair.</li>
            <li>Not only that but it completely damaged that strand.</li>

            <li>guard&lt;br /&gt;Timer (especially for frequent heat-tool users as it minimizes damage)&lt;br /&gt;Alternating</li>
            <li>Have a few practice rounds to get the hang of it and trust me it will be as useful as your hairdryer.</li>
            <li>wife says she&#x27;s still game to give it a try, on the lowest setting, but I&#x27;m not so sure I would chance it.</li>
            <li>have done makeup and hair for various occasions from pageants and photo shoots and other special occasions to casual situations where you can take more time.  </li>
            <li>I can do light waves to tigh small curls with this, just depending on how I hold it!</li>
            <li>Took me slightly over an hour to curl all my hair on my first</li>
            <li>Took me slightly over an hour to curl all my hair on my first</li>
            <li>The actually curler works very well and creates long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>What I noticed first was that the model&#x27;s hair was much shorter than mine, not as thick, and a different texture.  </li>
            <li>I was careful not to get too much hair, tried to hold the styler straight like the instructions said, but it pulled my hair way down and kept twisting.  </li>
            <li>This is not something to use when you are in a hurry but works very well if you take the time to learn how to use it and are very careful.</li>
            <li>A little of my hair got caught in the lower portion of the hot curler part, below the supposed safety stoppers.</li>
            <li>I think it might look nicer (and be a little more user-friendly) if my hair were just a few inches longer, so I&#x27;ll try it again when I grow it out and update my review if necessary.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-it is easy to get confused with direction and where to put the hair if you don&#x27;t concentrate&lt;br /&gt;-have to be very careful to separate out each strand very well before trying to curl&lt;</li>

            <li>I found that only a very small amount of my hair could fit into the petal.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure it would be worth the price if that is all you want to use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My hair falls right, above my breasts, is very thick and naturally straight.  </li>
            <li>daughter&#x27;s hair is pretty straight with just a little wave when it is wet and is about sixteen inches long.  </li>
            <li>Then you PUT THE HAIR INTO THAT SIDE OF THE SLOT, holding the hair straight down the length of the curling unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes practice to get it down, but it really does the job.</li>
            <li>Besides being too big and too bulky, it is very time consuming due to the tiny amount of hair it can handle at a time.</li>
            <li>When it comes to using on other people, I rate it a high five.  </li>

            <li>I have naturally straight hair and usually get a spiral perm and have them change out the rollers with two types so it looks natural.</li>
            <li>I do like the general look of the curls, but it&#x27;s such a hassle that this would only be a &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; hairstyle for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading some super negative reviews, so</li>
            <li>The first time that thing grabs your hair and starts twisting it is quite scary, but it came right off</li>
            <li>Its a little awkward at first, the biggest challenge for me was dividing my very layered hair into individual strands of one length that would fit into the machine.  </li>
            <li>I am certain you could get the hang of using this with a little practice and that is the way I left it with my granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Low (350 degrees) for beachy waves and soft, loose curls,</li>
            <li>it includes a little measuring clip so you don&#x27;t put too much hair in and tangle your locks in the curling chamber.  </li>
            <li>Before the InStyler Tulip, my hair was HARD to curl and rarely held a curl for any length of time.</li>

            <li> easy to use and made wonderful curls</li>
            <li> Her best friend had waist length fine hair.  </li>
            <li> NEVER had my hair look so good</li>
            <li> but i thought it was a good thing that the curler stopped.</li>
            <li> This tool is great for her and her friends to come over and do their own hair style.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a good curling device.</li>
            <li> But it does wonders for my wife who is more beautiful than ever with curls.</li>
            <li> and it is incredible so easy</li>
            <li> Perfect curl - first time!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many features to the Tulip that make it a great product.  </li>

            <li> After watching the video, I tried again, and this it worked like a charm :) it is actually amazing!</li>
            <li> Not only does it make beautiful and perfect curls</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it works great.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I absolutely LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> The options for temperature were amazing</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair curler.</li>
            <li> how do you get these amazing automatic curls</li>
            <li> She thought it was amazing</li>
            <li> After a couple hours everything relaxed into a really nice, looser curl.  </li>
            <li> Those curls just kind of fell apart.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to be honest here.</li>
            <li> to use on your own hair in the back&lt;br /&gt;-large and clunky to hold when using on self</li>
            <li> After using it, I have to say everyone I used it on was really thrilled at how their hair turned out.  </li>
            <li> to use on your own hair in the back&lt;br /&gt;-large and clunky to hold when using on self</li>
            <li> After using it, I have to say everyone I used it on was really thrilled at how their hair turned out.  </li>
            <li> and I did get a nice curl that stayed curly for a day.  </li>
            <li> My daughters are loving this curler now that they&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is that you can adjust it for which side of your head</li>
            <li> Since we have gotten this product she has decided to play with it on her own.  </li>
            <li> Since we have gotten this product she has decided to play with it on her own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a nice device</li>
            <li> (almost like you&#x27;re talking on the phone) and get a nice curl that doesn&#x27;t start too close to the root.  </li>
            <li> (almost like you&#x27;re talking on the phone) and get a nice curl that doesn&#x27;t start too close to the root.  </li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t own this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was grav3yardgirl&#x27;s youtube video, she is always honest about the things she try&#x27;s</li>
            <li> : The device itself has a very effective burn guard, and an automatic shut-off sensor that worked great when I used too much hair, and when I forgot to let go of the section of hair that was being curled.  </li>
            <li> I bought the original instyler &amp; it works great.  </li>
            <li> The Tulip also comes with a handy users&#x27; manual and style guide to help you figure out which settings is most appropriate for your hair-type and desired style, and (bonus!)</li>
            <li> The curls are beautiful on the right texture of hair.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy for her to learn to use.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I watched the review by Grav3yardgirl on YouTube and Bunny is usually alarmingly honest.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what an amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say this is by far the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever gotten .</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot and the first 5 curls were beautiful.</li>
            <li> She has enjoyed styling her own hair and seeing immediate results.  </li>
            <li> She has enjoyed styling her own hair and seeing immediate results.  </li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product because it curls my hair quickly, effectively, and safely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that when she first tried it, the curl it created looked great.</li>
            <li> When it came to using it on my own hair, I did not have as easy of a time of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it came to using it on my own hair, I did not have as easy of a time of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t burn myself a single time, which, lets be honest, is the best feature ever.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t burn myself a single time, which, lets be honest, is the best feature ever.  </li>
            <li> It works ok.  </li>
            <li> And boy, was I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> have been getting more compliments on my hair then ever</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is how it alternates the directions of the curls instead of just curling all in one direction.</li>
            <li> (make sure you follow the picture of how your hair goes in the curler or else it can get tangled)</li>
            <li> It does all the timing and work for you, and most of all I DIDNT BURN MYSELF.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter like the Tulip, but my daughter&#x27;s friend wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it, one reason being that it pulled her hair several times the one time she used it (at one point pulling some out!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought the Tulip Instyler and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the result</li>
            <li> Yet again, I love the results and didn&#x27;t mind the smell.  </li>
            <li> I will try this again on myself after my hair grows out some more.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t able to curl her hair at all.  </li>
            <li> My brave niece has almost waist length thick hair and her results were positively breathtaking.  </li>
            <li> Bought one, LOVE IT for so many reasons and here are some of them:</li>
            <li> she looks adorable.</li>
            <li> We just got 2 more Tulips to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Also,  there should be a length and thickness restriction; either that,  or you should plan on spending much more time curling your hair as it is now a meticulous process.</li>
            <li> so I feel confident using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Looking at this product you will find that most people bought this and used it without fully understand what it was.</li>
            <li> The auto curler is so much better than the manual ones</li>
            <li> Most of her curls are on the  top of her hair and does not flow downward like the photos shown on the box for the curling iron.</li>
            <li> and I know she will just love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Works great - love going from straight to curly...</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> daughter keep hogging the Tulip, defiantly will buy one for her with my Amazon gift card.:)</li>
            <li> I love hair gadgets</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to learn how to use it yet.</li>
            <li> There is no need for a resting wire as the unit does not touch a table top while it heats</li>
            <li> /&gt;The way that I found it best to use it is to use the lowest setting on the temperature, timer, and the individual settings for rotation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using it on myself was more challenging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using it on myself was more challenging.  </li>
            <li> Her curls look fantastic!</li>
            <li> If she gets better results, I&#x27;ll update the review.</li>
            <li> If you put more hair in the curler than this it will get stuck and start burning.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I need more practice?</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;ll be able to return it.</li>
            <li> The machine stopped and i was able to pull the curler away</li>
            <li> This happened to about 3 more strands after this one too.  </li>
            <li> Hair, make up, skin care, I love it all.  </li>
            <li> that I know and love when going for a curly style.  </li>
            <li> More like auto tangler.</li>
            <li> There are safety guards to keep your hairs from touching the ceramic barrel that heats up.  </li>
            <li> Do not try to rush the process by using more hair than is recommended at a time.  </li>
            <li> but I would imagine if you put more hair into the curler than it was designed for you could have that</li>
            <li> It made it look like she had a lot more hair than she already has.  </li>
            <li> It made it look like she had a lot more hair than she already has.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many products, and this one is perfect to do it by yourself, just add hair spray after and the curls will last longer.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it tangled when I used more than the recommended amount.  </li>
            <li> user-friendly, especially good for the occasional curler user</li>

            <li> I love this item would buy it again again</li>
            <li> Ok, so I got this, read the manual and followed the directions</li>
            <li> and I wish it took more than an inch.</li>
            <li> And make sure to separate the hair as recommended.</li>
            <li> I got two and am looking to buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Make sure you take out some time to learn how to operate the machine.  </li>
            <li> I made sure, after reading some of the disaster tangles on this site, that I used the cardboard thickness measure.  </li>
            <li> love curly hair</li>
            <li> love this device</li>

            <li> This time i wasn&#x27;t able to pull my hair free.</li>
            <li> The automatic feature is fun and nice to have</li>

            <li> Their are many different kinds of curls you can try and all of them look great.</li>
            <li> but my hair came out easily.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, reading this sounds anything but easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually easy</li>
            <li> With the Tulip, it is easy to rest the device against your head</li>
            <li> With the Tulip, it is easy to rest the device against your head</li>
            <li> I found that the button you push to start the winding of the hair can get pushed too easily while trying to get your hair into the guide.  </li>
            <li> Easy</li>
            <li> Those results weren&#x27;t as strong.  </li>
            <li> Another review site strongly advised not purchase this hair burner/tangler.</li>
            <li> She has very long beautiful hair &amp; has received many compliments since using it.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit of coordination at first, and using it on your own hair is not as easy as doing it on someone else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty darn amazing.</li>
            <li> she figured that was a nice touch to begin with, as her hair can tend to burn with some others as they may get to hot.</li>
            <li> With the Tulip, I now have lots of beautiful curls that last for hours!</li>
            <li> She is constantly getting comments about how beautiful her hair is</li>
            <li> Was able to return for full refund.</li>
            <li> To this girl, that&#x27;s a huge benefit, if it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li> The curl seemed not to take as well to her fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this curling iron in any way for individuals with fine hair.way for individuals with fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I was fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair must be too fine to use with this sort of system.</li>
            <li> There is a warning in the instruction book about using the highest heat on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The InStyler Tulip Auto Curler forms beautiful, bump free curls the likes of which I&#x27;ve seen only in a salon do.  </li>
            <li> I can also remove more quickly if I want to, but will have to wait for the unit to cycle through before I can hit the button again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can also remove more quickly if I want to, but will have to wait for the unit to cycle through before I can hit the button again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I am going to confess that the very first section of hair that I tried to curl did end up mostly yanked out OF my head.  </li>
            <li> VERY neat concept for better curl control!</li>
            <li> I love love love this new curling hair tool.</li>
            <li> and she has been very satisfied with how this particular curler  has done with her hair.</li>
            <li> The Tulip is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> If the hair fits in the triangle, then it will fit in the machine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am really happy with this thing overall.  </li>
            <li> found it too cumbersome, too time consuming, and the potential for hair damage, too great.</li>
            <li> It gives smooth curls.</li>
            <li> , I would have missed one of the most exciting experiences I have had in a while with working with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curler stopped pulling, but there was no &amp;#34;reverse&amp;#34; switch to free up her hair.</li>
            <li> The process is finicky because of the relatively precise amount of hair that can be curled and the fact that stray hairs will get caught in the curler and stop it (thankfully it stops).</li>
            <li> Great concept, just needs some further refinement.</li>
            <li> My curls were smooth and had the body I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this automated curling iron, I thought it would be perfect to make waves and a few curls around the face.</li>
            <li> Do use a fine-tooth comb to de-tangle and smooth your hair just before inserting a section into the curler.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to follow the directions to avoid tangling.</li>
            <li> Day two was nice also, I could have gone out with some nice beachy waves on day two, but I wash daily.  </li>
            <li> I loved how cute the curls looked in my hair individually</li>
            <li> The instructions say that it will beep 3 times when your curl is ready to release, and I never did get it to beep after spending a good 20 minutes curling my whole head - even having timed it for more than 30 seconds on some sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but right now it is doing ok</li>
            <li> Meanwhile the iron was still hot and burning her hair?!?!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it looked so easy to use and gave you a head of curls quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its super easy to use once you get the hang of</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves how easy it is to make nice professional looking curls in her hair for any style outfit she is wearing.</li>
            <li> Said it simplifies the process so well and is super fast and effective.</li>
            <li> I was still willing to keep trying because I was sure it was probably an error on my part and not the product.</li>
            <li> It would take all day to do my entire head even if I was successful.  </li>
            <li> The best part about it is no more burning yourself like you</li>
            <li> I have had the original instyler and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Call me lazy but gets my hair looking perfect all the time.</li>
            <li> It states it is “perfect for Fine, Medium, and Thick hair”.</li>
            <li> This curler makes it easy and it makes it fun to do.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how that works but its pretty cool and removed the scare factor.</li>
            <li> I was positive when I ordered this curing iron as I knew my spouse would literally love it.</li>
            <li> However, after 15 minutes of trying (and yes, I used the cardboard petal to measure and make sure I wasn&#x27;t loading too much hair), I only ended up with one successful curl.</li>
            <li> (This is a long detailed review for those who are worried about using this unit like I was)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest with you, I was very excited to have the ability to get this curler.  </li>
            <li> If you get to learn this unit, you can really do hair beautifully and more quickly than with other implements ON SOMEONE ELSE.  </li>
            <li> If you get to learn this unit, you can really do hair beautifully and more quickly than with other implements ON SOMEONE ELSE.  </li>
            <li> I also have a great stylist who showed me how to carefully add waves without frying my</li>
            <li> It takes my stick straight hair and turns it into sexy, flirty, beachy waves in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have quite short shoulder length hair  at the moment and it still manages to give some really good results.</li>
            <li> Now that it is growing out, I have straight hair at the roots and top and curls at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Use the measuring tool to collect your stand of hair to make sure you do not have too much.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow the directions and don&#x27;t put too much hair in the curler at one time.  </li>
            <li> when the hair does get caught into the rolling device, it is still heating the hair, so you can&#x27;t take too much time to get the hair uncaught or it will burn even more.  </li>
            <li> but, I will use this to touch up the bottom and sides of my hair--the results were a far neater hair style, which I liked.  </li>
            <li> It produces beautiful curls when you get the process down.</li>
            <li> Any more than that and the curling iron won&#x27;t be as effective on the hair, but you can just do a smaller strand again if you don&#x27;t get it right at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the naked  clean hair, my shinning curls  stayed for more than 3 days &amp; got so many</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product and honestly had never spent this amount of money on a styling product before.</li>
            <li> She uses it daily just because ITS JUST SO EASY!!</li>
            <li> but you pick it up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The open barrel design allows you to slide a section of your hair into the open barrel and push a button to get a perfect curl.  </li>
            <li> a feature most traditional curlers do not possess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use it: You are provided a &amp;#34;sectioning petal,&amp;#34; which is basically a hair-section measurer, and it gives you an idea of the appropriate amount of hair you can feed into the curler without it tangling.  </li>
            <li> You will hear a beep every two seconds and then 3 quick beeps at the end, letting you know the process has finished.  </li>
            <li> and it has a burn guard I love it and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Effortless and easy to use, picked it up and seemed to be able to get the hang of it straight away, gives those salon quality curls that you only seem to get when you pay top dollar....</li>
            <li> My advice, try out the device on the lowest settings first and then work your way up if you feel comfortable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a nice deviceit worked better on her thick hair and gave more bounce to the curl.  </li>
            <li> I used it on medium weight hair, fine hair, and slick hair all with great</li>
            <li> I used it on medium weight hair, fine hair, and slick hair all with great</li>
            <li> so it needs to be a bit more warm than a conventional iron.  </li>
            <li> so it needs to be a bit more warm than a conventional iron.  </li>
            <li> but once you do it&#x27;s fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I needed a curler that was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> and I wanted an easy way to add waves when I didn&#x27;t feel like doing much else to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I never heard of the  InStyler, this is a great product and easy you use once you follow the directions or go to you tube for help, I use this at least 2 times per week, my hair looks stylishe with those bouncing curls.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and its shoulder length shouldn&#x27;t have caused this much problem.</li>
            <li> Great curls, little time in the morning.</li>
            <li> I think that for a different hair type than my fine hair it might work better.  </li>
            <li> I think that for a different hair type than my fine hair it might work better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 10-15 minutes to do my entire head, and the results is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Last all day and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> in all, if you curl your hair  a lot it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was ready to use after reading the instructions once and using the hair sectioner to make sure I wasn&#x27;t trying to use too much hair at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figure out a way to use this on my own hair in the back</li>
            <li> I figure out a way to use this on my own hair in the back</li>
            <li> So I thought this would be a fun thing to try.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning myself like I would with a traditional curing iron or wand.  </li>
            <li> This is worth every penny once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the Right, Left, or Alternating curl.  </li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the Right, Left, or Alternating curl.  </li>
            <li> I have super long hair right now and it works great-- much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Now, anything that will help get my long, straight hair perfectly curled in a short period of time is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li> also read reviews on right here</li>
            <li> This scared two of my six test subjects off right away.  </li>
            <li> Takes awhile to get the right feel for the direction you want to curl</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Friday night right now</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of practice to get it right without stopping the unit and burning your hair all the time.    </li>
            <li> It broke right away.  </li>
            <li> Salon results right in the comfort of my home.&lt;br /&gt;Looking</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone looking for salon results right at home!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t make it work quite right.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> and they came right out, tried again,</li>
            <li> I GOT IT AND OPENED IT RIGHT AWAY TO USE IT .I</li>
            <li> love that it has 3 style options.&lt;br /&gt;You can choose for your curl to be left, right, or alternate (Alternate really is the best</li>
            <li> Then you should be able to thoroughly use it to its full potential.</li>
            <li> When it does work as it is suppose to, the curls are great, but does not last as many days as it states it will when put on the tight curl.  </li>
            <li> each curl was great - I didn&#x27;t have any limp ones!  </li>
            <li> It is so east and works great no more guess work</li>
            <li> Hey beauty takes time and money but we are worth it ;)</li>
            <li> Bottom line for me is if you have fine to medium thick hair, I think it will be good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the curls I was able to get were loose, smooth, and quite pretty.</li>
            <li> If you actually read the instructions then you would know how to properly this this great curler.</li>
            <li> but it was quick to learn and my hair really curled and stayed curled without hairspray.  </li>
            <li> But makes beautiful curls that last a long time.</li>
            <li> We used this almost weekly to just give a fresh new look or for special occasions.</li>
            <li> and they curl took very, very well.  </li>
            <li> Was super easy to learn to use even doing the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair that is fine, but I have a ton of it, therefore my hair is straight, substantial (not coarse), and so smooth it’s almost slippery.  </li>
            <li> When it gets tangled, there is the higher risk of hair getting burned.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, don&#x27;t be skeptical, buy this curler, its the best auto curler of my life!</li>
            <li> it would be more time consuming than a traditional wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not that big of a deal once you get used to the appropriate Amount of hair</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I really recommend this to anyone, once you give it a chance you are hooked!</li>
            <li> thought it was pretty and the style lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift and today was the first day I tried it.  </li>
            <li> This thing really really does work!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t let it get too hot...</li>
            <li> Not so fast fellow!</li>
            <li> Read the instructions and follow the guide lines and make sure you place your hair properly in between the guard as this ensures it will not get tangled.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this tool!</li>
            <li> SURE THAT THERE IS NOT A LOT OF EXTRA HAIR SURROUNDING THIS PIECE</li>
            <li> The timer does not have to be adhered to exactly.  </li>
            <li> The timer does not have to be adhered to exactly.  </li>
            <li> I figured this InStyler would buy me more time until my next apportionment to get my hair</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am very impressed with this!blend it with the other parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has beautiful, thick hair, but it&#x27;s straight as a pin.</li>
            <li> the first time out my hair got tangled, tried the recommendation of removal which did not help.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like it was working pretty well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> I think you will be happy with the results if you use some common sense and follow the instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> short, was she pleased with the results?  </li>
            <li> she had when she first put them in.  </li>
            <li> she had when she first put them in.  </li>
            <li> the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this to compliment the InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron which I gifted to my teenage nieces.</li>
            <li> My learning time was kicked off with Bunny&#x27;s review on YouTube--she tests out the Curler in front of her mirror and her comments will help guide you when you try out the Curler for the first time.</li>
            <li> A faster succession of beeps indicates that its time to slide the curler down--and out the comes the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is layered, I do not think I will try this on the top part of my head--its just too short--</li>
            <li> So I looked up reviews and the first video I saw</li>
            <li> Very good, I just wish it could do a larger section at a time, it would take a lot less time.</li>
            <li> Other than that its pretty good and give very professional results!</li>
            <li> It is soo easy to curl the back of the head and it will not snag or get stuck in your hair if you just use the curler right and put the hair in like</li>
            <li> have rated this four stars due to the price point and the clumsiness of using it on your own head.  </li>
            <li> have rated this four stars due to the price point and the clumsiness of using it on your own head.  </li>
            <li> The versatility was interesting also being able to get curly or wavy hair in a flash and not have to work hard at it.</li>
            <li> According to them, the curler is easy to use and functions well for the different types of hair that they have--also, they love the possible variations that they can do for their hair.</li>
            <li> and/or watched several reviews, and one that stands out is titled, \\&quot;I Tried The InStyler Tulip Auto Curler, And It Turned Out To Be A Clumsy Beauty Addict&#x27;s Best Friend.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing part of her hair we decided to change the timer to 5 seconds and it worked better on her thick hair and gave more bounce to the curl.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to use this type with my thick hair, but it is worth it if I really want my to look nice for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> I have no clue how anyone is rating this positively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly good at curling my hair, but the Tulip is great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot and the potential for hair damage is greater than a normal  iron.</li>
            <li> It really takes my process of doing hair on others to a much higher level of performance.</li>
            <li> The trick is to be  careful not to put too much hair in the thing at a time and to make sure all the hair goes in the right place--if there are strays they get stuck.</li>
            <li> She loves the curls, how easy it is and especially that it doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li> This machine also has an anti - tangle device which means it will stop rotating if you tug at it while the barrel is turning so you can easily take your hair out if you want the curl in a different direction or somewhere else.  </li>
            <li> It is only good for long hair.  </li>
            <li> Instyler Auto Curler is a rather large contraption.  </li>
            <li> She unplugged the curler, and my wife was able to work her loose from the curler, but her hair was burnt in places.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend this curler very highly.</li>
            <li> She liked the soft loose curls that using this device gave her.  </li>
            <li> She liked the soft loose curls that using this device gave her.  </li>
            <li> When I placed the hair in the notch and tapped the button to create the perfect curl, the barrel simply spun around my hair but didn’t hold it tight enough to curl.  </li>
            <li> The tulip comes with a cardboard shaped triangle which includes a tiny hole, you are supposed to put you hair into the hole to see how much hair you can fit in the device.</li>
            <li> The whole thing about &amp;#34;only</li>
            <li> The curls took very well.  </li>
            <li> It takes 3 to 4 seconds just to load your hair, making contact with the heat the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable too.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> There is no way you can do your whole head of hair without help.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to curl your hair with this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much easier it was when I used this product.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and always wanted to have curls but have never had the patience for curling irons or rollers.  </li>
            <li> The kit comes with a cardboard thing that has a hole in it so that you can estimate how much hair can be put into the unit at one time.  </li>
            <li> and I don’t know anyone who has that sort of time getting ready.</li>
            <li> At that rate it would take a whole day to curl my hair and I am not exaggerating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you put too much hair in the slot, it will get hung up.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not to mention, how much practice we&#x27;ve had and how well we can use the tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holding the hair straight, but over to the side, you&#x27; e now ready to start your curl.  </li>
            <li> really do like the InStyler.  </li>
            <li> I was like really you can turn your hair from blah to yah with this tulip iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Do pay close attention to how much hair you curl at one time.  </li>
            <li> but i had to much hair in it.</li>
            <li> DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK?&amp;#34; and it really helped me.</li>
            <li> and then press the button, you really have to watch it a couple of times and understand.</li>
            <li> and it really works on all sorts of hair types.</li>
            <li> Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> One star is too much.</li>
            <li> I love my hair enough to know that cannot be fixed.</li>
            <li> It was a real challenge to get it into the right position to actually pull any of my hair into it, and once it did, it kind of sat around the barrel very loosely.</li>
            <li> the blue light stays steady and you know that you are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 23 years old, and as long as you have common sense, and can read instructions, this product will work perfect for you!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have never had this much problem using a new tool!  </li>
            <li> That means that you separate each section out as cleanly from the rest of the hair as possible.  </li>
            <li> If I find that the hair needs a brief second to curl more, I can count to ten after the beep and it is fine.  </li>
            <li> If I find that the hair needs a brief second to curl more, I can count to ten after the beep and it is fine.  </li>
            <li> have long fine hair.</li>
            <li> So, it took me just as long as it does with the regular curling iron I use (the kind with the clip on the barrel) and didn&#x27;t save me any time at all.  </li>
            <li> This is for special occasions when you have set aside time, and maybe have someone help with the back of your head.  </li>
            <li> the front of the unit, there is a recessed metal plate which is in the shape of a full open grin in a smilie face.  </li>
            <li> not let hot barrel anywhere near skin</li>
            <li> not let hot barrel anywhere near skin</li>
            <li> About me (the reviewer): I am in my mid-twenties, I don&#x27;t normally curl my hair, as it is VERY voluminous, but I decided to try this curler anyway, as it was a gift.  </li>
            <li> With some exploring, I can go from beachy waves to 70&#x27;s disco queen to classic movie star</li>
            <li> I love this thing and the curls last through to the next day.</li>
            <li> I found that using a mirror, keeping the slot facing out from me and the iron as upright as possible, I was able to do the front and sides of my hair, but needed help with the back.  </li>
            <li> I found that using a mirror, keeping the slot facing out from me and the iron as upright as possible, I was able to do the front and sides of my hair, but needed help with the back.  </li>
            <li> It has always and still is naturally streaked blonde, light brown</li>
            <li> It does look completely simple and quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I find that using it on others (I happened to get this in time for Christmas special occasions and was able to use it on a few different heads of hair)</li>

            <li> You can also use the enclosed chart to properly curl by your hair&#x27;s texture, (ie fine, medium, or thick) to choose how much heat would be appropriate for the style you&#x27;re trying to achieve.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will buy me a few months before I have to get my hair permed again but to get the full effects, I would recommend that you hair is more of the same length and that you have time to dedicate to getting it styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Keeps grabbing more hair and wraps too tight.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Still I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend watching a YouTube tutorial before using this product to quell any concerns, and of course, read the user manual.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars really recommend for young ladies who want a easier method with curling without the hassle</li>
            <li> However, I am a more than a few months overdo.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my daughter and my wife to use, and hoped it would let them have some fun styling their hair, and get them away from the standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t find the Tulip to be any lighter than the curling iron I normally use.  </li>
            <li> Is it a fun and different way to curl your hair?</li>
            <li> I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Is it a fun and different way to curl your hair?</li>
            <li> I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li> So overall, its pretty good, my only complain is its confusing to use at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super fun to play with and I feel giddy like when I was a little girl playing hair saloon with my besties.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There  are rotation settings so you can get either a left or right curl.</li>
            <li> switch is for right rotation, left rotation, or alternating rotation&lt;br /&gt;-Top</li>
            <li> /&gt;The styler has three heat settings, three timer setting, and three rotation settings – right, left, and one that switches from left to right after each curl.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;R\\&quot; for Right, \\&quot;L\\&quot; for Left, and \\&quot;A\\&quot; which will automatically switch rotation from left to right after each completed curl.  </li>
            <li> We started out the lowest heat setting, with a 3 second timer and turning the curls to the right.  </li>
            <li> The curl falls out extremely quick and it doesn&#x27;t curl all the way to your ends if you have really long hair.</li>
            <li> My stepdaughter has fine, short blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;d want to use it on super-long hair either because it seems to get stuck inside the barrel mechanism.</li>
            <li> I see her she shows off a new style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up to trying new beauty products.  </li>
            <li> I have serious doubts that any of them did their own hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight, fine , shoulder length hair and was having trouble loading my hair into the barrel, but I expected a learning curve at first.</li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day and it gets gives my hair shinier curls than I could ever have imagined!</li>
            <li> I used the tulip and it lasted until the next day and so much faster too!</li>
            <li> Umm no way I&#x27;m not exposing myself or my young child to this!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a funny demo you tube video of a girl having the same problem.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using it and felt like I could barely wait to get it..</li>
            <li> When I wore my hair straight and used a flat iron to keep it straight, I would use the heat setting at 400.</li>
            <li> Just bought the tulip for my fianc&amp;eacute; as an early Chrismicah gift!</li>
            <li> Upon receiving my InStyler, it first instructed me to watch a short video.  </li>
            <li> This tool looks cool too makes me want to use it, not really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and requires little to no effort.</li>
            <li> I usually only curl my hair for a special night out not because I don&#x27;t like to do it, but because I need a lot of extra time.  </li>
            <li> It took a little practice &amp; was pretty much awkward to hold at first, but I eventually started curling my daughter&#x27;s hair better with more practice.  </li>
            <li> It gave a nice curl to some of my head but others were half curled, half straight with the perm at the bottom.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the button you push to spin the thing is easy to push prematurely (while you&#x27;re still trying to get your hair situated in it) but it quickly shut off the one time that it got a snag (didn&#x27;t pull or hurt or anything, shut off as soon as it felt any tension)</li>
            <li> I have tried may different curling apparatuses--Curl formers, Curl Genius, curling wand, curling iron, hot rollers, hot long twisty thingies...</li>
            <li> a learning curve at first, but if are careful is worth extra effort to learn it</li>
            <li> a learning curve at first, but if are careful is worth extra effort to learn it</li>
            <li> I twist the top of each strand slightly to make it easier for me to properly place the strands.  </li>
            <li> It has wet dry also which ladies love it for their hair.</li>
            <li> My own hair is very thick and shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time using it plus when I was able to get it to wind up</li>
            <li> I have curly hair but the back isn&#x27;t very curly and when I tried the Tulip it curls it well and leaves it looking natural like the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter got this for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It took about 20 minutes to completely curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> It would only really appeal to some one who likes all hair gadgets, or who needs a product to assist in styling.  </li>
            <li> Bought for 12 yr old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> waves look soft and natural.</li>
            <li> There is a plastic card, and it has a notched area, you can only put that much hair that fits in the cut out section.</li>
            <li> And its not heavy.</li>
            <li> It went directly to the bin.</li>
            <li> I didn’t have time to do much until the next day</li>
            <li> It now looks like one of those Brillo pads and smells completely burned.</li>
            <li> But, once I actually did it, it was very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t say that I will use it to completely replace my wand or curling iron</li>
            <li> This thing tangled and burnt my 10 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Now, Addison&#x27;s hair is natural curly</li>
            <li> It has a burn guard unlike the traditional curlers, which is very intuitive .</li>
            <li> I can only think that it would work very well on hair of one length.  </li>
            <li> I was going to cut the strand, but was able to slowly maneuver the strand out.</li>
            <li> For those that have thicker hair this product might be nice -- however for my thin hair it does not hold the curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really takes my process of doing hair on others to a much higher level of performance.ir for various occasions from pageants and photo shoots and other special occasions to casual situations where you can take more time.  </li>
            <li> That means that the slot has a right side and a left side, with the entry point in the middle.</li>
            <li> I have very long, 6-7 inches below my shoulders, fine, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It does the job, but you have to be very careful about how much hair you put in the curler, and if your hair tangles, be ready to pull the plug before your hair burns.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use (although took me a few tries to figure out how hold it</li>
            <li> and usually described as fine.  </li>
            <li> Hair massively stuck after FIRST TIME use and now it&#x27;s totally burnt.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, after one particular jam in the barrel, the silver metal part around the barrel that actually twirls your hair became stuck in the &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; position.</li>
            <li> It is also comfortable to use, I could keep my arm down in a resting position, whereas with a traditional curler, my arm would be jutting out.  </li>
            <li> It is also comfortable to use, I could keep my arm down in a resting position, whereas with a traditional curler, my arm would be jutting out.  </li>
            <li> curler has three slide switches and a button on it:&lt;br /&gt;-Bottom switch is Off, Low Medium, High</li>
            <li> Buy it only if you have long hair without those extensions which can be “jerked” right off.</li>
            <li> I have super long hair so anything that will hold a curl for a long period of time...</li>
            <li> You do have to use it a few times practicing and getting the fluid motion of handling it which is true of anything that is new</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t possibly be a woman who actually has to use it, that I am certain of.</li>
            <li> I have the original Instyler and then the Wet Dry also.  </li>
            <li> In fact we had my extended family over for a New Years Celebration (a couple weeks late) and I was able to test this curling iron out on several different types and length of hair!  </li>
            <li> my 13-year-old is happy that it is almost impossible to get burned by this iron.</li>
            <li> but at least it&#x27;s easy to return</li>
            <li> It also left my hair smelling burnt the whole day and the next day until I washed it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You could quickly become impatient, causing tangles or burning.  </li>
            <li> If you take some time to figure the machine out, watch a few Youtube videos, you will quickly catch on to the operation of it while looking in a mirror to style.  </li>

            <li> but they last all day and are so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Overall, this takes too long to be useful in daily use.</li>
            <li> Before we used the auto-curler for the first we read the instructions carefully!</li>
            <li> You could probably do just as good a job with a small curling iron or small hot curlers in half the time.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep it reasonable and simple.</li>
            <li> it clearly states in the commercial that it is not suppose to tangle your hair.</li>
            <li> Not only that but it completely damaged that strand.</li>
            <li> guard&lt;br /&gt;Timer (especially for frequent heat-tool users as it minimizes damage)&lt;br /&gt;Alternating</li>
            <li> guard&lt;br /&gt;Timer (especially for frequent heat-tool users as it minimizes damage)&lt;br /&gt;Alternating</li>
            <li> Have a few practice rounds to get the hang of it and trust me it will be as useful as your hairdryer.</li>
            <li> wife says she&#x27;s still game to give it a try, on the lowest setting, but I&#x27;m not so sure I would chance it.</li>
            <li> have done makeup and hair for various occasions from pageants and photo shoots and other special occasions to casual situations where you can take more time.  </li>
            <li> I can do light waves to tigh small curls with this, just depending on how I hold it!</li>
            <li> Took me slightly over an hour to curl all my hair on my first</li>
            <li> Took me slightly over an hour to curl all my hair on my first</li>
            <li> The actually curler works very well and creates long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> What I noticed first was that the model&#x27;s hair was much shorter than mine, not as thick, and a different texture.  </li>
            <li> I was careful not to get too much hair, tried to hold the styler straight like the instructions said, but it pulled my hair way down and kept twisting.  </li>
            <li> This is not something to use when you are in a hurry but works very well if you take the time to learn how to use it and are very careful.</li>
            <li> A little of my hair got caught in the lower portion of the hot curler part, below the supposed safety stoppers.</li>
            <li> I think it might look nicer (and be a little more user-friendly) if my hair were just a few inches longer, so I&#x27;ll try it again when I grow it out and update my review if necessary.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-it is easy to get confused with direction and where to put the hair if you don&#x27;t concentrate&lt;br /&gt;-have to be very careful to separate out each strand very well before trying to curl&lt;</li>

            <li> I found that only a very small amount of my hair could fit into the petal.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it would be worth the price if that is all you want to use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure it would be worth the price if that is all you want to use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair falls right, above my breasts, is very thick and naturally straight.  </li>
            <li> daughter&#x27;s hair is pretty straight with just a little wave when it is wet and is about sixteen inches long.  </li>
            <li> Then you PUT THE HAIR INTO THAT SIDE OF THE SLOT, holding the hair straight down the length of the curling unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes practice to get it down, but it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Besides being too big and too bulky, it is very time consuming due to the tiny amount of hair it can handle at a time.</li>
            <li> When it comes to using on other people, I rate it a high five.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to using on other people, I rate it a high five.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair and usually get a spiral perm and have them change out the rollers with two types so it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I do like the general look of the curls, but it&#x27;s such a hassle that this would only be a &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; hairstyle for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading some super negative reviews, so</li>
            <li> The first time that thing grabs your hair and starts twisting it is quite scary, but it came right off</li>
            <li> Its a little awkward at first, the biggest challenge for me was dividing my very layered hair into individual strands of one length that would fit into the machine.  </li>
            <li> I am certain you could get the hang of using this with a little practice and that is the way I left it with my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Low (350 degrees) for beachy waves and soft, loose curls,</li>
            <li> it includes a little measuring clip so you don&#x27;t put too much hair in and tangle your locks in the curling chamber.  </li>
            <li> Before the InStyler Tulip, my hair was HARD to curl and rarely held a curl for any length of time.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small paper, easily overlooked, that is the sectioning tool to show you how little hair should be put into the styler each time.  </li>
            <li> Used it on high and left it in much less than the 12 seconds suggested in the manual.  </li>
            <li> Medium (390 degrees) for medium body curls, and High (430 degrees) for tight, springy curls.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, it allows such a small amount of hair to be placed in the curler at one time, that even if it did curl my hair…it would probably take well over an hour to do my whole head</li>
            <li> One big negative I have to get out of the way first thing....</li>
            <li> Not good for super long hair... literally had to cut it after trying this item.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t thick, its fine, color treated, shoulder length hair took me about 20 minutes to curl, and even hours later those curls are still holding with only a little hair spray!</li>
            <li> My hair never holds a curl and it usually takes 45 minutes - a hour to curl my whole head , I watch YouTube tutorials all the time trying to find a way to curl my hair quicker and still never figured out a way UNTILL</li>
            <li> hair is long and this thing managed a wave at the ends only.</li>
            <li> Curls last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It works on medium to long hair of various types.  </li>
            <li> It works on medium to long hair of various types.  </li>
            <li> I read people with short hair had difficulty getting a curl and figured I would not since my hair is rather long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls actually last a long time.</li>
            <li> I think it would work for thinner, not as long( maybe above the bra strap length) hair.</li>
            <li> The cord is extra long, so you have plenty of room to maneuver in front of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Curling irons, flat irons, wands and even THIS device will have RESIDUAL heat</li>
            <li> (somewhat small), so you won&#x27;t be able to get those Kardashian curls.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a long time if you have a lot of thick hair.  </li>
            <li> (somewhat small), so you won&#x27;t be able to get those Kardashian curls.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a long time if you have a lot of thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Select your heat and time settings, insert the section of hair into the unit, make sure all hair is behind the gray dots on the opening, and pull the hair to either side tightly.  </li>
            <li> If you are left handed doing right side of your hair is difficult, same if you are right handed, left side is hard to do.</li>
            <li> Now it takes me far less time that I don&#x27;t mind curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Do thoroughly dry and section your hair as much as possible to make the curling process go quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> When using on other people, I found the lack of having to be so careful not to let the barrel touch their head was not an issue so hair was done much faster than with other implements.  </li>

            <li> Yes, you save your hands from burns of a traditional curling iron but as long as you are careful with the traditional variety, you don&#x27;t burn yourself anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s next to impossible to correctly (and safely) place hair into the tiny 1/8th inch slot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am going to give it a solid 4 stars because I think it has a lot of potential and think the fact that it did not curl all of my hair to my liking is due to the layers I have cut it my hair.</li>

            <li> You really can&#x27;t put hardly any hair in it at all.</li>
            <li> No curl, no matter how it was done, has ever lasted long in my hair.  </li>
            <li> On the box there are these four models all with long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The amount of time it takes to curl your hair is too long, and the process is finicky.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because my hair is somewhat long</li>
            <li> I have been using my wand and curling iron for a long time</li>
            <li> I got this to try on our daughter&#x27;s long hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want my long hair to tangle.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found that I had to start further down from the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li> I think my hair might be too short (approx chin-length) to work properly with this gadget, although after reading the other reviews I suspect that might be why I didn&#x27;t get tangled or stuck in it!  </li>
            <li> first time I used it, it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;You have tight curls, and it looks like your hair would look really bad, and unwearable out in public, but once you get done with your entire head, turn it upside down, and run your fingers through it or lightly tease to separate</li>
            <li> I do think with a little practice, I could get though the whole process a little faster.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this after reading negative reviews, but I am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li> This product was a little more complicated to use than the informercial shows.</li>
            <li> for temperature, this is not the same as other curling irons.  </li>
            <li> for temperature, this is not the same as other curling irons.  </li>
            <li> think in the future knowing how time consuming this device is I will use it on the front part of my hair which is straighter and let it blend it with the other parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that you can only curl small sections at a time, so curling your entire head can take a while.</li>
            <li> Today, my hair was dry</li>
            <li> Her hair is too short to “curl” and especially to use this heavy duty curing iron.</li>
            <li> The only issues are that it is not suitable for short hair, and I&#x27;ve not yet mastered curling the back of my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re limited to a maximum amount of hair per curl</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re limited to a maximum amount of hair per curl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this has to do with my length, or the thickness of the machine near the barrel.  </li>
            <li> At the head of the recessed plate there is a slot which is 1 1/2 inches long and 1/4 inches wide.  </li>

            <li> You are loosely having hair draped around a barrel</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> After this, simply slide the curler down away from your hair and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally never made it past my left side before I knew, there would be no curls for me.</li>
            <li> just enough to make my hair slightly wavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will only be curling the bottom half to two thirds of the hair (depending on hair length)</li>
            <li> Size of strands allowed is too small and the time it take to curl the entire head of hair is extensive.  </li>
            <li> It is thick, straight with a slight wave after it is washed, but the weight straightens that in a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> It did seem to take a little longer than we thought was necessary to heat up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to figure out and kind of scary how it sucks your hair in.</li>
            <li> The previous 11 reviews were all made within 24 hours of each other and by &amp;#34;people&amp;#34; who had only posted one review here to coincide with an infomercial that intrigued me.</li>
            <li> I say too long because you can only do a small amount of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have long thick hair and my daughter&#x27;s friend (who happens to be a mezzo who performs in operas internationally) has long, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> She had long flowing dark hair</li>
            <li> and their customer support is closed until Monday.</li>
            <li> you have heated up the iron (which only takes a few moments)</li>

            <li> Does not work as expected.</li>
            <li> Way harder to use than the tv commercials would have you believe.</li>
            <li> If you purchase this, be careful to not et our hair caught.  </li>
            <li> It is a lot harder to use than they show it on the informercials.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously that tool was made via hairstylists that actually HATE people doing their own hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, due to the shoulder length of my hair, I looked like Little Orphan Annie when my entire head was curled.  </li>
            <li> This curler is extremely easy to use, and it&#x27;s very difficult to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Not easily use in the opposite hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to align your hair sections correctly into the small hole where it needs to be for proper winding, especially toward the back of your head, using the mirror image.</li>
            <li> it was awkward at first on my left side since i&#x27;m a righty, but i got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> MS Atwood concludes her review by writing, \\&quot;Clumsy curl-coveters, the Tulip Auto Curler may be your saving grace--as long as you take the time to properly learn how to wield it.\\</li>
            <li> Can use a little amount of hair at a time, so it would take a long time to do my hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that is relatively thick and down to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> and I can literally curl my entire head of hair in 25 mins which has cut down my curling time almost in half!</li>
            <li> Usually I keep it longer but had recently cut it.  </li>
            <li> You can only use a small section of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> It has a small curling iron barrel surrounded by a white plastic housing that forms a barrier around the barrel so that it does not touch your face or skin in any way.  </li>
            <li> I use one direction on one side of the head, and another direction on the other side.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-makes doing hair on other people a snap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-makes doing hair on other people a snap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems this product is either a hit or miss with people due to hair types and lengths.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work unless you use fairly small sections of hair, even for wide/loose curls, so it takes quite a lot longer than a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> The amount is actually predetermined by a small bit of triangular card stock that is included.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and saw others complain that it pulled their hair out.  </li>
            <li> So, just like any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used, or you&#x27;ve used, is going to depend on all of those things.  </li>
            <li> the auto winding feature is a bit scary at first --the</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;For those complaining about how they got their hair stuck, are extremely ignorant…</li>
            <li> Automatically winds my hair and don&#x27;t have to worry if it is too tight or too loose.</li>
            <li> The instructions in the booklet that comes with the styler in a small box outlined in red tells you what to do in case of a tangle or jam, the “unlikely event”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was careful not to use too much hair</li>
            <li> unlike curl secret it has an open barrel system where you can actually see &amp; manipulate your hair plus it has built in safety guards that will STOP the machine if it were to do so.</li>
            <li> This amounts to approximately the same as a skinny drinking straw that bends in the middle.  </li>
            <li> I used the Tulip to section the hair, but was careful to use less than the sectioned amount.</li>
            <li> like all curling devices using heat, I would not use everyday as it will probably dry out the hair.  </li>
            <li> like all curling devices using heat, I would not use everyday as it will probably dry out the hair.  </li>
            <li> While it was a little bit expensive, the quality supersedes the price tag and for that I highly recommend it to anybody that can afford it because it gives a quality curl every single time .</li>
            <li> Usually I am doing my daughter&#x27;s hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> Compare that to the average oven temperature for baking at 350 degrees.</li>
            <li> Not worth damaging the hair to use this machine.</li>
            <li> And to the ladies with longer hair, you probably won&#x27;t find this machine any quicker than your average curling time.  </li>
            <li> The curling worked well, but using small sections took a long time.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is so thick that \\&quot;stylists have to book extra time\\&quot; for her.</li>
            <li> It requires that you choose a small section of hair and slide it through the opening for a curl but don&#x27;t let any other loose strands get caught up in the machine because it will rip your hair out.</li>
            <li> but it still tangled and burned my hair.d, but it pulled my hair way down and kept twisting.  </li>
            <li> I find that once I oriented the machine to face me in the mirror, if I separate the hair and pull it down, sliding it into the slot in the device is easier to accomplish.  </li>
            <li> This machine pulled all the way down to my scalp and couldn&#x27;t get it off.</li>
            <li> like one of the other reviews my strand of hair is burned and feels and looks like straw - and it smells burned!  </li>
            <li> Not very good for long hair.</li>
            <li> And it is incredibly expensive,  so much money for so little range of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife as her previous curler broke</li>
            <li> The instructions say for tighter curls use less hair.  </li>
            <li> Your hair must be about shoulder length or longer, and it&#x27;s difficult to place strands from the back of the head properly into the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and always have a hard time getting my curl to stay.</li>
            <li> We had a couple of crisis with hair getting stuck in the thing and having to rip it out because it was burning, but with a little practice they got it down.</li>
            <li> I get bored using a normal curling iron.</li>
            <li> Because her hair is so thick and long, it takes her 30 minutes to curl her hair with the Tulip, whereas it takes my wife closer to 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still practicing because all I get are tight curls.</li>
            <li> This curler does not make a tight curl at all.</li>
            <li> You are not winding this tightly around a barrel and clipping or holding it there.  </li>
            <li> You are not having the tight contact with the barrel of heat in this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You are not winding this tightly around a barrel and clipping or holding it there.  </li>
            <li> You are not having the tight contact with the barrel of heat in this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the manual, it explains how to obtain the type of curl you want for your hair type, ranging from beachy waves to tight Shirley Temple curls.  </li>
            <li> From wavy to a tight curls.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s used curlers and the curling iron to get a little wave and style here and there, but she doesn&#x27;t like taking the time to mess with it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about using a new curling tool</li>
            <li> Perhaps if one has thick course hair it would work, but it would still take a very long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a little heavy for holding at the odd angle you need to curl longer hair.</li>
            <li> It took a little patience to use it correctly, but I followed the directions and watched some styling videos and my results were just great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I am not sure what another reviewer is talking about, almost like they are talking about some other product.  </li>
            <li> There is this little triangle shaped piece of cardstock that you HAVE to go dig out of the garbage after your husband helpfully tosses it.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend unless you&#x27;re into torture devices, it&#x27;s really a little bit ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first I was intimidated of the curler, afraid that my hair would tangle and get stuck, but I was completely surprised and wrong.</li>
            <li> I was actually MAD at myself for not reading the reviews first before electing to accept this offer to test out the Tulip Auto Curler and wished there was a way to get out of doing</li>
            <li> it scared me a little</li>
            <li> Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> The iron  is a little heavy, bulky and requires a lot of patience to hold and operate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the manufacture states this is lightweight, it does appear a to be a little heavy but one can used to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint if I can come up with one is the petal should either be plastic or they should provide at least two.</li>
            <li> It definitely was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> With a few sprays of after using this my hair stays bouncy all day.</li>
            <li> I then looked through guide to trouble</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also heavy &amp; hurts my wrist.</li>
            <li> It trapped the hair in the curler and burn it.  </li>
            <li> She was frightened to death and is still crying even as I write this review.  </li>
            <li> curler is heavy.</li>
            <li> but it still pulled out a chunk of my hair and what was left behind was burnt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is heavy, bulky and not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I thought that maybe she hadn&#x27;t followed the instructions correctly, but it looks as if this is a common issue with this curler based on other reviews</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Doing this in front of a mirror, is not easy.  </li>
            <li> my hair is very thick &amp; long.</li>
            <li> have thin hair and it is long.</li>
            <li> so i put the settings on it for dark and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday now because the three second option works for me and using this curler is actually faster than straightening my hair and that is crazy!</li>
            <li> insert a very little amount of hair into the apparatus&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i was skeptical, especially after some reviews</li>
            <li> I always have in the past.</li>
            <li> I only deducted one star because of the awful yanking-out of hair by the machine on the first try.  </li>
            <li> It was actually quite difficult to remove the dead-yanked-out hair from the Tulip after it got YANKED FROM MY HEAD.</li>
            <li> I am unskilled and lazy when it comes to styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> It also pulls and break 2-3 hair in each small batch.  </li>
            <li> was truly terrified to try this after reading so many reviews of people who had horrible experiences.  </li>
            <li> was truly terrified to try this after reading so many reviews of people who had horrible experiences.  </li>
            <li> However, I did notice that the strands of hair that I put into the machine had to be really small.  </li>
            <li> you get matched curls which is difficult with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> and I usually use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> a little complicated to use, you can only do a very small strand each time.</li>
            <li> but in it&#x27;s natural state (thick and fuzzy and crazy).  </li>
            <li> and I am absolutely irritated and honestly so disappointed that I just ended up returning the product.</li>
            <li> Go slow learning use small amounts.</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s very clumsy and difficult to use, saves no time, and only takes small sections of hair.</li>
            <li> every single person noticed steam coming off their hair and the FAINT smell of hair frying.  </li>
            <li> It is a very small amount, about the size of a small hole punched through a piece of paper.  </li>
            <li> I hardly use</li>
            <li> It is hard to use for me.</li>
            <li> Using on myself, however, it is too hard to use all over my head.  </li>
            <li> Using on myself, however, it is too hard to use all over my head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard  </li>
            <li> The curler did what I wanted, so I would use it again, but it was hard to get the hang of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, the unit itself is bulky and awkward, I don’t know how I’d ever do the back of my head.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless since I got the product I thought we should at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment...</li>
            <li> I am not adept at curling my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, prepare to spend a lot of time going slowly and checking that gauge every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a product that works on my hair (thinner) and my daughter&#x27;s hair (extremely thick) until I bought a tulip.  </li>
            <li> I have hair that is slightly thick and wavy</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like me, it will take you some time.</li>
            <li> Set aside some time to do a thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and its layered--</li>
            <li> A press of the button winds the hair into the heating section and a series of slow beeps tells you that the hair is being curled.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean that you want to burn your hair at that temperature.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get the back of the hair curled.  </li>
            <li> The cardboard measurement has a very small hole but it fits about a inch of hair.</li>
            <li> is apparently very extremely serious.  </li>
            <li> It does work, but plan to spend some serious time if you have any hair at all.</li>
            <li> It was not very easy to use and unfortunately did not curl my hair.</li>
            <li> so when reviewing this device I knew I could take her seriously.</li>
            <li> It\s a little difficult to use by yourself.</li>
            <li> What I can tell you is that in my experience this is not a good styling tool.  </li>
            <li> What I can tell you is that in my experience this is not a good styling tool.  </li>
            <li> Not good for medium size hair</li>
            <li> Not a good item- would not recommend</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way and lost a chunk of hair!  </li>
            <li> Do NOT listen to the negative reviews on here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never own that though!  </li>
            <li> However, I have a lot of layers and it was very hard to get the hair to stay together in the chamber or barrel.</li>
            <li> This one ranges from 350 to 430 which is a very common heat range.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> A little awkward to get used to</li>
            <li> My hair kept getting tangled and jammed in the barrel, which is extremely painful to pull out.</li>
            <li> I was just a tad afraid when I scanned a few of the reviews...</li>
            <li> You must also get the strand inside the guide, behind the dots.  </li>
            <li> you have used the petal, you place the hair in between the two guides, behind the gray dots and choose where you&#x27;d like to start your curl.  </li>
            <li> By the time I got finished styling my hair my hand and arm were tired.</li>
            <li> -shut off sensor works great&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable, arm doesn&#x27;t get tired</li>
            <li> -shut off sensor works great&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable, arm doesn&#x27;t get tired</li>
            <li> Even leaving my thin hair in longer I don&#x27;t get any sort of curl</li>
            <li> Just got mine yesterday and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a fake post or whatever.</li>
            <li> Wish I could return after using because it was really expensive for not working AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did almost nothing to my hair to curl it.</li>
            <li> shoot found no answer but read this Scary warning: power chord made with LEAD which is known to cause birth defects</li>

            <li> Frustrating!</li>
            <li> I am doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> idea of putting your hair into something that is going to wind your hair around something is a bit of a scary thought.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those afraid of getting your hair caught, tangled or burned-</li>
            <li> Wife said it was unwieldy, awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> but I was afraid I would burn her scalp or that she would burn her hand when using it.  </li>
            <li> There is not a release button, so it is very very difficult to get the hair out.  </li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to pull out the hair.</li>
            <li> I found staying in that range almost impossible.</li>
            <li> That was impossible.  </li>
            <li> That was impossible.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Tangle-proof&amp;#34; is a dirty, dirty lie!</li>
            <li> It burned her hair so bad that she can&#x60;t get rid of the smell and her hair is coming out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad about it!</li>
            <li> and I hated doing it.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Perhaps the worst hair product I have ever purchased.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works ok.  I&#x27;m still practicing because all I get are tight curls.</li>
            <li> I love my Tulip!  I received my Tulip a couple of weeks ago.  I was a bit skeptical about using a new curling tool but I thought, why not try it?  And boy, was I glad I did.  The Tulip is fantastic.  I have pretty long hair and I have used just about every curling iron out there. It took a little patience to use it correctly, but I followed the directions and watched some styling videos and my results were just great.&lt;br /&gt;I have been getting more compliments on my hair then ever before.&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews and the blogs that I could find on the product before I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I also read reviews on right here and I am not sure what another reviewer is talking about, almost like they are talking about some other product.  Here are some links to the reviews and blogs I mentioned so you can see what I am  talking about.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Tulip, you are the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;http://divasanddorks.com/tag/instyler-tulip/&lt;br /&gt;http://www.vocalpoint.com/cms/reviews/5717&lt;br /&gt;http://www.bustle.com/articles/50069-i-tried-the-instyler-tulip-auto-curler-and-it-turned-out-to-be-a-clumsy-beauty</li>
            <li> DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT purchase this item!!!  It tangled and my hair was stuck in this so called curling machine!!  I was going to cut the strand, but was able to slowly maneuver the strand out.</li>
            <li> Not very good for long hair. It is easy to get tangled. When it gets tangled, there is the higher risk of hair getting burned. Also, only. Can use a little amount of hair at a time, so it would take a long time to do my hair. Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair that is fine, but I have a ton of it, therefore my hair is straight, substantial (not coarse), and so smooth it’s almost slippery.  That being said, this auto curler did not work for me. For one thing, it allows such a small amount of hair to be placed in the curler at one time, that even if it did curl my hair…it would probably take well over an hour to do my whole head (no exaggeration). When I placed the hair in the notch and tapped the button to create the perfect curl, the barrel simply spun around my hair but didn’t hold it tight enough to curl.  Perhaps if one has thick course hair it would work, but it would still take a very long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the unit itself is bulky and awkward, I don’t know how I’d ever do the back of my head. I personally never made it past my left side before I knew, there would be no curls for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself for Christmas and I absolutely LOVE this! I was skeptical to buy this after reading negative reviews, but I am so glad that I did! Do NOT listen to the negative reviews on here! This curler is so easy to use and gives you a perfect curl every time! It is soo easy to curl the back of the head and it will not snag or get stuck in your hair if you just use the curler right and put the hair in like your supposed to. It even has a burn guard! I use this everyday now because the three second option works for me and using this curler is actually faster than straightening my hair and that is crazy! This also works great with longer and shorter hair and even hair with layers! My favorite feature is how it alternates the directions of the curls instead of just curling all in one direction. In conclusion, don&#x27;t be skeptical, buy this curler, its the best auto curler of my life!</li>
            <li> i was skeptical, especially after some reviews but i got this as a gift and it is incredible so easy (make sure you follow the picture of how your hair goes in the curler or else it can get tangled) it was awkward at first on my left side since i&#x27;m a righty, but i got the hang of it. It does all the timing and work for you, and most of all I DIDNT BURN MYSELF. I always have in the past. My hair isn&#x27;t thick, its fine, color treated, shoulder length hair took me about 20 minutes to curl, and even hours later those curls are still holding with only a little hair spray! Just a great product.</li>
            <li> I got feedback about using the Tulip from my wife, 30-something daughter, and her friend. Based on their feedback, I&#x27;m rating it 4 rather than 5 stars. My wife and daughter have long thick hair and my daughter&#x27;s friend (who happens to be a mezzo who performs in operas internationally) has long, thinner hair. My daughter&#x27;s hair is so thick that \\&quot;stylists have to book extra time\\&quot; for her. My wife and daughter like the Tulip, but my daughter&#x27;s friend wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it, one reason being that it pulled her hair several times the one time she used it (at one point pulling some out!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who&#x27;s been using it regularly, says that it works well and she prefers using it to non-automatic curlers, but that it is \\&quot;not a big time saver\\&quot; and that as with setting one&#x27;s hair in curlers, there are \\&quot;no shortcuts.\\&quot; She says she would knock a star off the rating because using the Tulip involves a potential \\&quot;danger to hair.\\&quot; Because her hair is so thick and long, it takes her 30 minutes to curl her hair with the Tulip, whereas it takes my wife closer to 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In researching the Tulip I read and/or watched several reviews, and one that stands out is titled, \\&quot;I Tried The InStyler Tulip Auto Curler, And It Turned Out To Be A Clumsy Beauty Addict&#x27;s Best Friend.\\&quot; It&#x27;s written by Tyler Atwood and can be found at bustle dot com. MS Atwood concludes her review by writing, \\&quot;Clumsy curl-coveters, the Tulip Auto Curler may be your saving grace--as long as you take the time to properly learn how to wield it.\\&quot; My daughter agrees with that, with the emphasis on learning how to use the Tulip correctly - so that your hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck, yanked, or pulled out.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Tulip Instyler and I love it. Money is well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those afraid of getting your hair caught, tangled or burned- unlike curl secret it has an open barrel system where you can actually see &amp; manipulate your hair plus it has built in safety guards that will STOP the machine if it were to do so. I have used tulip now numerous times never once have I had this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For those worried about short hair don&#x27;t be- my hair is just above my shoulders in length and is layered and it works!! I love the result&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Time Saver! You do have to use it a few times practicing and getting the fluid motion of handling it which is true of anything that is new but once you do it&#x27;s fast and easy. For me anyways I do have shorter hair for the girls with&lt;br /&gt;Longer hair it would be more time consuming than a traditional wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint if I can come up with one is the petal should either be plastic or they should provide at least two. But it&#x27;s not that big of a deal once you get used to the appropriate Amount of hair I hardly use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product great buy!!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I watched the review by Grav3yardgirl on YouTube and Bunny is usually alarmingly honest.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was hesitant though.  My husband ordered it for me for Christmas!  What a guy!  I have tried may different curling apparatuses--Curl formers, Curl Genius, curling wand, curling iron, hot rollers, hot long twisty thingies...All with a maximum of hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the sense of honesty, I am going to confess that the very first section of hair that I tried to curl did end up mostly yanked out OF my head.  The whole thing about &amp;#34;only insert a very little amount of hair into the apparatus&amp;#34; is apparently very extremely serious.  There is this little triangle shaped piece of cardstock that you HAVE to go dig out of the garbage after your husband helpfully tosses it.  If the hair fits in the triangle, then it will fit in the machine.  My hair is mid length-past my shoulders- and usually described as fine.  It took about 30mins to do my entire head.  Getting the hang of the correct hand posture was part of the slowness.  The second time took about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curl produced was a nice, perfectly uniform, spiral ringlet.  I sprayed each section after it came out of the Tulip with some medium hold stuff.  After a couple hours everything relaxed into a really nice, looser curl.  It stayed that super nice way the rest of the day.  Day two was nice also, I could have gone out with some nice beachy waves on day two, but I wash daily.  Bottom line for me is if you have fine to medium thick hair, I think it will be good.  If you have thick hair, prepare to spend a lot of time going slowly and checking that gauge every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this thing overall.  I think I will get faster at it over time.  I only deducted one star because of the awful yanking-out of hair by the machine on the first try.  It was actually quite difficult to remove the dead-yanked-out hair from the Tulip after it got YANKED FROM MY HEAD. Which, some may argue, was user error...I&#x27;ll never own that though!  ;)</li>
            <li> Wife said it was unwieldy, awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Some of these reviews are making me question this generation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 23 years old, and as long as you have common sense, and can read instructions, this product will work perfect for you!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;You have tight curls, and it looks like your hair would look really bad, and unwearable out in public, but once you get done with your entire head, turn it upside down, and run your fingers through it or lightly tease to separate the curls.&lt;br /&gt;It literally looks like Marilyn Monroe hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it has 3 style options.&lt;br /&gt;You can choose for your curl to be left, right, or alternate (Alternate really is the best option!)&lt;br /&gt;It gave me tons of volume, and body, and the curls stayed perfect for 4 days! (My hair NEVER curls, so I was so amazed by this!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve NEVER had my hair look so good curled.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you curl your hair  a lot it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 10-15 minutes to do my entire head, and the results is just amazing.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the chance to try out the InStyler Tulip Auto Curler!  In fact we had my extended family over for a New Years Celebration (a couple weeks late) and I was able to test this curling iron out on several different types and length of hair!  The teenage girls especially were eager to play with this.  Every one of them had heard of it and several had watched YouTube reviews of this product.  One big negative I have to get out of the way first thing....every single person noticed steam coming off their hair and the FAINT smell of hair frying.  This scared two of my six test subjects off right away.  Soon as the smell and steam started they wanted it off their hair ASAP.  My own hair is very thick and shoulder length. Usually I keep it longer but had recently cut it.  I loved how cute the curls looked in my hair individually and they curl took very, very well.  However, due to the shoulder length of my hair, I looked like Little Orphan Annie when my entire head was curled.  Yet again, I love the results and didn&#x27;t mind the smell.  I thought it faded as we went on curling.  I will try this again on myself after my hair grows out some more.  My stepdaughter has fine, short blonde hair.  It wasn&#x27;t able to curl her hair at all.  My brave niece has almost waist length thick hair and her results were positively breathtaking.  She looked like she was going to Prom.  The curls took very well.  Her best friend had waist length fine hair.  Those results weren&#x27;t as strong.  The curl seemed not to take as well to her fine hair.  Those curls just kind of fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I like the curling iron.  The curls are beautiful on the right texture of hair.  I also like that you can do different types of curls with this iron.  None of the six subjects thought that the iron pulled their hair of felt undue pressure from the iron.  It did seem to take a little longer than we thought was necessary to heat up.  I would not recommend this curling iron in any way for individuals with fine hair.way for individuals with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an amazing product!!!! Bought one, LOVE IT for so many reasons and here are some of them: 1. It takes my stick straight hair and turns it into sexy, flirty, beachy waves in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;2. It seems to shine my hair and leaves it looking and feeling silky and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;3. It stops immediately and releases the strands when it detects a possible problem ( oh so smart!).&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s super fun to play with and I feel giddy like when I was a little girl playing hair saloon with my besties.&lt;br /&gt;5. With some exploring, I can go from beachy waves to 70&#x27;s disco queen to classic movie star and I&#x27;m just getting started!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hurray to the Tulip, thank you Instyler!!</li>
            <li> Very good, I just wish it could do a larger section at a time, it would take a lot less time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my tulip!! I use it nearly every day and it gets gives my hair shinier curls than I could ever have imagined! I really recommend this to anyone, once you give it a chance you are hooked! I&#x27;m never going back to my curling iron!</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and always have a hard time getting my curl to stay. I used the tulip and it lasted until the next day and so much faster too! I get bored using a normal curling iron. Whether I want to do curls for my school dance or beach waves...I would totally recommend the instyler!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a product that works on my hair (thinner) and my daughter&#x27;s hair (extremely thick) until I bought a tulip.  Usually I am doing my daughter&#x27;s hair for a long time. Not anymore. And she&#x27;s happy bc she looks adorable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great gift, this is the one. Got this for my best friend and she loves it!!  She loves the curls, how easy it is and especially that it doesn&#x27;t tangle. Everytime I see her she shows off a new style. Loves her beachy waves. AND she doesn&#x27;t burn herself anymore. The Tulip is really a cool gift!</li>
            <li> Not good for super long hair... literally had to cut it after trying this item. Ripped my hair out and caused split ends...</li>
            <li> The only reason to purchase this is if you don&#x27;t know how to use a curling iron. This curler does not make a tight curl at all. The curl falls out extremely quick and it doesn&#x27;t curl all the way to your ends if you have really long hair. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> My wife loves her Tulip. So easy to use. Now she has all the Instyler products. We just got 2 more Tulips to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter got this for Christmas. Read instructions and used as designed.  She has long thick hair. Used it on high and left it in much less than the 12 seconds suggested in the manual.  It burned her hair so bad that she can&#x60;t get rid of the smell and her hair is coming out.</li>
            <li> Love it works perfectly</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wonder who designs these products. It can&#x27;t possibly be a woman who actually has to use it, that I am certain of. Besides being too big and too bulky, it is very time consuming due to the tiny amount of hair it can handle at a time. You are to use a  strand of hair the diameter of a chopstick at a time, and there is no way to curl your crown. It didn&#x27;t tangle my hair at all because I used these tiny strands as directed. The temperature of this curler goes up to 430 degrees. Compare that to the average oven temperature for baking at 350 degrees. It&#x27;s hot and the potential for hair damage is greater than a normal  iron. I phoned my hair stylist to verify desired temperatures and she was emphatic, &amp;#34;stay in the 300s, ALWAYS.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to leave your hair in between 3 seconds, all the way up to 12. I found staying in that range almost impossible. It takes 3 to 4 seconds just to load your hair, making contact with the heat the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and this thing managed a wave at the ends only. I can&#x27;t recommend unless you&#x27;re into torture devices, it&#x27;s really a little bit ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I found it too cumbersome, too time consuming, and the potential for hair damage, too great.</li>
            <li> I am torn about the auto curler.  I am unskilled and lazy when it comes to styling my hair.  This Tulip auto curler is easy to use.  Read the settings and adjust accordingly to your desires.  I wanted to have loose curls.  I have medium thickness and length.  It took about 20 minutes to completely curl my hair.  Hair spray set the style and it lasted all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was pretty and the style lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was ready to use after reading the instructions once and using the hair sectioner to make sure I wasn&#x27;t trying to use too much hair at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this curler is bulky.  You can only use a small section of hair at a time.  You cannot curl your hair the entire length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the lack of adaptability,  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  It would only really appeal to some one who likes all hair gadgets, or who needs a product to assist in styling.  And it is incredibly expensive,  so much money for so little range of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could quickly become impatient, causing tangles or burning.  Also,  there should be a length and thickness restriction; either that,  or you should plan on spending much more time curling your hair as it is now a meticulous process.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife as her previous curler broke and she has been very satisfied with how this particular curler  has done with her hair. While it was a little bit expensive, the quality supersedes the price tag and for that I highly recommend it to anybody that can afford it because it gives a quality curl every single time .</li>
            <li> This thing is magic!  I was given this as a gift and today was the first day I tried it.  I can&#x27;t believe how well it worked!  I&#x27;m one of those girls that can&#x27;t curl my hair for the life of me.  I&#x27;ve had friends show me how again and again.  I&#x27;ve tried regular curling irons and clipless curling irons - I&#x27;ve tried everything.  Today, my hair was dry but in it&#x27;s natural state (thick and fuzzy and crazy).  I decided to just run this thing through so I could see how it worked.  Perfect curl - first time!  Very easy to use (although took me a few tries to figure out how hold it so I could get the  back of my head) and each curl was great - I didn&#x27;t have any limp ones!  My only complaint is that the button you push to spin the thing is easy to push prematurely (while you&#x27;re still trying to get your hair situated in it) but it quickly shut off the one time that it got a snag (didn&#x27;t pull or hurt or anything, shut off as soon as it felt any tension) so I feel confident using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you - this is going to change my life.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> MY granddaughter loves it. It was her Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it and it is so easy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves how easy it is to make nice professional looking curls in her hair for any style outfit she is wearing. This is a really easy to use device and it heats up very quickly. The price is very affordable too.</li>
            <li> Just got mine yesterday and was skeptical. I have to be honest here. Love love love! It is absolutely amazing! Not only does it make beautiful and perfect curls but they last all day and are so soft and shiny! I am so satisfied with this purchase. This isn&#x27;t a fake post or whatever. This thing really really does work!</li>
            <li> Bought for 12 yr old granddaughter. It was very easy for her to learn to use. She loves the way it curls her hair instantly. She has very long beautiful hair &amp; has received many compliments since using it.</li>
            <li> Looking at this product you will find that most people bought this and used it without fully understand what it was. If you actually read the instructions then you would know how to properly this this great curler. We used this almost weekly to just give a fresh new look or for special occasions. I do agree that it works best for people whose hair is not falling all the way to the ground. As long as you keep it reasonable and simple. Then you should be able to thoroughly use it to its full potential.</li>
            <li> I needed a curler that was fast and easy. I got this tulip auto curler hoping to get the results I wanted. At first I was intimidated of the curler, afraid that my hair would tangle and get stuck, but I was completely surprised and wrong. The auto curler is so much better than the manual ones and it gives me the curly hair I wanted. Instead of twisting my arms to curl my hair I now can just push the button to get my hair curly. With a few sprays of after using this my hair stays bouncy all day.</li>
            <li> She loves its ease of use.  And does a lot of styling hair at our gatherings.</li>
            <li> I love the InStyler Tulip!!! The product produces perfect curls and is easy to use! Thank you InStyler for making my hair day!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife.  She absolutely loves it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it works great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for the longest time...I have hair that is slightly thick and wavy and I wanted an easy way to add waves when I didn&#x27;t feel like doing much else to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...I was just a tad afraid when I scanned a few of the reviews...some users had tangles and burned hair but I really experienced none of the that.  I read the directions...I didn&#x27;t let it get too hot...and I was fine.  I also have a great stylist who showed me how to carefully add waves without frying my locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I using a product before I used this auto curler...one that would protect my hair.  I also don&#x27;t curl every piece of hair...just enough to make my hair slightly wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...I won&#x27;t yes this auto curler every day but when I want to add waves...I can...quickly and easily!</li>
            <li> Love this!  Curls last for a long time. Make sure you don&#x27;t have any products in your hair!! I found out the hard way and lost a chunk of hair!  Thankfully not noticeable!  A little awkward to get used to but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll love the awesome curls!</li>
            <li> I was positive when I ordered this curing iron as I knew my spouse would literally love it. Now I learn that I have a problem. Her hair is too short to “curl” and especially to use this heavy duty curing iron. Most of her curls are on the  top of her hair and does not flow downward like the photos shown on the box for the curling iron. Nevertheless since I got the product I thought we should at least give it a try. Even with her short hair it will curl the tips but they don’t look all that well. The iron  is a little heavy, bulky and requires a lot of patience to hold and operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a granddaughter that I know will be the perfect person for me to do some experimenting.  She had long flowing dark hair and I know she will just love this curling iron. Not so fast fellow! She has “extensions” in that head of hair and the curing iron will actually grab hold of an extension and proceed to dislodge it from the regular hair. I am certain you could get the hang of using this with a little practice and that is the way I left it with my granddaughter. She loves the curing iron, just has to be carful that she does not overdo. And lose some of those extensions. There are three temperature or heats settings and I am told she is trying to get used to the correct one for her hair. There  are rotation settings so you can get either a left or right curl. That is neat. While the manufacture states this is lightweight, it does appear a to be a little heavy but one can used to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give a perfect curl and with some experimenting and patience one can no doubt get the curler to preform as they so desire.  I don’t think had been a total loss in getting this item but I cannot give it five stars and will have to rate it three stars. Buy it only if you have long hair without those extensions which can be “jerked” right off.</li>
            <li> It\s a little difficult to use by yourself. It requires that you choose a small section of hair and slide it through the opening for a curl but don&#x27;t let any other loose strands get caught up in the machine because it will rip your hair out. There is no way you can do your whole head of hair without help. It took me an hour to do my medium length hair and I still could not get the back parts done because I could not reach my hair in a way that wouldn&#x27;t tangle my hair. It also left my hair smelling burnt the whole day and the next day until I washed it. It heats up fast. A timer tells you when to remove your hair. It gives smooth curls. My hair was beautifully curly but it took time to achieve by myself and not all my hair was curly. If I had help it would have been quicker.</li>
            <li> This product was a little more complicated to use than the informercial shows. Still trying to learn to load the hair.</li>
            <li> Got this awhile back for my girl and she thought it a great gift. The options for temperature were amazing she figured that was a nice touch to begin with, as her hair can tend to burn with some others as they may get to hot. The versatility was interesting also being able to get curly or wavy hair in a flash and not have to work hard at it.</li>
            <li> It works but it doesn&#x27;t hold the curl as advertised.</li>
            <li> If I could put 0 I would. This totally did not function like I had hoped. It did not curl any of my 3 girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Effortless and easy to use, picked it up and seemed to be able to get the hang of it straight away, gives those salon quality curls that you only seem to get when you pay top dollar.... not anymore!! Will be perfect for dinners with the family and other occasions. I have quite short shoulder length hair  at the moment and it still manages to give some really good results.</li>
            <li> Works great - love going from straight to curly...waves look soft and natural. Does not ever burn my skin. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Takes awhile to get the right feel for the direction you want to curl but you pick it up fairly quickly. Even if your hair gets  caught-up in the curler, it releases it with out tangles.</li>
            <li> a little complicated to use, you can only do a very small strand each time. There is a plastic card, and it has a notched area, you can only put that much hair that fits in the cut out section. And it&#x27;s a little heavy for holding at the odd angle you need to curl longer hair.</li>
            <li> This hair curler does not work of you have layered hair that makes it shorter than  your shoulders. I had to return my purchase because it wouldn&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment... I bought the original instyler &amp; it works great.  The Tulip does not curl, even on the highest/longest settings.  Wish I could return after using because it was really expensive for not working AT ALL.</li>
            <li> AWSOME TOOL! LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Its so easy to use, you don&#x27;t need to spray any solution to keep your hair staying curls.&lt;br /&gt;With the naked  clean hair, my shinning curls  stayed for more than 3 days &amp; got so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter keep hogging the Tulip, defiantly will buy one for her with my Amazon gift card.:)</li>
            <li> I love love love this new curling hair tool. It&#x27;s awsome I have total beach hair now !!! It works great</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did almost nothing to my hair to curl it. It definitely was a big disappointment. I would like to return it, but I couldn&#x27;t find an invoice with return info on it in the box.</li>
            <li> Hair massively stuck after FIRST TIME use and now it&#x27;s totally burnt. &amp;#34;Tangle-proof&amp;#34; is a dirty, dirty lie! And there&#x27;s no way to get it out besides brute force. In addition, it&#x27;s very clumsy and difficult to use, saves no time, and only takes small sections of hair. I have no clue how anyone is rating this positively.</li>
            <li> Unfortunally it had to go back it was messing up my hair!</li>
            <li> Just bought it today and will be returning it tomorrow. A little of my hair got caught in the lower portion of the hot curler part, below the supposed safety stoppers. I had to rip my hair out. Now have a patch of hair in the front of my head that is short. Not very happy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t  use it as it has a USA  plug  on. !!.</li>
            <li> I was actually impressed with the curler on my medium length hair until it stopped working Two days after purchase. I then looked through guide to trouble shoot found no answer but read this Scary warning: power chord made with LEAD which is known to cause birth defects etc...wash hands after using! Umm no way I&#x27;m not exposing myself or my young child to this! My guess is most people who own this have no idea! Returned.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair curler. It makes it so much easier to curl your hair with this product. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much easier it was when I used this product. To curl my hair it used to take me up to an hour and I hated doing it. Now it takes me far less time that I don&#x27;t mind curling my hair. This curler makes it easy and it makes it fun to do. I really do enjoy this product and I am glad that I found this product it is a life saver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product, it works perfectly !!!</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and always wanted to have curls but have never had the patience for curling irons or rollers.  I bought this because it looked so easy to use and gave you a head of curls quickly.  Read the instructions and follow the guide lines and make sure you place your hair properly in between the guard as this ensures it will not get tangled.  When the hair is in place push the button and let go.  This machine also has an anti - tangle device which means it will stop rotating if you tug at it while the barrel is turning so you can easily take your hair out if you want the curl in a different direction or somewhere else.  Not quite sure how that works but its pretty cool and removed the scare factor. I love this thing and the curls last through to the next day. Have a few practice rounds to get the hang of it and trust me it will be as useful as your hairdryer. And its not heavy. Just push the button and let the machine do the work.</li>
            <li> I never heard of the  InStyler, this is a great product and easy you use once you follow the directions or go to you tube for help, I use this at least 2 times per week, my hair looks stylishe with those bouncing curls.  I love it so much I bought my sister one for her birthday!!!</li>
            <li> No matter how I&#x27;ve tried, just gives the same size curls.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product and honestly had never spent this amount of money on a styling product before. I have very straight, fine , shoulder length hair and was having trouble loading my hair into the barrel, but I expected a learning curve at first. However, after 15 minutes of trying (and yes, I used the cardboard petal to measure and make sure I wasn&#x27;t loading too much hair), I only ended up with one successful curl. My hair kept getting tangled and jammed in the barrel, which is extremely painful to pull out. I was still willing to keep trying because I was sure it was probably an error on my part and not the product. HOWEVER, after one particular jam in the barrel, the silver metal part around the barrel that actually twirls your hair became stuck in the &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; position. Meaning I could no longer load any hair into the barrel period. I turned off and disconnected the device hoping it would &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; the barrel - no luck. I got on the manufacturer&#x27;s website looking for tech support and found nothing, so I went to give them a phone call and their customer support is closed until Monday. It&#x27;s Friday night right now and I am absolutely irritated and honestly so disappointed that I just ended up returning the product. I&#x27;ll be sending it back tomorrow. Terribly disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly good at curling my hair, but the Tulip is great.  I don&#x27;t feel like I need a third hand to use it! Great curls, little time in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am so unbelievably impressed by this tool! My hair never holds a curl and it usually takes 45 minutes - a hour to curl my whole head , I watch YouTube tutorials all the time trying to find a way to curl my hair quicker and still never figured out a way UNTILL I stumbled upon the tulip tutorial! And I thought why not give it a shot.. I bought the tulip about 2 weeks ago and I can literally curl my entire head of hair in 25 mins which has cut down my curling time almost in half! My curls literally last 2-3 days! Thank you so much for this tool! It&#x27;s truly heaven sent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s next to impossible to correctly (and safely) place hair into the tiny 1/8th inch slot.  It would take all day to do my entire head even if I was successful.  It comes with a &amp;#34;tulip&amp;#34; sectioning tool (flimsy piece of cardboard) to measure hair strands before inserting hair. Purchased today with 20% coupon at Bed, etc, Bath.  I love hair gadgets but this one is a BIG MISS.  It&#x27;s also heavy &amp; hurts my wrist. Going back tomorrow.  P.S. There&#x27;s a funny demo you tube video of a girl having the same problem.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to learn how to use it yet. It is hard to use for me.</li>
            <li> Returned it. It is only good for long hair.  If your hair is layered the shorter layers will not stay inside to make the curl.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the worst hair product I have ever purchased. Followed instructions to the letter. My hair must be too fine to use with this sort of system. I ended up having to have someone else cut it out of the darn thing. It went directly to the bin.</li>
            <li> Keeps grabbing more hair and wraps too tight.  Had to cut hair to get it untangled.</li>
            <li> It trapped the hair in the curler and burn it.  I ended up switching it off and pull the burned hair out!  It also pulls and break 2-3 hair in each small batch.  Not worth damaging the hair to use this machine.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is by far the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever gotten . It is so east and works great no more guess work and it has a burn guard I love it and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> (This is a long detailed review for those who are worried about using this unit like I was)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest with you, I was very excited to have the ability to get this curler.  I was really looking forward to using it and felt like I could barely wait to get it.. THEN I read the existing reviews on it and was terrified.  I tried to think of ways to test it without trying it on my hair- who wants burnt hair or missing patches of hair?  I was actually MAD at myself for not reading the reviews first before electing to accept this offer to test out the Tulip Auto Curler and wished there was a way to get out of doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I followed through with my plan, I would have missed one of the most exciting experiences I have had in a while with working with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IS THE INSTYLER AUTO CURLER LIKE?&lt;br /&gt;The Instyler Auto Curler is a rather large contraption.  It has a small curling iron barrel surrounded by a white plastic housing that forms a barrier around the barrel so that it does not touch your face or skin in any way.  There is no need for a resting wire as the unit does not touch a table top while it heats up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the front of the unit, there is a recessed metal plate which is in the shape of a full open grin in a smilie face.  At the head of the recessed plate there is a slot which is 1 1/2 inches long and 1/4 inches wide.  This slot is divided in the middle with an opening.  That means that the slot has a right side and a left side, with the entry point in the middle. This slot is labeled with two gray dots.  The idea is that you put the hair in the slot and depending on which way the curler is set to spin, you put the hair on that side of the slot to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler has three slide switches and a button on it:&lt;br /&gt;-Bottom switch is Off, Low Medium, High&lt;br /&gt;-Middle switch is for 3,8,12 second timer&lt;br /&gt;-Top switch is for right rotation, left rotation, or alternating rotation&lt;br /&gt;-Top button is for loading the hair onto the unit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DO YOU USE THIS CURLING IRON?&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind the curling iron takes a bit of thinking to learn to use at first.  It comes with an instruction book and you can watch videos online to help you figure out how to use it. It does take a bit of coordination at first, and using it on your own hair is not as easy as doing it on someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way that I found it best to use it is to use the lowest setting on the temperature, timer, and the individual settings for rotation.  I use one direction on one side of the head, and another direction on the other side.  The kit comes with a cardboard thing that has a hole in it so that you can estimate how much hair can be put into the unit at one time.  This amounts to approximately the same as a skinny drinking straw that bends in the middle.  Any more than that and the curling iron won&#x27;t be as effective on the hair, but you can just do a smaller strand again if you don&#x27;t get it right at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have heated up the iron (which only takes a few moments) the blue light stays steady and you know that you are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you decide which way you are curling the hair.  Then you PUT THE HAIR INTO THAT SIDE OF THE SLOT, holding the hair straight down the length of the curling unit.  MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NOT A LOT OF EXTRA HAIR SURROUNDING THIS PIECE OR IT COULD GET TANGLED.  That means that you separate each section out as cleanly from the rest of the hair as possible.  It takes some practice but it is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you press the button and the unit winds up the hair.  You will only be curling the bottom half to two thirds of the hair (depending on hair length) so don&#x27;t expect this to curl up to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the unit has wound the hair up, it beeps.  When it is done, it beeps three times and you simply pull the unit away from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THIS UNIT&lt;br /&gt;I have done makeup and hair for various occasions from pageants and photo shoots and other special occasions to casual situations where you can take more time.  If you get to learn this unit, you can really do hair beautifully and more quickly than with other implements ON SOMEONE ELSE.  When it came to using it on my own hair, I did not have as easy of a time of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that using it on others (I happened to get this in time for Christmas special occasions and was able to use it on a few different heads of hair) it works beautifully and really goes quickly once you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it on myself was more challenging.  I found that using a mirror, keeping the slot facing out from me and the iron as upright as possible, I was able to do the front and sides of my hair, but needed help with the back.  The timer does not have to be adhered to exactly.  If I find that the hair needs a brief second to curl more, I can count to ten after the beep and it is fine.  I can also remove more quickly if I want to, but will have to wait for the unit to cycle through before I can hit the button again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for temperature, this is not the same as other curling irons.  You are not winding this tightly around a barrel and clipping or holding it there.  You are loosely having hair draped around a barrel so it needs to be a bit more warm than a conventional iron.  You are not having the tight contact with the barrel of heat in this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any issues with hair winding up in the unit and getting caught or not coming out like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKE&lt;br /&gt;-puts in great natural looking curl&lt;br /&gt;-does not let hot barrel anywhere near skin&lt;br /&gt;-due to not having to be as careful about barrel/skin contact, goes faster&lt;br /&gt;-is flexible to use so you can find perfect temp and time for each type of hair&lt;br /&gt;-has built in stand and won&#x27;t damage table&lt;br /&gt;-long cord&lt;br /&gt;-makes doing hair on other people a snap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DON&#x27;T LIKE&lt;br /&gt;-difficult to use on your own hair in the back&lt;br /&gt;-large and clunky to hold when using on self&lt;br /&gt;-has a learning curve at first, but if are careful is worth extra effort to learn it&lt;br /&gt;-it is easy to get confused with direction and where to put the hair if you don&#x27;t concentrate&lt;br /&gt;-have to be very careful to separate out each strand very well before trying to curl&lt;br /&gt;-if you accidentally hit the button before hair is loaded, the unit will wind and you have to wait for the cycle to end before you can hit it again to use with the hair in it correctly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;I was truly terrified to try this after reading so many reviews of people who had horrible experiences.  After using it, I have to say everyone I used it on was really thrilled at how their hair turned out.  When using on other people, I found the lack of having to be so careful not to let the barrel touch their head was not an issue so hair was done much faster than with other implements.  Using on myself, however, it is too hard to use all over my head.  It works on medium to long hair of various types.  I used it on medium weight hair, fine hair, and slick hair all with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take the time to learn how to use it, it can turn out great.  For the price, however, if you are just going to use it on yourself, be prepared to have a learning curve challenge, especially when it comes to the back of your head. I am not sure it would be worth the price if that is all you want to use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I figure out a way to use this on my own hair in the back, I will update this review to reflect that.  Also, if I run into any problems, I will update that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rated this four stars due to the price point and the clumsiness of using it on your own head.  When it comes to using on other people, I rate it a high five.  It really takes my process of doing hair on others to a much higher level of performance.ir for various occasions from pageants and photo shoots and other special occasions to casual situations where you can take more time.

            <li> I get my hair permed every year. However, I am a more than a few months overdo. I have naturally straight hair and usually get a spiral perm and have them change out the rollers with two types so it looks natural. Now that it is growing out, I have straight hair at the roots and top and curls at the bottom. I try to scrunch it and hair spray it out to blend it and sometimes I can pull it off. I figured this InStyler would buy me more time until my next apportionment to get my hair done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been styling my hair for over 30 years and have tried about every device. When I wore my hair straight and used a flat iron to keep it straight, I would use the heat setting at 400. This one ranges from 350 to 430 which is a very common heat range. I think the hair that is getting burned is not from the temperature, but getting stuck in the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems this product is either a hit or miss with people due to hair types and lengths. It states it is “perfect for Fine, Medium, and Thick hair”. It also has 3 control settings for curling directions and 3 settings for the type of curl. Type of curl means 3, 8, or 12 seconds for the type of curl. It has a safety guard which is supposed to have “no burns, safety guards”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair and it is long. I read people with short hair had difficulty getting a curl and figured I would not since my hair is rather long. However, I have a lot of layers and it was very hard to get the hair to stay together in the chamber or barrel. It gave a nice curl to some of my head but others were half curled, half straight with the perm at the bottom. Also, to use the device all over my head it took about 50 minutes and I don’t know anyone who has that sort of time getting ready. I did not have any burns but if your hair is layered, it might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think in the future knowing how time consuming this device is I will use it on the front part of my hair which is straighter and let it blend it with the other parts of my hair. This will buy me a few months before I have to get my hair permed again but to get the full effects, I would recommend that you hair is more of the same length and that you have time to dedicate to getting it styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give it a solid 4 stars because I think it has a lot of potential and think the fact that it did not curl all of my hair to my liking is due to the layers I have cut it my hair. Other than that, I am very impressed with this!blend it with the other parts of my hair.

            <li> Just bought the tulip for my fianc&amp;eacute; as an early Chrismicah gift! Her curls look fantastic!</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my daughter and my wife to use, and hoped it would let them have some fun styling their hair, and get them away from the standard curling iron. My daughter has beautiful, thick hair, but it&#x27;s straight as a pin. She&#x27;s used curlers and the curling iron to get a little wave and style here and there, but she doesn&#x27;t like taking the time to mess with it. I had hoped that the auto curler would let her get the wave without the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that when she first tried it, the curl it created looked great. When she tried it a second time the strand of hair she was curling, got tangled in the curler. The curler stopped pulling, but there was no &amp;#34;reverse&amp;#34; switch to free up her hair. Meanwhile the iron was still hot and burning her hair?!?! She unplugged the curler, and my wife was able to work her loose from the curler, but her hair was burnt in places. I thought that maybe she hadn&#x27;t followed the instructions correctly, but it looks as if this is a common issue with this curler based on other reviews posted here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says she&#x27;s still game to give it a try, on the lowest setting, but I&#x27;m not so sure I would chance it. If she gets better results, I&#x27;ll update the review.</li>
            <li> I have very long, 6-7 inches below my shoulders, fine, dry hair.  It has always and still is naturally streaked blonde, light brown and my red is now gray.  It is thick, straight with a slight wave after it is washed, but the weight straightens that in a couple of hours.  No curl, no matter how it was done, has ever lasted long in my hair.  So I thought this would be a fun thing to try.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is heavy, bulky and not easy to use.  It comes with a small paper, easily overlooked, that is the sectioning tool to show you how little hair should be put into the styler each time.  It is a very small amount, about the size of a small hole punched through a piece of paper.  The instructions say for tighter curls use less hair.  At that rate it would take a whole day to curl my hair and I am not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styler has three heat settings, three timer setting, and three rotation settings – right, left, and one that switches from left to right after each curl.  The highest heat is 450 degrees F. There is a warning in the instruction book about using the highest heat on fine hair.  On the box there are these four models all with long curly hair.  I have serious doubts that any of them did their own hair.  The box also says perfect waves every time and no frizz styling.  The instructions in the booklet that comes with the styler in a small box outlined in red tells you what to do in case of a tangle or jam, the “unlikely event”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was careful not to use too much hair and I pulled it to the side of the barrel like the instructions suggested.  The first time that thing grabs your hair and starts twisting it is quite scary, but it came right off and I did get a nice curl that stayed curly for a day.  I didn’t have time to do much until the next day then I decided to see how different timer settings looked.  That was a mistake. I was careful not to get too much hair, tried to hold the styler straight like the instructions said, but it pulled my hair way down and kept twisting.  The instructions say in the “unlikely event” of a tangle untangle the hair.  That was impossible.  I had to cut my hair out and then trim it where it had burned my hair.  Yes I had immediately unplugged it when I realized that it was tangling my hair, but that does not immediately turn off the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that perhaps if someone was using this it might be easier to control.  I think that for a different hair type than my fine hair it might work better.  What I can tell you is that in my experience this is not a good styling tool.  I read and followed the directions but it still tangled and burned my hair.d, but it pulled my hair way down and kept twisting.

            <li> I think my hair might be too short (approx chin-length) to work properly with this gadget, although after reading the other reviews I suspect that might be why I didn&#x27;t get tangled or stuck in it!  It was a real challenge to get it into the right position to actually pull any of my hair into it, and once it did, it kind of sat around the barrel very loosely. The instructions say that it will beep 3 times when your curl is ready to release, and I never did get it to beep after spending a good 20 minutes curling my whole head - even having timed it for more than 30 seconds on some sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the curls I was able to get were loose, smooth, and quite pretty. I think it might look nicer (and be a little more user-friendly) if my hair were just a few inches longer, so I&#x27;ll try it again when I grow it out and update my review if necessary. Based on the other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;d want to use it on super-long hair either because it seems to get stuck inside the barrel mechanism. Maybe medium-length hair is the best for this type of curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very bulky and heavy, and takes up a ton of space in the hair-gadget shelf of the closet. It&#x27;s also hard to align your hair sections correctly into the small hole where it needs to be for proper winding, especially toward the back of your head, using the mirror image. It doesn&#x27;t work unless you use fairly small sections of hair, even for wide/loose curls, so it takes quite a lot longer than a regular curling iron. I do like the general look of the curls, but it&#x27;s such a hassle that this would only be a &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; hairstyle for me.</li>
            <li> From the Lady of the House:    The amount of time it takes to curl your hair is too long, and the process is finicky.    I say too long because you can only do a small amount of hair at a time. The amount is actually predetermined by a small bit of triangular card stock that is included. If you put more hair in the curler than this it will get stuck and start burning. The process is finicky because of the relatively precise amount of hair that can be curled and the fact that stray hairs will get caught in the curler and stop it (thankfully it stops). It produces beautiful curls when you get the process down. Overall, this takes too long to be useful in daily use. It takes a lot of practice to get it right without stopping the unit and burning your hair all the time.    Great concept, just needs some further refinement.</li>
            <li> To difficult to  manipulate</li>
            <li> Wife LOVES the product. Said it simplifies the process so well and is super fast and effective. Last all day and looks amazing. This tool looks cool too makes me want to use it, not really. But it does wonders for my wife who is more beautiful than ever with curls. She uses it daily just because ITS JUST SO EASY!! 5 stars really recommend for young ladies who want a easier method with curling without the hassle</li>
            <li> The InStyler Tulip Auto Curler forms beautiful, bump free curls the likes of which I&#x27;ve seen only in a salon do.  The only issues are that it is not suitable for short hair, and I&#x27;ve not yet mastered curling the back of my hair.  Your hair must be about shoulder length or longer, and it&#x27;s difficult to place strands from the back of the head properly into the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not follow the instructions, you will catch your hair in it.  You must use the included guide to make sure the section you&#x27;re curling will fit.  If you put too much hair in the slot, it will get hung up.  You must also get the strand inside the guide, behind the dots.  If part of the strand is in the gap or outside the unit, you will catch your hair.  I twist the top of each strand slightly to make it easier for me to properly place the strands.  Yes, I have caught my hair in it, and every time it happened, it was because I failed to use the Curler properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not an every-day styling tool, in my opinion.  This is for special occasions when you have set aside time, and maybe have someone help with the back of your head.  And given how much it costs to have your hair done at a salon, the unit pays for itself in a few uses.  Plus, you don&#x27;t have to go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes practice to get it down, but it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the Tulip!!! Before the InStyler Tulip, my hair was HARD to curl and rarely held a curl for any length of time. With the Tulip, I now have lots of beautiful curls that last for hours! It&#x27;s easy to use and requires little to no effort. Wonderful product!!!!</li>
            <li> Best tool ever!! Just got this and it curls my hair perfect. So fast and easy. Love it!</li>
            <li> Will being returning the product.  Does not work as expected.</li>
            <li> Way harder to use than the tv commercials would have you believe. Perhaps I need more practice? But for the price (after conversion) + delivery and having to have a converter plug you may as we&#x27;ll buy an equivalent curler in Australia which works out $20 dearer but at least it&#x27;s easy to return and you have it instantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard  to used  and almost  pulled my hair out, my scalp still hurting. I wish I&#x27;ll be able to return it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited getting this item...  read the instructions, watched the video etc...  the first time out my hair got tangled, tried the recommendation of removal which did not help.  had to finally yank my hair out.  like one of the other reviews my strand of hair is burned and feels and looks like straw - and it smells burned!  its going back tomorrow</li>
            <li> the I tulip curler worked very good. It made beautiful curls in seconds. The tulip curler is easy to use. Their are many different kinds of curls you can try and all of them look great.</li>
            <li> I thought this product worked great.  No you can&#x27;t put a ton of hair in at once like with a standard curling iron but it was quick to learn and my hair really curled and stayed curled without hairspray.  It got tangled like others said but my hair came out easily.  I have very thick hair so it did take a bit of time and it was trickier to get the hang of the back of my head otherwise I would have given it a five.  Still I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not good for medium size hair</li>
            <li> This tool is the best I have ever used.  I have the original Instyler and then the Wet Dry also.  I have not been able to get my hair to look curly without frizz but the Tulip curls so beautifully!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, don&#x27;t be fooled! The previous 11 reviews were all made within 24 hours of each other and by &amp;#34;people&amp;#34; who had only posted one review here to coincide with an infomercial that intrigued me. Another review site strongly advised not purchase this hair burner/tangler.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Highly recommend it. Always get tons of compliments on my curls whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Bought this item thinking that i would work since i saw someone review it on youtube. It seemed like it was working pretty well. I gave it a shot and the first 5 curls were beautiful. I have dark brown hair that is relatively thick and down to the middle of my back. so i put the settings on it for dark and thick hair. After a couple of curls, my hair got tangled. The machine stopped and i was able to pull the curler away it scared me a little but i thought it was a good thing that the curler stopped. I kept going with my hair and got to another strand where it got stuck. This time i wasn&#x27;t able to pull my hair free. The machine was BURING MY HAIR (i could smell it and see the smoke!) and i literally had to RIP the machine out and gave that strand about a 3 inch trim. Not only that but it completely damaged that strand. It now looks like one of those Brillo pads and smells completely burned. I love my hair enough to know that cannot be fixed. This happened to about 3 more strands after this one too.  I didn&#x27;t want to chance the rest of my hair so I returned the item. I don&#x27;t know if it was because my hair is somewhat long but, if you want to damage your hair or spend time yanking it out then go for it</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase still learning how to use it</li>
            <li> It broke right away.  I read other reviews and saw others complain that it pulled their hair out.  Ouch</li>
            <li> The InStyler Tulip Auto Curler advertises perfect curls and  waves every time.  To this girl, that&#x27;s a huge benefit, if it&#x27;s true!  I&#x27;m always up to trying new beauty products.  Hair, make up, skin care, I love it all.  Now, anything that will help get my long, straight hair perfectly curled in a short period of time is nothing short of amazing.  I usually only curl my hair for a special night out not because I don&#x27;t like to do it, but because I need a lot of extra time.  Upon receiving my InStyler, it first instructed me to watch a short video.  The video shows you the easiest way to learn how to get great curls using the InStyler Tulip Auto Curler.  That video can be found by going to instylertulip dot com.  Go ahead and watch it.  It does look completely simple and quick. What I noticed first was that the model&#x27;s hair was much shorter than mine, not as thick, and a different texture.  So, just like any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used, or you&#x27;ve used, is going to depend on all of those things.  Not to mention, how much practice we&#x27;ve had and how well we can use the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how do you get these amazing automatic curls yourself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you&#x27;ll find included in the box a \\&quot;sectioning petal\\&quot;.  You use this to measure the amount of hair that you are going to put into the InStyler to curl.  I found that only a very small amount of my hair could fit into the petal.  If you put too much hair into the sectioning petal, it will not fit in the opening and will overload the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have used the petal, you place the hair in between the two guides, behind the gray dots and choose where you&#x27;d like to start your curl.  Holding the hair straight, but over to the side, you&#x27; e now ready to start your curl.  If you&#x27;re like me, reading this sounds anything but easy.  But, once I actually did it, it was very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many features to the Tulip that make it a great product.  The Direction Switch has three rotation settings. \\&quot;R\\&quot; for Right, \\&quot;L\\&quot; for Left, and \\&quot;A\\&quot; which will automatically switch rotation from left to right after each completed curl.  Your \\&quot;Power/Heat Select\\&quot; button, allows you to pick a heat setting that&#x27;s perfect for both your hair and curl type.  Low (350 degrees) for beachy waves and soft, loose curls, Medium (390 degrees) for medium body curls, and High (430 degrees) for tight, springy curls.  You can also use the enclosed chart to properly curl by your hair&#x27;s texture, (ie fine, medium, or thick) to choose how much heat would be appropriate for the style you&#x27;re trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the InStyler.  For me, InStyler Tulip Auto Curler was very simple to use and I got great results.  My curls were smooth and had the body I was looking for.  My hair did not get tangled or stuck in the machine.  The automatic feature is fun and nice to have However, I did notice that the strands of hair that I put into the machine had to be really small.  So, it took me just as long as it does with the regular curling iron I use (the kind with the clip on the barrel) and didn&#x27;t save me any time at all.  Also, I didn&#x27;t find the Tulip to be any lighter than the curling iron I normally use.  I do think with a little practice, I could get though the whole process a little faster. I have been using my wand and curling iron for a long time and I know how to use them. Finally, I found that I had to start further down from the crown of my head.  I&#x27;m not sure if this has to do with my length, or the thickness of the machine near the barrel.  But, I can definitely get closer if I use my wand or curling iron that has a barrel and I twist manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I can&#x27;t say that I will use it to completely replace my wand or curling iron that I know and love when going for a curly style.  And to the ladies with longer hair, you probably won&#x27;t find this machine any quicker than your average curling time.  But, if you have shorter or thinner hair, this may help you get out of the house quicker  and with the style you want.  Do I like it? Yes! Is it a fun and different way to curl your hair? Absolutely! Would I recommend it? I would!  I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try.  You just may find a product you like that works perfectly with your hair type..  Do I like it? Yes!

            <li> More like auto tangler. This thing tangled and burnt my 10 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. She was frightened to death and is still crying even as I write this review.  This falls in the \\&quot;bag-o-glass\\&quot; category.  The only word that comes to mind is \\&quot;stupid\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m mad about it!</li>
            <li> My daughters are loving this curler now that they&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it. It&#x27;s a little tricky to figure out and kind of scary how it sucks your hair in. We had a couple of crisis with hair getting stuck in the thing and having to rip it out because it was burning, but with a little practice they got it down. The trick is to be  careful not to put too much hair in the thing at a time and to make sure all the hair goes in the right place--if there are strays they get stuck. The actually curler works very well and creates long lasting curls. It&#x27;s actually easy it is to use (once you know what you&#x27;re doing) and my 13-year-old is happy that it is almost impossible to get burned by this iron. Another nice feature is that you can adjust it for which side of your head your are curling so you get matched curls which is difficult with a regular curling iron. This is not something to use when you are in a hurry but works very well if you take the time to learn how to use it and are very careful.</li>
            <li> I got this to try on our daughter&#x27;s long hair.  She is constantly getting comments about how beautiful her hair is but she wanted to know what she could do to get curls in her hair like her friend, Addison, has.  Now, Addison&#x27;s hair is natural curly so I had to explain that there was almost no way she was going to have hair as curly as Addison&#x27;s but we could try this product and see how she like it. We thought about trying a traditional curling iron but I was afraid I would burn her scalp or that she would burn her hand when using it.  With the InStyler Auto Curler Tulip, you do not have that problem! The open barrel design allows you to slide a section of your hair into the open barrel and push a button to get a perfect curl.  There are safety guards to keep your hairs from touching the ceramic barrel that heats up.  With our mind on safety, we gave this auto-curler a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter&#x27;s hair is pretty straight with just a little wave when it is wet and is about sixteen inches long.  Before we used the auto-curler for the first we read the instructions carefully! My advice, try out the device on the lowest settings first and then work your way up if you feel comfortable.  Just because the heat setting says it can go up to 430* doesn&#x27;t mean that you want to burn your hair at that temperature.  I think you will be happy with the results if you use some common sense and follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;In short, was she pleased with the results?  YES!  We started out the lowest heat setting, with a 3 second timer and turning the curls to the right.  Do not try to rush the process by using more hair than is recommended at a time.  Use the measuring tool to collect your stand of hair to make sure you do not have too much.  Her hair did not get tangled into the device but I would imagine if you put more hair into the curler than it was designed for you could have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing part of her hair we decided to change the timer to 5 seconds and it worked better on her thick hair and gave more bounce to the curl.  She liked the soft loose curls that using this device gave her.  It made it look like she had a lot more hair than she already has.  Since we have gotten this product she has decided to play with it on her own.  She uses different timing settings to get shorter curls to frame her face and the longer waves for the rest of the length.  She has enjoyed styling her own hair and seeing immediate results.  She has put curls in her hair and at the end of the day still has the bounce and beauty she had when she first put them in.  The only reason we discussed not giving this five stars is the fact that it is so much more expensive than a traditional curling iron.  Yes, you save your hands from burns of a traditional curling iron but as long as you are careful with the traditional variety, you don&#x27;t burn yourself anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a nice deviceit worked better on her thick hair and gave more bounce to the curl.

            <li> FINALLY... Salon results right in the comfort of my home.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at it. I was like really you can turn your hair from blah to yah with this tulip iron.&lt;br /&gt;I am telling you. You no longer have to worry about burning your self. Its super easy to use once you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;The curls actually last a long time. I do however recommend using a moose or volumizer prior to iron your hair.&lt;br /&gt;This has given me great results. I have super long hair so anything that will hold a curl for a long period of time... IS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for salon results right at home!&lt;br /&gt;These are my thoughts and opinions of this product!</li>
            <li> Had a hard time using it plus when I was able to get it to wind up it did not curl my hair as shown on tv.</li>
            <li> I am not adept at curling my hair. When I saw this automated curling iron, I thought it would be perfect to make waves and a few curls around the face. The curler did what I wanted, so I would use it again, but it was hard to get the hang of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long fine hair. I used the Tulip to section the hair, but was careful to use less than the sectioned amount. I didn&#x27;t want my long hair to tangle. The curling worked well, but using small sections took a long time. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use this every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler is heavy. By the time I got finished styling my hair my hand and arm were tired. I suppose if I used the curler regularly it would get easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this curler very highly. It does the job, but you have to be very careful about how much hair you put in the curler, and if your hair tangles, be ready to pull the plug before your hair burns.</li>
            <li> I tried so many products, and this one is perfect to do it by yourself, just add hair spray after and the curls will last longer.</li>
            <li> Another tools that i bought for the wife. This tool is great for her and her friends to come over and do their own hair style. It has wet dry also which ladies love it for their hair. I never use it because i am bald, but my wife love this tool and her girlfriends also loves it!</li>
            <li> I ended up returning it.  my hair is very thick &amp; long. I just couldn&#x27;t make it work quite right. I think it would work for thinner, not as long( maybe above the bra strap length) hair.</li>
            <li> About me (the reviewer): I am in my mid-twenties, I don&#x27;t normally curl my hair, as it is VERY voluminous, but I decided to try this curler anyway, as it was a gift.  My hair falls right, above my breasts, is very thick and naturally straight.  I tend to wear my hair in a knot on the crown of my head, so any device that would make styling my hair any easier is welcomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use the device because I&#x27;ve never used anything that pulls your hair in, and would seemingly have the potential to get caught.  I would highly recommend watching a YouTube tutorial before using this product to quell any concerns, and of course, read the user manual.  In the manual, it explains how to obtain the type of curl you want for your hair type, ranging from beachy waves to tight Shirley Temple curls.  There are 3 heat settings and 3 time settings to achieve desired curls - very handy so you don&#x27;t burn your hair, a feature most traditional curlers do not possess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use it: You are provided a &amp;#34;sectioning petal,&amp;#34; which is basically a hair-section measurer, and it gives you an idea of the appropriate amount of hair you can feed into the curler without it tangling.  In my experience, it tangled when I used more than the recommended amount.  Select your heat and time settings, insert the section of hair into the unit, make sure all hair is behind the gray dots on the opening, and pull the hair to either side tightly.  Then press and instantly release the &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; button (and don&#x27;t forget to release your hair, or the machine will reset, thinking it has a tangle).  You will hear a beep every two seconds and then 3 quick beeps at the end, letting you know the process has finished.  After this, simply slide the curler down away from your hair and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience/recommendations: The device itself has a very effective burn guard, and an automatic shut-off sensor that worked great when I used too much hair, and when I forgot to let go of the section of hair that was being curled.  With traditional hair curlers, there is always a tendency to curl too close to the root.  With the Tulip, it is easy to rest the device against your head (almost like you&#x27;re talking on the phone) and get a nice curl that doesn&#x27;t start too close to the root.  It is also comfortable to use, I could keep my arm down in a resting position, whereas with a traditional curler, my arm would be jutting out.  Another nice feature is the Right, Left, or Alternating curl.  I didn&#x27;t burn myself a single time, which, lets be honest, is the best feature ever.  I may not be the savviest with traditional curlers, but I almost always got singed once or twice with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up:&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re limited to a maximum amount of hair per curl (somewhat small), so you won&#x27;t be able to get those Kardashian curls.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a long time if you have a lot of thick hair.

            <li> I just recently bought the Tulip hair curler.  I can honestly say I absolutely LOVE it!  I have a lot of hair that is coarse and wavy.  This curler can curl and polish my hair in a matter of 30 minutes.  The best part about it is no more burning yourself like you would with a curling iron or curling wand.  The burn guard works well.  Just make sure you follow the directions and don&#x27;t put too much hair in the curler at one time.  Using the right amount of hair, you get the perfect curl!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Curling my hair just became effortless!  I&#x27;m in love with this product because it curls my hair quickly, effectively, and safely.  More importantly, I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning myself like I would with a traditional curing iron or wand.  The cord is extra long, so you have plenty of room to maneuver in front of the mirror.  The Tulip also comes with a handy users&#x27; manual and style guide to help you figure out which settings is most appropriate for your hair-type and desired style, and (bonus!) it includes a little measuring clip so you don&#x27;t put too much hair in and tangle your locks in the curling chamber.  I&#x27;ve been reading some super negative reviews, so I hope the following tips will help out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Do pay close attention to how much hair you curl at one time.  Follow Tulip&#x27;s directions to the letter so your curls come out right the first time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Do thoroughly dry and section your hair as much as possible to make the curling process go quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3. Do use a fine-tooth comb to de-tangle and smooth your hair just before inserting a section into the curler.&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t overload the curling chamber, and don&#x27;t load your hair incorrectly or allow stray hairs to be drawn in during the curling process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s it!  I went from curling my hair in 30-45 minutes to 10-15 minutes in a matter of days!</li>
            <li> I have super long hair right now and it works great-- much better than I expected. It&#x27;s important to follow the directions to avoid tangling. The only downside is that you can only curl small sections at a time, so curling your entire head can take a while. This curler is extremely easy to use, and it&#x27;s very difficult to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get the back of the hair curled.  If the air does not get into the guide, it will start to twist, but the hair will get tangled and the hair will et caught inside.  There is not a release button, so it is very very difficult to get the hair out.  M hair has gotten caught several time and when getting it out, I have pulled out clumps of hair. when the hair does get caught into the rolling device, it is still heating the hair, so you can&#x27;t take too much time to get the hair uncaught or it will burn even more.  When it does work as it is suppose to, the curls are great, but does not last as many days as it states it will when put on the tight curl.  If you purchase this, be careful to not et our hair caught.  I found that the button you push to start the winding of the hair can get pushed too easily while trying to get your hair into the guide.  This is when the hair will get tangled up.  They need to upgrade tis product with a release button, to prevent the tangled up hair.  I have lost several clumps of hair because there is no release button and it is very difficult to pull out the hair.</li>
            <li> easy to use and made wonderful curls</li>
            <li> Not the easiest curling tong to use, and hair does have a tendency to get stuck even if you do only put through the recommended amount of hair.</li>
            <li> This keeps getting tangled in hair.  Not a good item- would not recommend</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loves it...!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to compliment the InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron which I gifted to my teenage nieces. Being unaccustomed to these sort of products, I&#x27;ve been given great feedback from the two during a family dinner. According to them, the curler is easy to use and functions well for the different types of hair that they have--also, they love the possible variations that they can do for their hair.</li>
            <li> Love this item! Was super easy to learn to use even doing the back of my hair. Had one snag with it but i had to much hair in it. Go slow learning use small amounts. But makes beautiful curls that last a long time. Very impressed great product.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t own this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) it clearly states in the commercial that it is not suppose to tangle your hair. Fact that is does, and even mentions what to do in a manual in case it does, is not good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Curling irons, flat irons, wands and even THIS device will have RESIDUAL heat even if you &amp;#34;unplug&amp;#34; it. With that said it takes only SECONDS to damage hair that is trapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously that tool was made via hairstylists that actually HATE people doing their own hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon seeing the commercial, I had thoughts of my hair getting tangled. And now, reading these reviews to find it ACTUALLY HAPPENS....No Thank You!</li>
            <li> still trying it but right now it is doing ok</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny once you get the hang of it it makes beautiful curls I love this item would buy it again again</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it it anglrs yhr hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I hope this review will help people and they won&#x27;t get their hair stuck in the curler. Ok, so I got this, read the manual and followed the directions but my hair got stuck. So instead of yanking my hair I just changed the curling direction and press the curl button and they came right out, tried again, didn&#x27;t work. Frustrating! My friend just bought one and she had the same issue. So I decided to return. But... I was thinking there is no way this product is $100 and not working, doesn&#x27;t make sense! May be I am doing it wrong. And I was.. so I watched this youtube video &amp;#34;TULIP INSTYLER - DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK?&amp;#34; and it really helped me. The technique is to &amp;#34;move the hair on the side&amp;#34; and then press the button, you really have to watch it a couple of times and understand. After watching the video, I tried again, and this it worked like a charm :) it is actually amazing! I have layers in my hair and it worked on all different lengths. The cardboard measurement has a very small hole but it fits about a inch of hair. If you have thick hair like me, it will take you some time. Once you get the hand of it, its still faster than using the curling iron because it is automatic, has a timer and heat is spread out evenly because for the ceramic rod. It has a burn guard unlike the traditional curlers, which is very intuitive . So overall, its pretty good, my only complain is its confusing to use at first and I wish it took more than an inch. Other than that its pretty good and give very professional results! Hey beauty takes time and money but we are worth it ;)</li>
            <li> It is a lot harder to use than they show it on the informercials. You really can&#x27;t put hardly any hair in it at all. It does work, but plan to spend some serious time if you have any hair at all. You could probably do just as good a job with a small curling iron or small hot curlers in half the time.</li>
            <li> VERY neat concept for better curl control! I can do light waves to tigh small curls with this, just depending on how I hold it! It takes a while to use this type with my thick hair, but it is worth it if I really want my to look nice for a special occasion. Worth every penny, I love it!</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.  Size of strands allowed is too small and the time it take to curl the entire head of hair is extensive.  Not easily use in the opposite hand.  If you are left handed doing right side of your hair is difficult, same if you are right handed, left side is hard to do.</li>
            <li> I have had the original instyler and it worked wonders. It was time to get another one before that one died. Got the Tulip and it is wonderful. Better than the original. It has different ways to curl and different heat settings so i can get different type of curls. From wavy to a tight curls. Automatically winds my hair and don&#x27;t have to worry if it is too tight or too loose. It does all the guess work for me. Call me lazy but gets my hair looking perfect all the time.</li>
            <li> It took a little practice &amp; was pretty much awkward to hold at first, but I eventually started curling my daughter&#x27;s hair better with more practice.  She loves it! And so do I! Lol!!! Kudo&#x27;s To the inventor!!!!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair but the back isn&#x27;t very curly and when I tried the Tulip it curls it well and leaves it looking natural like the rest of my hair. Also leaves it shiney and not tangled. I&#x27;m hooked!!!!</li>
            <li> It is pretty darn amazing. Easy and it really works on all sorts of hair types. Set aside some time to do a thick head of hair. And make sure to separate the hair as recommended. I got two and am looking to buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> For those that have thicker hair this product might be nice -- however for my thin hair it does not hold the curl.&lt;br /&gt;InStyler has a timer/settings that will beep when the hair is &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; that is based upon curl tightness and hair.  Even leaving my thin hair in longer I don&#x27;t get any sort of curl that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the auto winding feature is a bit scary at first --the idea of putting your hair into something that is going to wind your hair around something is a bit of a scary thought.  Let me be clear that it worked beautifully and I did not have my hair become tangled.  However I worry that if I continued to use it the odds would eventually &amp;#34;not be in my favor&amp;#34; so to speak.</li>
            <li> It was not very easy to use and unfortunately did not curl my hair. Was able to return for full refund. Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box of the Instyler Tulip Auto Curler, I must admit that I was skeptical--especially after I saw the cardboard Tulip device that is meant to act as a guide for the maximum hair thickness to be curled at one time.  My hair is thick and its layered--so I figured that coaxing my wavy hair into curls with this device was going to take a longgggg while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. Make sure you take out some time to learn how to operate the machine.  My learning time was kicked off with Bunny&#x27;s review on YouTube--she tests out the Curler in front of her mirror and her comments will help guide you when you try out the Curler for the first time. Its a little awkward at first, the biggest challenge for me was dividing my very layered hair into individual strands of one length that would fit into the machine.  I made sure, after reading some of the disaster tangles on this site, that I used the cardboard thickness measure.  The next challenge was getting the device in the correct position to insure that my hair went in it in the proper way.  Doing this in front of a mirror, is not easy.  I find that once I oriented the machine to face me in the mirror, if I separate the hair and pull it down, sliding it into the slot in the device is easier to accomplish.  A press of the button winds the hair into the heating section and a series of slow beeps tells you that the hair is being curled.  A faster succession of beeps indicates that its time to slide the curler down--and out the comes the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is layered, I do not think I will try this on the top part of my head--its just too short--but, I will use this to touch up the bottom and sides of my hair--the results were a far neater hair style, which I liked.  Using the curler was successful; I experienced no tangles and no burning--just uniform curls.  Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  The Instyle Tulip Auto Curler worked well on my layered hair.  I can only think that it would work very well on hair of one length.  If you take some time to figure the machine out, watch a few Youtube videos, you will quickly catch on to the operation of it while looking in a mirror to style.  Great for a finishing touch for me--like all curling devices using heat, I would not use everyday as it will probably dry out the hair.

            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to any of the people complaining about this device!&lt;br /&gt;I love curly hair and I was looking for a good curling device. So I looked up reviews and the first video I saw was grav3yardgirl&#x27;s youtube video, she is always honest about the things she try&#x27;s so when reviewing this device I knew I could take her seriously. She thought it was amazing so at that point I knew I wanted one.&lt;br /&gt;For those complaining about how they got their hair stuck, are extremely ignorant… The tulip comes with a cardboard shaped triangle which includes a tiny hole, you are supposed to put you hair into the hole to see how much hair you can fit in the device. If you exceed this amount of hair then you will get your hair stuck. If people actually read the directions then there would be no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this device and I usually use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> Followed directions to the letter but it still pulled out a chunk of my hair and what was left behind was burnt. I am a hair dresser and I have never had this much problem using a new tool!  I have fine hair, and its shoulder length shouldn&#x27;t have caused this much problem. I would not suggest it. One star is too much.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. This is a Health hazard. Look at the pics. This machine pulled all the way down to my scalp and couldn&#x27;t get it off. Had to cut my hair and still can&#x27;t pull off the hair of the machine. DO NOT PURCHASE YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR HAIR. I GOT IT AND OPENED IT RIGHT AWAY TO USE IT .I PRESSED THE BUTTON AND WOULD NOT STOP WRAPPING MY HAIR IN THE BARREL HAD TO CUT A PIECE OF MY HAIR OFF AND WHEN I CALLED THEY REFUSE TO HELP! VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT NEVER AGAIN ! Someone needs to pull this product off the market and sue this company.</li>
