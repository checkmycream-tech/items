            <li> can compare to similar scrafs due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t recieve this scarf.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to get here.</li>
            <li> In the picture it looked to me like a thick winter scarf but is more like a thin silky scarf.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected</li>
            <li> Tool awhile to get here, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> The ends are not sewn well - it&#x27;s not a high quality scarf, but at the price, it was a steal!</li>
            <li> , mine came really dark, not tiny bit like I&#x27;ve read in other posts, you can hardly notice the leopard spots.</li>
            <li> Soft thin fabric.</li>
            <li> Just as expected!!</li>
            <li> Plus it arrived 2 WEEKS before it was expected!!</li>
            <li> I disliked this product due to the fact that it never came after two months.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE THIN, BUT IT WORKS</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this scarf isn&#x27;t what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Very small ...</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the scarf I received, the scarf I received looks nothing like the one I see in the picture.</li>
            <li> The fabric is extremely thin making the scarf seem chintzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy!</li>
            <li> The material had a weird smell.</li>
            <li> it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly shocked by the quality of this scarf.</li>

            <li> Very pretty scarf. In the picture it looked to me like a thick winter scarf but is more like a thin silky scarf. Lovely product just not what I thought it wad</li>
            <li> ok not the same pattern</li>
            <li> It is not what it even looks like. It is so short not long like in the picture. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is okay to do wear as a head scarf</li>
            <li> Wish it was longer can&#x27;t use as a scarf.</li>
            <li> Beautiful love it nice rich colors</li>

            <li> it was not a long. It looks like my grandmas head scarf</li>
            <li> It doesnt look same as the picture....material is cheap</li>
            <li> The scarf is not the product advertised at all. It&#x27;s short and not long and looks cheap in person. Good thing it was only like $3 when I bought it, but still. It&#x27;s not the product I thought I paid for and their advertising was very deceiving. I kept it and I still wear it, but I&#x27;m salty that it&#x27;s not the product that it perceived to be. Oh well, get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
            <li> The scarf is very pretty! Nice material, good price, and goes really well with everything. I really like it.Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the scarf I received, the scarf I received looks nothing like the one I see in the picture. ... I&#x27;m not happy!</li>

            <li> Item came just as described!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this scarf isn&#x27;t what I had expected. The fabric is extremely thin making the scarf seem chintzy. Also, it isn&#x27;t too long.  I was hoping for more of the quality/look as in the photos &amp; advertised description.  The one good benefit is the price was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I do not like this scarf due to it being short. Being short means I can not wear it like I want to.</li>
            <li> I like the scarf that I received,however it is not the same one that was pictured.  It&#x27;s lighter in color and has two different leopard prints on it in stripes (not even close to the picture) after waiting over a month for delivery it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Nice new scarf. Soft thin fabric. Looks very nice on.</li>
            <li> The scarf is so cute, love it!&#x27;</li>

            <li> Nothing like the picture! The print is completely different and alot smaller! I&#x27;m extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> Tool awhile to get here, but that was expected. Scarf in photo has more tan colors while the scarf that came has more browns and is sheer in material. I like it better, actually. The ends are not sewn well - it&#x27;s not a high quality scarf, but at the price, it was a steal! Be sure to wash on a gentle cycle and in a laundry bag and it should last just fine. I am short and the scarf is not long - for me, it&#x27;s a great length! Super happy w/ the purchase!</li>

            <li> Great price for a great scarf!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the negative reviews got the same product I did, but am in LOVE with this scarf!! Its long, good quality fabric, soft and beautiful... and for the price, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! Plus it arrived 2 WEEKS before it was expected!!</li>
