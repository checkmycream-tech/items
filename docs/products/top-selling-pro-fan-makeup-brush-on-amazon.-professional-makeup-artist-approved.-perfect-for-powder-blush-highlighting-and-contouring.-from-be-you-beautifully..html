            <li>is truly a very good investment especially for beauty and makeup enthusiast like me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything you want a fan brush to be-- soft, great at holding powders, and it evenly distributes makeup.</li>
            <li>It feel soft and luxurious, and the size are great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews it was the perfect softness/firmness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and the bristles are good quality.</li>
            <li>Foundation goes on smooth and distributes evenly.</li>
            <li>I use this brush for highlighter or to dust a light layer of powder on my face, and it has done wonders for my makeup aesthetically.</li>
            <li>nice quality, haven&#x27;t used much</li>
            <li>This brush feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>Although I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, my opinion is from my own personal experience with this brush and was not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>so they are good on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite brushes that I own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely soft and has a good handle.</li>
            <li>, Beautifully brush I&#x27;ve purchased but it most certainly won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful and soft, large face brush.  </li>
            <li>Makes putting on blush super easy</li>
            <li>It is soft and gentle for my skin, and it makes me feel beautiful.</li>
            <li>A girl can never have too many makeup brushes and this one is definitely my new favorite for applying mineral powders.</li>
            <li>Nice strong handle and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristles are incredibly soft, yet dense enough to deposit the perfect amount of product on my face.</li>
            <li>This also helps keep it clean when it&#x27;s in my make-up box.</li>
            <li>More dense than your usual highlighter brush but applies the highlighter just beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, have a nice shape and are plentiful.</li>
            <li>nice brush, very soft</li>
            <li>But this one is just right!</li>
            <li>Not only is this brush beautiful but very functional.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love this brush as much as I was hoping -but</li>
            <li>omg Very Very soft and glad across your face so nice highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is super soft with dense bristles which allows for a smooth, even application every time and cleaning is quick and easy also, just use a gentle liquid soap and run under warm water, it even dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this new addition to my brushes!</li>
            <li>Well, It was a lot softer than I had expected, but perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, I washed it first, not one single bristles came out, &amp; it provides perfect coverage.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s soft, it places my bronzer exactly where I want it and leaves my cheekbones looking absolutely fabulous!!</li>
            <li>handle is relatively longer, which is really good for this kind of brush since it gives you enough control whenever you use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it primary to blend in my make up and so far I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brush.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;It applies very smooth and even, it gives me the perfect natural, subtle blush application ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that most brushes do not balance these two things well - they are either very soft but don&#x27;t provide enough coverage, or provide good coverage but are very rough/hard on skin.    </li>
            <li>Perfect bronzing brush for subtle all over color!</li>
            <li>I washed this brush right away and NO shedding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more brushes from Be You, Beautifully to replace my old ones, they&#x27;re high quality, soft and covers a large area with each brush</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful brush that will last a long time to come!  </li>
            <li>I use it predominantly for a light coat of powder to set my foundation and WOW</li>
            <li>This is my first brush from them</li>
            <li>My first time trying a fan brush</li>
            <li>This is the first</li>
            <li>So soft and light.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for in a fan brush</li>
            <li>and they all said the same thing--your make-up is only going to look as good as the tools you use to apply it.</li>
            <li>It is high quality and fun to use.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely FULL, lush, feels so decadent to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Pro Fan Makeup Brush is definitely a must have for those who love having high quality makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>I also love that the bristles are not only very soft</li>
            <li>but I have a few of their sponge beauty blenders and those are my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>Very high Quality fan brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush works out really well and the hair</li>
            <li>It made putting my makeup on so much easier</li>
            <li>I am going to have to buy the whole set now.</li>
            <li>The handle is very sturdy, and there is no brush fall-out or shedding whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush for anyone who wants a blush or powder brush.</li>
            <li>This fan brush was better than expected when I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to using it.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the handle</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>Really like this brush.</li>
            <li>When I washed it, the brush dried nicely and evenly, and no bristles were lost.</li>
            <li>Legit &amp; professional with HIGH-QUALITY bristles!!!</li>
            <li>It actually improves the appearance of my makeup and skin (much more than regular brushes, and something I really needed!)</li>
            <li>This was a bit too flimsy for that -not terribly flimsy, but a little more than I expected</li>
            <li>The handle is quite long and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>My new obsession!</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and the brush is made well!</li>
            <li>And I feel with the high quality,</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>bristles are synthetic and soft but really apply product evenly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Complete use and care instructions are much appreciated.</li>
            <li>There are tons of bristles, making the brush nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>This brush is much bigger than i expected, which is fine!</li>
            <li>I glides in my skin so smoothly like no other.&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing this brush, I dont think I will be needing any other fan brush</li>
            <li>As for application, like I said, I&#x27;m new to this</li>
            <li>far, it seems to be a decent quality.  </li>
            <li>so I still follow all the directions in the videos, and when I do there is no unwanted fall out of power from the brush, yet it releases it easily with a few shakes and taps when your done with that particular product.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as I expected and looks as if it costs way more than it actually does.</li>
            <li>Love this brush..so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how silky soft it is while it worked so well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>brush is so dense and so soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I will say, however that this might work well for the powdered highlighter above the cheekbones and as others have said -good for sweeping away fallout (definitely better than those really thin ones with not very many hairs).  </li>
            <li>The price is great as well considering how expensive similar brushes run at department stores.</li>
            <li>Its a really soft brush and the bristles have not came out any at all.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels like a professional brush that you might see in online video tutorials or at the MAC counter.</li>
            <li>Did not want to chance lossing my professional fan brush.</li>
            <li>Has a sturdy handle and soft bristles too.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel like a professional.  </li>
            <li>really soft</li>
            <li>Brush is soft.  </li>
            <li>Its really soft and well made.</li>
            <li>So soft and no shed.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, as most brushed are too rough or if they are soft, all the bristles fall out, I was unbelievably surprised at this brush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I never experienced any fall outs or any bristles shedding, I have cleaned and wash this brush many times already.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is super soft and thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed it 5 times and still no loose hairs and the net tube</li>
            <li>I love fan brushes for highlighting and adding a little blush to the cheeks and usually I prefer the smaller ones</li>
            <li>It is super soft and I have not experienced any shedding.</li>

            <li> then I was hoping for a good brush for contouring.  </li>
            <li> My biggest criteria when it comes to determining whether a brush is good or not is its softness to coverage ratio.</li>

            <li> is truly a very good investment especially for beauty and makeup enthusiast like me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything you want a fan brush to be-- soft, great at holding powders, and it evenly distributes makeup.</li>
            <li> It feel soft and luxurious, and the size are great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews it was the perfect softness/firmness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and the bristles are good quality.</li>

            <li> nice quality, haven&#x27;t used much</li>
            <li> This brush feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> Although I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, my opinion is from my own personal experience with this brush and was not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> so they are good on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite brushes that I own.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely soft and has a good handle.</li>
            <li> , Beautifully brush I&#x27;ve purchased but it most certainly won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and soft, large face brush.  </li>
            <li> Makes putting on blush super easy</li>
            <li> It is soft and gentle for my skin, and it makes me feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> A girl can never have too many makeup brushes and this one is definitely my new favorite for applying mineral powders.</li>
            <li> Nice strong handle and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are incredibly soft, yet dense enough to deposit the perfect amount of product on my face.</li>
            <li> This also helps keep it clean when it&#x27;s in my make-up box.</li>
            <li> More dense than your usual highlighter brush but applies the highlighter just beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, have a nice shape and are plentiful.</li>
            <li> nice brush, very soft</li>
            <li> But this one is just right!</li>
            <li> Not only is this brush beautiful but very functional.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this brush as much as I was hoping -but</li>
            <li> omg Very Very soft and glad across your face so nice highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is super soft with dense bristles which allows for a smooth, even application every time and cleaning is quick and easy also, just use a gentle liquid soap and run under warm water, it even dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this new addition to my brushes!</li>
            <li> Well, It was a lot softer than I had expected, but perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, I washed it first, not one single bristles came out, &amp; it provides perfect coverage.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s soft, it places my bronzer exactly where I want it and leaves my cheekbones looking absolutely fabulous!!</li>
            <li> handle is relatively longer, which is really good for this kind of brush since it gives you enough control whenever you use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it primary to blend in my make up and so far I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brush.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;It applies very smooth and even, it gives me the perfect natural, subtle blush application ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that most brushes do not balance these two things well - they are either very soft but don&#x27;t provide enough coverage, or provide good coverage but are very rough/hard on skin.    </li>
            <li> Perfect bronzing brush for subtle all over color!</li>
            <li> I washed this brush right away and NO shedding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more brushes from Be You, Beautifully to replace my old ones, they&#x27;re high quality, soft and covers a large area with each brush</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful brush that will last a long time to come!  </li>
            <li> I use it predominantly for a light coat of powder to set my foundation and WOW</li>
            <li> This is my first brush from them</li>
            <li> My first time trying a fan brush</li>
            <li> This is the first</li>
            <li> So soft and light.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a fan brush</li>
            <li> and they all said the same thing--your make-up is only going to look as good as the tools you use to apply it.</li>
            <li> It is high quality and fun to use.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely FULL, lush, feels so decadent to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Pro Fan Makeup Brush is definitely a must have for those who love having high quality makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> I also love that the bristles are not only very soft</li>
            <li> but I have a few of their sponge beauty blenders and those are my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> Very high Quality fan brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush works out really well and the hair</li>
            <li> It made putting my makeup on so much easier</li>
            <li> I am going to have to buy the whole set now.</li>
            <li> The handle is very sturdy, and there is no brush fall-out or shedding whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush for anyone who wants a blush or powder brush.</li>
            <li> This fan brush was better than expected when I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to using it.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the handle</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> Really like this brush.</li>
            <li> When I washed it, the brush dried nicely and evenly, and no bristles were lost.</li>
            <li> Legit &amp; professional with HIGH-QUALITY bristles!!!</li>
            <li> It actually improves the appearance of my makeup and skin (much more than regular brushes, and something I really needed!)</li>
            <li> This was a bit too flimsy for that -not terribly flimsy, but a little more than I expected</li>
            <li> The handle is quite long and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> My new obsession!</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and the brush is made well!</li>
            <li> And I feel with the high quality,</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> bristles are synthetic and soft but really apply product evenly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Complete use and care instructions are much appreciated.</li>
            <li> There are tons of bristles, making the brush nice and thick.  </li>
            <li> This brush is much bigger than i expected, which is fine!</li>
            <li> I glides in my skin so smoothly like no other.&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing this brush, I dont think I will be needing any other fan brush</li>
            <li> As for application, like I said, I&#x27;m new to this</li>
            <li> far, it seems to be a decent quality.  </li>
            <li> so I still follow all the directions in the videos, and when I do there is no unwanted fall out of power from the brush, yet it releases it easily with a few shakes and taps when your done with that particular product.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as I expected and looks as if it costs way more than it actually does.</li>
            <li> Love this brush..so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how silky soft it is while it worked so well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> brush is so dense and so soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I will say, however that this might work well for the powdered highlighter above the cheekbones and as others have said -good for sweeping away fallout (definitely better than those really thin ones with not very many hairs).  </li>
            <li> The price is great as well considering how expensive similar brushes run at department stores.</li>
            <li> Its a really soft brush and the bristles have not came out any at all.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels like a professional brush that you might see in online video tutorials or at the MAC counter.</li>
            <li> Did not want to chance lossing my professional fan brush.</li>
            <li> Has a sturdy handle and soft bristles too.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel like a professional.  </li>
            <li> really soft</li>
            <li> Brush is soft.  </li>
            <li> Its really soft and well made.</li>
            <li> So soft and no shed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, as most brushed are too rough or if they are soft, all the bristles fall out, I was unbelievably surprised at this brush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I never experienced any fall outs or any bristles shedding, I have cleaned and wash this brush many times already.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is super soft and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it 5 times and still no loose hairs and the net tube</li>
            <li> I love fan brushes for highlighting and adding a little blush to the cheeks and usually I prefer the smaller ones</li>
            <li> It is super soft and I have not experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> spreads a little too much and gets slightly where it shouldn&#x27;t if the brush isn&#x27;t pretty firm).  </li>
            <li> it;s going to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> It is soft, yet just stiff enough.  </li>
            <li> If this company made a similar brush in 2 progressively smaller sizes I don&#x27;t see why there would be the need for any other brushes except specialty eyeliner ad lip brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a fan brush for a long time and could not find an affordable one to my liking.  </li>
            <li> So every time I make a trip to Mac or Sephora to buy a new product I buy an expensive new brush to go with it.</li>
            <li> I have not had one single hair fall out of it yet!</li>
            <li> Some are too hard, some are too soft.  </li>
            <li> This is especially helpful when using bronzer since before I had to have a brush specifically dedicated just for that as it would stick to the brush so much it made the brush useless for anything else.</li>
            <li> Another thing that I am nit-picky about since I am honestly not very knowledgeable about makeup is having the type of brush imprinted on the handle.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate the name/use of the brush being imprinted since I tend to get confused when all of my brushes are intermingled together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thick and soft brush, sturdy and does not fall apart.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid at first as this brush is a lot bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> Some are too big, some are too small.</li>
            <li> synthetic hair, harbors less bacteria&lt;br</li>
            <li> No bristles fall out when i use it and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell that some new brushes can have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed a few times already and no shedding at all.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed (and this is coming from a super picky personðŸ˜‰).</li>
            <li> overly stiff make up brushes.</li>
            <li> (I have a small face and the contour powder</li>
            <li> I am by no means a make-up pro and have just gotten into learning about how to apply and wear make-up this past year.</li>
            <li> My other one was smashed, ugly, and barely useable.  </li>
            <li> it is a very firm brush.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the brush and that its not super thin.  </li>
            <li> thick brush handle</li>
            <li> Not great for applying liquid foundation</li>
            <li> have become obsessed with using this brush to put on my highlighter.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> It feels like a very expensive brush.  </li>
            <li> I have used their products before and have never been disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great makeup brush. I&#x27;ve recently switched to liquid foundation and prefer a brush to sponge applicator. There is nothing quite like a good makeup brush. Foundation goes on smooth and distributes evenly. The brush is like silk.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality. Great looking brush,  use daily with no issues.</li>
            <li> Great Quality and so very soft!!!</li>
            <li> Packaging is amazing. I use this brush for blending and some highlighting. This brush works out really well and the hair it&#x27;s very soft. The brush doesn&#x27;t shed. Great quality.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!  It is so soft and it applied my powder beautifully.  I can&#x27;t get over how silky soft it is while it worked so well!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush!  It made putting my makeup on so much easier and it worked perfectly for me.  I use all powder makeup, so I used this for all of the face powders and it did a perfect job on all of them!  It is a beautiful brush that will last a long time to come!  If you wear makeup, get yourself one of these brushes....you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this brush as much as I was hoping -but then I was hoping for a good brush for contouring.  This was a bit too flimsy for that -not terribly flimsy, but a little more than I expected (I have a small face and the contour powder spreads a little too much and gets slightly where it shouldn&#x27;t if the brush isn&#x27;t pretty firm).  I was thinking that it was going to be more dense based on the pictures and the reviews.  I will say, however that this might work well for the powdered highlighter above the cheekbones and as others have said -good for sweeping away fallout (definitely better than those really thin ones with not very many hairs).  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but will soon  It seems like it might also work well for a finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it seems to be a decent quality.  I washed it and only lost one hair. I do love the protective netting that came with it.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. It is super soft and I have not experienced any shedding. I use it to apply my blush and it goes on with just a couple swipes. I definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! Provides great coverage and the bristles are very soft to the touch! Easy to use and easy to clean! A must have for anyone that uses make-up!</li>
            <li> â€œThis is honestly one of the best brushes I have ever purchased!! It is great for contouring and it gives you a flawless, airbrushed look. I am going to have to buy the whole set now. If you are looking for great quality at a great price then this brand is the way to go!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing, high-quality brush, as is the case with all of the brushes I have tried from Be You, Beautifully. My biggest criteria when it comes to determining whether a brush is good or not is its softness to coverage ratio. I&#x27;ve found that most brushes do not balance these two things well - they are either very soft but don&#x27;t provide enough coverage, or provide good coverage but are very rough/hard on skin.    This brush in particular has the best balance of softness/coverage of any brushes that I have, including my Mac/Estee Lauder/Ulta brushes. The bristles are incredibly soft, yet dense enough to deposit the perfect amount of product on my face. The handle is very sturdy, and there is no brush fall-out or shedding whatsoever. Another thing that I am nit-picky about since I am honestly not very knowledgeable about makeup is having the type of brush imprinted on the handle. A lot of companies don&#x27;t do this, but Be You, Beautifully always imprints the name of the brush onto the end of its handle, which I truly appreciate.    I use this brush for highlighter or to dust a light layer of powder on my face, and it has done wonders for my makeup aesthetically. Although I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, my opinion is from my own personal experience with this brush and was not influenced in any way. That being said, this was one of my best beauty purchases all year.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush. The bristles are very soft, have a nice shape and are plentiful. I use to apply blush. I recommend this brush for anyone who wants a blush or powder brush.</li>
            <li> good quality. I like this brush!</li>
            <li> Way to big for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I like the size of the brush and that its not super thin.  The bristles are very soft and the brush is made well!</li>
            <li> omg Very Very soft and glad across your face so nice highly recommend. I love it uses it all the time</li>
            <li> Not only is this brush beautiful but very functional. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome fan brush. I have used their products before and have never been disappointed. Its a really soft brush and the bristles have not came out any at all. Works well and blends well. It&#x27;s now one of my favorite go to brushes. Very nice brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush, must have for every makeup user!</li>
            <li> Very high Quality fan brush.  Thick and soft brush, sturdy and does not fall apart.  A must-have fan brush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! This brand is amazing -- Very happy with this and will recommend it to others - Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> This fan brush was better than expected when I took it out of the box. The bristles are smooth and it provided for a nice application.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush!  Makes putting on blush super easy and it&#x27;s perfect every time!! It&#x27;s very soft and the bristles are good quality. Try it! You will not be disappointed (and this is coming from a super picky personðŸ˜‰).</li>
            <li> I am by no means a make-up pro and have just gotten into learning about how to apply and wear make-up this past year. Being I was a last bloomer I turned to YouTube to watch hundreds of videos by the pro&#x27;s and they all said the same thing--your make-up is only going to look as good as the tools you use to apply it. So every time I make a trip to Mac or Sephora to buy a new product I buy an expensive new brush to go with it. This brush could take the place of 4 or 5 of those brushes and is just as good, or better quality. I have not had one single hair fall out of it yet! I use it to apply finishing powder, highlighting powder, bronzer, blush, mineral foundation and touch up powder throughout the day. I&#x27;ve washed it 5 times and still no loose hairs and the net tube it comes with allows it to hold it&#x27;s shape after it dries. This also helps keep it clean when it&#x27;s in my make-up box. As for application, like I said, I&#x27;m new to this so I still follow all the directions in the videos, and when I do there is no unwanted fall out of power from the brush, yet it releases it easily with a few shakes and taps when your done with that particular product. This is especially helpful when using bronzer since before I had to have a brush specifically dedicated just for that as it would stick to the brush so much it made the brush useless for anything else. If this company made a similar brush in 2 progressively smaller sizes I don&#x27;t see why there would be the need for any other brushes except specialty eyeliner ad lip brushes. It&#x27;s that versatile. And I feel with the high quality, it;s going to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the look and feel of the brush. It works exactly as I expected and looks as if it costs way more than it actually does. Overall superb quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything you want a fan brush to be-- soft, great at holding powders, and it evenly distributes makeup. It looks and feels like a professional brush that you might see in online video tutorials or at the MAC counter. Very pleased :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, as most brushed are too rough or if they are soft, all the bristles fall out, I was unbelievably surprised at this brush! The bristles are very soft, I washed it first, not one single bristles came out, &amp; it provides perfect coverage. I use it predominantly for a light coat of powder to set my foundation and WOW the results are amazing! It actually improves the appearance of my makeup and skin (much more than regular brushes, and something I really needed!) Best thing I have purchased in a long time! I can&#x27;t say enough great things about the product and company!! Highly recommend for flawless looking skin!</li>
            <li> Love collecting make-up brushes, but think this is my favorite. Love the size and feel, works great for highlighting the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a back up to take on vacation. Did not want to chance lossing my professional fan brush. This works great, and I now find myself using it often. The seller even sent me a e-mail making sure I was happy with the purchase. Will defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this fan brush! It&#x27;s so soft! I&#x27;ve been using it to apply my face powder and it brushes on and blends flawlessly. I gave it a wash as soon as I got it and no bristles fell out at all. You can feel the quality and how well made this brush is. The price is great as well considering how expensive similar brushes run at department stores. This is my first brush from them but I have a few of their sponge beauty blenders and those are my absolute favorite! I received a discount in exchange for my honest review. I definitely need more brushes from Be You, Beautifully!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how good this is. I love fan brushes for highlighting and adding a little blush to the cheeks and usually I prefer the smaller ones but this one just makes my routine so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;It picks up a lot of product but applies it so evenly that you don&#x27;t have highlight overload so you look like a disco ball.&lt;br /&gt;The brush came beautifully packaged in a box with mesh around it to keep it protected.&lt;br /&gt;It washes very nicely and dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are synthetic and soft but really apply product evenly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;I found that I can even use this for adding bronzer to warm up my face when I don&#x27;t feel like contouring.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s honestly perfect for everything beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Soft, amazing, wonderful! I was afraid at first as this brush is a lot bigger than I expected but boy was I in for a surprise! It applies my bronzer to perfection and I can use it for my contouring as well!</li>
            <li> My first time trying a fan brush and I love it! Perfect for applying your bronzer and doing some contouring on your cheekbones. Has a sturdy handle and soft bristles too. And the customer service with this company is top notch!</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, I definitely recommend this brush. It is extremely FULL, lush, feels so decadent to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ferrel is innovative. It actually comes up and pinches the bristles. I washed this brush right away and NO shedding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush to put on highlighter or brush away fall out. You could also use it for powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is very sturdy and heavy. It feels like a very expensive brush.  It also washes and dries nicely. It comes with its own mesh brush shaper which is extremely handy for storage.  I excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brush. It is soft and gentle for my skin, and it makes me feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and soft, large face brush.  I am really looking forward to using it.  My other one was smashed, ugly, and barely useable.  Looks like a very good quality brush.</li>
            <li> how I love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;This brush is so dense and so soft! I glides in my skin so smoothly like no other.&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing this brush, I dont think I will be needing any other fan brush again.&lt;br /&gt;The size is so perfect, I mainly use it to clean up any eye shadow fall-outs and it sweeps them away so neatly.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use it for applying my blush and it pick ups just the right amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;It applies very smooth and even, it gives me the perfect natural, subtle blush application ever.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is relatively longer, which is really good for this kind of brush since it gives you enough control whenever you use it.&lt;br /&gt;I never experienced any fall outs or any bristles shedding, I have cleaned and wash this brush many times already.&lt;br /&gt;It also came with a bonus brush guard that helps maintain the quality and shape of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a very good investment especially for beauty and makeup enthusiast like me.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
            <li> This Pro Fan Makeup Brush is definitely a must have for those who love having high quality makeup brushes. This Pro Fan Makeup Brush does an amazing job at giving you the coverage you want. I love how sturdy the handle is and that it won&#x27;t slip and slide out of my hand. I also love that the bristles are not only very soft so they are good on sensitive skin but I also like that I have yet to see any bristles fall out. Be You, Beautifully definitely knows what they are doing when it comes to making great makeup brushes! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Awesome brush for applying translucent powder.</li>
            <li> A girl can never have too many makeup brushes and this one is definitely my new favorite for applying mineral powders. This is the first Be You, Beautifully brush I&#x27;ve purchased but it most certainly won&#x27;t be the last. This flat top makeup brush is perfect for either blending liquid makeup or for setting powder, so far I&#x27;ve used it with my mineral powders and have gotten a flawless look as a result. It comes in a resealable bag with a plastic zipper which is great for traveling or storage and also included is a brush guard to protect your brush when not in use. The brush itself is super soft with dense bristles which allows for a smooth, even application every time and cleaning is quick and easy also, just use a gentle liquid soap and run under warm water, it even dries quickly. I also really like the handle, it&#x27;s the perfect size for my hand and easy to maneuver. I will definitely be ordering more brushes from Be You, Beautifully to replace my old ones, they&#x27;re high quality, soft and covers a large area with each brush and I really appreciate the name/use of the brush being imprinted since I tend to get confused when all of my brushes are intermingled together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience.  All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.  One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product.</li>

            <li> Great brush at a very reasonable price. Great communication. Complete use and care instructions are much appreciated. Very happy with the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect fan brush for awhile.  Some are too big, some are too small. Some are too hard, some are too soft.  But this one is just right!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT BRUSH!!  From what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews it was the perfect softness/firmness.  Well, It was a lot softer than I had expected, but perfect for my sensitive skin.  I get irritated with overly stiff make up brushes.</li>
            <li> nice brush, very soft, the only thing is that it is too big.</li>
            <li> nice quality, haven&#x27;t used much but I like it!</li>
            <li> This brush is really nice. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Got powder on my shirt. Maybe it&#x27;s just for professionals, not people who want to look like one</li>
            <li> This brush feel fantastic. So soft and light.</li>
            <li> Love this brush..so soft and fluffy.It holds the product well and it feels great on my skin.Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup brush.  It is high quality and fun to use.  It makes you feel like a professional.  The handle is quite long and comfortable to hold.  There are tons of bristles, making the brush nice and thick.  It is soft, yet just stiff enough.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I really liked this brush, it did not shed and it picks up a lot of product! I can either use it to set my makeup or to apply highlighter. the quality is very good it is a very firm brush. my favorite fan brush at the time. :)</li>
            <li> Wow! Nice sturdy brush. Beautiful and functional. Exactly what I was looking for in a fan brush</li>
            <li> Love this fan brush!! More dense than your usual highlighter brush but applies the highlighter just beautifully.  It can also be used to contour &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Just OK. Not great for applying liquid foundation (the bristles are not great for precise application), but it&#x27;s acceptable for applying a finishing powder. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite brushes that I own. I have another fan brush, but it doesn&#x27;t compare at all to this one.&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ thick brush handle&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ really soft&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ can be used all over face&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ picks up makeup really well&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ hand-made and hand-cut&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ synthetic hair, harbors less bacteria&lt;br /&gt;â€¢vegan&lt;br /&gt;â€¢money back guarantee&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;I have become obsessed with using this brush to put on my highlighter. It is super soft and thick. Deposits my makeup nicely. This is ultimate quality over some store brands like elf, and Eco tools brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the brush.  Very, very nice.  Brush is soft.  This is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Softest fan brush I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Even though it&#x27;s soft, it places my bronzer exactly where I want it and leaves my cheekbones looking absolutely fabulous!! When I washed it, the brush dried nicely and evenly, and no bristles were lost. A+++ product. I will be ordering more of these!</li>
            <li> Really like this brush. I bought it primary to blend in my make up and so far I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Legit &amp; professional with HIGH-QUALITY bristles!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I&#x27;m looking forward to order more.</li>
            <li> This brush is much bigger than i expected, which is fine! I use it to apply my powder. Its really soft and well made. No bristles fall out when i use it and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell that some new brushes can have.</li>
            <li> Perfect bronzing brush for subtle all over color! Love this new addition to my brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderfully made! I love the texture and the quality of the brush it&#x27;s extremely soft and has a good handle. I am extremely satisfied with my purcharche.  If you&#x27;re  make up lover or even a make up artist I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a fan brush for a long time and could not find an affordable one to my liking.  This has a thicker fan, but it works well for what I wanted (contour).  Bristles are quality, and sturdy.  I am pleased with this!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush!  Works wonderfully for cheek bones and contouring!  No shed!!</li>
            <li> Nice strong handle and soft bristles. Color me impressed!</li>
            <li> My new obsession! I use it to highlight, as well as brush off fallout on my cheeks from eyeshadow. So soft and no shed. I put myself through nursing school with my cosmetology license, and I&#x27;ve been through thousands of brushes</li>
