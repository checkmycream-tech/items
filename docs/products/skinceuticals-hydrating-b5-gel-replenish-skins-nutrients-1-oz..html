            <li>love B5 gel, as always would recommend it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, but no wowing effect</li>
            <li>Is ok.</li>
            <li>love this product; does the job</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin hydrated and healthy, even in winter.  </li>
            <li>I see a more smooth and even consistency to my skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use (I use 3  of their products in the morning) and takes no time at all.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on easy</li>
            <li>no irritation, no smell, easy to apply -</li>
            <li>it goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is normally a great product although my purchase from this merchant does not have the same viscosity as when I have purchased at a salon so thus the 1 star review.</li>
            <li>Have received a genuine product from one seller on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>this is a great moisture enhancer and definitely helps to hydrate the skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>The price was great, my order was one day early, the product is perfect, and I will definitely buy from them again next time!</li>
            <li>Arrived in brand new box, with original seals at the top and bottom, and with the safety seal on top.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing yet light and non sticky - absorbs very quickly and gives my skin a boost of much needed moisture and B5 - skin looks dewy and fresh - love it!</li>
            <li>and it is obviously mostly water and not the real serum.</li>
            <li>It is not bad --</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the long term effects will be, but for now, it just feels good.</li>
            <li>My new favorite product in the skin ceuticals line.</li>
            <li>Ordered this with C E Ferulic, as recommended by a dermatologist, love it so far!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin care product by far!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 months and it really has helped hydrate and smooth out my combination skin.</li>
            <li>This is always an amazing product especially when using Tritanoin cream (retinA).  </li>
            <li>this product gives me a nice finish to my daily regimen.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Worth the $</li>
            <li>and I feel more natural.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>around eyes right after exiting shower.</li>
            <li>Better than the cheaper brands and worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>Great product that provides gentle hydration to dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this serum from my esthetician for years and this is my first time ordering it online</li>
            <li>greatest stuff for maintaining hydration although it is certainly expensive.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>I use it consistently.</li>
            <li>it still not a fake, but</li>
            <li>I tried it with CE Freulic (as recommended), on its own and with other moisturiser -- really does not do much difference.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little and it does a great job of hydrating.</li>
            <li>Whatever is contained in the bottle is not the real serum.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>This serum really hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>my friend recommended  don&#x27;t seem to much deference but for my friend work.</li>
            <li>Living in PR where there&#x27;s so much humidity, this moisturizer does not feel greasy or leave skin shiny.</li>
            <li>I really like this addition to my beauty regime...</li>
            <li>I do love this product, but this comment it is in regards of the price, why I can buy it here for $46, and if I go to skinceuticals.com or any other place like the dermatologist office will be for $150???.</li>
            <li>Purchased from Express Health specifically, after researching different seller reviews, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>consistency feels different from the original one I used to have.</li>
            <li>This product has nice coverage and is long lasting...</li>
            <li>I wish it had a little more &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; to it though.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does very fast (I would say a bottle a month)</li>
            <li>Just soft skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not many things that I can say I love enough to use for almost 10 years!</li>
            <li>Being in the skin/makeup industry I am always trying new products and I continue to come back to this.</li>
            <li>My 64 year old skin looks much younger.</li>
            <li>Makes my dry skin feel alive.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Makes my dry skin feel alive.</li>
            <li> It will last a really long time, and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel like you just gobbed on lotion</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It works so well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> but i definately see how this is helping me keep moisture in my dry desert climate.</li>
            <li> It relieves dry and itchy skin and gives it a radiant glow.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes  it feels a little dry after I have applied it</li>
            <li> In my experience, it was not worth its cost at all</li>
            <li> I am convinced that my skin has become less oily.</li>
            <li> Does the job promised with efficacy and little fuss.</li>
            <li> and it has dried..</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after vitamin C and before moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have seen a noticeble difference in my skin hydration in less than 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> The gel was packaged in an unmarked small brown cardboard box instead of the signature skinceuticals cardboard box.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 4 stars because it is expensive.</li>
            <li> its this a fake product or black market?</li>
            <li> An expensive, guilty pleasure.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive for the result.</li>
            <li> I want to prevent wrinkles (40s) but also have acne prone skin (so unfair)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> applies easily and feels wonderful !</li>
            <li> Same as what I buy at doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Started using it and saw some improvements.</li>
            <li> I ordered this b5 serum and it came enclosed in a plastic bag and there was no protective seal on the container.  Whatever is contained in the bottle is not the real serum.  I have used this serum from my esthetician for years and this is my first time ordering it online and they are NOT the same thing.  This serum on my face takes on a white tinge when I put it on and it is obviously mostly water and not the real serum. Nor does it provide and moisturizing benefits.  That is fraudulent and this stuff was not cheap!!This has been a total scam and needs to be reported as such.</li>
            <li> greatest stuff for maintaining hydration although it is certainly expensive. The quality out weighs the cost and so I continue to use this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> C an tell a difference when I do not use it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so  problematic that nothing seems to work but after one day of usage boy girls let me tell u all. Best  hydrating stuff :) makes life so much easier if u use makeup.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Goes on the skin very smoothly and leaves no sticky residue. In fact there is no residue. Just soft skin. 1 drop for the face and 1 for the neck. Spreads very nicely.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.  Realized it&#x27;s 30ml and not 50ml that i used to purchase.  Love this serum as it is light on the skin and yet hydrating!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I use with CE Ferulic and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist......around eyes right after exiting shower.</li>
            <li> I do love this product, but this comment it is in regards of the price, why I can buy it here for $46, and if I go to skinceuticals.com or any other place like the dermatologist office will be for $150???. its this a fake product or black market?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 months and it really has helped hydrate and smooth out my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome, is all I can say.  It works so well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was wonderful and made my face feel goof.</li>
            <li> this product gives me a nice finish to my daily regimen.  It leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth..  I wish it had a little more &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; to it though.  Sometimes  it feels a little dry after I have applied it and it has dried..&lt;br /&gt;I might shop around for a different product to try....</li>
            <li> An expensive, guilty pleasure.  This gel feels marvelous on my face. Makes my dry skin feel alive. I just love it.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals makes great products.  My skin has never been better since I started using their products 3 years ago.  Easy to use (I use 3  of their products in the morning) and takes no time at all.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Amazing serum. It leaves my face soft and supple. I use it two times a day. Worth it.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My 64 year old skin looks much younger. A couple of drops, morning and night, even under my eyes, moisturizes in a non-greasy way.</li>
            <li> I like to put it on my face. it goes on so smoothly. Does it do anything? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it does a great job of hydrating. It&#x27;s worth the cost. It will last a really long time, and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel like you just gobbed on lotion</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple of years!</li>
            <li> I loved the delivery time. And I love the product!  I will order it again just as I did. The service was as promised.</li>
            <li> Swear by Skin Ceuticals!  Took 10 years off my skin.  Worth the $</li>
            <li> I love the absorption of this product and the way it makes my skin look and feel. I use it morning and night under moisturizer. I see a more smooth and even consistency to my skin. I will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product. It didn&#x27;t work well for my skin. I didn&#x27;t fill that it was moist. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Who could ask for anything more.  Does the job promised with efficacy and little fuss. Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. Great product that provides gentle hydration to dry and sensitive skin. Skinceuticals b-5 mask is also very good.  The packaging of the gel from this company is not the skinceuticals packaging. The gel was packaged in an unmarked small brown cardboard box instead of the signature skinceuticals cardboard box.</li>
            <li> Great prod it and arrived timely.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully hydrating without gooping up your face. Makeup goes on easy and I feel more natural. Love it! Great for around your eyes too</li>
            <li> This is necessary gel. Just love it</li>
            <li> I tried it with CE Freulic (as recommended), on its own and with other moisturiser -- really does not do much difference.  It is not bad -- no irritation, no smell, easy to apply - but I do not see any difference.  In my experience, it was not worth its cost at all</li>
            <li> I love this product. I combine it with Skinceuticals CEFerulic Acid. Keeps my skin hydrated and looking great~Lots of nutrients.</li>
            <li> Great summer time moisturizer!!!!</li>
            <li> This is normally a great product although my purchase from this merchant does not have the same viscosity as when I have purchased at a salon so thus the 1 star review.</li>
            <li> Best when combined with C vit.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!  It does exactly what it says it will.  My skin feels healthier.  Only gave it 4 stars because it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin. I use this hydrating gel in the evening and I wake up with refreshed, glowing skin. I am convinced that my skin has become less oily. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> This gel is a great moisturizer with vitamin B.  I like skinceutical products.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Its just one of the many items i&#x27;ve added to my routine since turning 30 - but i definately see how this is helping me keep moisture in my dry desert climate.</li>
            <li> just as I ordered thank you</li>
            <li> Nice hydrating product to use after using the somewhat drying Phloretin CF product.  This product has nice coverage and is long lasting...</li>
            <li> My skin literally glows after applying this product.  I don&#x27;t know what the long term effects will be, but for now, it just feels good.</li>
            <li> I put a dab of my regular lotion in my hand and add a drop or so to mix. works great.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! Buy it</li>
            <li> Arrived in brand new box, with original seals at the top and bottom, and with the safety seal on top. Purchased from Express Health specifically, after researching different seller reviews, and was not disappointed. The price was great, my order was one day early, the product is perfect, and I will definitely buy from them again next time! Ordered this with C E Ferulic, as recommended by a dermatologist, love it so far!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, would order again.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals Hydrating B5 Gel should be a staple in everyone&#x27;s skin care routine. I have a background in dermatology and also in Aesthetics, so I see and try a lot of products. There&#x27;s not many things that I can say I love enough to use for almost 10 years! I did switch to something else for a brief time, but came back to the B5 Gel, and now I ALWAYS keep it with me! Skin feels perfect!</li>
            <li> The best over the counter product to revitalize hydration.</li>
            <li> Great product....worked miracles for me!</li>
            <li> Great product, love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin care product by far!  Very moisturizing yet light and non sticky - absorbs very quickly and gives my skin a boost of much needed moisture and B5 - skin looks dewy and fresh - love it!</li>
            <li> love B5 gel, as always would recommend it</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the result.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for years. My dermatologist discontinued this product and I didn&#x27;t know where to find it. Thank heavens for Amazon. This serum really hydrates your skin. I use it along with my moisturizer. Every product in this line is excellent. From skin repair to hydration I really recommend this product.  Nancy O.</li>
            <li> This is always an amazing product especially when using Tritanoin cream (retinA).  It relieves dry and itchy skin and gives it a radiant glow.  It definitely does very fast (I would say a bottle a month) but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I ever used&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, but no wowing effect</li>
            <li> Is ok. my friend recommended  don&#x27;t seem to much deference but for my friend work.</li>
            <li> I have seen a noticeble difference in my skin hydration in less than 2 weeks! My new favorite product in the skin ceuticals line.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I have sensitive skin and I break out from everything. This is the only thing that adds moisture without bumps.</li>
            <li> Living in PR where there&#x27;s so much humidity, this moisturizer does not feel greasy or leave skin shiny. I want to prevent wrinkles (40s) but also have acne prone skin (so unfair) and this moisturizer does the job.</li>
            <li> love this product; does the job</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin; no irritation whatsoever.  I use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it in combination with SkinCeuticals C E &amp; Ferulic. I swear by this combo. Being in the skin/makeup industry I am always trying new products and I continue to come back to this.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Have received a genuine product from one seller on Amazon.  Keeps my skin hydrated and healthy, even in winter.  People tell me I have beautiful skin, and I attribute it to excellent skincare.  This is a daily part of skin upkeep.  I put it on under a simple moisturizer every morning.</li>
            <li> A nice layer over my Vitamin C Serum and under my moisturizer.  I really like this addition to my beauty regime...</li>
            <li> I really liked it.It does nor grease your face.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Perfect and fast shipping - thank you</li>
            <li> It came with no box and instructions. I don&#x27;t no where this product coming from, it&#x27;s consistency feels different from the original one I used to have. Maybe they sell via Amazon some party didn&#x27;t pass quality certification and it still not a fake, but I don&#x27;t like to use this for my beauty..</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for oily skin. Better than the cheaper brands and worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> Coupled with the Skin Ceuticals Serum 20 aox this is a great moisture enhancer and definitely helps to hydrate the skin</li>
            <li> Great hydrator! I use this everyday after vitamin C and before moisturizer. Does wonders for my complexion!  Love it!</li>
            <li> After using the vitamin C for some months and the anti aging eye cream as well, I ordered this when I was replenishing my stock.  It has done just what it said it would do - add moisture.</li>
