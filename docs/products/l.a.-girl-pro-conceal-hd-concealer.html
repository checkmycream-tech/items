            <li>I  immediately  loved it.</li>
            <li>Great, creamy and very easy to blend out with finger or brush.</li>
            <li>and I feel like this color is perfect, not too light but brightens my under eye area nicely.  </li>
            <li>good thing I can say is that the coverage is nice.</li>

            <li>To light for me but a great product</li>
            <li>I think that it is good, just make sure</li>
            <li>one of the best concealers out there and very affordable.</li>
            <li>This concealer is so good and the price is even better.</li>
            <li>As for the seller, quick to ship, great packaging.</li>
            <li>The Natural seems to be perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>this is by far one of the best concealers I have ever used</li>
            <li>I love all of the shades I own.</li>
            <li>Not quite full, but good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look very smooth under eyes.</li>
            <li>I opened up to squeeze on my hand hoping the color would look better on skin</li>
            <li>concealer the most because of illness).  </li>
            <li>Definitely not the best concealer</li>
            <li>but for the price it&#x27;s listed as this thing is 10x better than what you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many concealers.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more like 25.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>( My fault, I should have done more research on the color).</li>
            <li>Does a much better job.</li>
            <li>and so so many colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li>I love la girl concealer</li>
            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>and I love the applicator on it as well.</li>
            <li>I honestly love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Ahhh this is an amazing product, cheap and it works,</li>
            <li>and I will for sure buy again.</li>
            <li>is I do have to put another concelar on top to brighten</li>
            <li>but I love how this peachyness gets rid of the darkness.</li>
            <li>I love it better than my mac make up its a</li>
            <li>I think the nyx HD is wayy better...</li>
            <li>Conceal more often than MAC&#x27;s Select Cover Up.</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the product</li>
            <li>and they come in so many shades,</li>
            <li>L.A Girl  is my favorite  now.</li>
            <li>Great conceler shipped veryyyyyy fast just to warn you if you are a makeup artist or something like that</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even need to use a setting powder (although I do because I&#x27;m particular like that lol).  </li>
            <li>I  was surprised  and happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Fresh &amp; Nice Product&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>very full coverage, easy to blend.</li>
            <li>This product does not come out easily from the applicator.</li>
            <li>Cheap concealer that&#x27;s just as good as high end concealers!</li>
            <li>Still, worth it for the awesome performance and cheap price, will definitely always have some in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li>wow for being affordable, this is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely AMAZING concealer, and exact dupe for MAC&#x27;s Select Cover-Up.</li>
            <li>Besides all those negatives, the concealer does not settle into fine lines and wrinkles and blends easily with a Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>This concealer by far covers better than the BM Stroke of Light, which at one time I really liked.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>i love this product for an under eye brightener, not so much for a highlight on my cheekbones, probably because i already have a favorite for that</li>
            <li>I  was excited  to try it.</li>
            <li>make sure the first couple times using you squirt it on a pallate or something like that</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush on the tip of the concealer makes this very easy to apply, and very contour-friendly, specially for the newbies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Easy to blend so useful like concealer, contour &amp; highlight.</li>
            <li>This is great concealer that doesn&#x27;t accentuate wrinkles or make my eyes look dry.  </li>
            <li>I found natural to be a great match for my light-medium skin-just a little lighter, great for gently brightening under my eyes while still doing a fabulous job covering up blemishes without looking strange/fake.</li>
            <li>I shook it up and it sounded full of water.</li>
            <li>I have really dark circles and it brightened and covered them beautifully.  </li>
            <li>my tried and true mac prolong wear.</li>
            <li>Not bad but not grate.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It conceals great the dark circles.</li>
            <li>For such a good price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>girls take a risk I did and it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>Other than that it would be a good concealer.</li>
            <li>Came earlier then expected:) overall a great product!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it definitely works very well and is amazing</li>
            <li>great product for such a low price!</li>
            <li>Got to me super fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair with freckles, although I tan a little in the summer, and I was worried about the shade.  </li>
            <li>The shade I got is a bit too orange-y (I got the shade &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;) on my skin</li>
            <li>The product appeared orange in the tube which was my first turn off.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make this concealer better is if it didn&#x27;t have a brush dispenser.  </li>
            <li>So definitely still on the cheaper side but a lot better than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li>First time I buy L.A. Girl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested in trying their corrective colors also.</li>
            <li>Really thick and covers great.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to purchase more shades</li>
            <li>I love this concealer I ordered it and a couple days later I received it</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I bought this based on a recommendation, and while it is a great concealer, I find the packaging sucks.</li>
            <li>So, at least I&#x27;m somewhat happy.</li>
            <li>I also have a higher end concealer that I find works just as well</li>
            <li>I was aware  of this brand through  a YouTube  video.</li>
            <li>, I just dab a little and it dries nice and quickly.</li>
            <li>ive had much better concealers than this, the hard candy concealer is 10x better.</li>
            <li>however, I had been using Bare Minerals Stroke of Light.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend only thing</li>
            <li>Shades:(2&#x3D;Natural &amp; Pure Beige).</li>
            <li>But seriously, I can deal with the brush because this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>You have to squeeze it through a little brush, which I don&#x27;t use because I prefer my fingers or a nice concealer brush.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount, so it lasts very well!!!!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It stays on my face through out the whole day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got a faulty tub or what, but it has a very grainy texture.</li>
            <li>The shipping was so fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it blends very well</li>
            <li>I like the tip of the brush because it makes it that much easier  to apply and it brightest  my eyes very well.</li>
            <li>I still use it with my other concealer to give me a more radiant look since it is a bit lighter than what I wanted</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t crease like other brands that cost much more.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t crease and a good subtle color for under eye highlight.</li>
            <li>It is highly pigmented and thus covers very well with a minimum of product.  </li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite concealer.</li>
            <li>In the photo, I used classic ivory for under the eyes and in the T-zone.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural and brightens under the eye very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easily bendable and I use this as a high when I&#x27;m in drag</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this</li>
            <li>High Definition Under Eye Setting Powder (another highly reviewed product for only $3 and well worth it).  </li>
            <li>After I went to a lot of trouble to get this, I must say it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>So I put the cap back on, squished the tube several times and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.  </li>
            <li>Tubes arrived clean &amp; closed.</li>
            <li>It blends well and does not crease once you set it with loose powder or any setting powder , BUT I ordered the wrong shade its to light for me ( medium fair skin with semi olive-yellow undertone )</li>
            <li>When I first opened the tube, a clear liquid oozed out like the product has separated and wasn&#x27;t mixed together well</li>
            <li>nice coverage a little goes a long way its not to thick nor watery :)</li>
            <li>Found this stuff on Makeupalley (a really dangerous website for those with a slight beauty obsession) and figured I had to try it with the great reviews and cheap price.</li>
            <li>Fantastic drugstore concealer that beats out some high end ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>i have pretty bad dark circles and this is by far the best cheaper concealer out there!</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I just swipe it on directly from the tube...</li>
            <li>It has a natural, skin like finish</li>
            <li>Conceal (Natural)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t  wait to try it especially  because its very  affordable.</li>
            <li>and I usually wear light in Maybelline&#x27;s Age Rewind Concealer.</li>
            <li>Some reviews said that too much comes and you run thru the little tube really fast</li>
            <li>I have issues with dark circles and hearing all the hype and reading all reviews, I figured it was worth a try especially at this price.  </li>
            <li>Not amazing but not bad.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I picked this up in a rite aide store and spent less...</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and becomes hard to blend unless you&#x27;re using a damp beauty blender.</li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t even need to use a setting powder (although I do because I&#x27;m particular like that lol).  </li>
            <li> I  was surprised  and happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Fresh &amp; Nice Product&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> very full coverage, easy to blend.</li>
            <li> This product does not come out easily from the applicator.</li>
            <li> Cheap concealer that&#x27;s just as good as high end concealers!</li>
            <li> Still, worth it for the awesome performance and cheap price, will definitely always have some in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> wow for being affordable, this is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely AMAZING concealer, and exact dupe for MAC&#x27;s Select Cover-Up.</li>
            <li> Besides all those negatives, the concealer does not settle into fine lines and wrinkles and blends easily with a Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> This concealer by far covers better than the BM Stroke of Light, which at one time I really liked.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> i love this product for an under eye brightener, not so much for a highlight on my cheekbones, probably because i already have a favorite for that</li>
            <li> I  was excited  to try it.</li>
            <li> make sure the first couple times using you squirt it on a pallate or something like that</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush on the tip of the concealer makes this very easy to apply, and very contour-friendly, specially for the newbies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Easy to blend so useful like concealer, contour &amp; highlight.</li>
            <li> This is great concealer that doesn&#x27;t accentuate wrinkles or make my eyes look dry.  </li>
            <li> I found natural to be a great match for my light-medium skin-just a little lighter, great for gently brightening under my eyes while still doing a fabulous job covering up blemishes without looking strange/fake.</li>
            <li> I shook it up and it sounded full of water.</li>
            <li> I have really dark circles and it brightened and covered them beautifully.  </li>
            <li> my tried and true mac prolong wear.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not grate.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It conceals great the dark circles.</li>
            <li> For such a good price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> girls take a risk I did and it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> Other than that it would be a good concealer.</li>
            <li> Came earlier then expected:) overall a great product!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it definitely works very well and is amazing</li>
            <li> great product for such a low price!</li>
            <li> Got to me super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair with freckles, although I tan a little in the summer, and I was worried about the shade.  </li>
            <li> The shade I got is a bit too orange-y (I got the shade &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;) on my skin</li>
            <li> The product appeared orange in the tube which was my first turn off.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could make this concealer better is if it didn&#x27;t have a brush dispenser.  </li>
            <li> So definitely still on the cheaper side but a lot better than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> First time I buy L.A. Girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be interested in trying their corrective colors also.</li>
            <li> Really thick and covers great.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to purchase more shades</li>
            <li> I love this concealer I ordered it and a couple days later I received it</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a recommendation, and while it is a great concealer, I find the packaging sucks.</li>
            <li> So, at least I&#x27;m somewhat happy.</li>
            <li> I also have a higher end concealer that I find works just as well</li>
            <li> I was aware  of this brand through  a YouTube  video.</li>
            <li> , I just dab a little and it dries nice and quickly.</li>
            <li> ive had much better concealers than this, the hard candy concealer is 10x better.</li>
            <li> however, I had been using Bare Minerals Stroke of Light.  </li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend only thing</li>
            <li> Shades:(2&#x3D;Natural &amp; Pure Beige).</li>
            <li> But seriously, I can deal with the brush because this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> You have to squeeze it through a little brush, which I don&#x27;t use because I prefer my fingers or a nice concealer brush.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount, so it lasts very well!!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It stays on my face through out the whole day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a faulty tub or what, but it has a very grainy texture.</li>
            <li> The shipping was so fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but it blends very well</li>
            <li> I like the tip of the brush because it makes it that much easier  to apply and it brightest  my eyes very well.</li>
            <li> I still use it with my other concealer to give me a more radiant look since it is a bit lighter than what I wanted</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t crease like other brands that cost much more.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t crease and a good subtle color for under eye highlight.</li>
            <li> It is highly pigmented and thus covers very well with a minimum of product.  </li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite concealer.</li>
            <li> In the photo, I used classic ivory for under the eyes and in the T-zone.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural and brightens under the eye very well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easily bendable and I use this as a high when I&#x27;m in drag</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this</li>
            <li> High Definition Under Eye Setting Powder (another highly reviewed product for only $3 and well worth it).  </li>
            <li> After I went to a lot of trouble to get this, I must say it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> So I put the cap back on, squished the tube several times and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.  </li>
            <li> Tubes arrived clean &amp; closed.</li>
            <li> It blends well and does not crease once you set it with loose powder or any setting powder , BUT I ordered the wrong shade its to light for me ( medium fair skin with semi olive-yellow undertone )</li>
            <li> When I first opened the tube, a clear liquid oozed out like the product has separated and wasn&#x27;t mixed together well</li>
            <li> nice coverage a little goes a long way its not to thick nor watery :)</li>
            <li> Found this stuff on Makeupalley (a really dangerous website for those with a slight beauty obsession) and figured I had to try it with the great reviews and cheap price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic drugstore concealer that beats out some high end ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> i have pretty bad dark circles and this is by far the best cheaper concealer out there!</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I just swipe it on directly from the tube...</li>
            <li> It has a natural, skin like finish</li>
            <li> Conceal (Natural)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t  wait to try it especially  because its very  affordable.</li>
            <li> and I usually wear light in Maybelline&#x27;s Age Rewind Concealer.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said that too much comes and you run thru the little tube really fast</li>
            <li> I have issues with dark circles and hearing all the hype and reading all reviews, I figured it was worth a try especially at this price.  </li>
            <li> Not amazing but not bad.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I picked this up in a rite aide store and spent less...</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and becomes hard to blend unless you&#x27;re using a damp beauty blender.</li>
            <li> The color natural is VERY pink toned almost orange .</li>
            <li> this is just a rip off for how much your paying for such a small tube.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for everyday use for high school or college.</li>
            <li> and it squirted out a clear liquid all down my hand.</li>
            <li> I only have one negative thing to say about this product and it&#x27;s the fact that it didn&#x27;t conceal my eyes as much as i would have wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I am not wild about the applicator</li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t like it as concealer to hide my dark circle,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s crease and not long</li>
            <li> Not good for much else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe that texture is less likely to crease on the eyelids (where i need</li>
            <li> It was only slightly lighter, so I used to anyways.</li>
            <li> and I keep coming back to this little tube.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, color matches, but be careful squeezing concealer from tube.</li>
            <li> Not great for my particular skin but for the price it gets the job done</li>
            <li> It covers extremely well yet</li>
            <li> Love this concealer, but it creases after a while :(</li>
            <li> But other websites it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
            <li> Wayyyyyyy to pink!</li>
            <li> My only negative comment about it is that it is a little dry instead of silky feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have dark, purplish circles</li>
            <li> I use this to hide dark marks along my jaw.</li>
            <li> I use it as an under eye corrector for my dark circles</li>
            <li> , PLEASE note that their line seems to run dark.</li>
            <li> A hidden gem that I hope LA Girl continues to make.  </li>
            <li> It ended up being a little darker than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It also sets like a dream, I just leave it on for a few seconds and then pat it into my skin</li>
            <li> so a few undereye creases and covers my circle and after the intial application, doesn&#x27;t settle into my creases during the day.</li>
            <li> It took a few times to get the tube &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34; and product dispersed thru the brush tip</li>
            <li> This creases,  looks cakey and feels heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> none the less!</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t crease to bad on me and really wakes my eyes up!</li>
            <li> As many youtubers as I have watched rave about this product, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is about.</li>
            <li> A small dusting of powder sets it</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> whereas I&#x27;m usually the 7/8th shade in a range of colors, please keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to spread but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> I have to squeeze really hard to get any product out.</li>
            <li> common sense will tell you not to squeeze the tube hard and</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick, caked-on-make-up look on the delicate skin under your eye.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and is somewhat of a whipped texture.</li>
            <li> Can someone help im confused</li>
            <li> The secret is to get your correct color match.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it wastes a lot of product on its way out of the stupid brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the expensive versions, (YSL,Lancome, Clinique etc.)</li>
            <li> How can you Give a bad review on a product in which YOU ordered the wrong shade?</li>
            <li> Too bad:(</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I HATE the packaging.</li>
            <li> I hate the squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> It creases very badly under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Sooo I prefer my maybelline one to this one, but this one isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome! Dupe for MAC prolong wear concealer</li>
            <li> Great concealer. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I think that it is good, just make sure you know what color to order. The shade I got is a bit too orange-y (I got the shade &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;) on my skin and I usually wear light in Maybelline&#x27;s Age Rewind Concealer. Sooo I prefer my maybelline one to this one, but this one isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this!!! The product appeared orange in the tube which was my first turn off. I opened up to squeeze on my hand hoping the color would look better on skin and it squirted out a clear liquid all down my hand. GROSS! I shook it up and it sounded full of water. I squeezed it again and it still squirted out water and clumpy product. I just threw it in the trash. Such a waste. I won&#x27;t be buying makeup on Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> Use for a highlight under my eyes. Doesn&#x27;t crease and a good subtle color for under eye highlight. Doesn&#x27;t crease or cake</li>
            <li> The only thing that could make this concealer better is if it didn&#x27;t have a brush dispenser.  I prefer the ones that just squeeze out of a tube.  But seriously, I can deal with the brush because this stuff is amazing!  I have really dark circles and it brightened and covered them beautifully.  It also sets like a dream, I just leave it on for a few seconds and then pat it into my skin and I don&#x27;t even need to use a setting powder (although I do because I&#x27;m particular like that lol).  With a price like this, this item will definitely be a staple in my beauty regimen from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I am on the lighter side of medium skin tone and I feel like this color is perfect, not too light but brightens my under eye area nicely.  I think it will work well when I have a tan also because I do like that area of my face to be lighter.</li>
            <li> Found this stuff on Makeupalley (a really dangerous website for those with a slight beauty obsession) and figured I had to try it with the great reviews and cheap price. The product itself I LOVE! I found natural to be a great match for my light-medium skin-just a little lighter, great for gently brightening under my eyes while still doing a fabulous job covering up blemishes without looking strange/fake. I like the liquid texture of it, I just dab a little and it dries nice and quickly. However, I HATE the packaging. You have to squeeze it through a little brush, which I don&#x27;t use because I prefer my fingers or a nice concealer brush. I feel like it wastes a lot of product on its way out of the stupid brush. Still, worth it for the awesome performance and cheap price, will definitely always have some in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> This product does not come out easily from the applicator. It ends up coming out in a blob and not at the ends of the bristles. It dries quickly and becomes hard to blend unless you&#x27;re using a damp beauty blender. I found that even after applying setting powder, it creased under my eyes within 15 minutes. The color is good, but not that great of a concealer.</li>
            <li> It covers well.  My only negative comment about it is that it is a little dry instead of silky feeling.  Maybe that texture is less likely to crease on the eyelids (where i need concealer the most because of illness).  Otherwise, color matches, but be careful squeezing concealer from tube. It can come out faster than you think.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite concealer. Never creases or fades and there is a great color selcection! Just be sure to look at what color you get, I was sent the wrong one. It was only slightly lighter, so I used to anyways. Great product!</li>
            <li> Wow. For such a good price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I saw a beauty guru on YouTube praise this product so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Definitely not the best concealer but for the price it&#x27;s listed as this thing is 10x better than what you&#x27;d think. If I had to &amp;#34;blind price&amp;#34; this concealer, I would&#x27;ve said its probably $10. So definitely still on the cheaper side but a lot better than you&#x27;d think. I would recommend this for everyday use for high school or college.</li>
            <li> First time I buy L.A. Girl. Fresh &amp; Nice Product&#x27;s. Well packed for shipping. Shades:(2&#x3D;Natural &amp; Pure Beige). Easy to blend so useful like concealer, contour &amp; highlight. Tubes arrived clean &amp; closed. Super fast shipping. An excellent seller &amp; experience.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! Best I&#x27;ve found in years</li>
            <li> wow for being affordable, this is amazing! very full coverage, easy to blend. will purchase over and over again! i have pretty bad dark circles and this is by far the best cheaper concealer out there!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many concealers.  It feels like a zillion but it&#x27;s more like 25.  This stuff, let me tell you, of all the expensive/prestige and drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried, this is THE ONE.  I have dark, purplish circles and I&#x27;m 44 so a few undereye creases and covers my circle and after the intial application, doesn&#x27;t settle into my creases during the day.</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail! one of the best concealers out there and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this but it definitely works very well and is amazing</li>
            <li> This concealer is so good and the price is even better. It&#x27;s blendable and doesn&#x27;t crease under the eyes. Also works great for me as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> I am not wild about the applicator but I just put it on my finger then on my face. I would prefer if it didn&#x27;t have the brush. I&#x27;m not sure that I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay... Not bad but not grate.</li>
            <li> Not great for my particular skin but for the price it gets the job done</li>
            <li> To light for me but a great product none the less!</li>
            <li> I have issues with dark circles and hearing all the hype and reading all reviews, I figured it was worth a try especially at this price.  I&#x27;ve never used the MAC concealer that is suppose to be just like however, I had been using Bare Minerals Stroke of Light.  When I first opened the tube, a clear liquid oozed out like the product has separated and wasn&#x27;t mixed together well -- I was worried.  So I put the cap back on, squished the tube several times and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.  Some reviews said that too much comes and you run thru the little tube really fast but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case with mine.  The applicator tip is a brush and the product comes up out of the tube in the middle of the brush bristles.  It took a few times to get the tube &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34; and product dispersed thru the brush tip but it&#x27;s been perfect ever since.  I just swipe it on directly from the tube...common sense will tell you not to squeeze the tube hard and sometimes there&#x27;s enough product lingering on the brush that you don&#x27;t need to squeeze it at all.  After I apply it to where I want it, I blend it in with my concealer brush then set it with E.l.f. High Definition Under Eye Setting Powder (another highly reviewed product for only $3 and well worth it).  This concealer by far covers better than the BM Stroke of Light, which at one time I really liked.  It covers extremely well yet it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick, caked-on-make-up look on the delicate skin under your eye.  I&#x27;m fair with freckles, although I tan a little in the summer, and I was worried about the shade.  The Natural seems to be perfect for me.  I&#x27;d be interested in trying their corrective colors also.</li>
            <li> Came earlier then expected:) overall a great product!</li>
            <li> Really good concealer!!! Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I only have one negative thing to say about this product and it&#x27;s the fact that it didn&#x27;t conceal my eyes as much as i would have wanted it to. I still use it with my other concealer to give me a more radiant look since it is a bit lighter than what I wanted ( My fault, I should have done more research on the color). I will still buy this concealer but in a darker color because of the price and the quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Really thick and covers great. You only need a tiny amount, so it lasts very well!!!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap concealer that&#x27;s just as good as high end concealers! It doesn&#x27;t cake on me and it lasts all day. I use this to hide dark marks along my jaw.</li>
            <li> Read rave reviews about this concealer and I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is about. It creases very badly under my eyes. I started using it to define my eyebrows after I fill them in. Not good for much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stick to my MAC liquid concealer. Does a much better job.</li>
            <li> This is the best under eye concealer on the market at any price.  It is highly pigmented and thus covers very well with a minimum of product.  A small dusting of powder sets it so it does not crease (in any noticeable way).  It has a natural, skin like finish and so so many colors to choose from.  Plus it&#x27;s cheap.  Yet, if I win the lottery, I will continue to use this concealer.</li>
            <li> I love la girl concealer but you find it way cheaper on the morphe brush website for 2.99 this is just a rip off for how much your paying for such a small tube.</li>
            <li> Hard to spread but great product</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. I have been picking it up over my Inglot and Mac concealer. Totally bang for your buck and I love the applicator on it as well. Get it! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It blends well and does not crease once you set it with loose powder or any setting powder , BUT I ordered the wrong shade its to light for me ( medium fair skin with semi olive-yellow undertone )&lt;br /&gt;another cone : Didn&#x27;t like the applicator</li>
            <li> Love this concealer, but it creases after a while :(</li>
            <li> i love this product for an under eye brightener, not so much for a highlight on my cheekbones, probably because i already have a favorite for that but this doesn&#x27;t crease to bad on me and really wakes my eyes up! great product for such a low price!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and is somewhat of a whipped texture. I honestly love it it&#x27;s easily bendable and I use this as a high when I&#x27;m in drag and I love it. It stays on my face through out the whole day.</li>
            <li> How can you Give a bad review on a product in which YOU ordered the wrong shade? Unbelievable. Will be ordering soon.</li>
            <li> I got mine in the lightest shade, and its almost a salmon color in the package but when I blend it out under my eyes, it just disappears and makes my skin look flawless! Definitely going to purchase more shades so I can do different looks with them! **blend with fingers not a brush or sponge**</li>
            <li> I wish the packaging was different. I do not like the squeeze tube. I wish it was in wand form but the concealer it self is great. It brightens my under eye area and doesn&#x27;t crease on me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a faulty tub or what, but it has a very grainy texture. As many youtubers as I have watched rave about this product, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great quality concealer! Will purchase over and over!</li>
            <li> So amazing!!! The consistency is perfect. I set it with Ben Nye Banana powder and it lasts all day! No creasing!</li>
            <li> Ahhh this is an amazing product, cheap and it works, im almost done with it and I will for sure buy again. girls take a risk I did and it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it amazing! I use it as an under eye corrector for my dark circles it has a peachy tint to it I love it and highly recommend only thing is I do have to put another concelar on top to brighten but I love how this peachyness gets rid of the darkness. One of my top concelars love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this product ! Looks very natural and brightens under the eye very well.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer I ordered it and a couple days later I received it this is by far one of the best concealers I have ever used I love it better than my mac make up its a must have</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Loved it! The shipping was so fast. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Didnt cover anything!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great price and quality product!  Highly recommend! ☆☆☆☆☆</li>
            <li> Not the best out there. Doesn&#x27;t look very smooth under eyes. The color natural is VERY pink toned almost orange . I think the nyx HD is wayy better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only good thing I can say is that the coverage is nice. Not quite full, but good.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing and Exceeded my expectations!! This is an absolutely AMAZING concealer, and exact dupe for MAC&#x27;s Select Cover-Up. I have both and I have to say, I find myself reaching for PRO. Conceal more often than MAC&#x27;s Select Cover Up. Yes, it is that good of a concealer. To add to the similarities, these are both Canadian brands, so that could be why they&#x27;re similar? I&#x27;m not sure bu I&#x27;m loving this concealer!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush on the tip of the concealer makes this very easy to apply, and very contour-friendly, specially for the newbies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, PLEASE note that their line seems to run dark. I am the 3rd shade in PRO. Conceal (Natural) whereas I&#x27;m usually the 7/8th shade in a range of colors, please keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural in PRO Conceal &#x3D; NW20 in MAC&#x27;s Select Cover Up - Hope that helps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add a picture for those looking for a comparison!!</li>
            <li> Can someone help im confused so do you get both tubes or just the one??</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get two concealers based on the picture and price, but only got one. I bought this based on a recommendation, and while it is a great concealer, I find the packaging sucks. It&#x27;s hard to squeeze out. Besides all those negatives, the concealer does not settle into fine lines and wrinkles and blends easily with a Beauty Blender. So, at least I&#x27;m somewhat happy. As for the seller, quick to ship, great packaging.</li>
            <li> nice coverage a little goes a long way its not to thick nor watery :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! But other websites it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
            <li> This is NOT a dupe for mac. This creases,  looks cakey and feels heavy on the skin. I hate the squeeze tube. I have to squeeze really hard to get any product out. I give them props for the range of colors but im sticking with my tried and true mac prolong wear. Luckily I picked this up in a rite aide store and spent less...$1.89</li>
            <li> It is great I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Blends evenly and lasts almost the entire day!</li>
            <li> It ended up being a little darker than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Great, creamy and very easy to blend out with finger or brush. Cant beat the price at all.  Fantastic drugstore concealer that beats out some high end ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  The color I got was a tiny bit pinker than I was expecting. I will definitely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;Great concealer for brightening under the eyes. (I use lighter concealer for highlighting areas of my face.)</li>
            <li> Great concealer for the price! Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer!!</li>
            <li> After I went to a lot of trouble to get this, I must say it&#x27;s just ok. Not amazing but not bad.  It&#x27;s worth a try but I still prefer all my Maybelline ones over this one.</li>
            <li> This concealer is great!  It doesn&#x27;t crease like other brands that cost much more.  I&#x27;ve tried the expensive versions, (YSL,Lancome, Clinique etc.) and I keep coming back to this little tube.  The coverage lasts all day without having to reapply.  The secret is to get your correct color match.  Buy several since they are so affordable and mix them if need be.  You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> It conceals great the dark circles. I love the consistency of the product and I like the packaging. It&#x27;s whiter than the color on the image but it blends very well</li>
            <li> ive had much better concealers than this, the hard candy concealer is 10x better.</li>
            <li> great concealer for the price and they come in so many shades, thats great</li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t like it as concealer to hide my dark circle,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s crease and not long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s only for highlight under eyes.</li>
            <li> It is perfect.iam happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is great concealer that doesn&#x27;t accentuate wrinkles or make my eyes look dry.  A hidden gem that I hope LA Girl continues to make.  I also have a higher end concealer that I find works just as well that cost me about 500x the price.</li>
            <li> I love all of the shades I own. I use a variety of shades for highlighting and contouring on my clients and I never have problems with blending the product! The coverage is beautiful and I love using them on myself as well! The applicator has never been a problem for me. All I do is put the product on the back of my hand and use it from there. I will definitely always use LA Girl Pro HD Concealer! In the photo, I used classic ivory for under the eyes and in the T-zone. And toast to contour my forehead and cheekbones. It blends flawlessly!</li>
            <li> If only they would work on the color!! Wayyyyyyy to pink! Other than that it would be a good concealer. Too bad:(</li>
            <li> I recently  bought L.A Girl pro concealer in shade neutral. I was aware  of this brand through  a YouTube  video. I couldn&#x27;t  wait to try it especially  because its very  affordable. As soon as it arrived I  was excited  to try it. The package was good and secured. It arrived when promised and the the size is just  like the  image shown. When I  applied the concealer  I  immediately  loved it. I like the tip of the brush because it makes it that much easier  to apply and it brightest  my eyes very well. I  was surprised  and happy with this product. I need to try the color brozer now. L.A Girl  is my favorite  now. I recommend  it to anyone  looking for  a concealer.</li>
            <li> Great conceler shipped veryyyyyy fast just to warn you if you are a makeup artist or something like that make sure the first couple times using you squirt it on a pallate or something like that be cause water will come out of&lt;br /&gt;It&lt;br /&gt;Since is is a water based concealer</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...at all..not anything against the seller just the product itself..</li>
            <li> Got to me super fast. And the concealer it&#x27;s self is alright..</li>
