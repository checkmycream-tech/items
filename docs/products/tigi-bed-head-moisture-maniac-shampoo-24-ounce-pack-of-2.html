    <ol>
            <li>The smell of this product is amazing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>So this ended up being the perfect combination for me:</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 stars because it smells great!!!</li>
            <li>got a very good amount of saving.</li>
            <li>No complaints, this shampoo smells great and works great.</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>The conditioner is good since you don&#x27;t get close to the scalp, but the shampoo I will have to throw it away.</li>
            <li>Nothing smoothes and detangles hair like Moisture Maniac, and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>If you want a good moisturizing shampoo check into Nexxus Therappe it works like a dream.</li>
            <li>This stuff here just smells good and has a sense of humor, but that doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair now does it?</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>always have liked bed head.</li>
            <li>Has a kind of grapefruit-ish scent that is nice and lite - not overpowering so</li>
            <li>: I love the pineapple scent of this one the best in the shower, as the self absorbed one has more of an orange scent</li>
            <li>Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize the hair worth a hoot.</li>
            <li>I will say that I go to the Suave professionals humecticant shampoo for the most part though, as I found Bed Head shampoo and conditioner tend to build up on my hair a lot after awhile of using just them</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to find it here.</li>
            <li>This product definitely keeps my hair in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo ever, leaves my hair full and silky soft</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky with a nice shine and it smells just like gummi bears!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Bed Head.</li>
            <li>I got this with the self absorbed conditioner by accident which turned out to be rather interesting</li>
            <li>I tried it on my young son during his bath, as his hair is perfect full and always looks the same.  </li>
            <li>That aside though I love this product and use it several times a week : )</li>
            <li>It may be good for the damaged and dry ends</li>
            <li>I wash my hair with this shampoo and enjoy the smell and then put the orange smelling self absorbed conditioner on and enjoy that smell for the rest of the time when it is dry : )</li>
            <li>something I rarely think of, so</li>
            <li>Have used Bed Head for a long time but they stopped making the kind I had before.  </li>
            <li>and I do not like orange smelling or tasting things very much.</li>
            <li>I actually like the smell more than the moisture maniac smell..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got pretty crappy hair anyways</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it looked a bit more dull and a bit more frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice clean scent and doesn&#x27;t take much to create a thick lather.</li>
            <li>It leaves the scalp very greasy.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I been using it as a bubble bath because it smells incredible but the performance of the product fails.</li>
            <li>can easily blend with other scents you may be wearing.</li>
            <li>I am a guy with dry hair, and this helps keep it moisturized more than a basic shampoo.</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for years, it is a good shampoo with a a soft scent, i got tired of paying a lot of money at the local drugstore</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo that I have ever tossed out, even if it takes years for me to finally empty one out.  </li>
            <li>Living in the high desert in Santa Fe NM where its dry weather and air play havoc on skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I am not able to get it at Super Target now</li>
            <li>Finally, it caused my scalp to really itch, though I am not certain this is the reason since it&#x27;s been a heat wave around here.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was just me, perhaps, but my wife also had kind of a half frizzy, half plain look after using it.  </li>

            <li> So upset that I purchased this shampoo, as I am throwing it away after only a few uses.  </li>

            <li> and they weigh my hair down and make the texture feel waxy.</li>
            <li> Provides moisture but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is in here, but after using it my hair was a messy uncontrollable matte.  </li>
            <li> but I thought I would warn others before it&#x27;s too late.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Moisture Maniac shampoo for at least 5 years and my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> Man, too bad.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Esse tigi deve ter uns 2  litros, se você esta Procurando o igual a do Salao e esse q vc deve comprar!!</li>
            <li> always have liked bed head.</li>
            <li> It leaves the scalp very greasy. It may be good for the damaged and dry ends but if you have an oily scalp don&#x27;t use it. The conditioner is good since you don&#x27;t get close to the scalp, but the shampoo I will have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is amazing!!!!!!! I could practically eat it! I got this with the self absorbed conditioner by accident which turned out to be rather interesting: I love the pineapple scent of this one the best in the shower, as the self absorbed one has more of an orange scent and I do not like orange smelling or tasting things very much. BUT as the day progresses I have found that the orange smelling conditioner seems to last longer and once it tones down and blends with my hair I actually like the smell more than the moisture maniac smell.. So this ended up being the perfect combination for me: I wash my hair with this shampoo and enjoy the smell and then put the orange smelling self absorbed conditioner on and enjoy that smell for the rest of the time when it is dry : ) I will say that I go to the Suave professionals humecticant shampoo for the most part though, as I found Bed Head shampoo and conditioner tend to build up on my hair a lot after awhile of using just them and they weigh my hair down and make the texture feel waxy. That aside though I love this product and use it several times a week : )</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever, leaves my hair full and silky soft</li>
            <li> Have used Bed Head for a long time but they stopped making the kind I had before.  This stuff makes my hair look/feel greasy out of the shower. I&#x27;ve got pretty crappy hair anyways so will probably keep using.</li>
            <li> Nothing smoothes and detangles hair like Moisture Maniac, and it smells good.  However, it WILL wash out your color, because it is not sulfate-free. Since I have highlites, I had to switch.</li>
            <li> I think they must have stopped making this as I can&#x27;t find it anywhere except here. Provides moisture but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy and weighed down. I can use this with or without conditioner - depending on how dry my hair is on any given day. Has a kind of grapefruit-ish scent that is nice and lite - not overpowering so can easily blend with other scents you may be wearing.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for quite a while now and I really like it.  I am not able to get it at Super Target now so I was pleased to find it here.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for years, it is a good shampoo with a a soft scent, i got tired of paying a lot of money at the local drugstore and i ordered this from Amazonm got a very good amount of saving.</li>
            <li> No complaints, this shampoo smells great and works great. I am a guy with dry hair, and this helps keep it moisturized more than a basic shampoo. Get the conditioner too!</li>
            <li> works great the hair stylists do not try to sell me hair shampoo when I get haircuts</li>
            <li> So upset that I purchased this shampoo, as I am throwing it away after only a few uses.  This is the first shampoo that I have ever tossed out, even if it takes years for me to finally empty one out.  I don&#x27;t know what it is in here, but after using it my hair was a messy uncontrollable matte.  I thought it was just me, perhaps, but my wife also had kind of a half frizzy, half plain look after using it.  I was starting to get alarmed that I actually wasted my money on a hair product, something I rarely think of, so I tried it on my young son during his bath, as his hair is perfect full and always looks the same.  Sure enough, it looked a bit more dull and a bit more frizzy.  UGH!  I hate wasting $$, I would love to just use this product and not think of it, but it let me down.  Finally, it caused my scalp to really itch, though I am not certain this is the reason since it&#x27;s been a heat wave around here.  But it was really itching pretty bad -- perhaps there are a ton of chemicals in here that I am not used to.  Man, too bad.  PS -- I didn&#x27;t purchase it on Amazon but I thought I would warn others before it&#x27;s too late.  I am going to try something off the bestsellers here, perhaps Crew (?) for men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Moisture Maniac shampoo for at least 5 years and my hair loves it! Has a nice clean scent and doesn&#x27;t take much to create a thick lather.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize the hair worth a hoot. Dried my hair out actually. I been using it as a bubble bath because it smells incredible but the performance of the product fails. If you want a good moisturizing shampoo check into Nexxus Therappe it works like a dream. This stuff here just smells good and has a sense of humor, but that doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair now does it? think not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because it smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Bed Head. I love this shampoo! It leaves my hair soft and silky with a nice shine and it smells just like gummi bears! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years. Living in the high desert in Santa Fe NM where its dry weather and air play havoc on skin and hair. This product definitely keeps my hair in perfect condition.</li>
