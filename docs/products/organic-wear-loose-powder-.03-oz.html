    <ol>
            <li>This suits my skin tone perfectly and wears quite well for being a budget foundation -</li>
            <li>This product is the best on the market that I have found.</li>
            <li>Best makeup ever.  </li>
            <li>Its not in the best container.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years, and it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>, this powder is great!</li>
            <li>Perfect color.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>the best part is  </li>
            <li>Good coverage and a perfect color for me when blended with the translucent medium shade.</li>
            <li>Giving a great finishing touch.</li>
            <li>This is breathable and covers great.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, but even the slightest amount made me look cakey.</li>
            <li>great smell n</li>
            <li>so the two colours mix great together.</li>
            <li>I am stocking up because it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>Powder is very light and matches her skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>and it looks good, too,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for my skin..</li>
            <li>It make me look good.</li>
            <li>Grateful for the good tolerance on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I love the combo of the two!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It covers amazingly well.</li>
            <li>but I use my own make up brush.</li>
            <li>nice color</li>
            <li>kind to my face.</li>
            <li>Is nice that i can find something organic.</li>
            <li>this gives a nice glow to skin and feels light.&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>It blends nicely and stays in place all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m middle-aged and have good skin but have some fine lines and like to even out my skin tone and have SOME \\&quot;coverage\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I am now 27, and after 19 years of dealing with attempted cover-up, this is by far the best makeup</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s by FAR my favorite!!!</li>
            <li>i have very light skin</li>
            <li>This so mild and smell good..</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this brand for many years now.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s better than a lot of makeup out there</li>
            <li>so I will use it until I find something better that is Organic.</li>
            <li>It comes with a brush to apply with in a separate compartment on top.</li>
            <li>Oh well, still works OK for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product for more than the one time the brush touched my face.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m glad I had a backup.</li>
            <li>more questions email me at tanya_derkatch@hotmail.com</li>
            <li>and I love the mineral powder makeup.</li>
            <li>Typically it is difficult for me to find a shade that matches perfectly with my skin tone, but this one worked out for me and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this powder</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this makeup for around 4 or 5 years now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad they have lots of organic options online.</li>
            <li>I love the product, and use it often.</li>
            <li>To cover break outs better, use an eye shadow brush.  </li>
            <li>Also, applying more than one layer will help.  </li>
            <li>I have combination to oily skin, mostly on my forehead and sides of my nose &amp;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>Now the color is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>It just provides a nice, clean matte-type look without looking like</li>
            <li>/&gt;i started putting the normal non organic one on then touching up or putting a bit more of this one and found it looks perfect and more natural that way.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>most important thing to know for acne is when you are done applying it, PAT IN ON YOUR ACNE SPOTS</li>
            <li>Simply and naturally good stuff!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines at all.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, the product is awesome, but the packaging should get a slight revamp.</li>
            <li>I bought this face powder because EWG&#x27;s cosmetic safety database recommended it as being one of the safer products available.  </li>
            <li>I did not bother using the brush that came with it though since it appearing cheap.  </li>
            <li>For the cheap price I bought three</li>
            <li>and I found that using that wouldn&#x27;t spread out the powder with a light look.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>important detail.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>Even just a light moisturizer will cause this powder to stick and cover almost anything.  </li>
            <li>I got the translucent light and was nervous because of the word translucent.</li>
            <li>I have used it for five years or so now and I will continue to be happy with it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d originally been looking for the Physicians</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE YOUR LOTION IS VERY DRY BEFORE APPLYING IT or it will be spotted and will not look good.</li>
            <li>it scores really low on the EWG (which is good).</li>
            <li>It worked great though and didn&#x27;t seem to make my face as irritated as other powders/cover ups.</li>
            <li>Came rather quickly, too.</li>
            <li>The translucent &#x27;color&#x27; is nice for me - a pale redhead - because it just blends into my own skin tone.</li>
            <li>Great concept and smooth application, but the color was much darker than I expected.</li>
            <li>Cruelty-free, effective, cheaper than Bare Minerals, and non-comodegenic!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to apply moisturizer/sunscreen first so it can adhere well and stay put all day.</li>
            <li>I have super fair skin and have never really found a product that matched my skin this well.</li>
            <li>i cant say if it does much for those but mine are fine and i just want my blackheads, acne and redness covered.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin nor look like I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>Such a nice addition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a mirror and a brush holder inside this powder jar, which is super helpful because who wants to run to the bathroom all the time?!    </li>
            <li>i BUY this because its the right shade</li>
            <li>* in a pinch, and the pry-off top between the brush compartment and the powder sometimes makes a mess as powder is stuck to the top.</li>
            <li>I used my own brush to avoid loose hair on my face.</li>
            <li>This is a true translucent powder; although when you first open it, it looks super pale/light, it quickly disappears when you place it on your face.    </li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t that good, all the little bristles come out every time I tried to use it, so I definitely recommend using a better quality one for application.  </li>
            <li>It is light and natural.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Same product as the pressed powder, but you get way more for your $.  </li>
            <li>that brush smells EXACTLY like a goat.</li>
            <li>I use a light dusting and wow.... HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li>but i put on like 3 layers of it first.</li>
            <li>I get compliments how natural and smooth my face look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, isn&#x27;t chalky, and will last for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li>I love this powder as it&#x27;s free from harsh chemicals, so</li>
            <li>and I still look good at dinner time, then if I&#x27;m going out then ill put more on</li>
            <li>I love the natural loose powder because my face feel so smooth and not caked up with foundation</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t like the large packaging</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients are a huge improvement to the drugstore products I was using as far as risk factors go.</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important for me and the reason it&#x27;s only 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Not really PFs problem as I love their products</li>
            <li>Much softer...</li>
            <li>i was always embarrassed and everyone could tell i had so much cakey makeup on.</li>
            <li>and it covers really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to REALLY over-apply it to make it look</li>
            <li>That is just wayyyy to much to spend on makeup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the cakey thick look of liquid foundations, although it may make a good finishing powder over liquid makeup.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be fine, otherwise some minor caking might cause an issue.</li>
            <li>I purchased 3 of these powders and received them pretty quickly, considering I live on a different continent.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of putting it on my chin first (who knows why) and now the smell was directly under my nose and it didn&#x27;t go away until I washed my face again.</li>
            <li>I have super white skin, bordering on ghostly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin - it&#x27;s really a fresh look!  </li>
            <li>but its so easy to touch up in seconds anywhere and its easier to remove then other makeups which stay on skin even after its washed.</li>
            <li>She uses it everyday and already requested more.  </li>
            <li>I have received compliments on my even complexion while wearing this without even using a concealer first, which is a miracle because my skin is white with a lot of red imperfections ranging from acne to mild scars.  </li>
            <li>i could NEVER touch up my old makeups after they dried or they turned even more orange and cakey</li>
            <li>I use it primarily to tone down my reddish skin after putting on some Aveeno lotion-</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and makes my face appear even toned without that heavy make-up look.</li>
            <li>The normal one works really well mixed with this one.</li>
            <li>To be clear-</li>
            <li>To be clear- its not the make up that smells....</li>
            <li>If your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive (which it probably is bc</li>
            <li>i do NOT put it on near my son or let him in when im applying it</li>
            <li>pat it with my fingers and it looks natural then.</li>
            <li>It looks natural.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much powder in the jar and it lasts for months with daily usage, there&#x27;s at least three times as much powder in there vs l&#x27;oreal bare minerals and it stays with you pretty much all day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also too small to fit a regular-sized powder brush inside the container.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I expected and does the job without harm.  </li>
            <li>It actually ended up being a little too light for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sheer, natural looking and gentle on my dry, excema-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried bare minerals and all sorts of liquid and power foundations.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve transferred some of this powder into an old, smaller container</li>
            <li>more annoying thing is this makeup does come off easily if you rub your face on something</li>
            <li>I usually wear light in other makeups but in this I use translucent medium.</li>

            <li> The brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t that good, all the little bristles come out every time I tried to use it, so I definitely recommend using a better quality one for application.  </li>
            <li> It is light and natural.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Same product as the pressed powder, but you get way more for your $.  </li>
            <li> that brush smells EXACTLY like a goat.</li>
            <li> I use a light dusting and wow.... HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> but i put on like 3 layers of it first.</li>
            <li> I get compliments how natural and smooth my face look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, isn&#x27;t chalky, and will last for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> I love this powder as it&#x27;s free from harsh chemicals, so</li>
            <li> and I still look good at dinner time, then if I&#x27;m going out then ill put more on</li>
            <li> I love the natural loose powder because my face feel so smooth and not caked up with foundation</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t like the large packaging</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients are a huge improvement to the drugstore products I was using as far as risk factors go.</li>
            <li> really</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important for me and the reason it&#x27;s only 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Not really PFs problem as I love their products</li>
            <li> Much softer...</li>
            <li> i was always embarrassed and everyone could tell i had so much cakey makeup on.</li>
            <li> and it covers really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to REALLY over-apply it to make it look</li>
            <li> That is just wayyyy to much to spend on makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the cakey thick look of liquid foundations, although it may make a good finishing powder over liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be fine, otherwise some minor caking might cause an issue.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these powders and received them pretty quickly, considering I live on a different continent.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of putting it on my chin first (who knows why) and now the smell was directly under my nose and it didn&#x27;t go away until I washed my face again.</li>
            <li> I have super white skin, bordering on ghostly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin - it&#x27;s really a fresh look!  </li>
            <li> but its so easy to touch up in seconds anywhere and its easier to remove then other makeups which stay on skin even after its washed.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday and already requested more.  </li>
            <li> I have received compliments on my even complexion while wearing this without even using a concealer first, which is a miracle because my skin is white with a lot of red imperfections ranging from acne to mild scars.  </li>
            <li> i could NEVER touch up my old makeups after they dried or they turned even more orange and cakey</li>
            <li> I use it primarily to tone down my reddish skin after putting on some Aveeno lotion-</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and makes my face appear even toned without that heavy make-up look.</li>
            <li> The normal one works really well mixed with this one.</li>
            <li> To be clear-</li>
            <li> To be clear- its not the make up that smells....</li>
            <li> If your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive (which it probably is bc</li>
            <li> i do NOT put it on near my son or let him in when im applying it</li>
            <li> pat it with my fingers and it looks natural then.</li>
            <li> It looks natural.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much powder in the jar and it lasts for months with daily usage, there&#x27;s at least three times as much powder in there vs l&#x27;oreal bare minerals and it stays with you pretty much all day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also too small to fit a regular-sized powder brush inside the container.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I expected and does the job without harm.  </li>
            <li> It actually ended up being a little too light for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sheer, natural looking and gentle on my dry, excema-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried bare minerals and all sorts of liquid and power foundations.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve transferred some of this powder into an old, smaller container</li>
            <li> more annoying thing is this makeup does come off easily if you rub your face on something</li>
            <li> I usually wear light in other makeups but in this I use translucent medium.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much, didn&#x27;t expect it to be any different from other loose powder brands</li>
            <li> The brush is hard bristled and makes application difficult but the actual powder is amazing!</li>
            <li> I dip it in a flat lid, swirl and tap</li>
            <li> they are listed as the same shade but not exactly the same</li>
            <li> I have a few old acne scars and some sun spots.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on the brush seemed to come loose.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is a little tough to spread because it dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it does spread and cover well and go on evenly as long as you do it properly and practise a bit.&lt;br /&gt;i have a FEW WRINKLES.</li>
            <li> Well, as expected it is what it is.</li>
            <li> I just use my big fluffy powder brush</li>
            <li> It was also lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Tired of paying high prices for makeup</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like when I&#x27;m using other powder that gives me pimples..</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It is VERY PALE even though sheer.</li>
            <li> The brush hairs are scratchy and also a little rough, I haven&#x27;t had any hairs fall out though.     </li>
            <li> After having such a hard time finding makeup that matched my face</li>
            <li> I tried probably at LEAST 30 different foundations in my life and NONE compare to this.</li>
            <li> Go as dark in the shades as you can for your skin tone, as it covers redness better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why you use PF typically)</li>
            <li> my skin tone is slightly darker than \\&quot;fair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is fairly soft, but is awkward to use with this loose powder, so I typically don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> But it does the trick just need to do little sections at a time rather than slathering on a bunch at once</li>
            <li> Works well for everyday use and nights out.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and one tub lasts about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS broken out (since I was in 2nd grade).  </li>
            <li> I sort of just wanted something to keep me matte for a few hours.    </li>
            <li> The product has a ton of plastic around it, a lot of which seems redundant?</li>
            <li> either - it&#x27;s way too stiff</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT if you plan to travel with this makeup, prepare for a mess!</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find a foundation that doesn&#x27;t make me look at least slightly orange or tan.  </li>
            <li> Not great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> the brush is too small to use unless you&#x27;re</li>
            <li> The brush is small</li>
            <li> /&gt;To touch-up throughout the day, just reapply small amounts.  </li>
            <li> It also comes in a big cardboard container that has a lot of flaps, which is unfortunate.     </li>
            <li> I do agree with other people that there is a lot of unnecessary packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and was hoping it would match my skin tone since I bought &amp;#34;translucent light&amp;#34;, but it was tanned with an orange tint.</li>
            <li> its hard to explain</li>
            <li> The others were sub-par but at least I have one for the go and one for home.</li>
            <li> Yes, this sucks.  </li>
            <li> Oh and the brush sucks</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was not going to feel thick and cakey but that has a bit of coverage.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are less scary than what you usually see in makeup.  </li>
            <li> i inhale quite a bit which is the only bad thing of this product</li>
            <li> do it in a bathroom with the fan going because the minerals go in the air pretty badly and are bad to breath in.</li>
            <li> (all the others looked even worse)</li>
            <li> Liquid foundations make me oily and cause my skin to break out worse than before.</li>
            <li> i used a thick liquid crap foundation for years by revlon that took over half an hour to put on!!!</li>
            <li> one weird thing that happens depending on the moisturizer i use.</li>
            <li> (seriously i tried with around 30 of them!!</li>
            <li> crazy about the brush included</li>
            <li> covers so well its crazy.</li>
            <li> I can touch up in less then a minute throughout the day with no side effect!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this product shocked me at how well the COVERAGE is.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product exceeded my expectations.  It is light and natural.  Giving a great finishing touch.</li>
            <li> I have super white skin, bordering on ghostly.  It is not easy to find a foundation that doesn&#x27;t make me look at least slightly orange or tan.  This suits my skin tone perfectly and wears quite well for being a budget foundation - I have received compliments on my even complexion while wearing this without even using a concealer first, which is a miracle because my skin is white with a lot of red imperfections ranging from acne to mild scars.  I like that the ingredients are less scary than what you usually see in makeup.  I have used it for five years or so now and I will continue to be happy with it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Great concept and smooth application, but the color was much darker than I expected. I&#x27;m very pale and was hoping it would match my skin tone since I bought &amp;#34;translucent light&amp;#34;, but it was tanned with an orange tint.</li>
            <li> This product is the best on the market that I have found. No worries about harmful chemicals! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this face powder because EWG&#x27;s cosmetic safety database recommended it as being one of the safer products available.  My local store carries this brand but not this line so I ordered it.  The product is exactly what I expected and does the job without harm.  The seller was prompt and the product arrived undamaged.  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 21yo niece.  She uses it everyday and already requested more.  Powder is very light and matches her skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> Simply and naturally good stuff! Skin handles it well and it looks good, too,</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this brand for many years now. I have tried bare minerals and all sorts of liquid and power foundations. This is breathable and covers great. It downs;t leave you looking lie you have a ton of makeup on either. I recently started using this with the liquid tinted moisturizer and I love the combo of the two! The moisturizer is a little tough to spread because it dries so quickly. But it does the trick just need to do little sections at a time rather than slathering on a bunch at once like I am used to doing with regular lotion. Best makeup ever.  just wish it was actually 100% organic. But it&#x27;s better than a lot of makeup out there so I will use it until I find something better that is Organic.</li>
            <li> This product does the job when it comes to covering shine on my face.  I did not bother using the brush that came with it though since it appearing cheap.  Only con is that at times it can appear cakey.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and makes my face appear even toned without that heavy make-up look. It comes with a brush to apply with in a separate compartment on top. Works well for everyday use and nights out.</li>
            <li> My only star off is for the clumsy/compact packaging... the brush is too small to use unless you&#x27;re *really* in a pinch, and the pry-off top between the brush compartment and the powder sometimes makes a mess as powder is stuck to the top. It&#x27;s also too small to fit a regular-sized powder brush inside the container. Oh well, still works OK for me. The translucent &#x27;color&#x27; is nice for me - a pale redhead - because it just blends into my own skin tone. No orange-y effect ;) I also love that it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin nor look like I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> After having such a hard time finding makeup that matched my face I was so excited to find this color. It actually ended up being a little too light for me. It worked great though and didn&#x27;t seem to make my face as irritated as other powders/cover ups. I wear it alone as foundation and its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT if you plan to travel with this makeup, prepare for a mess! Its not in the best container. That&#x27;s important for me and the reason it&#x27;s only 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Same product as the pressed powder, but you get way more for your $.  Matte, but not cakey. The only foundation powder I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for my skin.. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like when I&#x27;m using other powder that gives me pimples.. This so mild and smell good..</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, and it&#x27;s awesome! Cruelty-free, effective, cheaper than Bare Minerals, and non-comodegenic!&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Not great for dry skin. Great coverage, but even the slightest amount made me look cakey. Gave it to my oily skinned friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Works for me! Tired of paying high prices for makeup so I decided to try this powder &amp;  it does what my $35 powder does. The brush is small but I use my own make up brush.</li>
            <li> To be clear- I haven&#x27;t used the product for more than the one time the brush touched my face. I guess my question would be... is the brush goat hair? Because I owned goats before in my life and let me tell you... that brush smells EXACTLY like a goat. HORRIBLE! I made the mistake of putting it on my chin first (who knows why) and now the smell was directly under my nose and it didn&#x27;t go away until I washed my face again. Yuck. To be clear- its not the make up that smells.... just the brush. Count on throwing it away the second you get it... unless you like your face smelling like a goat.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these powders and received them pretty quickly, considering I live on a different continent.  I love this powder as it&#x27;s free from harsh chemicals, so it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin.  The brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t that good, all the little bristles come out every time I tried to use it, so I definitely recommend using a better quality one for application.  Other than that, this powder is great!</li>
            <li> Well, as expected it is what it is. For the cheap price I bought three and now I&#x27;m glad I had a backup. One was expired (based on prior experience with the product) and I only used once. The others were sub-par but at least I have one for the go and one for home. Not really PFs problem as I love their products, I just think with the discontinue of the Organics, the company reselling had to have had them for awhile. If your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive (which it probably is bc that&#x27;s why you use PF typically) you&#x27;ll be fine, otherwise some minor caking might cause an issue.</li>
            <li> nice color great smell n kind to my face.Is nice that i can find something organic.It make me look good.</li>
            <li> Perfect color. Grateful for the good tolerance on my skin.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this...  Recently saw it at Big Lots.  Didn&#x27;t expect much, didn&#x27;t expect it to be any different from other loose powder brands I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it IS different.  BTW I use either liquid foundation or I use the Balm Shelter tinted moisturizer SPF 18 and then once that \\&quot;sets\\&quot; I finish up with applying Mineral Fusion Illuminating mineral Beauty Balm SPF 9.  I&#x27;m middle-aged and have good skin but have some fine lines and like to even out my skin tone and have SOME \\&quot;coverage\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this powder is just what I was wanting!  (I don&#x27;t like the large packaging but I&#x27;ve transferred some of this powder into an old, smaller container and that&#x27;s perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;Not crazy about the brush included either - it&#x27;s way too stiff and I found that using that wouldn&#x27;t spread out the powder with a light look.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I just use my big fluffy powder brush and it&#x27;s perfect.  Much softer... I dip it in a flat lid, swirl and tap so it&#x27;s not loaded with powder, than VOILA!  Such a nice addition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder actually MINIMIZES the look of my pores!  and it doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines at all.  It just provides a nice, clean matte-type look without looking like I have dry skin - it&#x27;s really a fresh look!  I use a light dusting and wow.... HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am 27 with some acne and redness. i have been using this product for years. I tried probably at LEAST 30 different foundations in my life and NONE compare to this. this product shocked me at how well the COVERAGE is. i used a thick liquid crap foundation for years by revlon that took over half an hour to put on!!! (all the others looked even worse) i was always embarrassed and everyone could tell i had so much cakey makeup on. I did not know a powder could actually FULLY COVER acne until tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;This covers so well its crazy. the best part is  I can touch up in less then a minute throughout the day with no side effect!!!!!! i could NEVER touch up my old makeups after they dried or they turned even more orange and cakey (seriously i tried with around 30 of them!! including (maybelline, loreal, revlon, cover girl, clinic, mac etc)&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing to know for acne is when you are done applying it, PAT IN ON YOUR ACNE SPOTS OR THEY WONT BE COVERED FULLY. same with red spots. the brush will not cover it fully.&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER important detail. i BUY this because its the right shade but when you pat it on it appears a bit lighter. i used translucent medium for my forehead, side of nose and side of face and TRANSLUCENT MEDIUM TO PAT ON ACNE so it doesn&#x27;t look whiter on those spots. i have very light skin btw,&lt;br /&gt;this is the only makeup i found that does not clog pores or cause acne at all. MAKE SURE YOUR LOTION IS VERY DRY BEFORE APPLYING IT or it will be spotted and will not look good. do it in a bathroom with the fan going because the minerals go in the air pretty badly and are bad to breath in. i inhale quite a bit which is the only bad thing of this product and it goes on everything in my bathroom after a bit. i do NOT put it on near my son or let him in when im applying it so he doesn&#x27;t inhale it.&lt;br /&gt;it does spread and cover well and go on evenly as long as you do it properly and practise a bit.&lt;br /&gt;i have a FEW WRINKLES. i cant say if it does much for those but mine are fine and i just want my blackheads, acne and redness covered. this gives a nice glow to skin and feels light.&lt;br /&gt;one more annoying thing is this makeup does come off easily if you rub your face on something but its so easy to touch up in seconds anywhere and its easier to remove then other makeups which stay on skin even after its washed. i do swim with this makeup but i put on like 3 layers of it first. lots comes off but some definitely stays and still covers ok.&lt;br /&gt;lastly one weird thing that happens depending on the moisturizer i use. sometimes i have to wait then pat it with my fingers and it looks natural then. then i apply another layer with the brush. its hard to explain but it just happens sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;i started putting the normal non organic one on then touching up or putting a bit more of this one and found it looks perfect and more natural that way. The normal one works really well mixed with this one. they are listed as the same shade but not exactly the same so the two colours mix great together. i do use a different wider flatter brush.&lt;br /&gt;any more questions email me at tanya_derkatch@hotmail.com</li>
            <li> I buy Physician&#x27;s Formula as they don&#x27;t do animal testing and I love the mineral powder makeup. Typically it is difficult for me to find a shade that matches perfectly with my skin tone, but this one worked out for me and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the natural loose powder because my face feel so smooth and not caked up with foundation does. I get compliments how natural and smooth my face look. The only problem it the brush that comes with it. The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on the brush seemed to come loose. I used my own brush to avoid loose hair on my face.</li>
            <li> This item has been discontinued and can no longer be found on the physician&#x27;s formula site or in stores.  I am stocking up because it&#x27;s a great product.  Good coverage and a perfect color for me when blended with the translucent medium shade.</li>
            <li> I love this powder it&#x27;s by FAR my favorite!!! There&#x27;s so much powder in the jar and it lasts for months with daily usage, there&#x27;s at least three times as much powder in there vs l&#x27;oreal bare minerals and it stays with you pretty much all day, I don&#x27;t wear a lot I only put it over my Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer, which is my fav, in the morning and I still look good at dinner time, then if I&#x27;m going out then ill put more on but it&#x27;s so light and it covers really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this makeup for around 4 or 5 years now and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s very sheer, natural looking and gentle on my dry, excema-prone skin. I use it everyday and one tub lasts about 6 months. I use it primarily to tone down my reddish skin after putting on some Aveeno lotion- I don&#x27;t like the cakey thick look of liquid foundations, although it may make a good finishing powder over liquid makeup. This may need reapplying in the middle of the day if you&#x27;re oily or a perfectionist.  It is VERY PALE even though sheer. I usually wear light in other makeups but in this I use translucent medium.</li>
            <li> I am so glad they have lots of organic options online. I love the product, and use it often. Came rather quickly, too.</li>
            <li> The brush is hard bristled and makes application difficult but the actual powder is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS broken out (since I was in 2nd grade).  Yes, this sucks.  I am now 27, and after 19 years of dealing with attempted cover-up, this is by far the best makeup I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It covers amazingly well. I use cover up, but no liquid foundation.  Liquid foundations make me oily and cause my skin to break out worse than before. Even just a light moisturizer will cause this powder to stick and cover almost anything.  I&#x27;ve had to REALLY over-apply it to make it look caked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is in the BRUSH you use to apply it. To cover break outs better, use an eye shadow brush.  Also, applying more than one layer will help.  Go as dark in the shades as you can for your skin tone, as it covers redness better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO mix different shades depending on where you are applying it.  Jawline: lighter to match the neck.  Cheeks/forehead darker so you don&#x27;t look like a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To touch-up throughout the day, just reapply small amounts.  It sticks to itself so well.</li>
            <li> This is a true translucent powder; although when you first open it, it looks super pale/light, it quickly disappears when you place it on your face.    I use this powder on my face after I moisturize (I don&#x27;t use foundation or concealer). I have combination to oily skin, mostly on my forehead and sides of my nose &amp; my skin tone is slightly darker than \\&quot;fair\\&quot;. I sort of just wanted something to keep me matte for a few hours.    This does the trick! I DON&#x27;T need to reapply the powder for probably 6 hours. After 6 hours is up, I can see a bit of oil peeking through, but what can you do!?    The brush that comes with it is fairly soft, but is awkward to use with this loose powder, so I typically don&#x27;t use it. The brush hairs are scratchy and also a little rough, I haven&#x27;t had any hairs fall out though.     There is a mirror and a brush holder inside this powder jar, which is super helpful because who wants to run to the bathroom all the time?!    I do agree with other people that there is a lot of unnecessary packaging. The product has a ton of plastic around it, a lot of which seems redundant? It also comes in a big cardboard container that has a lot of flaps, which is unfortunate.     Regardless, the product is awesome, but the packaging should get a slight revamp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d originally been looking for the Physicians Formula Magic Mosaic compact but was having an extremely difficult time finding it. I decided to try this instead and I&#x27;m glad I took the chance. It&#x27;s great, isn&#x27;t chalky, and will last for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> Went in rather chalky. It was also lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal. I have been looking for an organic powder for awhile now. Every truly organic product is $30 and up...way up. That is just wayyyy to much to spend on makeup. If your like me you have a family and a budget...although this product is not 100% organic it scores really low on the EWG (which is good). Natural ingredients are a huge improvement to the drugstore products I was using as far as risk factors go. Now the color is FANTASTIC! I have super fair skin and have never really found a product that matched my skin this well. I got the translucent light and was nervous because of the word translucent. I have a few old acne scars and some sun spots. I wanted something that was not going to feel thick and cakey but that has a bit of coverage. It&#x27;s important to apply moisturizer/sunscreen first so it can adhere well and stay put all day. Oh and the brush sucks but nobody uses the brush that comes with makeup anyway!</li>
            <li> This powder does not result in a caked-on appearance.  It blends nicely and stays in place all day.  It looks natural.</li>
