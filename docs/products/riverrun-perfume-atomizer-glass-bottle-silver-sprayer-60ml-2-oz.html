            <li>A friend gave me my favorite cologne but in a regular bottle which I realized I wasn&#x27;t using very often.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as expected - nice volume - fit the entire bottle</li>
            <li>I should have ordered the larger size but this one works just fine.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, plus it came with a little eye dropper like thing</li>

            <li> DONT LIKE IT....IT SPRAYS ALL AROUND MY FACE AND I WISH IT WOULD SPRAY SMALL AREA</li>
            <li> Nice, solid, heavyweight reusable perfume bottle (spray). Glad I ordered it!  I would order again if I ever need another.</li>
            <li> Good size and sprays a big mist.</li>

            <li> I purchased this bottle to replace a malfunctioning perfume bottle. Enclosed in the package is a small pipette to transfer the liquid! I was delighted because I did not realize the pipette was included. The spray mechanism works well and I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I should have ordered the larger size but this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> I had a big name designer cologne that had a defective spray pump.  The bottle was almost full when the pump decided to stop working.  I picked this so that I could continue using the cologne.  This works great and the atomizer is better then the ones that come by default on normal bottles.  It is also heavy glass, very well made.</li>
            <li> Love the spray bottle.  Now I spray my favorite cologne on vs having to &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; it on while trying to juggle a bottle that won&#x27;t stand up.</li>
