            <li>Very pretty, broke first time I put it on.</li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>but I use it as a hatband s yellow flower received many raves</li>
            <li>Pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, Great condition :) Only thing is, it&#x27;s a little loose.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really quite pretty.  </li>
            <li>It is large, but you can easily add a slip know to make it smaller.  </li>

            <li>I have a small head and there is a bit more room, so</li>
            <li>It had a few stray threads that were easily snipped off from the edges.</li>
            <li>So, wearing a headband like this in my long dark hair is striking.  </li>
            <li>I can barely feel this while wearing it.</li>

            <li> The shipping time was pretty long, but I was aware of that because it ships from Asia. The headband looks just like the picture and I love mine! I was a little concerned about buying it because the reviews were kind of mixed. Some people said that it broke the day they got it, but others said that theirs hasn&#x27;t broke and that they have had it for months. So far , I love this headband, I am satisfied with this product!</li>

            <li> Beautiful headband that classes up any outfit.  It is large, but you can easily add a slip know to make it smaller.  Just lovely.</li>
            <li> This needs several hair pins to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> Love the headband, but hated that it took over three weeks to get to me from China. Will be more careful and buy from a place in the US next time.</li>
