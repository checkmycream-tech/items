            <li>Excellent Comb that is of excellent quality.  </li>

            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Happy I got the 3 pack.</li>
            <li>the money; this is great</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a happy camper!&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you need one you need a good one and this is a good one to have.</li>
            <li>Great price and love that you can purchase a 3 pack</li>
            <li>(As opposed to the softer, more flexible kind of plastic that bends easily without breaking.)</li>
            <li>I purchased several Ace rat-tail combs from Amazon and have been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>packaged fine</li>
            <li>Every time I buy some people love them so much they disappear.</li>
            <li>good quality product--hard to find in local stores-came promptly--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m set for a good long while.</li>
            <li>so she has two more left.</li>
            <li>While this comb will certainly work for what I need, I just wanted to add this info for any tender-headed folks out there.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy them again when needs be.</li>
            <li>They are super sturdy and can be used so a variety of different things.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll have to live to 100 to use them all.</li>
            <li>These are the best combs I&#x27;ve found - expensive for combs, but they generally last a very long time.</li>
            <li>After going through comb after comb, breaking teeth when brand new, I looked for the trusted brand I grew up with but could not find locally.</li>

            <li> The combs were as expected.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  I&#x27;ve had one Ace comb for over 25 years..</li>
            <li> Highest quality. After going through comb after comb, breaking teeth when brand new, I looked for the trusted brand I grew up with but could not find locally. Tines do not pull or damage hair. Tail is sturdy. Happy I got the 3 pack. I&#x27;m set for a good long while.</li>
            <li> I do not like using any other comb and have a very hard time finding these. Great price and love that you can purchase a 3 pack</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought all kinds of combs but this same type of ACE comb lasts the longer, doesn&#x27;t break hair, and won&#x27;t kill my bank account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money; this is great and I&#x27;m a happy camper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> While this comb will certainly work for what I need, I just wanted to add this info for any tender-headed folks out there. This comb is made out of hard, brittle plastic that can sometimes be tough on scalps if used with any sort of pressure. (As opposed to the softer, more flexible kind of plastic that bends easily without breaking.) Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> These are still the best combs ever.  They never break.  Difficult to find in drugstores so Anazon is best way to buy.</li>
            <li> Ace tail combs are the best that were ever made! Every time I buy some people love them so much they disappear. I usually have to hide them. They are super sturdy and can be used so a variety of different things.</li>

            <li> I purchased several Ace rat-tail combs from Amazon and have been very happy with them.  These combs have been rather hard to come by in my shopping \\&quot;digs\\&quot; so I found them (including the ratting combs I have grown to depend upon) on Amazon.  I will certainly buy them again when needs be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ace combs for years.  They last forever so I&#x27;ll have to live to 100 to use them all.</li>
            <li> Best combs in the world!</li>
            <li> good quality product--hard to find in local stores-came promptly--packaged fine</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this tail comb. Came in a package of 3 for $10. She has been using 1 for the past 6 months so she has two more left. Says it works. Since its a good buy and it works well, I give this wonderful product 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> These are the best combs I&#x27;ve found - expensive for combs, but they generally last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Only received part of the order but they sent the remainder after I contacted them. Took forever to arrive but that was the post office error.</li>
