            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The packaging of this product could be better.</li>
            <li>The bottle with the instructions was blurry, and the top was a screw on top with tape wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply printed label that just says &amp;#34;Ale Vera Oil&amp;#34; – no mark of organic production, no ingredients, etc.</li>

            <li>This is a very light oil and absorbs quickly,leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>but when i open the bottle then realize that this the pure Aloe vera smell --great for hair as well as body massage .</li>
            <li>plus theres no closed seal on the top of the bottle</li>
            <li>I will no doubt order more when this gets low.</li>
            <li>(it looks exactly like the pic at the top)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>and I will purchase more in the future</li>
            <li>so when you use my product you will have no worry of what exactly you are putting on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera Oil is good for mixing with Vitamin E Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, and just a few drops of Eucalyptus oil for body aches.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff i use in on my skin and hair especially since i just had a baby it really helps with the marks</li>
            <li>i still have a bit left and it lasted a good while it mixed well with other oils and was just over all good not to light or too heavy</li>
            <li>it is very soothing and healing.</li>
            <li>if something really is organic)</li>
            <li>but the problem is theres no way of really knowing since there&#x27;s no certified seal...</li>
            <li>it was very helpful for me</li>
            <li>and i cant use alot of products with perfumes and dies it really helps in that area.</li>
            <li>But the oil its self have my hair feeling awesome:-D. Haha</li>
            <li>I love this product it was as expected works well on my skin</li>
            <li>With many other oils that I have recently purchased, I mix all of these oils together, and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how shiny, soft, and healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li>it had a really strong smell of wheat and left my hair shiney and soft...</li>
            <li>i was hoping the bottle would actually have a CERTIFIED ORGANIC seal on it (the only way to know for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised this product has any positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The packaging is the first red flag.</li>
            <li>and this was the only oil on here claiming that it was both certified and nothing but pure aloe vera...</li>
            <li>this made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I had no idea it was going to be so professional.</li>
            <li>plus it left my skin soft..  </li>

            <li> plus it left my skin soft..  </li>
            <li> so anybody could&#x27;ve added anything to it and closed it back up and claim its \\&quot;organic\\&quot;...  </li>
            <li> The label information is not clear so you can not read it.</li>
            <li> I give this a three star because I order other oils with this order and they all smelled the same...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, but this seems to solve the problem with out being too oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> and I dab some on when I&#x27;m feeling itchy or too dry in the scalp.</li>
            <li> I think the strength of this oil, although, somewhat thinner than I expected, is in mixing it with other body oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably 99.9% other oils besides Aloe Vera (like a vegetable, mineral, and/or canola mixture).</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever the label isnt right as I cant read a thing in it just a waste of money</li>
            <li> my sister has told me that smell is not good</li>
            <li> I like this product since I&#x27;m unable to buy a piece of aloe vera plant.</li>
            <li> Cant read label, use it on my hair and is sticky and smells bad, darker collor than it shows on picture.</li>
            <li> Of course, what&#x27;s inside the bottle is the worst part.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> just like the plant it is very soothing and healing. I will no doubt order more when this gets low.</li>
            <li> this made my hair so soft. i will be repurchasing it soon i still have a bit left and it lasted a good while it mixed well with other oils and was just over all good not to light or too heavy</li>
            <li> I was looking for organic aloe vera and wheat germ on here with nothing but aloe vera in the ingrediants and this was the only oil on here claiming that it was both certified and nothing but pure aloe vera... I ordered this over a month ago but just now decided to use it because theres no way of knowing whats actually in it... i was hoping the bottle would actually have a CERTIFIED ORGANIC seal on it (the only way to know for sure if something really is organic) but nope... it doesn&#x27;t... plus theres no closed seal on the top of the bottle so anybody could&#x27;ve added anything to it and closed it back up and claim its \\&quot;organic\\&quot;...  i&#x27;ve got a big thing about non sealed bottles and an even bigger thing about actual organic products coming with their registerd USDA organic inspected seal... this product could be organic and it could be aloe vera but the problem is theres no way of really knowing since there&#x27;s no certified seal... just a taped on homemade looking label with the word organic on it and some blurry description at the bottom you can&#x27;t even read (it looks exactly like the pic at the top)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i finally tried it out and am just hoping i dont break out if it&#x27;s something else.. i&#x27;ll let u know... if it is actually organic the seller should just get the USDA seal put on it so people buying it will know for sure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDED: I used the aloe vera on my face and i didn&#x27;t break out plus it left my skin soft..  so i went ahead and used the wheat germ by the same company... it had a really strong smell of wheat and left my hair shiney and soft... so it gets bumped up from 3 stars to 4 .. would give it a 5 if it had a certified seal</li>
            <li> This is a great oil. I often mix it with aloe vera gel and use it after I shower. I have dry skin, but this seems to solve the problem with out being too oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Mixed in well with the oils I used for lotions</li>
            <li> This works amazing. I had no idea it was going to be so professional. Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Organic Aloe Vera Oile. it was very helpful for me and I finished. I can buy it again sure</li>
            <li> Personally i lovr it for my hair n skin . Considering i have a skin disorder and i cant use alot of products with perfumes and dies it really helps in that area. Just wish it came with a lil squirt top or some type of nozzle. But the oil its self have my hair feeling awesome:-D. Haha</li>
            <li> BEWARE!  Certified Organic Aloe Vera OIL...... Not stated on bottle nor did it have USDA label for such certification.  Amazon should take this off their website!  Personally think I get ripped off!  Will be more vigilant when I order this type of product!</li>
            <li> Cheaply printed label that just says &amp;#34;Ale Vera Oil&amp;#34; – no mark of organic production, no ingredients, etc. Smells like a cheap vegetable oil and the texture quality is poor. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Okay.  I purchased a different kind before, and it was much better.</li>
            <li> my sister has told me that smell is not good but when i open the bottle then realize that this the pure Aloe vera smell --great for hair as well as body massage .</li>
            <li> great for what it was need for</li>
            <li> i love this stuff i use in on my skin and hair especially since i just had a baby it really helps with the marks</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT THE ITEM SELLER WAS PROMPT AND PRICE GOOD, I USe THIS FOR TAKING OFF MAKEUP AND FOR MY SKIN AROUND MY EYE BEFORE  BED!... You know ladys we have to keep wrinkles away and organic aloe vera oil is great ...</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera has many uses. I use it in my hair as well as my body. This is a great product. I will use it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for your skin!! This is a very light oil and absorbs quickly,leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Cant read label, use it on my hair and is sticky and smells bad, darker collor than it shows on picture.</li>
            <li> I love this product it was as expected works well on my skin I love it and I will purchase more in the future</li>
            <li> I like this product since I&#x27;m unable to buy a piece of aloe vera plant. You can use this on all sorts of things. I&#x27;ve tried a mixture for my hair and I dab some on when I&#x27;m feeling itchy or too dry in the scalp. Love this oil.</li>
            <li> Good product, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised this product has any positive reviews. The packaging is the first red flag. As noted by others, the product has a real cheap looking label. It appears the seller &amp;#34;certified&amp;#34; the oil organic themselves because there&#x27;s no governing body or seal to verify the claim. Of course, what&#x27;s inside the bottle is the worst part. It&#x27;s probably 99.9% other oils besides Aloe Vera (like a vegetable, mineral, and/or canola mixture). What a rip.</li>
            <li> I give this a three star because I order other oils with this order and they all smelled the same...</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Oil is a great source of hair treatment. With many other oils that I have recently purchased, I mix all of these oils together, and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how shiny, soft, and healthy my hair is. A+</li>
            <li> I like this oil. It has a barely discernible aroma, which is perfect. I think the strength of this oil, although, somewhat thinner than I expected, is in mixing it with other body oils. Aloe Vera Oil is good for mixing with Vitamin E Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, and just a few drops of Eucalyptus oil for body aches. The price was great for the amount.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it every day and every night on my face!!!</li>
            <li> The packaging of this product could be better. The label information is not clear so you can not read it. There is also no information to prove that product is certified anything. The oil has no scent and does absorb into the skin well. I have used it and it did not break my skin out. There is no way of knowing if this is really&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for hair and skin, I&#x27;m using for both to give my product the healthier and natural state so when you use my product you will have no worry of what exactly you are putting on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The bottle with the instructions was blurry, and the top was a screw on top with tape wrapped around it.  The oil looked similiar to another bottle I bought from the same company.  It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever the label isnt right as I cant read a thing in it just a waste of money</li>
