            <li>Strongly recommend it if u dont like strong smell moisturizers.</li>

            <li>I Love This Lotion Since The First Time I Test It</li>
            <li>Worth its weight in gold, I say!</li>
            <li>Perfect for any season and the subscribe &amp; save price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other St Ives lotions but they can be greasy or have a really strong smell, this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I use all the St. Ives lotlions because they not only make my skin feel good</li>
            <li>I use it after I get out of the shower and it absorbs quickly into my skin (doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feel).  </li>
            <li>one needs just a little on the hands to keep them moist, this may be a body lotion, but great for hands too.</li>
            <li>I always use it after washing my hands and my nails always look healthy and naturally white on the tips, with smooth cuticles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many all natural ingredients lotions and this is just as good as or better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>(Though I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Applying It), But Its Scent Also Keeps Me Fresh</li>
            <li>I like the St. Ives brand and was happy to find such a big bottle for such a good price.</li>
            <li>Right</li>
            <li>and I like the smell very much</li>
            <li>Keeps my body soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Simply Put, I Love It</li>
            <li>And really affordable too!</li>
            <li>No odor and rub it in well for the first year to minimize scarring.</li>
            <li>So many lotions ,once dry, seem to have disappeared and have no effect.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it absorbs fast with no greasy feeling, has a light natural scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it gentle enough to even use on my face which is uber sensitive.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Fast Absorbing Non Greasy\\&quot; to this product.</li>
            <li>During Working Hours Infront Of My Lappy &amp; Very Relaxing For My Bedtime.</li>
            <li>Absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it n</li>
            <li>It really hydrates your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell on this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just got my first container of the newly designed lotion</li>
            <li>I am a loyal St Ives consumer and this price matched or was actually cheaper compared to the real store</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and apply it to my whole body after showering and put a little on my hands after each hand washing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice &amp; thick but not greasy which makes me feel like it is really hydrating my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and this is so soft and smooth, and it really hydrates well.</li>
            <li>I suppose the length of time it requires to absorb may be fast relative to man&#x27;s descent from the apes, but</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin well moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I have pumps of both the old and new formula&#x27;s in front of me, it&#x27;s very different.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really feel it has been keeping my skin hydrated as much as I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to have such an affordable product which works this well.</li>
            <li>So long St. Ives, I guess it&#x27;s time to find a new lotion.</li>
            <li>you will not be disappointed by  purchasing this product a really thick and moisturizing lotion which will get rid of your dry skin, the scent is nice and mild , the size is very generous.</li>

            <li> you will not be disappointed by  purchasing this product a really thick and moisturizing lotion which will get rid of your dry skin, the scent is nice and mild , the size is very generous.</li>
            <li> The new formula has extra added perfume, which for someone like me that can&#x27;t go within 3 stores of a Bath &amp; Body works without sneezing, ruins the lotion for me.  </li>
            <li> This lotion I use from long time ago,my mon introduce for me</li>
            <li> I purchased each to try out for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> When the colder weather hits, my hands begin to get dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dry feet and patches on elbows.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, though.</li>
            <li> This brand has been my favorite for years; hydrates, silky texture, neither too thick or thin, with a &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use it at work where the air is very dry and the bathroom soap strips all of the moisture from your hands.  </li>
            <li> The cost for the amount you get is unbelievable for such a quality product, enabling me to have bottles at home and at the office.</li>
            <li> You end up having to unscrew the cap with the pump mechanism and holding the bottle upside down and smacking it against your palm to get the lotion out.  </li>
            <li> I know I like the brand, and can count on it, so I usually buy their body lotion and their face lotion.  </li>
            <li> NBD, as we usually end up transferring some or all of it to another container anyway,</li>
            <li> Never had any problems with St. Ives lotions in the past, but this one is ridiculously thick that it&#x27;s a struggle to pump it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy icky coating or anything</li>
            <li> And the lotion is just too thick for my liking.  </li>
            <li> Non Greasy pretty implicitly states that your hands won&#x27;t leave awful grease marks on everything you touch.</li>
            <li> Sadly, they do.</li>
            <li> The lotions formula is almost unrecognizable from what it used to be, it&#x27;s very sad, they built their reputation on being one way and now feel the need to change that for the worse.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst hand cream I&#x27;ve used in some time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lotion is great. I use it at work where the air is very dry and the bathroom soap strips all of the moisture from your hands.  I work with a lot of paper work and I have not had one papercut yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using St. Ives lotion for sometime now.  I know I like the brand, and can count on it, so I usually buy their body lotion and their face lotion.  I am happy with the smell, the feel and the design of the product.  No complaints, probably have a customer for life here!</li>
            <li> One of four from the same company but with different ingrediants. I purchased each to try out for dry skin.  Not my favorite but it does have a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it absorbs fast with no greasy feeling, has a light natural scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it gentle enough to even use on my face which is uber sensitive. The cost for the amount you get is unbelievable for such a quality product, enabling me to have bottles at home and at the office. I always use it after washing my hands and my nails always look healthy and naturally white on the tips, with smooth cuticles. I&#x27;ve tried other St Ives lotions but they can be greasy or have a really strong smell, this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It is a grear produciton. After I used it every time, I feel I refresh myself. So cheap for quality.</li>
            <li> It baffles me as to how St. Ives can, in good conscience, apply the label \\&quot;Fast Absorbing Non Greasy\\&quot; to this product. I suppose the length of time it requires to absorb may be fast relative to man&#x27;s descent from the apes, but Non Greasy pretty implicitly states that your hands won&#x27;t leave awful grease marks on everything you touch. Sadly, they do. This is the worst hand cream I&#x27;ve used in some time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it did not take well to this, I broke out and it didn&#x27;t help moisturize well...</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! Doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy icky coating or anything and it smells nice but not overbearing. Just as good as any of the department store stuff. Love this!</li>
            <li> I always prefer St.Ives because many of their products do not contain animal ingredients or harmful chemicals. This is a wonderful everyday hand and body lotion. It will prevent dryness from reoccurring even if you don&#x27;t use it for a day or two. The formula seems very mild. The scent is almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li> I borrowed this lotion from a friend while traveling and I instantly fell in love with the scent, which is light and pleasant. It goes on easy, absorbs quickly, and hydrates my skin. Perfect for any season and the subscribe &amp; save price is hard to beat. I&#x27;ve tried many all natural ingredients lotions and this is just as good as or better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Body Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was  looking for body wash but got lotion. Since it was not what we needed, I ate the cost.</li>
            <li> I use all the St. Ives lotlions because they not only make my skin feel good they do no leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Gentle, excellent body lotion.  Using it for years.</li>
            <li> This lotion I use from long time ago,my mon introduce for me and I like the smell very much,the price is good too!</li>
            <li> Keeps my body soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I Love This Lotion Since The First Time I Test It At My Local Pharmacy. The Scent Just Gets Me Right Into It, The Texture Makes It Easy To Control The Amount And It&#x27;s Non-Greasy! It Does A Great Job In Keeping My Skin Moisturized For Hours After Application (Though I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Applying It), But Its Scent Also Keeps Me Fresh And Awake During Working Hours Infront Of My Lappy &amp; Very Relaxing For My Bedtime. Simply Put, I Love It All The Way (:</li>
            <li> For me, this is the best product for dry skin and I love it.  It leaves my skin well moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> St. Ive&#x27;s brand is a family favorite. We use almost all their products and once you get used to them it&#x27;s hard to use anything else. This is a wonderful light lotion. Absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li> This brand has been my favorite for years; hydrates, silky texture, neither too thick or thin, with a &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; fragrance.</li>
            <li> When the colder weather hits, my hands begin to get dry and cracked. I&#x27;ve been looking for a great lotion to apply after hand washing. This lotion is great - it actually does its job. So many lotions ,once dry, seem to have disappeared and have no effect. I love this stuff and apply it to my whole body after showering and put a little on my hands after each hand washing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Makes skin smooth n hydrated! My whole family uses it n everyone loves it. We will buy again! Strongly recommend it if u dont like strong smell moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dry feet and patches on elbows.  Applied daily and after 10 days or so, I am baby bottom smooth and moisturized.  Worth its weight in gold, I say!</li>
            <li> I do not like the way this stuff smells. It&#x27;s really strong and sticks with you throughout the day. I tried dropping lavender into it, but I obviously haven&#x27;t been putting in enough. I also don&#x27;t really feel it has been keeping my skin hydrated as much as I expected. I have really dry skin, though. I also feel like since I&#x27;ve been using it I&#x27;ve been getting more of those bumps on my legs like a lot of people have on their arms.</li>
            <li> And really affordable too! I&#x27;m surprised to have such an affordable product which works this well. St Ives really did a good one!</li>
            <li> one needs just a little on the hands to keep them moist, this may be a body lotion, but great for hands too.Mom loves the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives Vitamin E lotion for over 15 years and I love it... well loved it.  I just got my first container of the newly designed lotion and it&#x27;s causing me to have an allergic reaction!  I have pumps of both the old and new formula&#x27;s in front of me, it&#x27;s very different.  The new formula has extra added perfume, which for someone like me that can&#x27;t go within 3 stores of a Bath &amp; Body works without sneezing, ruins the lotion for me.  The lotions formula is almost unrecognizable from what it used to be, it&#x27;s very sad, they built their reputation on being one way and now feel the need to change that for the worse.  So long St. Ives, I guess it&#x27;s time to find a new lotion.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, but I&#x27;ve ordered St Ives twice from Amazon and have gotten a defective pump each time.  NBD, as we usually end up transferring some or all of it to another container anyway, but I&#x27;m wondering if this is where St Ives unloads its defective bottles.</li>
            <li> I use this daily.  It really hydrates your skin.  For the price and quality,  this is a really great value lotion.</li>
            <li> awesome buy love it you will not be disappointed by  purchasing this product a really thick and moisturizing lotion which will get rid of your dry skin, the scent is nice and mild , the size is very generous.</li>
            <li> Never had any problems with St. Ives lotions in the past, but this one is ridiculously thick that it&#x27;s a struggle to pump it out of the bottle.  You end up having to unscrew the cap with the pump mechanism and holding the bottle upside down and smacking it against your palm to get the lotion out.  And the lotion is just too thick for my liking.  So, I definitely can&#x27;t recommend this unless you like struggling with the pump bottle to get the lotion out and have the time for it!</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion.  It&#x27;s nice &amp; thick but not greasy which makes me feel like it is really hydrating my skin.  I use it after I get out of the shower and it absorbs quickly into my skin (doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feel).  I like the St. Ives brand and was happy to find such a big bottle for such a good price.</li>
            <li> My Niece and her two daughters are thrilled their Christmas surprise. Amazon&#x27;s customer service helped me with this deliverly by 12/24/2012 Christmas eve&#x27; A family with no hope for the holiday are so happy today.&lt;br /&gt;I love St Ives products myself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and it arrived in the specified time, so I recommend it to anyone who knows what they are buying.&lt;br /&gt;thanks God bless</li>
            <li> It works and smells real nice!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and this is so soft and smooth, and it really hydrates well. I will use nothing else. great price too</li>
            <li> Have been a fan of these body lotions for so many years now!  They all work the same - great texture,very hydrating, easy to use package, non-greasy.  I really like the smell on this one.&lt;br /&gt;As the lotions all have very different odors, it might make sense to check them out at traditional retail stores to see if you like them before ordering online. (Just be discreet opening the bottle and smelling, of course!).  Some odors might not work well with your perfume, etc. etc. But the lotions themselves are really great products.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal St Ives consumer and this price matched or was actually cheaper compared to the real store</li>
            <li> Not smelly and great to rub out scars. The vitamin E is to rub out scars. No odor and rub it in well for the first year to minimize scarring.</li>
