            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This is a good product though beware.</li>
            <li>This mascara is excellent, and would definately buy the full size product.</li>
            <li>I have really been impressed with the It Cosmetics I have purchased.</li>
            <li>This eye shadow goes on very easily.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>your money ladies, stick with your favorite brand that you can pick up at Walmart.</li>
            <li>You wont find a better lash lengthener than this one.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this before and love this product but this order was the travel size...</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for my bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>This product does wonders for your lashes and is easy to use</li>
            <li>It does work easily and covers all lashes.</li>
            <li>For a couple of dollars more, I could have purchased a full size tube.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it when I first got it</li>
            <li>Love this mascara, makes it look like I have full lashes.</li>
            <li>The actual large size product was wonderful when I had it</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey for something that appeared to me to be more along the lines of a sample size.</li>
            <li>I tried 5 other top rated mascaras and this was by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is a new brush configuration and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This just gave the oz which I confess I did not know the exact number of ounces in a full size tube of mascara.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are thin, but this makes me look awesome</li>
            <li>I would sure hope it would be the real deal, and didn&#x27;t think I had to figure out how much in ounces that this product was.</li>
            <li>It is probably just right.</li>
            <li>additionally, there isn&#x27;t very much product in the tube.</li>
            <li>Ball in wand broke off during first use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same high-quality product that I love but be aware that you are paying full price for this brand&#x27;s regular size mascara and receiving a trial size tube.</li>
            <li>If you have very fine/</li>
            <li>Hello Lashes is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointef</li>
            <li>This product really does make your lashes look longer and doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>not what any girl really wants...</li>
            <li>I wanted a mascara with all healthy ingredients and that would go on with absolutely no clumping.</li>
            <li>The travel size applicator is difficult to use, but the product is really good!</li>
            <li>It doesnt make them too full or too cluttered if you like a more defined look and not over dramatic w/ too much volume.  </li>
            <li>Other ads state full size or travel size, etc.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is rich and long lasting.</li>
            <li>got some helpful application tips, from watching the lady who developed this, on QVC.</li>
            <li>All is growing in thick and healthy now in part, I think, because of my use of IT cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Dried out quickly.</li>
            <li>barely there lashes like I do it</li>
            <li>and the it was really quick to dry up and not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Very small tube for full price</li>

            <li> This is a good product though beware. Check the size. It is much smaller than your typical mascara bottle. Pretty pricey for something that appeared to me to be more along the lines of a sample size. I do like the product as it does what it claims. It&#x27;s difficult to apply because of&lt;br /&gt;the round tip. If you have very fine/barely there lashes like I do it can everywhere but where you want it. Applying this takes some practice.&lt;br /&gt;I got some helpful application tips, from watching the lady who developed this, on QVC.</li>
            <li> Love the mascara, but very disappointed in this purchase.  The actual size of the mascara is very small.  Other ads state full size or travel size, etc.  This just gave the oz which I confess I did not know the exact number of ounces in a full size tube of mascara.  The price I paid was crazy expensive for what I received.  It looks like it may have been part of a kit.  For a couple of dollars more, I could have purchased a full size tube.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not ertain this is the 5-in-one you&#x27;d buy retail elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow goes on very easily. It does not irritate my eyes. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Cost the same as the product sold on QVC but half the size, horrific,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same high-quality product that I love but be aware that you are paying full price for this brand&#x27;s regular size mascara and receiving a trial size tube.</li>
            <li> The travel size applicator is difficult to use, but the product is really good! I have really been impressed with the It Cosmetics I have purchased. thank you!</li>
            <li> I chose this item because it helps nurture your lashes, however the brush itself is awkward  and difficult to use.  additionally, there isn&#x27;t very much product in the tube.</li>
            <li> Very small tube for full price i paid</li>
            <li> Every product I have tried has worked perfectly.  I use a serum, moisturizer, the best redness cover up EVER, perfect brow pencil ( lost all my hair during chemo for Bone Marrow Transplant including brows and lashes), Tightline eye lash serum.  All is growing in thick and healthy now in part, I think, because of my use of IT cosmetics. TRY THESE PRODUCTS YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPOINTED, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Hello Lashes is better than I expected.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say how disappointed I was in this product. :-(&lt;br /&gt;It did NOT deliver on all the hype.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money ladies, stick with your favorite brand that you can pick up at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I really liked it when I first got it and the it was really quick to dry up and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ball in wand broke off during first use.  So I&#x27;m unable to use. A total waste of my money. Very disappointef</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, makes it look like I have full lashes.</li>
            <li> You wont find a better lash lengthener than this one. My lashes are thin, but this makes me look awesome</li>
            <li> This product really does make your lashes look longer and doesn&#x27;t clump.  This is my second time to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Dried out quickly. It didn&#x27;t seperate well, flaked off my lashes into my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and love this product but this order was the travel size...not what any girl really wants... lol</li>
            <li> For !8.75 I would sure hope it would be the real deal, and didn&#x27;t think I had to figure out how much in ounces that this product was. Seems shifty to me…  The actual large size product was wonderful when I had it and luckily I only use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> I wanted a mascara with all healthy ingredients and that would go on with absolutely no clumping. I tried 5 other top rated mascaras and this was by far the best.</li>
            <li> This mascara is excellent, and would definately buy the full size product. This product does wonders for your lashes and is easy to use</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for my bottom lashes.  You can use all over.  It does work easily and covers all lashes. It doesnt make them too full or too cluttered if you like a more defined look and not over dramatic w/ too much volume.  It is probably just right. It says it is a treatment mascara but I&#x27;m not sure if I see a difference.</li>
            <li> could not  try product the tip of applicator broke off when opened.....</li>
            <li> This is a new brush configuration and I love it.  The mascara is rich and long lasting.</li>
