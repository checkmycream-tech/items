            <li>I love this Bundle Monster set !</li>
            <li>and it is AMAZING</li>
            <li>Worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>Packed nicely, arrived in time frame stated, product stamps nicely....</li>
            <li>Fun designs resulting in great stamps.  </li>
            <li>Namely, #&#x27;s 611, 614, 610, 607, the top image on 618 and 616.  </li>
            <li>I like the set for the most part.</li>
            <li>Love almost all plates.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more plates by bundle monster soon.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been collecting all of bundle monster plates, I love each and every plate</li>
            <li>Made out of metal and have a nice clean edge.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, nice plates!</li>
            <li>, they stamp fine all the time.</li>
            <li>Amazing images that stamp very well.</li>
            <li>But bundle monster sent replacement plates for free</li>
            <li>They are alittle smaller than I thought but work great.</li>
            <li>This bundle is so much fun, so many things to choose from.  </li>
            <li>A couple had some light scratches, but it didn&#x27;t detract away from the design I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Genuine bundle monster.</li>
            <li>but i know they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>absolute perfection!!!</li>
            <li>I do wish this had more floral choices, but overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not yet good enough at stamping to &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; the images yet,</li>
            <li>, I enjoy these very much</li>
            <li>All in all they are exactly what I expected and are just gorgeous and fun designs ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li>Beautiful but hard to use</li>
            <li>If you find that not all of your design is trasferring, first clean the plate really well with acetone.  </li>
            <li>This set contains a great selection of images, most of which stamp with ease, though the images with finer liners are difficult to transfer to the stamper.</li>
            <li>Basically the exact plates that I purchased this collection for</li>
            <li>They stamp well and the details come out crisply.</li>
            <li>Used these for the first time tonight the images were just as pictured and even came with a plastic coating to prevent scratched during shipping.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of image plates</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried bundle monster plates.</li>
            <li>First time stamper here...</li>
            <li>clear, clean, and perfection.</li>
            <li>The etching is crisp and transfers very well.  </li>
            <li>some of the plates have such fine lines that they don&#x27;t show up very well or at all (mainly the dinosaur one) but still it&#x27;s a steal compared to how much these go for at the mall!</li>
            <li>When you first pull off the blue protective film, clean the plates really well with acetone.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, fast shipping as described.</li>
            <li>I really like these images.</li>
            <li>There are just some of the plates and images that don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping. ..</li>
            <li>Most stampers say to rub it off, but with some of the designs with smaller lines you should definitely give it a minute.</li>
            <li>I received this 2012 collection by Bundle Monster few weeks ago and have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>so i feel some more negative reviews could have been because of many other factors like drying time, the type of polish, how you scrape the plates, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to stamping</li>
            <li>I find the first stamping doesn&#x27;t go well on a fresh plate, so I  just don&#x27;t waste my time.&lt;br /&gt;After doing that</li>
            <li>These plates are deeply etched, and Transfer the images very well.</li>
            <li>Then,  I usually paint, scrape, roll, and then clean everything off without actually rolling the first stamping on my nails.</li>
            <li>The size of images is bigger than their first collection from prior year, although I wish it was even slightly bigger to for my thumb.</li>
            <li>im surprised that some people have mixed reviews about bundle monster because they DO work</li>

            <li> these stamping plates are AMAZING! i love the patterns - now i just have to master using them and getting them on perfectly :)</li>
            <li> Amazing images that stamp very well. My only complaint and the reason for taking off a star is that some of the images are too small for longer nails. I&#x27;m not yet good enough at stamping to &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; the images yet, but I plan to learn.</li>
            <li> Some of the plates aren&#x27;t etched deep enough so the stamp doesn&#x27;t transfer.  I have at least 6 plates from this set that are completely useless.  Namely, #&#x27;s 611, 614, 610, 607, the top image on 618 and 616.  Basically the exact plates that I purchased this collection for and it makes me mad.  Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster does it again</li>
            <li> two of the plates were not picking up well. But bundle monster sent replacement plates for free then I found out it was my stamper that was not picking up well. All in all they are exactly what I expected and are just gorgeous and fun designs ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Very nice selection, all as shown, they all work well, I enjoy these very much</li>

            <li> Absolutely loved the plates. They are alittle smaller than I thought but work great. Made out of metal and have a nice clean edge.</li>
            <li> I just started to stamp and i am in love with doing it! I got this BM set and it is AMAZING im surprised that some people have mixed reviews about bundle monster because they DO work and they are great designs. I&#x27;m new to stamping so i can see how i could have messed up but with PRACTICE you get the hang of it. There are a lot of other variables that could mess up the process not just the plates so i feel some more negative reviews could have been because of many other factors like drying time, the type of polish, how you scrape the plates, etc. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with these plates and i absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> 2 day shipping and it arrived in great shape. The stamps worked great!!! Some of them didn&#x27;t turn out the greatest but some of them were awesome! This is a great buy for a great price!</li>
            <li> Images were very small and some don&#x27;t hold and release enough polish to imprint a design at all. I would say one third of each plate is useless but for the money it was okay.</li>
            <li> I really like these images. They stamp well and the details come out crisply.</li>
            <li> I like the set for the most part. There are just some of the plates and images that don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I love all the bundle monster plates! They are great and my favorite art supply!</li>
            <li> great worth the price am very happy with the plates</li>
            <li> Double on plate 20 missing plate 19.</li>
            <li> Used these for the first time tonight the images were just as pictured and even came with a plastic coating to prevent scratched during shipping. Worked amazingly. One tip leave the polish to sit for a minute or so before scraping it off so it gets into all areas of the image you&#x27;re wishing to stamp. Most stampers say to rub it off, but with some of the designs with smaller lines you should definitely give it a minute.</li>
            <li> These are the stamping plates that I use all the time. I stamp over gel nail polish with konad stamping polish, Essie polish, or Sallie Hanson insta-dri polish. When you first pull off the blue protective film, clean the plates really well with acetone. Then,  I usually paint, scrape, roll, and then clean everything off without actually rolling the first stamping on my nails. I find the first stamping doesn&#x27;t go well on a fresh plate, so I  just don&#x27;t waste my time.&lt;br /&gt;After doing that, they stamp fine all the time. I have found at least one image in every stamper bundle that has stamping issues. I just don&#x27;t use that stamp. These plates have intricate designs that transfer well.  If you find that not all of your design is trasferring, first clean the plate really well with acetone.  All that built-up dried polish affects the stamp. There are lots of good videos on stamping troubleshooting,  too, if you are having trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I stamp with a konad stamper, and scrape with an old credit card or empty gift cards. Metal scrapers will damage the plates.</li>
            <li> This bundle is so much fun, so many things to choose from.  Great time doing my nails, or a friends!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried these yet, but I will update about the transfer of these Images. Lots of designs to choose from and images look clear without a lot of tiny details, which I&#x27;ve found are hard to transfer.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t get the design shown in the picture.  it doesn&#x27;t cover the entire nail</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to transfer well for me. But 8m probably doing something wrong...</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! This is my first set of image plates and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I received this 2012 collection by Bundle Monster few weeks ago and have enjoyed using it. Love almost all plates.  The etching is crisp and transfers very well.  The size of images is bigger than their first collection from prior year, although I wish it was even slightly bigger to for my thumb.</li>
            <li> Awesome selection. Delivery came on time and the plates are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. ..great product. ..will shop again soon! !</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried bundle monster plates. These plates are deeply etched, and Transfer the images very well. I will be ordering more plates by bundle monster soon.</li>
            <li> First time stamper here... and I&#x27;m wondering where stamping plates have been all my life?? I love these. The etchings are well done and the images transfer well. My only complaint is that I spent 2 days scouring amazon to decide which set to get as my first set. I do wish this had more floral choices, but overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Fun designs resulting in great stamps.  A couple had some light scratches, but it didn&#x27;t detract away from the design I wanted.  NICE addition to my plate collection!</li>
            <li> Love these stamping plates! Great item! Great seller!</li>
            <li> Packed nicely, arrived in time frame stated, product stamps nicely....great variety of designs in bundle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been collecting all of bundle monster plates, I love each and every plate and I will continue buying more, they have great quality, beautiful designs and a great price.</li>
            <li> Genuine bundle monster. Excellent quality plates. Great selection. Well worth the money, because you&#x27;re getting the best. I&#x27;ll definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Great deal but some of the plates have such fine lines that they don&#x27;t show up very well or at all (mainly the dinosaur one) but still it&#x27;s a steal compared to how much these go for at the mall!</li>
            <li> absolute perfection!!! throw all your stamping plates away, and buy these! clear, clean, and perfection. very creative assortment as well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful plates, i haven&#x27;t used them yet but i know they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but hard to use</li>
            <li> I love this Bundle Monster set !</li>
            <li> I love them !! Great quality</li>
