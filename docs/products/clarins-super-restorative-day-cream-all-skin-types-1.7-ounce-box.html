            <li>Lovely texture and no annoying fragrance.</li>
            <li>The price was right!!</li>
            <li>Used together with the double serum this cream is great.</li>
            <li>it is light and smooth and not greasy wears well under make up.</li>
            <li>Gives you smooth skin and reduces lines.  </li>
            <li>It is the original product as we would buy in any store.     </li>
            <li>It adds a special glow to my face.</li>
            <li>What I got was some pink goop that looked like it was from the dollar store and did not smell very nice.  </li>
            <li>I adore Clarins Super Restorative skin care line.</li>
            <li>a year, maybe 2.5 jars, but for the price the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>Pricey , but worth the money.</li>
            <li>I saw result right away.</li>
            <li>The day cream goes very fast.  </li>
            <li>This product smells heavenly and keeps my skin softer throughout the whole day!</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR TWO WEEKS AND DO REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li>The jar and box looked real, but the product absolutely was not!  </li>
            <li>and although it does cost a bit more than others, I find that a bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It should be a thick white cream with a very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>IF you get the real thing and a jar intended for commerical purchase.</li>
            <li>you do get the real thing</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this versus the sunscreen version</li>
            <li>The consistency of the night cream is much thicker and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I switched to the Clarins formula for dryer skin and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>open it immediately and if it does not look right, either have a Clarins expert check it or return it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told I look younger than my years, or my skin does, and I believe it&#x27;s mostly genes and simple routine for cleansing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I hope that it has kept me young looking!!</li>
            <li>Item was received sealed as all new products.</li>
            <li>This is not our first purchase from this dealer and not the last</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a fantastic product and the only one I can use daily.</li>
            <li>When told I needed to switch moisturizers to one for mature skin, I tried Clarins.  </li>
            <li>Have used for 10 years (I&#x27;m REALLY mature now)</li>
            <li>You also won&#x27;t run out unexpectenly since you can see how much cream is left.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the genuine product, but I ordered some from an Amazon seller and it was FAKE!  </li>
            <li>(actually, bobbi brown has a moisturizer I used to use before I was 30 that worked, but stopped working as my skin got older and drier)  </li>
            <li>but the smell is barely masked.</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Not bad, just not exceptional.</li>

            <li> I took the product to the Clarins counter at a department store not far from me</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> In any event not worth the price to me.  </li>
            <li> It cost less because there is no box and the product is meant to be used by store as demo.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was past the 30-day return window because I trusted that it was real and waited until my other supply ran out.....</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was thrilled to find a product that didn&#x27;t make me break out in awful rashes and was creamy enough to moisturize my skin (I use it day and night as even the night cream is too oily and thick and makes me break out)  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money I lost!</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dried out by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t come in a box and is not tightly sealed ,you either have a tetster or a fake.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS SOFTER AND MY WRINKLES LESS NOTICEABLE!</li>
            <li> Sadly there are sellers on amazon who are selling fakes AND who are selling testers.</li>
            <li> This cream has an awful fragrance that does not dissipate over time.</li>

            <li> WATCH OUT who you buy from, especially when the prices are so favorable!  I LOVE the genuine product, but I ordered some from an Amazon seller and it was FAKE!  It should be a thick white cream with a very pleasant smell.  What I got was some pink goop that looked like it was from the dollar store and did not smell very nice.  The jar and box looked real, but the product absolutely was not!  I took the product to the Clarins counter at a department store not far from me and she said there is no way that is a Clarins product. Sadly, I was past the 30-day return window because I trusted that it was real and waited until my other supply ran out.....&lt;br /&gt;Best advice:  open it immediately and if it does not look right, either have a Clarins expert check it or return it!  Not worth the money I lost!</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer after receiving a sample from Nordstrom. This product smells heavenly and keeps my skin softer throughout the whole day! A bonus: my age spots seem a lot lighter! Who knew?!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many expensive and inexpensive creams for my sensitive/dry skin and this is the only one that I&#x27;m not allergic to!  (actually, bobbi brown has a moisturizer I used to use before I was 30 that worked, but stopped working as my skin got older and drier)  Anyway, I was thrilled to find a product that didn&#x27;t make me break out in awful rashes and was creamy enough to moisturize my skin (I use it day and night as even the night cream is too oily and thick and makes me break out)  The only downside is that it has a strong fragrance and is expensive. Overall, it&#x27;s a fantastic product and the only one I can use daily.</li>
            <li> Item was received sealed as all new products. It cost less because there is no box and the product is meant to be used by store as demo. It is the original product as we would buy in any store.     This is not our first purchase from this dealer and not the last</li>
            <li> Used together with the double serum this cream is great. It has a very  nice fragrance, which you rarely find in a  face cream.  My skin tone evened out and the wrinkles softened nicely.  :)</li>
            <li> I use this product for the day and I use the night cream too. I&#x27;ve  used these products for years. I believe it keeps my face and neck area in good condition</li>
            <li> Skins feel great.  My foundation goes on very smooth and stays looking good all day.  I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I always use it because of the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it so the 5 star rating</li>
            <li> This cream has an awful fragrance that does not dissipate over time. I catch whiffs of it all day. I tried mixing a drop of perfume oil into it but the smell is barely masked.</li>
            <li> 5 stars IF you get the real thing and a jar intended for commerical purchase. Sadly there are sellers on amazon who are selling fakes AND who are selling testers. If it doesn&#x27;t come in a box and is not tightly sealed ,you either have a tetster or a fake. I have encountered this TWICE and am no longer ordering this from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;If you do get the real thing it is WONDERFUL - it is light and smooth and not greasy wears well under make up. I use it with Clarins SPF40 sunblock for extra protection.</li>
            <li> When told I needed to switch moisturizers to one for mature skin, I tried Clarins.  Have used for 10 years (I&#x27;m REALLY mature now) and although it does cost a bit more than others, I find that a bit goes a long way.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation, blessed with pretty good fair skin, and I use this mornings and at night.  I&#x27;m told I look younger than my years, or my skin does, and I believe it&#x27;s mostly genes and simple routine for cleansing and moisturizing.  I use about 2 jars (1.7 oz ea) a year, maybe 2.5 jars, but for the price the results are worth it.  It&#x27;s the only product that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.  I use the one without SPF; if I need sun block I add that as needs be.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this versus the sunscreen version so I wear it during the winter and the sunscreened one after that season. I hope that it has kept me young looking!!</li>
            <li> My review is the same for all Clarins products.  Do not expect miracles.  The day cream goes very fast.  The consistency of the night cream is much thicker and lasts longer.  In any event not worth the price to me.  Not bad, just not exceptional.</li>
            <li> I like the price of Clarins through Amazon!  It is an excellent product that delivers beautiful skin!  It has a light feel and gives a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> I have moved through the stages of Clarins in the last 25 years of use.  Great product.  I am not allergic to it.</li>
            <li> Great for mature skin that needs more attention. Use in the morning to moisturize your skin all day. Last a while and you don&#x27;t need much. The jar is easier to work with and you can get the last drop out without losing product like the pump bottles. You also won&#x27;t run out unexpectenly since you can see how much cream is left. Not cheap, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I switched to the Clarins formula for dryer skin and it really makes a difference.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dried out by the end of the day.  It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> The price was right!!</li>
            <li> Use it all the time great cream</li>
            <li> AWESOME! LOVE THIS CREAM! I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR TWO WEEKS AND DO REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE! MY SKIN IS SOFTER AND MY WRINKLES LESS NOTICEABLE! WILL BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!</li>
            <li> This is the best day cream on the market!  I love the way it makes my skin feel.  It adds a special glow to my face.</li>
            <li> I adore Clarins Super Restorative skin care line. My skin is the proof that these products reallywork. They&#x27;re expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I saw result right away. I am a fan of all Clarins products.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Gives you smooth skin and reduces lines.  I use it daily and would definitely buy it again.  Clarins are good products.</li>
            <li> good value. Service excellent</li>
            <li> Lovely texture and no annoying fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great product. Pricey , but worth the money.</li>
