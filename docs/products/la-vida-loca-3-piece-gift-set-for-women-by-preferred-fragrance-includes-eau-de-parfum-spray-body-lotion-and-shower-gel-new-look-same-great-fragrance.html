            <li>and she was very happy with the gift.  </li>
            <li>Smells awesome!</li>
            <li>and she was very pleased!</li>
            <li>It would make a great gift, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it for myself again.</li>
            <li>is a good perfume</li>
            <li>its a good buy.</li>
            <li>My hubby says it smells good though.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>but I had to go look at USPS because a signature required, otherwise all good.</li>
            <li>But if you like Juicy but don&#x27;t want to spend the money, this is a good solution.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it, just what she wanted.</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT</li>
            <li>and I really liked the people that he loved</li>
            <li>cheap and good quality!</li>
            <li>Amazon basically said I&#x27;m not allowed to return it because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;hazardous</li>
            <li>Great Product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Better price than in the stores.</li>
            <li>Wish my eyesight was better.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of Viva La Juicy in my Birchbox and fell in love with the sent.</li>
            <li>The perfume was leaking when I got it and smelled CHEAP!</li>
            <li>It smells ok though.</li>
            <li>MOSTLY BIRTHDAYS</li>
            <li>Impressed with the low price and free shipping, I ordered without reading, this is not officially a VIVA LA JUICY COUTURE PERFUME.  </li>
            <li>I was getting a great deal, but it was definitely too good to be true.</li>
            <li>So, if you are a huge fan of Viva La Juicy, you are probably better off just buying a bottle of it instead of trying to find something like it.</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY advise against buying this product.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price and smells pretty nice :)</li>
            <li>They can send hazardous and flammable material to their customers houses and let their customers spray this hazardous material on their bare skin</li>
            <li>I was a fool to think the actual perfume was this cheap lol</li>
            <li>Great gift for your teen!</li>
            <li>Delivery was prompt and the product waspacakged securely to protect it from damage.</li>
            <li>Shame on me, but hope my review may make a difference for someone else who may think they&#x27;re ordering genuine article.  </li>
            <li>I realized it is a cheap DUPE of Viva La Juicy.</li>
            <li>PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY GET THIS FOR ANY KIND OF EVENTS</li>
            <li>would recommend this not only for the great sent but also because it arrives quickly.</li>
            <li>to look like the original.</li>
            <li>i shoulda jus bought original juicy</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and the packaging is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Before my sample ran out I wanted to get a full size.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and product are good, just a very different, distinct smell from the original product.</li>
            <li>so I bought it quickly worrying that if I didn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t get the product before it was sold out.</li>
            <li>The lotion isn&#x27;t that fragrant, but I have enjoyed the perfume so far and the shower gel.</li>
            <li>While Viva la Juicy smells young, fresh, and sexy, this supposed impression</li>
            <li>If you are a &amp;#34;Juicy and only Juicy&amp;#34; kind of fan this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>And last but not least it smells so good.</li>
            <li>The product,for it&#x27;s price, is a good alternative to Viva La Juicy if you want to spend less than $20.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off spending a little more on the REAL THING!</li>
            <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t have much scent but the spray smells just like Viva La Juicy!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s package was so pretty.</li>
            <li>I for one think that if Amazon is willing to send something to my house through UPS that they should be willing to receive it themselves as a return.</li>
            <li>The product came exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>The colors and the packaging design is exact copy of Viva La Juicy and that is probably their purpose.</li>
            <li>Therefore no one should expect it to smell like or look like the real thing!</li>
            <li>bought this set without realizing it wasn&#x27;t the real deal, but decided that since most knock off sents smell the same I would give it a whirl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little set.</li>
            <li>Smells nothing like the real thing.</li>
            <li>thanks for everything</li>
            <li>I was very unsatisfied with this product, it is a knock off that was made.</li>
            <li>Fast deivery.</li>
            <li>I got it in and the sent is very close to the Viva La Juicy (smelling both straight from the bottles), but after wearing it for a few minutes I realized it had a sent all its own</li>
            <li>THANKS SO MUCH Preferred Fragrance Inc</li>
            <li>In fact, I advise against buying any kind of perfume, cologne, or substance that can be considered flammable from Amazon because you will be stuck with it since you&#x27;re unable to return it because apparently it&#x27;s okay for them to take your money and send what they call \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; materials to your house</li>
            <li>you can buy Viva La Juicy at other stores for a better price &amp; it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>yet I can&#x27;t send that same material they thought was okay to send to me, back to them!</li>
            <li>,it CLEARLY STATES THAT THIS IS NOT A JUICY COTURE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>No it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same smell as Viva La Juicy however</li>
            <li>So after realizing that it wasn&#x27;t what she wanted and didn&#x27;t even smell close to what she wanted I went on Amazon to return it and buy the real thing and low and behold I was surprised by this load of bull!    </li>
            <li>I have decided that I would rather spend the extra $50 to get the real thing.  </li>
            <li>If your expecting the real thing,spend the extra money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first it arrived sooner then expected when I opened the shipping box my eyes lit up</li>
            <li>Also, the lotion just smells like regular lotion you&#x27;d get at any drug store, but other than that it&#x27;s very subtle and nice.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve smelled the actual viva la juicy, but for some reason, I thought it would be fruitier than it is.</li>
            <li> a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are looking for an inexpensive gift that isn&#x27;t the typical generic store brand lavender/vanilla perfume/shower gel/lotion gift sets.</li>
            <li> They are attempting to confuse and lie to people and then deny them refunds once they realize they have ordered the wrong thing or that the perfume they ordered expecting it to at least smell similar to what it says it imitates does not even smell close to the same as the original.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> wasnt wat i expected...</li>
            <li> My expected delivery date was July 8th</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an imitation.</li>
            <li> obviously just a BS excuse to keep you from returning it and getting your money back once you realize that it can&#x27;t even be called a bad imitation because it&#x27;s not even close enough to BE an imitation.</li>
            <li> It was very embarrassing to get that as a gift and then be told its wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a blatant double standard and</li>
            <li> that perfume is still half way</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving a 4 star rating because being the wrong product sure isn&#x27;t a reason to give something a bad review</li>
            <li> But as soon as I saw the poor packaging</li>
            <li> an impression is false advertising at</li>
            <li> just plain STINKS!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect match to Juicy</li>
            <li> but it don&#x27;t it stinks.</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed :/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it unless you wanna spend your money on useless crap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have the time to return the product, very unhappy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worst.</li>
            <li> It is disgusting.</li>
            <li> Worst experience ever!</li>
            <li> Worst experience ever!</li>
            <li> Shocking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I will buy this again.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t have much scent but the spray smells just like Viva La Juicy!</li>
            <li> Smells NOTHING like Viva la juicy, which it said it did.  I threw it all away.  The only thing that smelt alright was the shower gel.  I will never buy this product again, and recommend that no one else does either.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Orders this because I heard mixed reviews about it and me I have to always see for myself. first it arrived sooner then expected when I opened the shipping box my eyes lit up it&#x27;s package was so pretty. And last but not least it smells so good. Ill be ordering more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Great Product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> is a good perfume and I really liked the people that he loved Give the gift I recommend it to my family and friends</li>
            <li> I had been looking for Viva La Juicy perfume/lotion gift set, and I purchased this thinking I was getting a great deal, but it was definitely too good to be true. When it arrived, I was impressed with the size of the items, but the minute I sprayed it, I knew something was wrong, and that&#x27;s when I realized I had purchased the wrong product. I&#x27;m giving a 4 star rating because being the wrong product sure isn&#x27;t a reason to give something a bad review, that was my mistake. The product,for it&#x27;s price, is a good alternative to Viva La Juicy if you want to spend less than $20. The lotion isn&#x27;t that fragrant, but I have enjoyed the perfume so far and the shower gel. I would recommend this product if you are looking for an inexpensive gift that isn&#x27;t the typical generic store brand lavender/vanilla perfume/shower gel/lotion gift sets.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this product!  I got it for one of her gifts for her birthday and she was very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great gift for your teen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that if I could have given this product zero stars I would have! So I bought this for my son&#x27;s girlfriend who was asking for Viva la Juicy perfume for Christmas. I typed in Viva la Juicy in the Amazon search and this product popped up. It was almost out of stock so I bought it quickly worrying that if I didn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t get the product before it was sold out. Only after buying it did I take the time to read the description and the reviews and boy do I wish I had read them beforehand! Did not realize this was a knock off because I am unfamiliar with the Juicy brand. I figured hopefully if it smelled close enough to the same that she would like it though. So I gave it to her this morning and she smelled it and according to her it smells nothing like Viva la Juicy and the fact that they even say it&#x27;s an impression is false advertising at it&#x27;s worst. While Viva la Juicy smells young, fresh, and sexy, this supposed impression just plain STINKS! It is disgusting. So after realizing that it wasn&#x27;t what she wanted and didn&#x27;t even smell close to what she wanted I went on Amazon to return it and buy the real thing and low and behold I was surprised by this load of bull!    [...]  [...]  [...]  [...]  [...]    I&#x27;ve posted it three different ways as I&#x27;m unsure whether I can include HTML Hyperlinks or Forum Language in this post. If it doesn&#x27;t support either you can copy the link into your browser&#x27;s address bar. It is basically a picture of the screen I was presented with when I went to return the item. Amazon basically said I&#x27;m not allowed to return it because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot; and it&#x27;s \\&quot;flammable\\&quot;. They can send hazardous and flammable material to their customers houses and let their customers spray this hazardous material on their bare skin yet I can&#x27;t send that same material they thought was okay to send to me, back to them! They said in the message that I should just dispose of it properly. Well if I throw it away are they going to refundmy money? OF COURSE NOT! Buyer beware! THIS ITEM IS A SCAM! Smells nothing like the real thing. Amazon should not have this show up when you search for Viva la Juicy on their site. They are attempting to confuse and lie to people and then deny them refunds once they realize they have ordered the wrong thing or that the perfume they ordered expecting it to at least smell similar to what it says it imitates does not even smell close to the same as the original. I STRONGLY advise against buying this product. In fact, I advise against buying any kind of perfume, cologne, or substance that can be considered flammable from Amazon because you will be stuck with it since you&#x27;re unable to return it because apparently it&#x27;s okay for them to take your money and send what they call \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; materials to your house but if you want your money back that&#x27;s a no-go because while they don&#x27;t care if they are putting you in danger they will not let you put them in danger. I for one think that if Amazon is willing to send something to my house through UPS that they should be willing to receive it themselves as a return. It&#x27;s a blatant double standard and obviously just a BS excuse to keep you from returning it and getting your money back once you realize that it can&#x27;t even be called a bad imitation because it&#x27;s not even close enough to BE an imitation. See if I buy anything off Amazon ever again! Worst experience ever! Amazon just ruined my Christmas!!!ing off Amazon ever again! Worst experience ever! Amazon just ruined my Christmas!!!</li>
            <li> cheap and good quality! its a good buy. a lil goes a long way. that perfume is still half way and i bought it a year ago!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law for christmas and I&#x27;ve smelt it and I personally do not like it. My hubby says it smells good though. I thought the actual products would be bigger but it is a gift set.</li>
            <li> good product but I had to go look at USPS because a signature required, otherwise all good. thanks for everything</li>
            <li> For the trade off between price and quality, I give price the edge on this one.  It&#x27;s not a perfect match to Juicy but it&#x27;s close. If you are a &amp;#34;Juicy and only Juicy&amp;#34; kind of fan this may not be for you.  But if you like Juicy but don&#x27;t want to spend the money, this is a good solution.</li>
            <li> Product was misleading! I was very unsatisfied with this product, it is a knock off that was made. to look like the original. It was very embarrassing to get that as a gift and then be told its wrong. I don&#x27;t even have the time to return the product, very unhappy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve smelled the actual viva la juicy, but for some reason, I thought it would be fruitier than it is. Also, the lotion just smells like regular lotion you&#x27;d get at any drug store, but other than that it&#x27;s very subtle and nice. It shipped quickly and the packaging is fantastic. It would make a great gift, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it for myself again.</li>
            <li> Product came as advertised. My daughter loved it, just what she wanted. Fast deivery. Better price than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Wish my eyesight was better.  I saw this &amp;#34;great deal&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t look into it closely enough.  I did not realize this was knock-off stuff until it arrived and I opened it.  Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter, she loves this perfume.  The product came exactly as advertised and she was very happy with the gift.  Delivery was prompt and the product waspacakged securely to protect it from damage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as Viva La Juicy. i got this from another place thinking it would smell the same but it don&#x27;t it stinks. you can buy Viva La Juicy at other stores for a better price &amp; it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> Impressed with the low price and free shipping, I ordered without reading, this is not officially a VIVA LA JUICY COUTURE PERFUME.  Shame on me, but hope my review may make a difference for someone else who may think they&#x27;re ordering genuine article.  The packaging and product are good, just a very different, distinct smell from the original product.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Viva La Juicy in my Birchbox and fell in love with the sent. Before my sample ran out I wanted to get a full size.  I was not paying attention bought this set without realizing it wasn&#x27;t the real deal, but decided that since most knock off sents smell the same I would give it a whirl. I got it in and the sent is very close to the Viva La Juicy (smelling both straight from the bottles), but after wearing it for a few minutes I realized it had a sent all its own and I was not a fan.  I have decided that I would rather spend the extra $50 to get the real thing.  So, if you are a huge fan of Viva La Juicy, you are probably better off just buying a bottle of it instead of trying to find something like it.</li>
            <li> I wish I never bought this, now it is sitting in the back of my closet collecting dust. I am hoping to return it but have heard no feedback. Shocking.</li>
            <li> wasnt wat i expected...i was very disappointed :/ the ribbon fell off in my purse. very generic lookin...showergel n lotion smell like s***. i shoulda jus bought original juicy</li>
            <li> My Daughter loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I got this from my sister for Xmas gift. She thought she bought the actual Juicy Couture gift set. I thought so, too after opening my present. But as soon as I saw the poor packaging I realized it is a cheap DUPE of Viva La Juicy. It is quite misleading, I think. The colors and the packaging design is exact copy of Viva La Juicy and that is probably their purpose. The perfume was leaking when I got it and smelled CHEAP! Didn&#x27;t even open it and is still sitting in my closet. Don&#x27;t buy it unless you wanna spend your money on useless crap. You&#x27;d be better off spending a little more on the REAL THING!</li>
            <li> I bought this by mistake thinking it was the actual perfume but it&#x27;s an imitation. I was a fool to think the actual perfume was this cheap lol but this perfume does smell similar the only problem is that it last for like five minutes</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this was a knock off. It smells ok though.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! No it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same smell as Viva La Juicy however,it CLEARLY STATES THAT THIS IS NOT A JUICY COTURE PRODUCT! Therefore no one should expect it to smell like or look like the real thing! If your expecting the real thing,spend the extra money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this not only for the great sent but also because it arrives quickly. My expected delivery date was July 8th and I received it 4 days after I ordered it which was today *July 5th*!</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT AND SHE DID TOO.... PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY GET THIS FOR ANY KIND OF EVENTS MOSTLY BIRTHDAYS THANKS SO MUCH Preferred Fragrance Inc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little set. Not bad for the price and smells pretty nice :)</li>
