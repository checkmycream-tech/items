            <li>I also have many stones, clusters, and calcifications.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not sourced or processed from its native habitat of Italy.</li>

            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the suggested uses.</li>
            <li>Really love the essence of lemon.</li>
            <li>Great REAL lemon scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend :)))</li>
            <li>Has many uses from cleaning to a beauty aid.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the price and quality of this oil.</li>
            <li>This lemon essential oil is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>However, I have been using it on our skin and love it.  </li>
            <li>After trying a number of water enhancers, I&#x27;m finding I like the simplicity of a couple drops of this (as well as the peppermint oil I got at the same time) in my water the best.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would have given a five star if it was more thicker in consistency.</li>
            <li>But overall it is an excellent buy for your money.</li>
            <li>This is the best lemon essential oil ever.</li>
            <li>I just absolutely love both.  </li>
            <li>It is safe for consumption as well as cleaning, deodorizing.</li>

            <li>I have got to find more uses for this.</li>
            <li>Just lovely.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>- I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Very fresh and very clean!</li>
            <li>I love fresh lemon scent and this is it !!</li>
            <li>Super pleased with the value of this product!</li>
            <li>I put two drops into my water when drinking, 5 drops to hot bath, also use it in diffusers for great clean scent of lemons.</li>
            <li>this oil is okay but not as strong and therapeutic as the one that&#x27;s made with lemon rinds</li>
            <li>Nice way to lighten the mood rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very tasty good for you and helps your body be more alkaline than acidic which helps to fight off diseases.</li>
            <li>Its not so great for adding to water to drink as its not that lemony flavored but for cleaning and as far as the smell it is outstanding</li>
            <li>it is very true lemon.</li>
            <li>I bought this lemon oil to treat a beautiful little wall table that I received from a  good friend.  </li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried many oils but they either had unwanted chemicals or were pre-diluted, which meant I had to use a large amount of just to make it effective.</li>
            <li>This was an easy sale.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>EVERY  NIGHT,  IT  SEEMS  STRONG  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this fine product for 2 months now, and am very pleased to report that I&#x27;ve had no symptoms or infections, and haven&#x27;t felt any large stone movement whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>and it tasted fine.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells exceptional, shipping was fast, the bottle came packaged and secured properly, and it works great with my oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>The oil is so very strong and crisp smelling.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this lemon oil</li>
            <li>it has a fresh taste and refreshing lemon smell.</li>
            <li>Even better than organic fresh pressed lemon juice like Lakewood.</li>
            <li>Great smell, mixed with water and spray everywhere</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Just have caution, it is very powerful</li>
            <li>I have not used this very much, but recently I found a very good use for it.</li>
            <li>I originally Bought it to treat my dogs fleas.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure why I had ordered this product at first</li>
            <li>I also use it to clean up kitchen  and bathroom counter tops.</li>
            <li>And the dropper makes it easy to apply the right amount.</li>
            <li>I would buy again for sure, because it is so pure.</li>
            <li>I had been told that lemon oil straight from the bottle or lemon oil mixed with beeswax would make any wood piece look beautiful again.  </li>
            <li>Great product that I received faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the house fresh and pest free.  </li>
            <li>I mixed the lemon oil with beeswax and gave this table a good soaking.  </li>
            <li>When you open the bottle, the pure potent lemon aroma lets you know immediately that this oil is fresh, undiluted and obtained through superior methods.</li>
            <li>After my first bottle top didn&#x27;t fit right and leaked they sent me a new bottle asap!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure (so yeah it&#x27;s a bit more pricey but worth it).</li>
            <li>It smelled very fresh and clean, which is exactly what I wanted when choosing a lemon oil.</li>
            <li>The lemon makes the house smell fresh and clean also.</li>
            <li>; my home smells fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>Has a clean fresh taste as well.</li>
            <li>fresh  and clean...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve answered every question, responding quickly, politely, and compassionately.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff &amp; love the personal outreach/emails from the company giving tips on uses for this oil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t drink, but I can only imagine it would be awesome in a frozen mixed</li>
            <li>I use it in a non chemical bug repellant that I make and it mixes very nicely with other oils.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong and natural; a small amount fills my kitchen with a delicious aroma.</li>
            <li>I used it in a diffuser and it puts out a strong refreshing lemon scent which lasted several hours.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh lemon scent, smells very natural.</li>
            <li>The glass dropper is a great way to get just a little.</li>
            <li>The positive is the whole facility had a very fresh lemon scent all day!</li>
            <li>There are so many uses I urge you to check out these huge bottles of essential oils.</li>
            <li>so fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>but it is definitely a fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice big bottle and well worth it.</li>
            <li>I drink water almost exclusively, and on a rare occasion, a cup of tea.</li>
            <li>The wonderfully natural  fragrances of this lemon as well as the peppermint oil is  refreshing and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I also used some in my oil burner to make my house smell fresh.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised that I was able to strip paper off of a desk!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kitchen smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>I put a couple of drops in my dish washer and the kitchen smelled so fresh.</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I even put some drops in with my home made laundry detergent for a fresh lemony smell.  </li>
            <li>I also use lemon oil as my facial moisturizer (lemon oil, rose hip oil, grapefruit oil, jojoba oil, &amp; almond oil/coconut oil/sunflower oil/hemp oil, &amp; water).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge believer of quality essential oils, but when I went through my 10.00 (wholesale) 15mL bottle of Lemon oil in no time flat, I sought a more cost effective solution and found it with Eve Hansen.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and a few drops around the apartment makes it smell so fresh!</li>
            <li>I bought it for cosmetic reason but tried some of the other things that were recemended and it really works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it baking shortbread, and making hard candy with great success.</li>
            <li>Very much work my money.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely recommend it on &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; alone.  </li>
            <li>I do like this product, I have used for many different things.</li>
            <li>reviews mention it&#x27;s a much safer alternative to GooGone!)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking.</li>
            <li>I first used this product in my all purpose cleaner.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>best part is that it comes in a 4 ounce bottle for a low price so not only do you save money, but you also have enough oil to use in a variety of ways.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>I only got it for flavoring hot water but many uses.</li>
            <li>Have put some in hot water for a drink.  </li>
            <li>I like lemon in hot water.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Love it and use it daily!!</li>
            <li>Purchased this to add to hot water for morning drink</li>
            <li>The peppermint oil has digestive properties, and let me tell you, it works very well!</li>
            <li>I bought this very eager to try it!</li>
            <li>and I even put it in my hot water each day to help with digestion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rare moment when a new purchase brings a smile to your face.  </li>
            <li>I mixed some with water in a spray bottle for easy fresh smelling cleanup.</li>
            <li>It is like drinking pure, clear and clean water, with the freshness of lemon.</li>
            <li>quite nice aroma, useful for salad dressing and to fragrance house hold cleaning products and even body lotions and other personal skin oils, refreshing and clean and definitely a fully natural feel.</li>
            <li>It certainly helps with digestion too.</li>
            <li>Eve Hansen puts out very high quality well made products and the lemon oil</li>
            <li>fast shipping, dropped included.</li>
            <li>the product was delivered fast.</li>
            <li>so much for the follow up.</li>
            <li>I added too much once</li>
            <li>The advice was absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li>Very concentraded.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li>The tips on use of the oil was appreciated and helpful.</li>
            <li>Real lemon scent from the peels.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product and seller!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying lemons and really don&#x27;t like how oily it feels in the water or the flavor.  </li>
            <li>They are definitely more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The glass bottle and glass dropper really make the whole product .  </li>
            <li>There are many uses for the peppermint oil as well i.e. a spider and mouse repellent and a wonderful pet smell deodorizer.</li>
            <li>Eve Hansen is the only person I would recommend buying the available products from.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping and High Quality</li>
            <li>There are so many other uses.  </li>
            <li>This lemon oil seems exactly the same, only a lot more inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product gets 4 stars because it as not as potent as my other oil.</li>
            <li>Will order more &amp; other oils</li>
            <li>I have purchased other brand of lemon oils in the past but this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>I went from not sure why I decided to get this product to loving it.</li>
            <li>now it looks almost new!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended  for just having on hand.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Eve Hansen Lemon Oil.</li>
            <li>You only have to use a little, for it is very potent.  </li>
            <li>A weaker version to some other consumable lemon oils out there but volume and price easily overcomes this.</li>
            <li>not least, I ordered the Lemon Oil.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I get the same benefit as a fresh lemon.</li>
            <li>I love that there are no fillers or other ingredients at all; just pure lemon essential oil.</li>
            <li>and you need so little of this to make your water taste great  that this will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I was paying 10.00 for, and bears the exact same latin name.</li>
            <li>and he won&#x27;t come back ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>Not sure what it is good for, other than a body oil?  </li>
            <li>Pure smell of lemon and only lemon.</li>
            <li>So far my DH is the one using it.  </li>
            <li>But wow.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is wow</li>
            <li>As far as Eve Hansen?</li>
            <li>I bought a glass spray bottle to make the natural cleaner.</li>
            <li>Little more diluted than expected</li>
            <li>But I was surprised to see not a single one of the 50</li>
            <li>I add several drops of this lemon oil (and a drop of Eve Hansen peppermint oil) to every glass/cup (please use glass, ceramic, or stainless steel as essential oils can pull the toxins out of plastics with repetitive/prolonged use).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to make body scrubs, furniture polish &amp; general household spray cleaner.</li>
            <li>How can you explain to a young boy that he will not be getting anything for his birthday because a person did not care enough about their product being sold.</li>
            <li>I add a fresh squeezed lemon to my water everyday now with this lemon oil - just a few drops and it taste exactly the same.</li>
            <li>but I ended up putting a few drops into a glass of water for the first rehydrating drink in the morning.</li>
            <li>So this is also a large supply by even an above average users needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality, very careful packaging, also included a dropper.  </li>

            <li> Thank you Eve Hansen for prompt service and a top notch product.</li>

            <li> I also have many stones, clusters, and calcifications.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not sourced or processed from its native habitat of Italy.</li>
            <li> Lemon oil, simply the best.  </li>
            <li> Love stuff from Eve Hansen</li>
            <li> This company is so attentive!</li>
            <li> I love the size and will use for all of my cleaning needs.</li>

            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the suggested uses.</li>
            <li> Really love the essence of lemon.</li>
            <li> Great REAL lemon scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend :)))</li>
            <li> Has many uses from cleaning to a beauty aid.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the price and quality of this oil.</li>
            <li> This lemon essential oil is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> However, I have been using it on our skin and love it.  </li>
            <li> After trying a number of water enhancers, I&#x27;m finding I like the simplicity of a couple drops of this (as well as the peppermint oil I got at the same time) in my water the best.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I would have given a five star if it was more thicker in consistency.</li>
            <li> But overall it is an excellent buy for your money.</li>
            <li> This is the best lemon essential oil ever.</li>
            <li> I just absolutely love both.  </li>
            <li> It is safe for consumption as well as cleaning, deodorizing.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased that they emailed me with suggested usage tips/recipes.</li>
            <li> I have got to find more uses for this.</li>
            <li> Just lovely.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> - I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Very fresh and very clean!</li>
            <li> I love fresh lemon scent and this is it !!</li>
            <li> Super pleased with the value of this product!</li>
            <li> I put two drops into my water when drinking, 5 drops to hot bath, also use it in diffusers for great clean scent of lemons.</li>
            <li> this oil is okay but not as strong and therapeutic as the one that&#x27;s made with lemon rinds</li>
            <li> Nice way to lighten the mood rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very tasty good for you and helps your body be more alkaline than acidic which helps to fight off diseases.</li>
            <li> Its not so great for adding to water to drink as its not that lemony flavored but for cleaning and as far as the smell it is outstanding</li>
            <li> it is very true lemon.</li>
            <li> I bought this lemon oil to treat a beautiful little wall table that I received from a  good friend.  </li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried many oils but they either had unwanted chemicals or were pre-diluted, which meant I had to use a large amount of just to make it effective.</li>
            <li> This was an easy sale.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> EVERY  NIGHT,  IT  SEEMS  STRONG  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fine product for 2 months now, and am very pleased to report that I&#x27;ve had no symptoms or infections, and haven&#x27;t felt any large stone movement whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> and it tasted fine.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells exceptional, shipping was fast, the bottle came packaged and secured properly, and it works great with my oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> The oil is so very strong and crisp smelling.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this lemon oil</li>
            <li> it has a fresh taste and refreshing lemon smell.</li>
            <li> Even better than organic fresh pressed lemon juice like Lakewood.</li>
            <li> Great smell, mixed with water and spray everywhere</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Just have caution, it is very powerful</li>
            <li> I have not used this very much, but recently I found a very good use for it.</li>
            <li> I originally Bought it to treat my dogs fleas.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why I had ordered this product at first</li>
            <li> I also use it to clean up kitchen  and bathroom counter tops.</li>
            <li> And the dropper makes it easy to apply the right amount.</li>
            <li> I would buy again for sure, because it is so pure.</li>
            <li> I had been told that lemon oil straight from the bottle or lemon oil mixed with beeswax would make any wood piece look beautiful again.  </li>
            <li> Great product that I received faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the house fresh and pest free.  </li>
            <li> I mixed the lemon oil with beeswax and gave this table a good soaking.  </li>
            <li> When you open the bottle, the pure potent lemon aroma lets you know immediately that this oil is fresh, undiluted and obtained through superior methods.</li>
            <li> After my first bottle top didn&#x27;t fit right and leaked they sent me a new bottle asap!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure (so yeah it&#x27;s a bit more pricey but worth it).</li>
            <li> It smelled very fresh and clean, which is exactly what I wanted when choosing a lemon oil.</li>
            <li> The lemon makes the house smell fresh and clean also.</li>
            <li> ; my home smells fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Has a clean fresh taste as well.</li>
            <li> fresh  and clean...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve answered every question, responding quickly, politely, and compassionately.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff &amp; love the personal outreach/emails from the company giving tips on uses for this oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink, but I can only imagine it would be awesome in a frozen mixed</li>
            <li> I use it in a non chemical bug repellant that I make and it mixes very nicely with other oils.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong and natural; a small amount fills my kitchen with a delicious aroma.</li>
            <li> I used it in a diffuser and it puts out a strong refreshing lemon scent which lasted several hours.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh lemon scent, smells very natural.</li>
            <li> The glass dropper is a great way to get just a little.</li>
            <li> The positive is the whole facility had a very fresh lemon scent all day!</li>
            <li> There are so many uses I urge you to check out these huge bottles of essential oils.</li>
            <li> so fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> but it is definitely a fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice big bottle and well worth it.</li>
            <li> I drink water almost exclusively, and on a rare occasion, a cup of tea.</li>
            <li> The wonderfully natural  fragrances of this lemon as well as the peppermint oil is  refreshing and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I also used some in my oil burner to make my house smell fresh.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised that I was able to strip paper off of a desk!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kitchen smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops in my dish washer and the kitchen smelled so fresh.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I even put some drops in with my home made laundry detergent for a fresh lemony smell.  </li>
            <li> I also use lemon oil as my facial moisturizer (lemon oil, rose hip oil, grapefruit oil, jojoba oil, &amp; almond oil/coconut oil/sunflower oil/hemp oil, &amp; water).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge believer of quality essential oils, but when I went through my 10.00 (wholesale) 15mL bottle of Lemon oil in no time flat, I sought a more cost effective solution and found it with Eve Hansen.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and a few drops around the apartment makes it smell so fresh!</li>
            <li> I bought it for cosmetic reason but tried some of the other things that were recemended and it really works great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it baking shortbread, and making hard candy with great success.</li>
            <li> Very much work my money.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely recommend it on &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; alone.  </li>
            <li> I do like this product, I have used for many different things.</li>
            <li> reviews mention it&#x27;s a much safer alternative to GooGone!)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking.</li>
            <li> I first used this product in my all purpose cleaner.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> best part is that it comes in a 4 ounce bottle for a low price so not only do you save money, but you also have enough oil to use in a variety of ways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> I only got it for flavoring hot water but many uses.</li>
            <li> Have put some in hot water for a drink.  </li>
            <li> I like lemon in hot water.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Love it and use it daily!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to add to hot water for morning drink</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil has digestive properties, and let me tell you, it works very well!</li>
            <li> I bought this very eager to try it!</li>
            <li> and I even put it in my hot water each day to help with digestion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rare moment when a new purchase brings a smile to your face.  </li>
            <li> I mixed some with water in a spray bottle for easy fresh smelling cleanup.</li>
            <li> It is like drinking pure, clear and clean water, with the freshness of lemon.</li>
            <li> quite nice aroma, useful for salad dressing and to fragrance house hold cleaning products and even body lotions and other personal skin oils, refreshing and clean and definitely a fully natural feel.</li>
            <li> It certainly helps with digestion too.</li>
            <li> Eve Hansen puts out very high quality well made products and the lemon oil</li>
            <li> fast shipping, dropped included.</li>
            <li> the product was delivered fast.</li>
            <li> so much for the follow up.</li>
            <li> I added too much once</li>
            <li> The advice was absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li> Very concentraded.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li> The tips on use of the oil was appreciated and helpful.</li>
            <li> Real lemon scent from the peels.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product and seller!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying lemons and really don&#x27;t like how oily it feels in the water or the flavor.  </li>
            <li> They are definitely more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The glass bottle and glass dropper really make the whole product .  </li>
            <li> There are many uses for the peppermint oil as well i.e. a spider and mouse repellent and a wonderful pet smell deodorizer.</li>
            <li> Eve Hansen is the only person I would recommend buying the available products from.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping and High Quality</li>
            <li> There are so many other uses.  </li>
            <li> This lemon oil seems exactly the same, only a lot more inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product gets 4 stars because it as not as potent as my other oil.</li>
            <li> Will order more &amp; other oils</li>
            <li> I have purchased other brand of lemon oils in the past but this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> I went from not sure why I decided to get this product to loving it.</li>
            <li> now it looks almost new!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended  for just having on hand.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Eve Hansen Lemon Oil.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a little, for it is very potent.  </li>
            <li> A weaker version to some other consumable lemon oils out there but volume and price easily overcomes this.</li>
            <li> not least, I ordered the Lemon Oil.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I get the same benefit as a fresh lemon.</li>
            <li> I love that there are no fillers or other ingredients at all; just pure lemon essential oil.</li>
            <li> and you need so little of this to make your water taste great  that this will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was paying 10.00 for, and bears the exact same latin name.</li>
            <li> and he won&#x27;t come back ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is good for, other than a body oil?  </li>
            <li> Pure smell of lemon and only lemon.</li>
            <li> So far my DH is the one using it.  </li>
            <li> But wow.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is wow</li>
            <li> As far as Eve Hansen?</li>
            <li> I bought a glass spray bottle to make the natural cleaner.</li>
            <li> Little more diluted than expected</li>
            <li> But I was surprised to see not a single one of the 50</li>
            <li> I add several drops of this lemon oil (and a drop of Eve Hansen peppermint oil) to every glass/cup (please use glass, ceramic, or stainless steel as essential oils can pull the toxins out of plastics with repetitive/prolonged use).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to make body scrubs, furniture polish &amp; general household spray cleaner.</li>
            <li> How can you explain to a young boy that he will not be getting anything for his birthday because a person did not care enough about their product being sold.</li>
            <li> I add a fresh squeezed lemon to my water everyday now with this lemon oil - just a few drops and it taste exactly the same.</li>
            <li> but I ended up putting a few drops into a glass of water for the first rehydrating drink in the morning.</li>
            <li> So this is also a large supply by even an above average users needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality, very careful packaging, also included a dropper.  </li>
            <li> If you are using for cleaning or topically use, that is a little less expensive, this is a great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it to clean the glue that is left behind when I take the lables off plastic and glass containers.</li>
            <li> barely any is missing… So it will last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> I utilize various natural oils for multiple purposes, everyday!</li>
            <li> In the 2 months prior to freely using Eve Hansen&#x27;s Lemon oil several times a day, I had to use other more expensive essential oils topically to fight off one kidney infection, 2 UTIs, and treat the painful symptoms of a passing kidney stone - I was stingier with the Lemon oil in my water because of the cost of the tiny bottles and my financial situation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long</li>
            <li> Just a couple drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was going to have to cut back on usage due to finances, at the cost of my health.</li>
            <li> It had been dry and almost cracking -</li>
            <li> Because natural oils are so concentrated, often times a few drops is all you need!</li>
            <li> around the house dropping it in sinks, grandsons diaper changing area,&lt;br /&gt;dog</li>
            <li> Currently using a few drops in my drinking water and also use it as a cleaning product and air freshener.</li>
            <li> Be careful traveling with this as the rubber dropper piece will burst with air travel.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you put it in the bathtub though, it started to make my skin burn.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in loose bubblewrap leaking all over my other items ordered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big bag of lemons condensed in a little jar!</li>
            <li> I use several drops in a little less than a gallon of purified water along with about 1/8 tsp baking soda.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> Took a little long to get here.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this oil.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why the other reviews say it didn&#x27;t smell like lemon...</li>
            <li> (As other reviewers have stated, you can Google dozens of uses for Lemon oil.</li>
            <li> So disappointed after so many glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li> Dilute a small amount of lemon essential oil combined with honey in lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> What a difference compared to the other brand I was using.</li>
            <li> All i can say is HOLY COW</li>
            <li> I am surprised, for an &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; that it is so weak.  </li>
            <li> DARK  </li>
            <li> As a skin care product, it helps fade dark spots and even out your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to keep a cutting board fresh.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in an empty candle jar &amp; put on a mug warmer.</li>
            <li> But for me the choice came down to economics.</li>
            <li> Probably added a little too much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my water to drink as well as my bath for aroma therapy.</li>
            <li> I use this for my homemade body butter and put a few drops in my water.  </li>
            <li> I read how this product can give you an energy boost by adding a few drops to a glass of water.</li>
            <li> DEAD  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put a few drops on cotton balls as a rodent deterrent.</li>
            <li> A drop in my green tea tasted</li>
            <li> Also the uses for this are boundless.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when adding to bath, when it says a few drops, they mean it!</li>
            <li> MY  RAW  </li>
            <li> you saw the little sucker crawl through</li>
            <li> I used a small amount of it when cleaning my bathroom</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am not able to fully review it.</li>
            <li> But, I am a bit disappointed that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Take it slow, you can always add more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to put this one to work!</li>
            <li> I use if for other purposes, but sad I cannot use it for drinking.</li>
            <li> what  I mean....</li>
            <li> I am addicted to Eve Hansen&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> put a few drops in artificial plant bases, I burn it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other items are worthless due to this worthless product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product is just mediocre.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews i decided to try the oil, not impressed at all!!!!!!!!.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it like crazy (I like to drink it) and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used to made Lemon and Pepper spice blend, to drink with water for a cold and now to heal a planters wart on my daughter&#x27;s foot (who knew).</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this product OR this seller!    </li>
            <li> I have carpet and  animals, bad  </li>
            <li> Buyer be ware, worthless product unless you like everthing in the box to be covered in lemon oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lemon oil smells so fresh, I just love it!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have made my own toothpaste with it and plan to make shampoo with it, too.</li>
            <li> This lemon oil is really pleasant and versatile. I have used it for soap making and cleaning car interior and home, and it works wonders: the smell is very refreshing and uplifting, just as its introduction describes. I like how it is &amp;#34;food grade&amp;#34; cold pressed natural oil, as you don&#x27;t need to worry about it occasionally touching your food when you use it with a spraying bottle in the kitchen. I just hope that there comes a choice of larger bottles with batch price as I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> So far my DH is the one using it.  The flavor is good.  I intend to start using it in my morning water.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, dropped included. don&#x27;t know why the other reviews say it didn&#x27;t smell like lemon... mine did. using it for my homemade dishwasher soap, laundry detergent and fabric softener!</li>
            <li> Love the Lemon Oil.  I originally Bought it to treat my dogs fleas.  But wow.  There are so many other uses.  Do some research and you will see all the great uses of Lemon Oil.&lt;br /&gt;The Seller,  Eve Hansen is the only person I would recommend buying the available products from.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping and High Quality Effective Products.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Eve,&lt;br /&gt;Jason/Thomas Walker....</li>
            <li> Great product.....so fresh smelling.  I&#x27;m anxious to put this one to work!</li>
            <li> Great product. Pure smell of lemon and only lemon. Very fresh and very clean!</li>
            <li> the product was delivered fast. I am happy with the product and can&#x27;t wait to use it for many things</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this again. I used it in my homemade toothpaste recipe. it is the best!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and clean. Would gladly reorder.</li>
            <li> The oil smelled delicious. Used it in my sugar scrubs. People loved them and I will buy again</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I believe it arrived yesterday.  After work I was a lemon dropping fool.&lt;br /&gt;Went around the house dropping it in sinks, grandsons diaper changing area,&lt;br /&gt;dog beds, kitchen sink, dishwasher, clothes washer.  Don&#x27;t know how long the smell&lt;br /&gt;will last but it is definitely a fresh smell.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I like the size of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It will last a bit if used correctly. (i.e., using dropper and not pouring)&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much for the follow up. I will most definitely recommend it on &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; alone.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to the company.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service and fantastic product!!  The quality exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to Eve Hansen&#x27;s products.  I&#x27;ve ordered the Peppermint several times.. It keeps the house fresh and pest free.  I also use it with carrier oils to make the best massage oil ever.  You only have to use a little, for it is very potent.  As an Aesthetician, I know when a product is good for my skin and Eve&#x27;s Rosehip Oil is one of the best.  Last but not least, I ordered the Lemon Oil.  I absolutely love it.  There are so many uncountable ways to use it.  Such as for cleaning the kitchen counters, for skin, in homemade products, etc.  I am a customer for life.  Very satisfied.  Thank you Ms. Hansen.</li>
            <li> Smells and taste wonderful! After my first bottle top didn&#x27;t fit right and leaked they sent me a new bottle asap!!! Awesome company</li>
            <li> I do like this product, I have used for many different things. I put a few drops in my water to drink as well as my bath for aroma therapy. Just be careful when adding to bath, when it says a few drops, they mean it! I added too much once and it literally burned my skin. I would buy again for sure, because it is so pure. Just have caution, it is very powerful</li>
            <li> Great Product! Tastes Great and Is Very Healthy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I use this for my homemade body butter and put a few drops in my water.  It taste so good and has done wonders for my water intake.  I have purchased other brand of lemon oils in the past but this one by far is the best. It&#x27;s pure (so yeah it&#x27;s a bit more pricey but worth it). I will def but again. it comes with a dropper so it&#x27;s east to use.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why I had ordered this product at first but then once I got it I learned. I used this as part of my regimen to fade freckles and age spots from sun damage. All I can say is wow, it&#x27;s been working. I have only started using the product about a week ago but the results have been amazing. I read how this product can give you an energy boost by adding a few drops to a glass of water. Well you know that afternoon slump that tends to happen? Not anymore with this product around. It&#x27;s is truly amazing! The scent is wonderful and a little goes a long ways. This is a nice big bottle and well worth it. I used a small amount of it when cleaning my bathroom and it smelled so wonderful and fresh when I was done. I&#x27;m sure I will find many more uses for this product. I&#x27;m learning as I got along. I went from not sure why I decided to get this product to loving it.</li>
            <li> The smell is so wonderful!  I use it for cleaning and for making the room smell nice.  It works great for both.</li>
            <li> Nice lemon oil, it smells great!!</li>
            <li> Nice product with good service! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I could add vitamin c and lemon essential oils to my water.  The flavor is  really good and it makes the water taste excellent.  I have more energy and you need so little of this to make your water taste great  that this will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s a big bag of lemons condensed in a little jar!</li>
            <li> I bought this lemon oil to treat a beautiful little wall table that I received from a  good friend.  I had been told that lemon oil straight from the bottle or lemon oil mixed with beeswax would make any wood piece look beautiful again.  The advice was absolutely correct.  I mixed the lemon oil with beeswax and gave this table a good soaking.  It had been dry and almost cracking - now it looks almost new! The lemon makes the house smell fresh and clean also.</li>
            <li> I use it a lot. Mixed in water, to flavor food, make drinks, ect.</li>
            <li> I was on a quest to find a quality, no alcohol lemon extract for cooking and making detox drinks. This product has a rich,natural lemon flavor that is delicious. Best of all its all natural with no &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; ingredients. Thank you Eve Hansen for prompt service and a top notch product.</li>
            <li> CAN  I  USE  THIS  LEMON  ESSENTIAL  OIL  ON  MY  RAW  FACE  EVERY  NIGHT,  IT  SEEMS  STRONG  LIKE  A  PRODUCT  I  LIKE,  BUT  WHAT  DO  YOU  THINK?  AND  DOESNT  THIS  LIGHTEN  DARK  SPOTS  TOO  AND  REMOVE  DEAD  SKIN  CELLS  OFF  FACE  AND  HANDS  AND  BODY  PARTS  ?</li>
            <li> Very concentraded. I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have kidney problems that make me prone to infections. I also have many stones, clusters, and calcifications. I drink water almost exclusively, and on a rare occasion, a cup of tea. I add several drops of this lemon oil (and a drop of Eve Hansen peppermint oil) to every glass/cup (please use glass, ceramic, or stainless steel as essential oils can pull the toxins out of plastics with repetitive/prolonged use). I&#x27;m a huge believer of quality essential oils, but when I went through my 10.00 (wholesale) 15mL bottle of Lemon oil in no time flat, I sought a more cost effective solution and found it with Eve Hansen. This product costs 2.79 for the same cold-pressed 15mL I was paying 10.00 for, and bears the exact same latin name. However, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not sourced or processed from its native habitat of Italy. But for me the choice came down to economics. I was going to have to cut back on usage due to finances, at the cost of my health. No brainer for me!    I&#x27;ve been using this fine product for 2 months now, and am very pleased to report that I&#x27;ve had no symptoms or infections, and haven&#x27;t felt any large stone movement whatsoever.  In the 2 months prior to freely using Eve Hansen&#x27;s Lemon oil several times a day, I had to use other more expensive essential oils topically to fight off one kidney infection, 2 UTIs, and treat the painful symptoms of a passing kidney stone - I was stingier with the Lemon oil in my water because of the cost of the tiny bottles and my financial situation. I&#x27;m about 40% through the Eve Hansen bottle, and have consumed 99.5% of that internally. YES, it IS safe to do so!  As far as Eve Hansen? SUPERIOR customer service. They&#x27;ve answered every question, responding quickly, politely, and compassionately. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this product OR this seller!    (As other reviewers have stated, you can Google dozens of uses for Lemon oil. But I was surprised to see not a single one of the 50+ reviews mention it&#x27;s a much safer alternative to GooGone!)</li>
            <li> This oil has a nice scent and works well in baking.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rare moment when a new purchase brings a smile to your face.  The wonderfully natural  fragrances of this lemon as well as the peppermint oil is  refreshing and luxurious. Highly recommended  for just having on hand.</li>
            <li> Good smell, good price, good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product is just mediocre. I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Little more diluted than expected</li>
            <li> Lemon oil, simply the best.  This is a great price for the amount you get.  I have ordered from doterra, it is alot more expensive.  This lemon oil seems exactly the same, only a lot more inexpensive.  Definitely recommend eve Hansen.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Excellent fresh scent. Exactly what I was looking. I have used this lemon oil in my water and in my smoothies. I mixed some with water in a spray bottle for easy fresh smelling cleanup. I also used some in my oil burner to make my house smell fresh. I would recommend it and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this lemon oil it has a fresh taste and refreshing lemon smell. I used this as air freshener and as a detox every morning. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love stuff from Eve Hansen</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it to add to my water for drinking, freshen the rooms and the kitchen sink.</li>
            <li> This company is so attentive! They immediately emailed tips and too see if I was happy with the product. I first used this product in my all purpose cleaner. I was so surprised that I was able to strip paper off of a desk!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something very strong, I would go with Doterra, which I use for my baking, cooking and drinks. If you are using for cleaning or topically use, that is a little less expensive, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product gets 4 stars because it as not as potent as my other oil. I love the size and will use for all of my cleaning needs.</li>
            <li> It strong but perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li> Love,love, love this stuff!!!  Uplifting in water, in the air, everywhere!!!!  Thanks so much.  I would highly recommend this Eve Hansen Lemon Oil.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great smell, awesome taste, versatile, many, many uses. Get this product, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again when my bottle runs out. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Would definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using essential oils for years. This lemon oil is top of the line! When you open the bottle, the pure potent lemon aroma lets you know immediately that this oil is fresh, undiluted and obtained through superior methods. I use it to make lemon water, which is incredibly healthy and it&#x27;s delicious. I also make cleaning products for my home with it and it cleans better than store bought cleansers. My kitchen smells so fresh. I use it in a non chemical bug repellant that I make and it mixes very nicely with other oils. As a skin care product, it helps fade dark spots and even out your skin tone. The vitamin c in the lemons rejuvenates your skin in the cellular level. (It needs to be diluted to use on your skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it comes in a 4 ounce bottle for a low price so not only do you save money, but you also have enough oil to use in a variety of ways. Eve Hansen puts out very high quality well made products and the lemon oil is one more product that you will be very happy with.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It smells amazing. I use in almost everything!</li>
            <li> Hello there!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled as I just received my lemon oil!  I immediately opened it up, put the tincture dropper in it and dropped two drops in 16 oz of water.  It is like drinking pure, clear and clean water, with the freshness of lemon. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!  I&#x27;m going to look at your peppermint oil as well, you mentioned about lemon and peppermint oil eliminating digested food, to help cleanse the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product, excellent quality and customer service!</li>
            <li> This lemon oil has the freshness of hundreds of bright lemons in the convenience of a bottle with a dropper provided. I love the suggested uses. I put a couple of drops in my dish washer and the kitchen smelled so fresh.</li>
            <li> It is great for everything.</li>
            <li> this oil is okay but not as strong and therapeutic as the one that&#x27;s made with lemon rinds</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product. We have never purchased this before and are very pleased. A couple of drops in the water is easy to use and we are enjoying this product for its lovely aroma as well!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff &amp; love the personal outreach/emails from the company giving tips on uses for this oil. I&#x27;ve used it to make body scrubs, furniture polish &amp; general household spray cleaner. Will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. I put 5 drops in a cup of water and it had a good lemon taste. I drink it for health reasons, so did not add a sweetener and it tasted fine. Even better than organic fresh pressed lemon juice like Lakewood. I used it in a diffuser and it puts out a strong refreshing lemon scent which lasted several hours.</li>
            <li> Great smell, mixed with water and spray everywhere; my home smells fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> This was an easy sale. The seller was extremely nice and concerned! The tips on use of the oil was appreciated and helpful.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> Great product that I received faster than expected.  I only got it for flavoring hot water but many uses.</li>
            <li> Real lemon scent from the peels. It certainly helps with digestion too. Very good and pure product. I put two drops into my water when drinking, 5 drops to hot bath, also use it in diffusers for great clean scent of lemons.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I utilize various natural oils for multiple purposes, everyday! The potency and viscosity of this oil is perfect. And the dropper makes it easy to apply the right amount. Because natural oils are so concentrated, often times a few drops is all you need! So this is also a large supply by even an above average users needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAVORITE APPLICATIONS...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAKING&lt;br /&gt;It works great in cookie and candy recipes! I&#x27;ve used it baking shortbread, and making hard candy with great success. For all edible applications it usually only takes 1/4tsp to 1tsp. Take it slow, you can always add more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEVERAGES&lt;br /&gt;I like to add a drop to a cup of tea. It works great as a decongestant. I don&#x27;t drink, but I can only imagine it would be awesome in a frozen mixed drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEST DETERRENT&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put a few drops on cotton balls as a rodent deterrent. Stuff the cotton ball in the hole you saw the little sucker crawl through and he won&#x27;t come back ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s GREAT! The product is fantastic. And I can say without any hesitation that my experience with Eve Hansen&#x27;s customer service is among the best I&#x27;ve ever had. I will definitely be purchasing this (as well as their Lemon) product again!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing!  I just put a couple of drops into my Liter water bottle. A little goes a long way..Remember it&#x27;s an oil!  I&#x27;m looking forward to use in different ways!</li>
            <li> Took a little long to get here. But I use every morning in my water!</li>
            <li> I love this lemon oil! The scent is strong and natural; a small amount fills my kitchen with a delicious aroma. I love that there are no fillers or other ingredients at all; just pure lemon essential oil. I’ve tried many oils but they either had unwanted chemicals or were pre-diluted, which meant I had to use a large amount of just to make it effective.</li>
            <li> Really love the essence of lemon. Currently using a few drops in my drinking water and also use it as a cleaning product and air freshener. Just a couple drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great REAL lemon scent. I love fresh lemon scent and this is it !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops in artificial plant bases, I burn it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend :)))</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I use it on hot towels. Be careful traveling with this as the rubber dropper piece will burst with air travel.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  We are very happy with it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This smells abolutely heavenly. Has many uses from cleaning to a beauty aid. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the price and quality of this oil. Love the fresh lemon scent, smells very natural. I add 1-2 drops to my drinking water. Tastes great too!</li>
            <li> AMAZING QUALITY LEMON OIL! This stuff smells exceptional, shipping was fast, the bottle came packaged and secured properly, and it works great with my oil diffuser. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product and seller! Thanks for a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Tastes great and helps digestion.</li>
            <li> This lemon essential oil is awesome!!! I bought it initially to add to my homemade body butter but I ended up putting a few drops into a glass of water for the first rehydrating drink in the morning. Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.... Securely packaged and smells and taste superb!!!! Quality glass dropper included.... I bought it a week ago and I&#x27;ve used it like crazy (I like to drink it) and barely any is missing… So it will last a long time!!! Also the customer service is excellent, as well as friendly and helpful. They even sent an email with helpful usage ideas!  Will buy again 🍋❤️🍋</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. The oil is so very strong and crisp smelling. Nice way to lighten the mood rather quickly. Has a clean fresh taste as well. The dropper that came along is a bonus. Very much work my money.</li>
            <li> It tastes great (4 drops in 12 oz of warm water) and arrived in a timely manner. A drop in my green tea tasted great- so far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Item as described, received on time.</li>
            <li> I love this lemon oil!!!! I add a fresh squeezed lemon to my water everyday now with this lemon oil - just a few drops and it taste exactly the same. Plus, I get the same benefit as a fresh lemon. Thank You!!!!!</li>
            <li> quite nice aroma, useful for salad dressing and to fragrance house hold cleaning products and even body lotions and other personal skin oils, refreshing and clean and definitely a fully natural feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to keep a cutting board fresh.  It doesn&#x27;t work for that.  However, I have been using it on our skin and love it.  Have put some in hot water for a drink.  I like lemon in hot water.  Very good product.  And, lordy, lordy, does it ever smell good!</li>
            <li> After trying a number of water enhancers, I&#x27;m finding I like the simplicity of a couple drops of this (as well as the peppermint oil I got at the same time) in my water the best. My husband likes it in his tea. Will definitely get again.</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells so good and a few drops around the apartment makes it smell so fresh!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described. Love it and use it daily!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Nice &amp; strong. Use it in my tea, as a cleaner, room &amp; carpet freshener. I put a few drops in an empty candle jar &amp; put on a mug warmer. The company has sent follow up emails to make sure I&#x27;m happy. ( yes I am ).  Will order more &amp; other oils</li>
            <li> I have used it in my water for a detox and for cleaning.  I also put it on my hands to ligthen my brown spots. This works for me.</li>
            <li> Smells great - quick arrival!</li>
            <li> This product smells awsome. It was delivered on time and believe me the smell is so relaxing. I would have given a five star if it was more thicker in consistency. But overall it is an excellent buy for your money.</li>
            <li> Excellent in every drop!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to add to hot water for morning drink so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying lemons and really don&#x27;t like how oily it feels in the water or the flavor.  So disappointed after so many glowing reviews.  I use if for other purposes, but sad I cannot use it for drinking.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in loose bubblewrap leaking all over my other items ordered. Other items are worthless due to this worthless product. I would not even give  it one star but that was the lowest rating I could give. The items ruined were for my son for his birthday. How can you explain to a young boy that he will not be getting anything for his birthday because a person did not care enough about their product being sold. Buyer be ware, worthless product unless you like everthing in the box to be covered in lemon oil.</li>
            <li> did not come with dropper...needs one!</li>
            <li> This is the best lemon essential oil ever. The smell is spot on and so wonderfully lemony. It makes my mouth water it is very true lemon. Also the uses for this are boundless. Eve Hansen rocks!! The service...Impeccable! I also received a bottle of her essential oil in peppermint. The peppermint oil has digestive properties, and let me tell you, it works very well! There are many uses for the peppermint oil as well i.e. a spider and mouse repellent and a wonderful pet smell deodorizer. I just absolutely love both.  There are so many uses I urge you to check out these huge bottles of essential oils. It is safe for consumption as well as cleaning, deodorizing. I even put some drops in with my home made laundry detergent for a fresh lemony smell.  I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple of months or so now. They are definitely more than I expected.  Thank you Eve Hansen for your lovely products and impeccable service!&lt;br /&gt;~T~</li>
            <li> The lemon oil relaxes me and moisturizes my skin. The smell is also pleasant and wonderful. I have been using lemon oil about one month. I have Eczema. I use lemon oil for my morning detox drink (lemon oil, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, hemp oil, olive oil, &amp; warm water). I also use lemon oil as my facial moisturizer (lemon oil, rose hip oil, grapefruit oil, jojoba oil, &amp; almond oil/coconut oil/sunflower oil/hemp oil, &amp; water). For my Eczema spots, I use hemp/almond/sunflower oil. I haven&#x27;t used lemon oil on my Eczema spots but... found lemon oil can \\&quot;Help Relieve Eczema: Eczema sufferers have found relief from lemon wraps. Dilute a small amount of lemon essential oil combined with honey in lukewarm water. Soak a cloth made of linen in this solution, squeeze out the extra solution, and place the cloth on the area of the body affected by eczema for 15 minutes at a time, 3 times a day.\\&quot; from http://www.herbwisdom.com/herb-lemon.html</li>
            <li> Love it. I use several drops in a little less than a gallon of purified water along with about 1/8 tsp baking soda. It is very tasty good for you and helps your body be more alkaline than acidic which helps to fight off diseases. Wonderful product. Smells great as well.</li>
            <li> great product, smells wonderful. Be careful when you put it in the bathtub though, it started to make my skin burn. Probably added a little too much.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the laundry, and in the diffuser . It is great!! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Definitely for lemon lovers.</li>
            <li> This  oil is phenomonal.....I use  it  for  cleaning  and the house  smells  fresh  and clean...I have carpet and  animals, bad  combo  if  you know  what  I mean....I&#x27;ve  sprayed  this  oil  diluted and  what  a  change! I now  walk into my house and  go ...ahhhhhh!  The  best thing is that it is non -toxic ! I&#x27;m trying to not use chemicals  anymore. I&#x27;m in lemon heaven!</li>
            <li> Today I received this in the mail and made my drink the same way I do with another brand I use. All i can say is HOLY COW this is awesome!!! What a difference compared to the other brand I was using. This is night and day different. Glad I bought this, Its so good that I will not even consider trying another brand.</li>
            <li> Tonight I finally used the handful of essential oils that I purchased, one of which was this lemon essential oil. It smelled very fresh and clean, which is exactly what I wanted when choosing a lemon oil. I&#x27;m also very pleased that it came with a good dropper. I felt like such a chemist using it!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews i decided to try the oil, not impressed at all!!!!!!!!. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it! I will be ordering another bottle to keep on hand in the kitchen.  I bought it for cosmetic reason but tried some of the other things that were recemended and it really works great.  I don&#x27;t do reviews but was very impressed by it.</li>
            <li> I bought this very eager to try it! Unfortunately I am not able to fully review it. Because of my clumsiness I dropped it on the floor at work before I had a chance. The positive is the whole facility had a very fresh lemon scent all day!</li>
            <li> Eve Hansen is a great company!  My lemon oil arrived quickly with wonderful helpful hints and how to use the product.  The glass bottle and glass dropper really make the whole product .  Thank you and I look forward to purchasing again from the company.</li>
            <li> Versatile and awesome product; just needed the instructions included. I later received them via email. Nevertheless, terrific product!!!&lt;br /&gt;A must try!!!</li>
            <li> Smells really good! I&#x27;m pleased that they emailed me with suggested usage tips/recipes. I have the peppermint iol as well. I bought a glass spray bottle to make the natural cleaner.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great smell and quality!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have not used this very much, but recently I found a very good use for it. I used it to clean the glue that is left behind when I take the lables off plastic and glass containers. It works great! I also use it to clean up kitchen  and bathroom counter tops. I have got to find more uses for this.</li>
            <li> Just lovely. Nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve used to made Lemon and Pepper spice blend, to drink with water for a cold and now to heal a planters wart on my daughter&#x27;s foot (who knew).</li>
            <li> High quality, very careful packaging, also included a dropper.  Super pleased with the value of this product!</li>
            <li> Whats the Point of this? It smells terriffic for about a minute and fades away.</li>
            <li> I use just a drop or two in my water. I love it! The glass dropper is a great way to get just a little. A little goes a long way with this oil.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Good product for mouth wash and cleaning kitchen surface.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and light and fresh.  But, I am a bit disappointed that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I am surprised, for an &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; that it is so weak.  Not sure what it is good for, other than a body oil?  (Doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose that I needed/wanted it for.)</li>
            <li> Good price, I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it. use it in everything.</li>
            <li> smells great and I even put it in my hot water each day to help with digestion. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  A weaker version to some other consumable lemon oils out there but volume and price easily overcomes this. Arrived on time.  Will purchase again and again.  Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Tastes and smells delicious! I will buy this oil again and again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I add it to vinegar and water and it is the best to clean my house with!! amazing ..Its not so great for adding to water to drink as its not that lemony flavored but for cleaning and as far as the smell it is outstanding - I love this stuff</li>
