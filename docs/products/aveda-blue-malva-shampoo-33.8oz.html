            <li>Great for graying hair.  </li>

            <li>It smells great and adds shine.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and does a great job of cleaning my hair and not drying my scalp out.</li>

            <li>The scent is nice and the quality I&#x27;m sure is great.  </li>
            <li>This was just ok!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Nice scent as well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with joico</li>
            <li>but today I&#x27;m buying a pureology purple shampoo to see if I like it better</li>
            <li>I find to be better quality.  </li>
            <li>However, I used it regularly 20 years ago and found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else and really glad I found it online.  </li>
            <li>The Blue Malva Aveda Shampoo arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist showed me that trick:)</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Best option for grey or greying hair I have found.</li>
            <li>As expected - arrived on time and wrapped very securely - great product and love the effect it has on keeping my hair color not to brassy.</li>
            <li>The salon said that they would not recommend using it every day if you have light hair, but when I didn&#x27;t see results I did just that.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, Aveda.com sells it for 31.50 WITH FREE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>You need to buy $50 o get free shipping</li>
            <li>Also great to keep your blonde hair staying that way if your like me who wait till the 8 week mark</li>
            <li>Second, I dried and styled my hair and discovered a brilliant, bright blonde--with no coppertones!</li>
            <li>Impressed with the loss of the yellow tint and leaves hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>After a week straight the results are much more noticeable, and the overall condition of my hair is greatly improved.</li>
            <li>Use it to clean my wedding ring and earrings.  </li>
            <li>The Blue Malva makes the silver in my hair so bright, it almost glows.  </li>
            <li>Husband used it this product and keep his hair bright white .</li>
            <li>and I must say her hair did look a true silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other bluing products but nothing works as well or smells as great as Aveda.</li>
            <li>I bought this along w/ the conditioner at dillards for my platinum highlights that get brassy quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it smells great and ensures that my blonde hair stays blonde.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo for people with white or grey hair.</li>
            <li>So nice to have the ease of having a product I regularly use</li>
            <li>and I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 or 4 years and it&#x27;s really good for making gray or white hair bright and shiney vs dull like some shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Love how it makes my silver-grey hair shine (I get compliments from total strangers often).  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a pretty dog.</li>
            <li>I love the Blue Malva Shampoo-</li>
            <li>Clean and soft as well.</li>
            <li>and I am left with gorgeous bleach blonde results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually gone in to get my hair cut at different places and they have remarked I must use a really good shampoo,</li>
            <li>So excited I&#x27;m golden blonde Asain!</li>
            <li>First of all, I can&#x27;t recall having such  clean feeling hair after using a conditioner.</li>
            <li>The blue malva, although maybe pricier than others really works in keeping the brassiness at bay and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair free of yellowish, brassy look and does not need to be used daily.</li>
            <li>I also really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s keeping it very neutral and makes my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>just ordered my shampoo plus the blue malva conditioner with free shipping for just a few bucks more than this seller is selling it here.</li>
            <li>the lady at dillards was a bit older and rocked her hair gray</li>
            <li>I have been unable to afford the salon so have been dying my own hair and the cheap home dye</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shampoo for anyone with blond or high lighted hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>it cleans my hair and leaves it soft, true to my natural color without brassiness, and clean- no oil or heavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Trying a new hair color</li>
            <li>Best is you only need a small drop of the shampoo, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>, it is much cheaper in a local salon then on here.</li>
            <li>the conditioner I regret buying completely since I have cheaper conditioners that work a lot</li>
            <li>will like to add if you have naturally gray hair</li>
            <li>My 87 year old mom loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner that matches the shampoo, I use the mint conditioner that AVEDA offers.  </li>
            <li>Aveda.com does beat all the prices here for this product and blue malva conditioner ($18), twice as much here.</li>
            <li>Leave hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I have high lighted hair and my beautician sold me some last year for my hair</li>
            <li>It keeps the white white and vibrant.</li>
            <li>You can buy a litre of Blue Malva at the salon or directly from the Aveda website for $31.50.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin as well and have never had a problem with Blue Malva causing breakouts or itchiness.  </li>

            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin as well and have never had a problem with Blue Malva causing breakouts or itchiness.  </li>
            <li> My grey hair looks like silver or platinum with this shampoo, never yellow, never like a blue hair.</li>
            <li> I have used other blue shampoos before such as Matrix Silver that work but Blue Malva</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo for a few washes however the red comes completely out</li>
            <li> I just wanted it highlighted with a slightly blue tinge that I have seen on other seniors.</li>
            <li> after I tried Joicos purple shampoo and that definitely makes a difference in toning down brassyness.  </li>
            <li> I just got blonde highlights and my stylist recommended this product to cut down on brassyness.</li>
            <li> Other purple shampoos I&#x27;ve tried seem to dry out my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful about what shampoos I use to avoid turning my hair brassy, red, and heavy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is half white &amp; half gray.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shampoo, and the conditioner, to anyone who has blonde hair and is tired of it turning brassy!</li>
            <li> They never did send me the other two</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who has allergies to other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Arrived sooner then expected!</li>
            <li> I think you need to look at the vendor very carefully.</li>
            <li> The shampoo, along with the conditioner, turned my hair a dark gray color.</li>
            <li> My hair turned dry &amp; dull looking.</li>
            <li> I almost bought it here, and then went to check the price because it sounded a little steep... come to find out</li>
            <li> I tried leaving it on a few minutes and even up to 30 minutes and my hair never changed.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few times I&#x27;ve seen Amazon stores get beat on price so dramatically.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken open.</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy but you can mix 1/4 tablespoon of grape kool-aid powder to 4 tablespoons of your normal shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the results were not more noticeable.</li>
            <li> But would have been disappointed anyway because the smell was terrible, not like other aveda products at all.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did you know you can get the same effects without the big price?  Sounds crazy but you can mix 1/4 tablespoon of grape kool-aid powder to 4 tablespoons of your normal shampoo.  Same effect.  Doesn&#x27;t turn your hair purple.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, google \\&quot;grape kool-aid shampoo\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve tried both the Blue Malva and the kool-aid trick and the kool-aid trick gives the same result at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my silver-grey hair shine (I get compliments from total strangers often).  It smells nice and does a great job of cleaning my hair and not drying my scalp out.</li>
            <li> Impressed with the loss of the yellow tint and leaves hair very soft and manageable. It did what it said it would!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner I was disappointed that the results were not more noticeable. The salon said that they would not recommend using it every day if you have light hair, but when I didn&#x27;t see results I did just that. After a week straight the results are much more noticeable, and the overall condition of my hair is greatly improved. Once I get my hair where I would like it to be colorwise I will probably go to only twice a week alternating with Redken Blonde Glam shampoo. Definitely recommend it, but don&#x27;t expect an instant miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is much cheaper in a local salon then on here.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where the word Blue came into the picture. The shampoo, along with the conditioner, turned my hair a dark gray color. My hair is half white &amp; half gray. I just wanted it highlighted with a slightly blue tinge that I have seen on other seniors. My hair turned dry &amp; dull looking.</li>
            <li> This was just ok! I bought this along w/ the conditioner at dillards for my platinum highlights that get brassy quickly. I tried leaving it on a few minutes and even up to 30 minutes and my hair never changed.  The scent is nice and the quality I&#x27;m sure is great.  I have it around just in case I&#x27;m ever out of shampoo ...the conditioner I regret buying completely since I have cheaper conditioners that work a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after I tried Joicos purple shampoo and that definitely makes a difference in toning down brassyness.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with joico but today I&#x27;m buying a pureology purple shampoo to see if I like it better (hence this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will like to add if you have naturally gray hair this might work for you...the lady at dillards was a bit older and rocked her hair gray and I must say her hair did look a true silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it smells great and ensures that my blonde hair stays blonde.  I have used other blue shampoos before such as Matrix Silver that work but Blue Malva I find to be better quality.  I have been unable to afford the salon so have been dying my own hair and the cheap home dye leaves my hair with a reddish tint.  After using the shampoo for a few washes however the red comes completely out and I am left with gorgeous bleach blonde results.  This shampoo has saved my hair and my wallet, a great buy!</li>
            <li> I have tried every bluing shampoo for my blonde hair from Schwarzkopf to Joico and some leave your hair purple or are too drying. The blue malva, although maybe pricier than others really works in keeping the brassiness at bay and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> My 87 year old mom loves this stuff. I think she washes her toy poodle with it too, but what the heck, it&#x27;s a pretty dog.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo. I have tried all kinds of different shampoos that claim to get rid of brassiness and this is definitely the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, Aveda.com sells it for 31.50 WITH FREE SHIPPING. I almost bought it here, and then went to check the price because it sounded a little steep... come to find out, I was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered my shampoo plus the blue malva conditioner with free shipping for just a few bucks more than this seller is selling it here. Aveda also automatically threw in all kinds of extra product samples that I didn&#x27;t even ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am all for supporting small businesses but not ones that are trying to price gouge.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I would recommend it to anyone with light colored hair.  My husband uses it too.  I would not recommend it to be from the vendor that I got it from as they sent only one and I ordered and paid for three.  They never did send me the other two and I have had to file a claim to receive the hundred or so dollars refund.  I think you need to look at the vendor very carefully.</li>
            <li> I have used this product only once and therefore cannot report on its quality. However, I used it regularly 20 years ago and found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 or 4 years and it&#x27;s really good for making gray or white hair bright and shiney vs dull like some shampoos.  It also has no harmful chemicals.  A hair salon person introduced me to this and I noticed the difference right away. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else and really glad I found it online.  I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner that matches the shampoo, I use the mint conditioner that AVEDA offers.  I&#x27;ve actually gone in to get my hair cut at different places and they have remarked I must use a really good shampoo, so that&#x27;s objective feedback as well.</li>
            <li> My gray hair lost yellow from being in sun from using it.  P.S. thank you reviewer from 2012. Aveda.com does beat all the prices here for this product and blue malva conditioner ($18), twice as much here. This was $31.50. You need to buy $50 o get free shipping but it s only $6. Might be cheaper for all aveda products. You will pay state sales tax at aveda. This is one of the few times I&#x27;ve seen Amazon stores get beat on price so dramatically.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this shampoo!  Been using it for years, maybe decades.  Why change?</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken open. But would have been disappointed anyway because the smell was terrible, not like other aveda products at all.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo for my white hair that works to keep the yellowing out on the market.  Nice scent as well.</li>
            <li> The Blue Malva Aveda Shampoo arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner. I am very pleased with both the timeliness of its arrival.</li>
            <li> As expected - arrived on time and wrapped very securely - great product and love the effect it has on keeping my hair color not to brassy.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  Great for graying hair.  So nice to have the ease of having a product I regularly use delivered to the door.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of color protector shampoos, color enhancers, and toners to keep the brassiness at bay, but nothing ever works. I simply had to recolor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set out on an internet search for something--anything--that would work, and I found a reference to Aveeda&#x27;s Blue Malva. I bought the shampoo and conditioner and tried them last night. THEY WORKED. First of all, I can&#x27;t recall having such  clean feeling hair after using a conditioner. Second, I dried and styled my hair and discovered a brilliant, bright blonde--with no coppertones! YAY!</li>
            <li> I have high lighted hair and my beautician sold me some last year for my hair and I use it once a week to keep out the brassy look I would recommend this shampoo for anyone with blond or high lighted hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I use.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.  My hair is healthy and shiny.  The Blue Malva makes the silver in my hair so bright, it almost glows.  This product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair purple or ashy looking.  I&#x27;ve tried other bluing products but nothing works as well or smells as great as Aveda.</li>
            <li> Husband used it this product and keep his hair bright white . Excellent product would recommend for anyone with any gray they want to brighten</li>
            <li> The shampoo is awesome-- makes my hair soft and shines beautifully.  Love it!  Will use for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Best option for grey or greying hair I have found. Leave hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and would not consider using anything else.  It is keeping the white of my hair white.  Will continue to use to help my white hair looking white.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I go my highlights done and the only thing that keeps my blonde form turning brass is this shampoo! Also great to keep your blonde hair staying that way if your like me who wait till the 8 week mark it is a life saver.</li>
            <li> My grey hair looks like silver or platinum with this shampoo, never yellow, never like a blue hair. Clean and soft as well.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Trying a new hair color and it&#x27;s keeping it very neutral and makes my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> I alternate using Shampure with Blue Malva.  It has a deeper cleanse, gets all the hairspray &amp; styling products out of my hair, and smells soooooo good!  It is also a great jewelry cleaner.  Use it to clean my wedding ring and earrings.  My hairstylist showed me that trick:)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who has allergies to other shampoos.  She can use this with no problems. Smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Terrific shampoo for my white hair. It keeps the white white and vibrant. Best is you only need a small drop of the shampoo, so a little goes a long way. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair free of yellowish, brassy look and does not need to be used daily. I get compliments on my almost totally white hair because of using this product. I am African-American and have texturized hair, but it works on all gray hair.</li>
            <li> It arrived today and it came with the pump! Arrived sooner then expected! I&#x27;ll update after I use it tonight! So excited I&#x27;m golden blonde Asain!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for people with white or grey hair. I have used it for years and love it.</li>
            <li> You can buy a litre of Blue Malva at the salon or directly from the Aveda website for $31.50. That&#x27;s what I did. I just got blonde highlights and my stylist recommended this product to cut down on brassyness. It smells great and adds shine. Other purple shampoos I&#x27;ve tried seem to dry out my hair and scalp. This one does NOT do that! The litre size will last FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde hair with lots of highlights that are affected by the season (lighter in the summer; darker in winter) and it&#x27;s very fine so I have to be very careful about what shampoos I use to avoid turning my hair brassy, red, and heavy.  I started using AVEDA Blue Malva shampoo about ten years ago and have alternated it with different Aveda products, such as Rosemary Mint.  I love the Blue Malva Shampoo- it cleans my hair and leaves it soft, true to my natural color without brassiness, and clean- no oil or heavy hair.  I also really like the smell. I have extremely sensitive skin as well and have never had a problem with Blue Malva causing breakouts or itchiness.  I would highly recommend this shampoo, and the conditioner, to anyone who has blonde hair and is tired of it turning brassy!</li>
