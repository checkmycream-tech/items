            <li>I found the razor easy to use on my face and took my time and achieved a really nice smooth face.  </li>
            <li>but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>They are kind of large for eyebrows</li>
            <li>Shaving your face is a great exfoliator &amp; removes excess facial hair.  </li>
            <li>so i am pretty sure i was doing it right.</li>
            <li>Item quick to ship.</li>
            <li>These little razors are great.</li>
            <li>I was using a regular razor on my face or the fine hairs, but these work so much better and can get all of the angles of my face.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>Good idea and somewhat functional but not sharp enough.  </li>
            <li>Tried on face first, had no succes so tried on my arm and after vigorously scraping at my arm hair</li>
            <li>Two of the cheap plastic razors completely fell apart after three uses, with the blades falling out within the first week.  </li>
            <li>I was able to shave my face, upper lip, chin, eyebrows and I even shaved my legs with it.  </li>
            <li>they work exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to try this these are the razors for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try again, but my first try caused a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li>However, the blade is kind of large for tight spots under the brow.</li>
            <li>These work really well</li>
            <li>Very dispointed.</li>
            <li>The razors arrived really fast in two days and were well packaged.  </li>
            <li>They give a pretty clean shave, with some pulling on the coarser hair (I used them to &#x27;clean up&#x27; the little hairs at my hairline).</li>
            <li>you did not mean to shave off!</li>
            <li>Great product a little long but serves the purpose.  </li>
            <li>I would never go back to any other method of doing my eyebrows because these are so easy and pain free.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft &amp; my makeup applies much easier.  </li>
            <li>so it was a new experience.</li>
            <li>As an esthetician I like to try new things for the skin always.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely use again and will repurchase this particular one as I really like it.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it above the browline for a few stray hairs there.</li>
            <li>If you are using these for the first time be careful because they are very sharp when you first get them.</li>
            <li>but you have to be careful because sometime you don&#x27;t expect it to shave at a certain angle and when it does i could get a part of your eyebrow</li>
            <li>Also they could cause irritation if you have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;d say some sort of aftershave may be necessary (or pinterest home remedy).</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right, but I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on these...</li>
            <li>Use small quick strokes</li>
            <li>I have no experience with other brands but these seem a little cheaply made in general, like a bottom of the line Bic disposable razor.</li>
            <li>so I scratched myself with it the first time and had a red line for a few days.</li>

            <li> They didn&#x27;t seem particularly sharp, but if you are using these for razor-exfoliation they might work well.</li>

            <li> be careful very sharp!</li>
            <li> They are a little wide so unless you are shaving the whole brow off it is clunky and borderline dangerous.</li>
            <li> A little learning curve on how to angle the razor.</li>
            <li> The plastic sticks out a little</li>

            <li> Missing parts and opened packaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used these things before, so I&#x27;m not sure how well they should work.</li>
            <li> Yeah so this was not very pleasant to use at all.</li>
            <li> The blades were all dull.</li>
            <li> In addition to it not working (dull razors) the plastic holding the razor in place came apart and the razor fell out.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed as it came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They do not work at all not sharp and horrible.</li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> After watching Michelle Money from the Bachelor on YouTube I decided to give these bad boys a try.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in purchase.</li>
            <li> These are just terrible.</li>

            <li> Great for on the go. But not the best.</li>
            <li> The blades were all dull. Disappointed in purchase.</li>
            <li> Love them, they are much better then what you buy at Walmart!!!</li>
            <li> great groomer...love it!</li>
            <li> These didnt work as well as I was expecting, I would go over the same area multiple times and there would still be peach fuzz. I watched instruction videos on youtube so i am pretty sure i was doing it right. I prob will not use again because it was too time consuming and the results weren&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> These are just terrible. Don&#x27;t buy these. They don&#x27;t even take off any hair... Tried on face first, had no succes so tried on my arm and after vigorously scraping at my arm hair did I finally manage to shave anything off. Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right, but I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on these...</li>
            <li> An absolute waste of money!  Two of the cheap plastic razors completely fell apart after three uses, with the blades falling out within the first week.  Furthermore, one of the blades that fell out was rusted.  Rusty razors create an unacceptable risk.  I haven&#x27;t even attempted to use the third one.  I would NEVER get these again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see that it did anything.  Totally disappointed as it came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like these. Works well</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. They are kind of large for eyebrows but they work just fine. If you are using these for the first time be careful because they are very sharp when you first get them. Also they could cause irritation if you have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;d say some sort of aftershave may be necessary (or pinterest home remedy).

            <li> Yeah so this was not very pleasant to use at all.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found these! I was using a regular razor on my face or the fine hairs, but these work so much better and can get all of the angles of my face.</li>

            <li> Great product a little long but serves the purpose.  Item quick to ship.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot. Works great</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even cut like it was suppose to. Useless!</li>
            <li> They do not work at all not sharp and horrible. A waste of money</li>
            <li> So easy to use!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I really love them I think they work great. They are even better than I though they would be.</li>
            <li> Good idea and somewhat functional but not sharp enough.  Requires you to go over areas multiple times.</li>
            <li> I liked the razor.  I was able to shave my face, upper lip, chin, eyebrows and I even shaved my legs with it.  I gave one to my friend but she said she cut herself with it (she probably didn&#x27;t have it at a 45 degree angle).  Anyway, she ended up using it as a &amp;#34;seam ripper&amp;#34; (she sews) and said it worked great.  Great price and great product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast. Great product, works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these tinkle razors from sally&#x27;s they worked great. Thought these would be the same since they say there the same brand but they don&#x27;t work well at all! Very dispointed.</li>
            <li> These little razors are great. They are sharp enough to cut the little brow hairs yet they will not cut your skin. A little learning curve on how to angle the razor. Simple and effective. Leaves skin very smooth. However, the blade is kind of large for tight spots under the brow. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> It works but the plastic that holds the blade in place broke off of 4 of them!</li>
            <li> These work! be careful very sharp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used these things before, so I&#x27;m not sure how well they should work. I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to come in a plastic bag with no brand name on the &amp;#34;package&amp;#34; nor on the item itself though.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand based no a blog review. It is supposed to be the best one out there. It works well on the face, but takes some getting used to. The plastic sticks out a little so I scratched myself with it the first time and had a red line for a few days. You CANNOT use them on eyebrows. They are a little wide so unless you are shaving the whole brow off it is clunky and borderline dangerous. I was able to use it above the browline for a few stray hairs there. It is perfect for upper lip, chin and jawline. No irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough but works</li>
            <li> they work exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> Missing parts and opened packaging</li>
            <li> After watching Michelle Money from the Bachelor on YouTube I decided to give these bad boys a try.  They&#x27;re awesome at removing facial hair without leaving razor burn.  Shaving your face is a great exfoliator &amp; removes excess facial hair.  Your hair doesn&#x27;t come back thicker or darker.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this little secret.  My face is so soft &amp; my makeup applies much easier.  If you&#x27;re willing to try this these are the razors for you.  Use small quick strokes so you don&#x27;t knick your face with the ends.  Make sure to tone &amp; use moisturizer with each shave.  Should be done weekly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it, I tried these after reading about them on Buzzfeed. I have never used this style of face-razor before so it was a new experience. They give a pretty clean shave, with some pulling on the coarser hair (I used them to &#x27;clean up&#x27; the little hairs at my hairline). They didn&#x27;t seem particularly sharp, but if you are using these for razor-exfoliation they might work well. I will say that they never cut me; they have guards on each side to prevent nicks. I have no experience with other brands but these seem a little cheaply made in general, like a bottom of the line Bic disposable razor. One of the razors blades had a bend in it. I think these might be a really good place to start if you want to try this sort of grooming product.</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow razors. One of the razors didnt work so I am glad they are affordable.</li>
            <li> I have been reading a lot about dermaplaning.  As an esthetician I like to try new things for the skin always.  The razors arrived really fast in two days and were well packaged.  I found the razor easy to use on my face and took my time and achieved a really nice smooth face.  I did remove a substantial amount of dry dead skin even though I use a microdermabrasion machine regularly.  I will definitely use again and will repurchase this particular one as I really like it.</li>
            <li> Razors are too sharp to use on delicate facial skin.  I&#x27;ll try again, but my first try caused a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. In addition to it not working (dull razors) the plastic holding the razor in place came apart and the razor fell out. Luckily the razor wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to cut my face open as it would have if it wasn&#x27;t so dull. Wish the quality was better.</li>
