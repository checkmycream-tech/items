            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>I have tried many products and this one is easily my favorite.  </li>

            <li>love how it make my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several others and find this one works best for me.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>I Love it,</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used most out there.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product, really helped my hair</li>
            <li>Will definitely be a continuing user for sure!!!!!!</li>
            <li>but this one has been the best stuff I have ever used especially after I color my hair!  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I buy so many products to give my hair some shine and reduce frizz</li>
            <li>but most things do not work at all.</li>
            <li>My hair just didn&#x27;t look healthy, the shine was short-lived, and I had frizzies here in the humid Southeast.</li>
            <li>I am debating on returning it or just twisting off the top every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I will use one more pump spread through out my hair before straightening.  </li>
            <li>and it gives it a healthy (not greasy) looking shine.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes my hair feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li>A costly wish it had help my hair more.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t rate excellent because I found a Paul Mitchell product that works the same</li>
            <li>I simply love the scent and texture of these silk drops.</li>
            <li>It does everything they say it will and more.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice too(very mild scent).</li>
            <li>It is a great detangler, keeps hair soft and awesome for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>and it is great on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>all I have to do is scrunch my hair right after the shower and looks nice and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair is now healing and this helps to smooth and maintain most of my baby fine hair fly-aways to the point of looking and feeling like I stepped out of a magazine ad.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products like this, but L&#x27;anza works the best for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Healing Strength Neem Plant Silk Serum by L&#x27;anza (3.4 oz) and it was shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My hair frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>I recieve daily compliants on how beautiful my hair looks</li>
            <li>My hair qualifiies as aging (over 50) and fine.  </li>
            <li>It has added &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for adding shine and softness for fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily after the shower and it leaves my hair frizz free and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Light weight oil for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I use a little of this and my hair looks GREAT!  </li>
            <li>I dont know how it does it, but it gives my hair incredible, healthy shine without weighing it down or making me look like I&#x27;ve gone a week without washing it!  </li>
            <li>Nice gentle smell.</li>
            <li>I smooth it on before blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic too.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair smooth as silk and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>So, even though I was happy with my current set of hair products, I came shopping.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>, it moisturizes without leaving my hair oily and heavy, I love it !!!</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>My hair gets dry, and this products works really great for me.  </li>
            <li>nothing special.  </li>
            <li>The seller was very fast and the price is great compare to local salon prices !</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and love the way it keeps my very curly hair behave.  </li>
            <li>Great for adding shine and gives a nice flat ironed look when styled as such.</li>
            <li>I havent noticed any change worthy of the price</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, I have VERY dry hair, a quick application really softens it.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but curly rather than straight, and tends towards being frizzy.</li>
            <li>so I consider it well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>about $6 worth</li>
            <li>It is also not aggravating to my skin which is highly sensitive to most product.</li>
            <li>I have uses many before and by far this beat all of them.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite--smells amazing, and makes hair so soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth</li>
            <li>I love how this silk serum makes my hair feel - so soft, silky and moist.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair sooo soft and light!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff -- and it doesn&#x27;t weight down my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I can only say that it is a unique and extremely satisfying product.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but you have to be very careful not to use too much-</li>
            <li>was tempted to toss this out, but humid weather is right around the corner</li>
            <li>I put this serum on right after I come out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and full of body, natural looking shine.  </li>
            <li>Top quality hair oil that isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy and absorbs easily into the hair protecting it from heat !</li>
            <li>Still, there’s absolutely nothing special about this serum,</li>
            <li>After using a very little bit of this product my hair looks great and holds its curl and style.  </li>
            <li>Only thing that has saved my hair and keeps it strong healing it after being overly processed !</li>
            <li>I know that most mass market “shine serums” use silicone as their main ingredient, but I expected better quality ingredients from a higher-end brand that’s sold in salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After putting this stuff in her hair it comes out so soft and easily.  </li>
            <li>This serum is light and does not weigh my hair down at all, It leaves it shiny but not dirty and oily looking like most products will.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my hairdresser who introduced me to this product !  </li>
            <li>You must try this if you really care about your hair and are in need of some healing hair therapy !</li>
            <li>but this one reAlly helps to make my hair feel like a million dollars!</li>
            <li>so I can bring it higher up the hair shaft</li>
            <li>It just felt so soft and looked beautiful after I dried my hair.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THIS AFTER GETTING MARRIED IN JAMAICA.</li>
            <li>First time buying it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The product is amazing, but I received it with a broken top that is why I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very, very heavily-scented, and the smell clashes with my own scent (which is green and oak-mossy).</li>
            <li>The treated hair became drier, and this was less effective than I&#x27;d like in shining up that drier hair.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 10 days and each time I liked it less.</li>
            <li>certainly nothing to warrant the salon product price tag.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend using the marching Lanza Healing shampoo ( same color bottle ) that is the same as this serum , I purchase them together and my hair is a million times better, can&#x27;t wait to keep using these truly valuable products !</li>
            <li>Very highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have been using it and it does work very well.  </li>
            <li>The shipping delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>It smells divine and really helps control the frizz.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is a real treat.</li>
            <li>Hair stays silky, shiny and straight, or when I just want my hair to be wavy</li>
            <li>Squirt it into your palm and gently tap onto hair while hair is damp to avoid over saturating &amp; looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell that it did much of anything</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for curly hair!</li>
            <li>I do really like this serum because it does not make my hair greasy</li>
            <li>My hair was very damage</li>
            <li>and I was losing so much hair all the time no matter what.</li>
            <li>and I think is already time to say that really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also smells really</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not finding any difference using this stuff, except that if I use too much, my hair comes out kinda greasy-looking.</li>
            <li>Thank you for my fast and prompt ordered.</li>
            <li>This really helps my hair.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>Yes, if you do too much your hair will appear and feel oily.  </li>
            <li>It really is all you need.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper on amazon than my salon.thankyou</li>
            <li>and my hair fells much soft right after I apply.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft and controls the static in the dry winter.</li>
            <li>I had asked other buyers if they used this in place of an oil and many had said yes and that they even prefer it to an oil.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, only need small amount, gives great shine and texture.  </li>
            <li>I use 1-2 pumps of the product onto my towel dried hair and my hair is loft feeling super soft and manageable with a healthy kick to it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much of the product but it helps my hair feel healthy without being heavy.</li>
            <li>; about this particular product.</li>
            <li>Great for my thick curly hair that tends to frizz!!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Better and cheaper than Moroccon Oil, which left my hair flat and oily.</li>
            <li>Put some one Friday night, a little more Saturday night, and then on Sunday night washed it out, already this morning two compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much your hair can start to separate a bit and look a tad greasy, but as my hair us super dry and fried, that doesn&#x27;t happen too often.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, shiny, and really stops frizz.  </li>
            <li>I mix a squirt of this with mousse and smooth through my wet hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra money to get this instead of a cheaper brand like got 2b or Herbal Essence.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair every day and this serum definitely helps keep it healthy and protect against the damage from the dryer.  </li>
            <li>I always let it dry naturally and even thought this product just makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>Small amount gives great shine to hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Does make my hair very soft but it also takes away some of the body.</li>
            <li>The first 5 ingredients listed on the back of the bottle are all some variation of silicone.  </li>
            <li>I use 1 squirt every other day and it has helped the texture of my hair significantly.  </li>
            <li>Mars my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Smells great, only takes a tiny tiny bit, but a little bit too heavy/greasy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and after coloring it, it is a little brittle.  </li>
            <li>I use 2 pumps on my wet hair and 1 more after it is dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky</li>
            <li>i used to buy this directly from my hairdresser at a cost of $22.00.  </li>
            <li>This helps control that and bring out my natural wave.</li>
            <li>(I have naturally wavy hair)</li>
            <li>forgot how soft it made my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way my hair looks and think next weekend with try it again.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>The price was considerably lower</li>
            <li>This is NOT a good product for fine hair, even when used very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>As with all hair product the less you use the more days you can go without having to wash your hair daily which dries it out further....</li>
            <li>If you have long hairs then this product is a real blessing.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE LONG STRAIGHT HAIR</li>
            <li>I have thin, straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Be cautious about how much you use, too much makes hair look a little greasy.</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase this again when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>I do find that it adds shine (there’s certainly enough silicone in it!), but even the tiniest amount leaves my hair looking very flat and stick straight.  </li>
            <li>I am a male, 36 years old, I since cut my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, longer than shoulder-length hair, and I use about a pump, then a bit more after it starts to dry.</li>
            <li>It is alcohol free, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down like silk oil and other oils.</li>
            <li>Live in PacNW but was traveling in NJ and went to unknown established hair salon.  </li>
            <li>You can use product on wet or dry hair and will make hair much softer.  </li>
            <li>It really tames the flyaway hair and gives little shine.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so start sparingly when first using.</li>
            <li>I find if I use it everyday, it is too soft, and the curl doesn&#x27;t last long; but every other day is just right.  </li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>

            <li> I Love it,</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used most out there.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product, really helped my hair</li>
            <li> Will definitely be a continuing user for sure!!!!!!</li>
            <li> but this one has been the best stuff I have ever used especially after I color my hair!  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I buy so many products to give my hair some shine and reduce frizz</li>
            <li> but most things do not work at all.</li>
            <li> My hair just didn&#x27;t look healthy, the shine was short-lived, and I had frizzies here in the humid Southeast.</li>
            <li> I am debating on returning it or just twisting off the top every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I will use one more pump spread through out my hair before straightening.  </li>
            <li> and it gives it a healthy (not greasy) looking shine.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my hair feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li> A costly wish it had help my hair more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rate excellent because I found a Paul Mitchell product that works the same</li>
            <li> I simply love the scent and texture of these silk drops.</li>
            <li> It does everything they say it will and more.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice too(very mild scent).</li>
            <li> It is a great detangler, keeps hair soft and awesome for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> and it is great on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> all I have to do is scrunch my hair right after the shower and looks nice and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is now healing and this helps to smooth and maintain most of my baby fine hair fly-aways to the point of looking and feeling like I stepped out of a magazine ad.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products like this, but L&#x27;anza works the best for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Healing Strength Neem Plant Silk Serum by L&#x27;anza (3.4 oz) and it was shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My hair frizzes easily.</li>
            <li> I recieve daily compliants on how beautiful my hair looks</li>
            <li> My hair qualifiies as aging (over 50) and fine.  </li>
            <li> It has added &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for adding shine and softness for fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily after the shower and it leaves my hair frizz free and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Light weight oil for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I use a little of this and my hair looks GREAT!  </li>
            <li> I dont know how it does it, but it gives my hair incredible, healthy shine without weighing it down or making me look like I&#x27;ve gone a week without washing it!  </li>
            <li> Nice gentle smell.</li>
            <li> I smooth it on before blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic too.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair smooth as silk and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> So, even though I was happy with my current set of hair products, I came shopping.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> , it moisturizes without leaving my hair oily and heavy, I love it !!!</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry, and this products works really great for me.  </li>
            <li> nothing special.  </li>
            <li> The seller was very fast and the price is great compare to local salon prices !</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and love the way it keeps my very curly hair behave.  </li>
            <li> Great for adding shine and gives a nice flat ironed look when styled as such.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed any change worthy of the price</li>
            <li> Super product.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, I have VERY dry hair, a quick application really softens it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but curly rather than straight, and tends towards being frizzy.</li>
            <li> so I consider it well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> about $6 worth</li>
            <li> It is also not aggravating to my skin which is highly sensitive to most product.</li>
            <li> I have uses many before and by far this beat all of them.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite--smells amazing, and makes hair so soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth</li>
            <li> I love how this silk serum makes my hair feel - so soft, silky and moist.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair sooo soft and light!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff -- and it doesn&#x27;t weight down my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I can only say that it is a unique and extremely satisfying product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but you have to be very careful not to use too much-</li>
            <li> was tempted to toss this out, but humid weather is right around the corner</li>
            <li> I put this serum on right after I come out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and full of body, natural looking shine.  </li>
            <li> Top quality hair oil that isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy and absorbs easily into the hair protecting it from heat !</li>
            <li> Still, there’s absolutely nothing special about this serum,</li>
            <li> After using a very little bit of this product my hair looks great and holds its curl and style.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that has saved my hair and keeps it strong healing it after being overly processed !</li>
            <li> I know that most mass market “shine serums” use silicone as their main ingredient, but I expected better quality ingredients from a higher-end brand that’s sold in salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After putting this stuff in her hair it comes out so soft and easily.  </li>
            <li> This serum is light and does not weigh my hair down at all, It leaves it shiny but not dirty and oily looking like most products will.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my hairdresser who introduced me to this product !  </li>
            <li> You must try this if you really care about your hair and are in need of some healing hair therapy !</li>
            <li> but this one reAlly helps to make my hair feel like a million dollars!</li>
            <li> so I can bring it higher up the hair shaft</li>
            <li> It just felt so soft and looked beautiful after I dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS AFTER GETTING MARRIED IN JAMAICA.</li>
            <li> First time buying it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The product is amazing, but I received it with a broken top that is why I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very heavily-scented, and the smell clashes with my own scent (which is green and oak-mossy).</li>
            <li> The treated hair became drier, and this was less effective than I&#x27;d like in shining up that drier hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 10 days and each time I liked it less.</li>
            <li> certainly nothing to warrant the salon product price tag.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using the marching Lanza Healing shampoo ( same color bottle ) that is the same as this serum , I purchase them together and my hair is a million times better, can&#x27;t wait to keep using these truly valuable products !</li>
            <li> Very highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using it and it does work very well.  </li>
            <li> The shipping delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> It smells divine and really helps control the frizz.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is a real treat.</li>
            <li> Hair stays silky, shiny and straight, or when I just want my hair to be wavy</li>
            <li> Squirt it into your palm and gently tap onto hair while hair is damp to avoid over saturating &amp; looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell that it did much of anything</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for curly hair!</li>
            <li> I do really like this serum because it does not make my hair greasy</li>
            <li> My hair was very damage</li>
            <li> and I was losing so much hair all the time no matter what.</li>
            <li> and I think is already time to say that really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also smells really</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not finding any difference using this stuff, except that if I use too much, my hair comes out kinda greasy-looking.</li>
            <li> Thank you for my fast and prompt ordered.</li>
            <li> This really helps my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> Yes, if you do too much your hair will appear and feel oily.  </li>
            <li> It really is all you need.  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper on amazon than my salon.thankyou</li>
            <li> and my hair fells much soft right after I apply.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft and controls the static in the dry winter.</li>
            <li> I had asked other buyers if they used this in place of an oil and many had said yes and that they even prefer it to an oil.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, only need small amount, gives great shine and texture.  </li>
            <li> I use 1-2 pumps of the product onto my towel dried hair and my hair is loft feeling super soft and manageable with a healthy kick to it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much of the product but it helps my hair feel healthy without being heavy.</li>
            <li> ; about this particular product.</li>
            <li> Great for my thick curly hair that tends to frizz!!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Better and cheaper than Moroccon Oil, which left my hair flat and oily.</li>
            <li> Put some one Friday night, a little more Saturday night, and then on Sunday night washed it out, already this morning two compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much your hair can start to separate a bit and look a tad greasy, but as my hair us super dry and fried, that doesn&#x27;t happen too often.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft, shiny, and really stops frizz.  </li>
            <li> I mix a squirt of this with mousse and smooth through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra money to get this instead of a cheaper brand like got 2b or Herbal Essence.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every day and this serum definitely helps keep it healthy and protect against the damage from the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I always let it dry naturally and even thought this product just makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li> Small amount gives great shine to hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Does make my hair very soft but it also takes away some of the body.</li>
            <li> The first 5 ingredients listed on the back of the bottle are all some variation of silicone.  </li>
            <li> I use 1 squirt every other day and it has helped the texture of my hair significantly.  </li>
            <li> Mars my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Smells great, only takes a tiny tiny bit, but a little bit too heavy/greasy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and after coloring it, it is a little brittle.  </li>
            <li> I use 2 pumps on my wet hair and 1 more after it is dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky</li>
            <li> i used to buy this directly from my hairdresser at a cost of $22.00.  </li>
            <li> This helps control that and bring out my natural wave.</li>
            <li> (I have naturally wavy hair)</li>
            <li> forgot how soft it made my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way my hair looks and think next weekend with try it again.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> The price was considerably lower</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good product for fine hair, even when used very sparingly.  </li>
            <li> As with all hair product the less you use the more days you can go without having to wash your hair daily which dries it out further....</li>
            <li> If you have long hairs then this product is a real blessing.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE LONG STRAIGHT HAIR</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Be cautious about how much you use, too much makes hair look a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Will certainly purchase this again when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I do find that it adds shine (there’s certainly enough silicone in it!), but even the tiniest amount leaves my hair looking very flat and stick straight.  </li>
            <li> I am a male, 36 years old, I since cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, longer than shoulder-length hair, and I use about a pump, then a bit more after it starts to dry.</li>
            <li> It is alcohol free, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down like silk oil and other oils.</li>
            <li> Live in PacNW but was traveling in NJ and went to unknown established hair salon.  </li>
            <li> You can use product on wet or dry hair and will make hair much softer.  </li>
            <li> It really tames the flyaway hair and gives little shine.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so start sparingly when first using.</li>
            <li> I find if I use it everyday, it is too soft, and the curl doesn&#x27;t last long; but every other day is just right.  </li>
            <li> I use a flat iron and it takes my hair to the next level.</li>
            <li> but will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Using this on the ends of my hair makes it easier to create a curled effect with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> AND YOU USE A FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t weigh it down (good) but also only moderately deals with the frizz (bad).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or weigh it down but controls major frizz and hair feels silky!</li>
            <li> Product was described properly and was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I am going grey and letting it grow out.  </li>
            <li> I have a brown hair with about 25% grey.</li>
            <li> A lot also goes a long way with this product.  </li>
            <li> I use one pump when my hair is wet to protect it from the heat of the blow dyer and if I want some extra shine</li>
            <li> I have long colored blonde hair that gets rough and frizzy but no worries at all since using Lanza.</li>
            <li> I use it on my niece&#x27;s hair which is thick and tends to be really tangles.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try something else next time, but there&#x27;s certainly no hardship in using this product until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Have colored hair and trying to wash less so nice that this serum does not leave hair dirty looking or feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I have previously been pretty lazy about protecting and taking care of my hair and this product has made a difference in the feel and look of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this after buying several other Lanza products.</li>
            <li> that at the retail beauty supply which is a very long drive from my home.</li>
            <li> If you are having a probelm with dry, lifeless or frizzy hair, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> when my hair is dry, sometimes i apply to the ends.  </li>
            <li> When excess is distributed evenly, rub hands through hair &amp; then blow dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is supposed to “provide weightless shine and silky softness” when used on damp hair before blow drying or as a finishing serum on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> hair get dry out from swimming</li>
            <li> feeling so dry.</li>
            <li> Also helped me a lot with my dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it before using the blow dryer, my hair does not become dry or frizzy when I have used it.</li>
            <li> This is a must for frizzy or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;ve even put it on my dry hair and gone off to do errands.  </li>
            <li> I prefer Kenra Platinum blow dry spray to this any day.</li>
            <li> It works on hair from all types of climates; from the dry of Montana to the humid of southeast TX.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not applying it correctly, but I use is sparingly, and only from about halfway down the shaft to the end.</li>
            <li> This product helps to give my dry course hair moisture!</li>
            <li> It doesnt do anything different than other products you can buy at any other drug store cheaper.</li>
            <li> Can be applied wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very very dry shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> You need to use only little bit, rub it between your hands and glide it.</li>
            <li> but now I use a little bit of this and then apply oil only to my ends.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, so while it is pricey, it will last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> when my hair is wet, i start at the ends and work my way up.  </li>
            <li> you only need a few drops, i have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d just be careful with the amount.  </li>
            <li> so I expected alot...</li>
            <li> My only warning is not to be too heavy handed</li>
            <li> and I use it in combination with a leave in conditioner on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Wish it was less expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the price and lasts me quite a long time - probably a couple of months, and my hair is 2-3 inches below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I usually wash every other day and put this in before blow drying (with no other product).</li>
            <li> I have long hair with a slight wave.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little grape size dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can comb my very long wet hair in a few seconds with this product.  </li>
            <li> It is just a serum like any other.</li>
            <li> Use on damp hair, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy but it does make it extremely shiny.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair, use coconut oil or some other oil, work that through, then finish with 1 pump of this.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said it tends to make hair greasy around scalp</li>
            <li> I use this every day after my shower and even when my hair is dry and needs a little shine or frizz control.  </li>
            <li> dried wet hair and then comb through.  </li>
            <li> The product adds shine and smoothes the ends without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> This will weigh the hair down, so</li>
            <li> My hair is sleek and shiny but never oily or weighted down.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would leave my hair shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have an asymmetrical a-lined bob that at its longest comes down to about my collarbone.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and/or the texture is coarse, then you might like the “flattening” effect, but I’d still recommend using only a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> usually put it in my dry hair before I head off for a workout, and let the body heat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that this stuff makes my hair shiny, or any less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li> and I can probably use a little of this on the ends of my hair to control the dreaded frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Until I found this product I would wash and blow dry my hair and it would last no more than 30 minutes before it was straight, flat, fly-away and awful looking.</li>
            <li> ABout 1/4 of it was missing when I recieved the serum...</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I do a few sprays of the healing moisture</li>
            <li> I use it on just shampooed and towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use this over Morracan Oil because it is less greasy, but just as moistuzing with tons of added shine!</li>
            <li> Expensive serum that doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything different than other hair serums.  </li>
            <li> I have used other expensive oils that make my hair feel dry even though it contains</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything, and while it&#x27;s a small bottle mine has lasted me six months</li>
            <li> I have unruly, thick curls and this makes my hair shine and look silky.</li>
            <li> I mean it gives a shine to my curls without making them look too sleek.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and had the bad idea to put in highlights last summer at the crown.</li>
            <li> The pump is broken, but it&#x27;s not the sellers fault.</li>
            <li> The bad part: my hair tends to get used to something I use over a period of time and loses its effect.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair so not looking greasy from a product</li>
            <li> This “Silk Serum” is a disappointment.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best leave-in hair product I&#x27;ve used.  It makes my hair so soft, shiny, and really stops frizz.  A little bit goes a long way.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff -- and it doesn&#x27;t weight down my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Small amount gives great shine to hair without weighing it down.  Expensive but will last a long time.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have unruly, thick curls and this makes my hair shine and look silky. Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything, and while it&#x27;s a small bottle mine has lasted me six months and it&#x27;s not used up yet.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on my hair after I use this product.  Better and cheaper than Moroccon Oil, which left my hair flat and oily.</li>
            <li> mix with trauma treatment for a great treatment</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! I dont know how it does it, but it gives my hair incredible, healthy shine without weighing it down or making me look like I&#x27;ve gone a week without washing it!  Because lets face it, some of these serums just make us look like greaseballs! This is not one of them! I use 1-2 pumps of the product onto my towel dried hair and my hair is loft feeling super soft and manageable with a healthy kick to it.  Very highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best Hair Products Ever!!!</li>
            <li> I can comb my very long wet hair in a few seconds with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.  My hair is shiny and soft - what else could I ask for in a product?  My hair is colored to cover gray.  Not since pre-coloring days has my hair looked so good.  The product smells very good.  Pineappley and coconut.  Two squirts do it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky</li>
            <li> I tried to give myself a home perm and totally fried my hair.  I went online to look for products and came about a list of socalled \\&quot;best\\&quot; brands to buy.  I purchased the Healing Strength Neem Plant Silk Serum by L&#x27;anza (3.4 oz) and it was shipped very quickly.  I have been using it and it does work very well.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but you don&#x27;t need a lot so I consider it well worth the price.  If you are having a probelm with dry, lifeless or frizzy hair, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  It makes my hair feel like silk! I am getting more for Christmas gifts for the family.  The shipping delivery was fast.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It doesnt do anything different than other products you can buy at any other drug store cheaper. It is just a serum like any other.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for years.  it is wonderful, leaves the hair soft and shiney.  i used to buy this directly from my hairdresser at a cost of $22.00.  now i look online for the bargain.  when my hair is wet, i start at the ends and work my way up.  when my hair is dry, sometimes i apply to the ends.  you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a splurge. It is too expensive to buy all the time, but my curly hair really enjoyed it during Summer.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair serum on the market, and Amazon offers it at a great price!</li>
            <li> By far best hair serum ever!!!! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it! Doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or weigh it down but controls major frizz and hair feels silky! Use on damp hair, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Keeps hair from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft and controls the static in the dry winter.</li>
            <li> If you have long hairs then this product is a real blessing. I just use on my locks avoiding the scalp. It really tames the flyaway hair and gives little shine. You need to use only little bit, rub it between your hands and glide it. Smells nice too(very mild scent).</li>
            <li> Does make my hair very soft but it also takes away some of the body.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years along with the L&#x27;Anza healing and smoother  and it is great on my naturally curly hair.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have found to make my hair soft and silky.  I absolutely love it.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy but it does make it extremely shiny.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every day and this serum definitely helps keep it healthy and protect against the damage from the dryer.  It smells divine and really helps control the frizz.  Love it!</li>
            <li> this stuff is a real treat. you only need a few drops, i have shoulder length hair. makes it silky and detangles too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  Thanks to my hairdresser who introduced me to this product !  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> My hair frizzes easily. This helps control that and bring out my natural wave. I mix a squirt of this with mousse and smooth through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> ABout 1/4 of it was missing when I recieved the serum...about $6 worth but it was too big of a pain to return it.  I havent noticed any change worthy of the price...go with the drugstore brand!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;High grade, it moisturizes without leaving my hair oily and heavy, I love it !!!&amp;#34; - My wife.</li>
            <li> Miracle in a bottle that smells so lovely ! Only thing that has saved my hair and keeps it strong healing it after being overly processed ! Top quality hair oil that isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy and absorbs easily into the hair protecting it from heat ! Once it is activated by heat your hair looks better, love to smooth more on after my hair is styled for a sleek finish ! The smell is so beautiful and light like something tropical. The seller was very fast and the price is great compare to local salon prices ! Excellent customer service , will continue to purchase here ! You must try this if you really care about your hair and are in need of some healing hair therapy ! I would recommend using the marching Lanza Healing shampoo ( same color bottle ) that is the same as this serum , I purchase them together and my hair is a million times better, can&#x27;t wait to keep using these truly valuable products !</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I have been using this for sometime now and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy or oily. Hair stays silky, shiny and straight, or when I just want my hair to be wavy (I have naturally wavy hair) all I have to do is scrunch my hair right after the shower and looks nice and silky.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have long, thick hair.  I use 2 pumps on my wet hair and 1 more after it is dry.  It definitely adds an immediate shine.  I have to be careful not to get it near my temples or part, because it will give a greasy appearance.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product for smooth, healthy hair! Squirt it into your palm and gently tap onto hair while hair is damp to avoid over saturating &amp; looking greasy.  Stay away from roots. When excess is distributed evenly, rub hands through hair &amp; then blow dry.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best stuff I have ever used in my hair...I love it and all the L&#x27;anza products</li>
            <li> Nice gentle smell. My hair seems to like it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  My hair qualifiies as aging (over 50) and fine.  The product adds shine and smoothes the ends without weighing it down.  A small amount goes a long way, so while it is pricey, it will last quite awhile.  I have tried many products and this one is easily my favorite.  Will certainly purchase this again when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell that it did much of anything</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry, and this products works really great for me.  I smooth it on before blow drying my hair.  It gives my hair moisture, but does not look greasy.  I have tried other products like this, but L&#x27;anza works the best for me.</li>
            <li> I’m a fan of the L’ANZA hair care line; I’ve been using their shampoos and conditioners for years.  This “Silk Serum” is a disappointment.  The first 5 ingredients listed on the back of the bottle are all some variation of silicone.  I know that most mass market “shine serums” use silicone as their main ingredient, but I expected better quality ingredients from a higher-end brand that’s sold in salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is supposed to “provide weightless shine and silky softness” when used on damp hair before blow drying or as a finishing serum on dry hair.  I do find that it adds shine (there’s certainly enough silicone in it!), but even the tiniest amount leaves my hair looking very flat and stick straight.  This is NOT a good product for fine hair, even when used very sparingly.  This will weigh the hair down, so if you’re looking for fullness and volume this is going to work against you.  If your hair is thick and/or the texture is coarse, then you might like the “flattening” effect, but I’d still recommend using only a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to toss this out, but humid weather is right around the corner and I can probably use a little of this on the ends of my hair to control the dreaded frizzies.  Still, there’s absolutely nothing special about this serum, certainly nothing to warrant the salon product price tag.  You can pick up just about any drugstore shine serum at a quarter of the price and it’ll work just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First five ingredients listed on the back of the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*cyclopentasiloxane&lt;br /&gt;*dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;*c. methicone&lt;br /&gt;*p. trimethicone&lt;br /&gt;*p. dimethicone</li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell absolutely wonderful, my hair has never been healthier.  Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for curly hair. Tames frizzy hair and adds shine! I highly recommend it for curly hair!</li>
            <li> Light weight oil for fine hair. It is also not aggravating to my skin which is highly sensitive to most product.</li>
            <li> I have finally faced the fact that when you are over 60 your hair is different and regular products don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried every gloss and nothing worked, no shine or silky feeling. I tried this one because I did a bit of research and this came up for aging hair.This serum makes my hair silky and shiny. A miracle worker.</li>
            <li> This work Great.  love how it make my hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;my hair get dry out from swimming so this Help it&lt;br /&gt;from feeling so dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 years and it works well for my curls. I mean it gives a shine to my curls without making them look too sleek.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  This product helps to give my dry course hair moisture! I have used other expensive oils that make my hair feel dry even though it contains oils- but this one reAlly helps to make my hair feel like a million dollars!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, I have VERY dry hair, a quick application really softens it. Can be applied wet or dry. I&#x27;ve tried several others and find this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight, fine hair.  I use a little of this and my hair looks GREAT!  Until I found this product I would wash and blow dry my hair and it would last no more than 30 minutes before it was straight, flat, fly-away and awful looking. After using a very little bit of this product my hair looks great and holds its curl and style.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> My stylist started me on this years ago!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must for longer hair with silky not sticky comb outs!</li>
            <li> I bought this after buying several other Lanza products. I had asked other buyers if they used this in place of an oil and many had said yes and that they even prefer it to an oil. One buyer told me she uses this in conjunction with an oil, which I thought was a great idea since my hair gets used to products. I was using it interchangeably with an oil but now I use a little bit of this and then apply oil only to my ends. I do this because I feel the ends of my hair still need that extra boost and tlc. I do really like this serum because it does not make my hair greasy so I can bring it higher up the hair shaft then I would an oil. I have very thin hair so not looking greasy from a product is always a plus.Before I put this in my hair I do a few sprays of the healing moisture and I am loving them together. The texture of my hair has changed without any build up or added weight. I would say if you&#x27;re thinking about get this then get it.</li>
            <li> Not as great, as I thought from reviews.  Be cautious about how much you use, too much makes hair look a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have uses many before and by far this beat all of them. The bad part: my hair tends to get used to something I use over a period of time and loses its effect. I recommend alternating after finishing each bottle to keep on having the same results.</li>
            <li> Product was described properly and was what I expected.  I would recommend this product to anyone who would want to use it.</li>
            <li> The absolute best thing about this serum is its magical smell - every time I wear it someone near me asks what smells so good! It was recommended in a beauty magazine article to make your hair shinier, which it definitely does. I color my hair and had the bad idea to put in highlights last summer at the crown. The treated hair became drier, and this was less effective than I&#x27;d like in shining up that drier hair. My hair is fine but curly rather than straight, and tends towards being frizzy. I usually wash every other day and put this in before blow drying (with no other product). This doesn&#x27;t weigh it down (good) but also only moderately deals with the frizz (bad). I think I&#x27;ll try something else next time, but there&#x27;s certainly no hardship in using this product until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this before from my beauty shop and really liked it so was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have long hair with a slight wave.  I like to straighten it but don&#x27;t get the ends like a hair dresser gets them.  This product is terrific.  My hair turns out like silk without being greasy~!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite--smells amazing, and makes hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I use this every day after my shower and even when my hair is dry and needs a little shine or frizz control.  Smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of Good Housekeeping.  It was in my medicine cabinet for awhile until I ran out out Moroccan Oil and I started using it again this weekend.  I Love it, forgot how soft it made my hair.  I actually used it as a deep conditioner all weekend.  Put some one Friday night, a little more Saturday night, and then on Sunday night washed it out, already this morning two compliments on my hair.  I have very very dry shoulder length hair.  I am going grey and letting it grow out.  I really like the way my hair looks and think next weekend with try it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel wonderful and look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it. I hope to purchase this again. Thank you for making such good stuff.</li>
            <li> With the L&#x27;Anza shampoo and a bit of moisturizer, this will keep the frizzies at bay...As with all hair product the less you use the more days you can go without having to wash your hair daily which dries it out further....the vicious cycle of hair care  - so I&#x27;d just be careful with the amount.  It&#x27;s a lovely product and I&#x27;ve used most out there.  It&#x27;s lighter, non-oily and works!</li>
            <li> I live/breath by this product! I used to purchase at my salon, so was happy to find on Amazon Prime.  I put on my towel dried wet hair and then comb through.  It is a great detangler, keeps hair soft and awesome for dry hair.  LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but you have to be very careful not to use too much- it can get greasy in a hurry!</li>
            <li> this is a great product, really helped my hair</li>
            <li> my hairdresser told me this is the best product ever... so I expected alot... its good, but not that amazing...</li>
            <li> I cannot do without this product. When I use this, my hair looks so amazing and perfect. Smooth and full of body, natural looking shine.  I have relaxed hair but I only relax twice a year and this product helps my new growth blend perfectly with the straightened part (4b medium hair). My only warning is not to be too heavy handed and I use it in combination with a leave in conditioner on wet hair. I use a flat iron and it takes my hair to the next level.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Neem Oil from my stylist. I can only say that it is a unique and extremely satisfying product. It is alcohol free, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down like silk oil and other oils. My daughter and I use it daily and we LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years. I have long colored blonde hair that gets rough and frizzy but no worries at all since using Lanza. My hair is sleek and shiny but never oily or weighted down. This stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold (though it is weightless).</li>
            <li> I just tried this product because the reviews that I read here. It´s really GOOD! OMG!!! My hair was very damage and I was losing so much hair all the time no matter what. I have been using this product for two weeks now and I think is already time to say that really works.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the shampoo and conditioner from the same line ( Healing Strength) so I have been using than combined. After I wash my hair I use on pump of the serum from the middle of my hair until the end and my hair fells much soft right after I apply. I always let it dry naturally and even thought this product just makes my hair so smooth. Also smells really good!&lt;br /&gt;Now my hair fells an look health and shine. Also helped me a lot with my dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;I definitively recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not finding any difference using this stuff, except that if I use too much, my hair comes out kinda greasy-looking. Oh, and my hair smells like marshmallows. It&#x27;s very, very heavily-scented, and the smell clashes with my own scent (which is green and oak-mossy). I have no idea why hair products hafta be soooo heavily-scented; the scent invariably clashes with whatever scents we prefer to wear. I don&#x27;t find that this stuff makes my hair shiny, or any less frizzy. Whether I wear it or not, I see no difference at all. It appears to do nothing but impart a LOT of fragrance that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> My beautician recommended it. I bought it, but then  I ran out and reordered from you. Thank you for my fast and prompt ordered. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Best serum!!  I use this over Morracan Oil because it is less greasy, but just as moistuzing with tons of added shine!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Using this on the ends of my hair makes it easier to create a curled effect with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Super product. I am using this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner and it has literally transformed my hair. My hair is now healing and this helps to smooth and maintain most of my baby fine hair fly-aways to the point of looking and feeling like I stepped out of a magazine ad. It smells fantastic too. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another brand again, their products are too good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and love the way it keeps my very curly hair behave.  I use it before using the blow dryer, my hair does not become dry or frizzy when I have used it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell, and I found that it made my hair greasy, not silky. Maybe I&#x27;m not applying it correctly, but I use is sparingly, and only from about halfway down the shaft to the end. I haven&#x27;t even been using it since I got it because I am so displeased with it. I would recommend awapuhi oil instead.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!! I don&#x27;t go a day without using it. It makes my hair silky soft and shinny. I recieve daily compliants on how beautiful my hair looks</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and after coloring it, it is a little brittle.  I am trying to find a product that adds softness and movement.  I use 1 squirt every other day and it has helped the texture of my hair significantly.  I find if I use it everyday, it is too soft, and the curl doesn&#x27;t last long; but every other day is just right.  It has added &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; to my fine hair.  I recommend it for adding shine and softness for fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This serum is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever tried!! It leaves your hair smooth as silk and shiny all day. Never greasy or dulling!  I use it on just shampooed and towel dried hair. 1 pump is plenty to do the job and it smells wonderful. Will definitely be a continuing user for sure!!!!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love how this silk serum makes my hair feel - so soft, silky and moist.  I put this serum on right after I come out of the shower.  It just felt so soft and looked beautiful after I dried my hair.</li>
            <li> This really helps my hair. It detangles it, makes it shinier, and healthier. Wish it was less expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the price and lasts me quite a long time - probably a couple of months, and my hair is 2-3 inches below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I am a male, 36 years old, I since cut my hair.  But for the gray fly away&#x27;s this serum is the best I have used so far!</li>
            <li> Smells great, only takes a tiny tiny bit, but a little bit too heavy/greasy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used. It goes on easily after the shower and it leaves my hair frizz free and shiny.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great.Betterthan using conditioner.</li>
            <li> great for my curly hair</li>
            <li> This is a must for frizzy or dry hair.  Great for adding shine and gives a nice flat ironed look when styled as such.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair sooo soft and light!  I use it on my niece&#x27;s hair which is thick and tends to be really tangles.  After putting this stuff in her hair it comes out so soft and easily.  I have really curly hair and I have tried tons of products but this one has been the best stuff I have ever used especially after I color my hair!  I would and do recommend this product to anyone who will listen!!!  :)</li>
            <li> I buy so many products to give my hair some shine and reduce frizz but most things do not work at all. This serum is light and does not weigh my hair down at all, It leaves it shiny but not dirty and oily looking like most products will. I can use this several times during the day and it will not build up. Smells nice too. Ordered the shampoo/conditioner with hopes it will work just as well. Have colored hair and trying to wash less so nice that this serum does not leave hair dirty looking or feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum after reading about it in Good Housekeeping magazine. Their claim was that your hair would be 250% shinier. So, even though I was happy with my current set of hair products, I came shopping. BTW, competitive price Amazon, quick Prime shipping and arrived in perfect shape.  I was impressed the first couple of days, but I&#x27;d just been for a color touch up and highlights and I think my stylist probably deserves the credit for that. I used this product for 10 days and each time I liked it less. My hair just didn&#x27;t look healthy, the shine was short-lived, and I had frizzies here in the humid Southeast. So today this Serum went into the hair product graveyard under my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using this for a while, and have seen great results in the texture, health, and shine of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist kept asking me what I was doing for my hair....so I bought an extra bottle and took it to her!&lt;br /&gt;I usually put it in my dry hair before I head off for a workout, and let the body heat and yes even sweat help&lt;br /&gt;it to absorb into my hair!  And, I&#x27;ve even put it on my dry hair and gone off to do errands.  It&#x27;s especially great to&lt;br /&gt;put it in your hair before bed.  Yes, if you do too much your hair will appear and feel oily.  But, this stuff absorbs&lt;br /&gt;into the hair!!!</li>
            <li> Live in PacNW but was traveling in NJ and went to unknown established hair salon.  Hairdresser was shocked at the dryness of my hair and used this product while styling my hair. I absolutely loved it!  So, I purchased it and when I ran out of it a year later, I purchased online and have continued to do so ever since.  it 100% works for long, short, wild &amp; kooky, to long silky.</li>
            <li> Mars my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Expensive serum that doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything different than other hair serums.  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad but nothing special.  I hate getting my hands so greasy just to eliminate some flyaways.  I prefer Kenra Platinum blow dry spray to this any day.</li>
            <li> Nice serum for my colored,dry,frizzy, middle-age hair. A little goes a long way, so start sparingly when first using. I wash my hair, use coconut oil or some other oil, work that through, then finish with 1 pump of this. I have thick, longer than shoulder-length hair, and I use about a pump, then a bit more after it starts to dry. If you use too much your hair can start to separate a bit and look a tad greasy, but as my hair us super dry and fried, that doesn&#x27;t happen too often. I recommend it for problem hair.</li>
            <li> I only use 1 pump and put at the ends and underneath hair. Other reviews said it tends to make hair greasy around scalp so I just skipped that area. Works great. Helps keep hair from being frizzy and makes it shinier.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of L&#x27;anza products.  I apply the Healing Strenth Neem Plant Silk Serum on damp hair and style.  It really is all you need.  Weightless and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by Good Housekeeping. I have a brown hair with about 25% grey. I wanted something that would leave my hair shiny without weighing it down. I&#x27;m pleased with the product and use it almost everyday. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the price - but I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, but I received it with a broken top that is why I gave it three stars. The pump is broken, but it&#x27;s not the sellers fault. I am debating on returning it or just twisting off the top every time I use it. I love the product!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have previously been pretty lazy about protecting and taking care of my hair and this product has made a difference in the feel and look of my hair. A lot also goes a long way with this product.  I have an asymmetrical a-lined bob that at its longest comes down to about my collarbone. I use one pump when my hair is wet to protect it from the heat of the blow dyer and if I want some extra shine I will use one more pump spread through out my hair before straightening.  This stuff makes my hair feel so silky and it gives it a healthy (not greasy) looking shine. It is worth the extra money to get this instead of a cheaper brand like got 2b or Herbal Essence.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my hair feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Best hair conditioning treatment I have ever used. Non-greasy, only need small amount, gives great shine and texture.  Use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> This works as hoped. I don&#x27;t use much of the product but it helps my hair feel healthy without being heavy.</li>
            <li> this came in when promised and is a great product to use on any hair type and condition.  Great job</li>
            <li> Use it all the time! Leaves hair silky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for several years now. It works on hair from all types of climates; from the dry of Montana to the humid of southeast TX.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS AFTER GETTING MARRIED IN JAMAICA. THEY USED THIS ON MY HAIR FOR MY UPDO AND IT IS AWESOME AND SMELLS GREAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE, ESP IF YOU HAVE LONG STRAIGHT HAIR AND YOU USE A FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> I works great but leaves hands oily. A costly wish it had help my hair more. But you don&#x27;t know till you try it if it is going to work for&lt;br /&gt;your hair type</li>
            <li> Excellent! So much cheaper on amazon than my salon.thankyou</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised good price</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. Makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for my thick curly hair that tends to frizz!!  Just a little grape size dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a fix to frizzy/dry hair this is a good choice!  You can use product on wet or dry hair and will make hair much softer.  I didn&#x27;t rate excellent because I found a Paul Mitchell product that works the same so there is nothing &amp;#34;stand out&amp;#34; about this particular product.</li>
            <li> I simply love the scent and texture of these silk drops. My mom was the one who started using them and I was the one who ended up ordering them online all the time.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent.  It does everything they say it will and more.  First time buying it on Amazon.  The price was considerably lower that at the retail beauty supply which is a very long drive from my home.</li>
