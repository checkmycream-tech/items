            <li>just amazing!</li>
            <li>love love love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the original.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like was that while it healed my one pimple, it caused more pimples to form around it and cluster like never before.</li>
            <li>It seems to exacerbate the area and cause more zits to form.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to was able to find it here.</li>
            <li>It sure does do what it says it does and dries out my pimples for sure.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find anything that works better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product has not been effective in treating my mild acne.</li>
            <li>and her face is almost acne free.</li>
            <li>So the Clean and Clear is the closest thing I have found to keep my face fairly pimple free.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was looking for another brand of drying paste that wasn&#x27;t so \\&quot;new\\&quot; but Clean &amp; Clear was all they had</li>
            <li>It does the same thing without creating more blemishes, and it&#x27;s easy for on the go use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been consistently using this product for over a year now!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>But for something that literally saves my face, I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this a long time now and love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get my right chin to heal up from this paste.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the popped pimple pen it replaced, but still better than other similar products.</li>
            <li>I hope that Clean and Clear NEVER takes this off the shelves!!</li>
            <li>Now, to be fair, I&#x27;m not riddled with pimples, nor am I particularly prone to them, but for my one minor blemish issue, this stuff worked and it worked fast.</li>
            <li>That night, I put it on, was able to sleep with it on, and the next morning, my was encroaching</li>
            <li>But for what they claim in the name, it really works!    </li>

            <li>Sunday morning, pimple-threat-level was gaining, so I ran by a CVS &amp; picked up the Clean &amp; Clear Popped Pimple Relief Drying Paste.</li>
            <li>and I was still searching for something (over the counter or prescribed) that took my acne away fast without drying my skin too much.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all either.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just use it on popped pimples, it works very well for putting on spots you haven&#x27;t picked.</li>
            <li>This cream really does work.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how this product sped up the pimple healing process and dried it up.</li>
            <li>I wake up the next morning, gently rinse off the dried pate with warm water, and voila!</li>
            <li>pimple had receded to about half its original size and the throbbing was gone!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there to reduce the amount of acne, and so far this is my favorite little tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was pretty pricey for a tiny tube, but then I realized that all you need is a tiny bit for every pimple you have.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried just about half acne products available on the market.</li>
            <li>I am 19 years old, and I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne prone skin for some years now.</li>
            <li>Works really well &amp; by the next day you will see improvement in your skin.</li>
            <li>This one really does dry out the acne, allowing it to heal/go away faster.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything over the counter and other then Acutane most doctor prescribed products with little success.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very attractive when you put it on, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;ll rinse off the tiny wound, and dab on a tiny amount directly onto it.</li>
            <li>The bumps aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they&#x27;re considerably smaller in size and redness, I repeat the same process whenever I&#x27;m lounging around the house, and within a couple of days, there is no sign of any pimple (popped or not).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works well on the under the skin ones though.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this a long time now and love it!</li>
            <li> This work wonders on my face.  I see the difference  the next day.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this product sped up the pimple healing process and dried it up. What I didn&#x27;t like was that while it healed my one pimple, it caused more pimples to form around it and cluster like never before. I&#x27;m still trying to get my right chin to heal up from this paste. I would recommend the [[ASIN:B004J8T5R8 Clean &amp; Clear Advantaged Popped Pimple Relief, Gel Pen, On-The-Go]] over this product. It does the same thing without creating more blemishes, and it&#x27;s easy for on the go use!</li>
            <li> Saturday morning, I could feel the tell-tell signs of a pimple: a raised mound of skin, pinkish, &amp; throbbing. Unfortunately, I had to go out of town that day &amp; my tight schedule didn&#x27;t allow for me to stop by a store to pick something up.  Sunday morning, pimple-threat-level was gaining, so I ran by a CVS &amp; picked up the Clean &amp; Clear Popped Pimple Relief Drying Paste. To be honest, I was looking for another brand of drying paste that wasn&#x27;t so \\&quot;new\\&quot; but Clean &amp; Clear was all they had and I was desperate. That night, I put it on, was able to sleep with it on, and the next morning, my was encroaching pimple had receded to about half its original size and the throbbing was gone! Monday night, same routine and the next morning, all signs of my blemish was gone--just amazing! I know this stuff is supposed to be for pimples that have been popped, but it worked as a preventative for me.  Now, to be fair, I&#x27;m not riddled with pimples, nor am I particularly prone to them, but for my one minor blemish issue, this stuff worked and it worked fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 6 weeks ago. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and have severe environmental allergies with dry, sensitive, blemish prone skin. This product has not been effective in treating my mild acne. It&#x27;s very drying and almost makes my skin worse!  It seems to exacerbate the area and cause more zits to form.  Plus, it&#x27;s rather pricey for the amount of product you receive. It seems like a lot of great things are advertised on the packaging that are impossible to occur in the typical person&#x27;s 8-hour night sleep.. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the promises!</li>
            <li> I have had acne since puberty.  I&#x27;m now in my 30s and I was still searching for something (over the counter or prescribed) that took my acne away fast without drying my skin too much.  This paste does just that!  Within hours of noticing a breakout if I put this on, my pimple is gone!  It doesn&#x27;t take much at all either.  I put about the size of a tip of a ball point pen right on the zit itself and by the morning, its no longer painful and less red and on its way to gone!  I hope that Clean and Clear NEVER takes this off the shelves!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been consistently using this product for over a year now! While it doesn&#x27;t wok miracles, it is an excellent overnight spot treatment. I don&#x27;t just use it on popped pimples, it works very well for putting on spots you haven&#x27;t picked. Either way helps get rids of those occasional pesky zits faster.</li>
            <li> I have had an unsightly zit for DAYS smack dab in the middle of my eyebrows. It was painful and red because I couldn&#x27;t stop messing with it (bad I know, but it was huge). My usual acne spot cream I use by clean and clear wasn&#x27;t cutting it this time, and make up couldn&#x27;t even hide the beast. Desperate for relief I picked up a bottle of the popped pimple relief while at Walmart last night on a whim. I put it on before bed and when I woke up it was A LOT smaller and a lot less red and tender. I highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for its intended purpose: on popped pimples. I&#x27;ve had acnes for a few decades so I&#x27;ve tried just about half acne products available on the market. Last year I was blessed with serious cystic acne breakout for a few months, and each deep nodules would last for weeks and months. A lot of products prevent breakout and hasten recovery. But no product calms a big red bump after a popped pimple like this drying paste. Put it on at night, peel it off in the morning and you have a flat skin. Just don&#x27;t leave the house with this on the face, it&#x27;s very bright! This does not work that well for acnes that are still forming. But for what they claim in the name, it really works!    You get a very small tube. But for something that literally saves my face, I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> This cream really does work.  I&#x27;m always so skeptical about face products.  This one really does dry out the acne, allowing it to heal/go away faster.</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff!  overnight relief!</li>
            <li> Goes from a  pale blue to a  white color. I leave it on for hours. Very effective. Not damaging at all.</li>
            <li> This is affordable and takes care of the problem. I was glad to was able to find it here. I cannot find it locally.</li>
            <li> I use this as a spot treatment every night and it really does reduce the size of your pimples! I will always use this.</li>
            <li> I am 40 something and have been dealing with acne for years. I have tried almost everything over the counter and other then Acutane most doctor prescribed products with little success.&lt;br /&gt;This product works incredibly well for me. It dries the acne and my face is not oily when I use it. I use it at night and I mix a small amount in with my Epi-Duo in the morning under my make up to keep the oil down. Yes I still get break outs and probably always will. My doctor said unless I do the Acutane. Which I won&#x27;t do that because of the side effects. So the Clean and Clear is the closest thing I have found to keep my face fairly pimple free. My daughter is now using it as well and her face is almost acne free.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It sure does do what it says it does and dries out my pimples for sure. I&#x27;m not sure if it works well on the under the skin ones though. I haven&#x27;t seen any change when I put it on there.</li>
            <li> I am 19 years old, and I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne prone skin for some years now. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there to reduce the amount of acne, and so far this is my favorite little tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this when randomly browsing the acne washes at a local Duane Reade, and am I glad I decided to give this a chance. At first, I thought it was pretty pricey for a tiny tube, but then I realized that all you need is a tiny bit for every pimple you have. I think I read another review saying all you need is \\&quot;a ballpoint\\&quot; amount and it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, my acne has reduced to only random breakouts, and if I&#x27;m desperate enough, I&#x27;ll go ahead and pop them (I know, gross. It&#x27;s not good to pop them, blah, blah. Whatever, I do it.) Then I&#x27;ll rinse off the tiny wound, and dab on a tiny amount directly onto it. The paste dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family has commented on the fact that I look silly with random white dots on my face, but it&#x27;s an overnight paste, so I don&#x27;t really care because I don&#x27;t go out with it on. I wake up the next morning, gently rinse off the dried pate with warm water, and voila! The bumps aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they&#x27;re considerably smaller in size and redness, I repeat the same process whenever I&#x27;m lounging around the house, and within a couple of days, there is no sign of any pimple (popped or not).</li>
            <li> very good at the beginning but seems to lose potency after a few applications, which is solved applying bigger amounts</li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t live without it. I have yet to find anything that works better than this stuff. It&#x27;s not very attractive when you put it on, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the popped pimple pen it replaced, but still better than other similar products. Bring back the pen.</li>
            <li> Great product...works every time .</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Works really well &amp; by the next day you will see improvement in your skin. Directions on the product are vague on time frame to leave product on the skin, so base that on your skin conditions. Sucks that the company stopped making it!</li>
            <li> This shrinks pimples within hours.  If you put it on overnight the next morning the pimple is almost non existent.  Very good product and it works!</li>
    </ol>
