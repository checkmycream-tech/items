            <li>For me, it greatly reduces those creases and lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>I AM VERY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for laugh lines and others on your face.  </li>
            <li>It is the best product I have ever found for instantly improving the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>which made me wonder where it came from and is it fresh, with a good remaining shelf-life....</li>
            <li>bought it before, love it.</li>
            <li>5 stars great products keeps skin smooth and non greasy feeling recommend for older users.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that the lines around my eyes really look better.</li>
            <li>Made a difference in my fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Cannot rate it accurately.</li>
            <li>Order regularly ans most satisfied</li>
            <li>It is okay, but not any better than other products that I have tried for wrinkles</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I first purchased it while I was on a flight from Europe to United States.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, it works better then anything else for deep creases.  </li>
            <li>I am almost 29, and am using anti-wrinkle care because it&#x27;s better to do it prior to wrinkles as opposed to during.</li>
            <li>Way less $$$ and just as effective.  </li>
            <li>I use just a little and pat it on the creases to kind of fill them in.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this stuff all the time and remember really liking it</li>
            <li>While I intend to give it a chance, I can say without doubt that it does absolutely nothing to improve my wrinkles &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products but none of them work as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall, probably as effective as other products on the market.</li>
            <li>and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and it works better than any other product with same claims.</li>
            <li>This definitely works, been using it for years and can honestly say nothing else does the job at such a small price</li>
            <li>yet recently tried to and they didn&#x27;t carry this exact formula anymore and the similar one they had was a bit costly.</li>
            <li>Wow what an INSTANT difference.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptic but at 48 years of age, I could see those little wrinkles around my eyes were quickly becoming visible.  </li>

            <li> and I usually buy it at a department store and pay almost twice as much for it.</li>
            <li> This product blends minor lines, such as crows feet, but not deeper lines.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars is because its expensive and it did finally harden in the tube so its good the tube is small, but quite a bit of money for such a little tube.</li>
            <li> I had to return the item since I didn&#x27;t see any effect expected after trying this out for several times.</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t get my money back, I don&#x27;t want anyone else to waste their money on Tri-Aktiline Instant Deep Wrinkle Filler.</li>
            <li> but I think Tri-Aktiline is much better and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was just a little concerned that the packaging was written in Chinese or Japanese I think...</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I noticed a big difference!  </li>
            <li> given that this tube typically lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very dry and not easy to spread.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday before I put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> The directions also states that you can apply makeup, however when I applied a liquid makeup it covered my skin unevenly.</li>
            <li> However, I use it everyday and when re-doing make-up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes lines soften permanently, but for a few hours I don&#x27;t think I look like I have my lips around a straw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it should be like this.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at Kohl&#x27;s and even got a 2 oz.</li>
            <li> Its thick and fills those creases in  </li>
            <li> They drive me crazy.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted and could not go without it!!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that I immediately repackaged the item with the goal of requesting a refund and writing a review of my experience, however, this product is NON-RETURNABLE.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this for years and I usually buy it at a department store and pay almost twice as much for it. I was so happy to see it at this price. It is the best product I have ever found for instantly improving the appearance of wrinkles. I use it everyday before I put on my makeup.  I have tried many other products but none of them work as well. I am addicted and could not go without it!!</li>
            <li> It is okay, but not any better than other products that I have tried for wrinkles but I keep on using it in hope!</li>
            <li> This definitely works, been using it for years and can honestly say nothing else does the job at such a small price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for four weeks.  It has made no difference at all. I would not recommend it at all to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had to return the item since I didn&#x27;t see any effect expected after trying this out for several times. The texture is very dry and not easy to spread. I&#x27;m not sure whether it should be like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 yrs. and I can honestly say that the lines around my eyes really look better. I can see a difference within a couple of hours after using it. It will not make the lines go away but it does seem to keep them from getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Clinique and Avon but I think Tri-Aktiline is much better and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tri-Aktiline Instant Deep Wrinkle Filler since March 2010.  I first purchased it while I was on a flight from Europe to United States.  I was a little skeptic but at 48 years of age, I could see those little wrinkles around my eyes were quickly becoming visible.  I started using it and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.  Within a few weeks I noticed a big difference!  The fact that I have continued to use it speaks for itself.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this stuff all the time and remember really liking it so I decided to buy it again. While I intend to give it a chance, I can say without doubt that it does absolutely nothing to improve my wrinkles &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34;. I have used another instant wrinkle filler by Kiehl&#x27;s that does work but it is more expensive, I was out of it and decided to try this one again. Probably won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I have no basis on which to make a review yet.  The product has not arrived yet! Cannot rate it accurately.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for laugh lines and others on your face.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Been using for years.  5 stars great products keeps skin smooth and non greasy feeling recommend for older users.  Order regularly ans most satisfied</li>
            <li> Way less $$$ and just as effective.  I would recommend to anyone.  Made a difference in my fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product blends minor lines, such as crows feet, but not deeper lines. It&#x27;s neither a permanent solution, nor does continued use reduce the lines. Overall, probably as effective as other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I use this for the very deep creases between my eyebrows.  They drive me crazy.  I just ordered my 2nd tube and the 1st one lasted me about 6 months.  I use just a little and pat it on the creases to kind of fill them in. For me, it greatly reduces those creases and lasts most of the day. I also use it at night.  Although its not a permanent fix, but I do think if you use it every day,  over time it does reduce the lines or wrinkles.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because its expensive and it did finally harden in the tube so its good the tube is small, but quite a bit of money for such a little tube. Regardless, it works better then anything else for deep creases.  Its thick and fills those creases in  so I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Estoy en prueba del producto. El despacho fue eficiente. Solo debe ser mas efectivo el despacho o currier. Seria bueno ustedes confirmaran o certificaran la entrega por este mismo medio.</li>
            <li> Was watery doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> estou usando esse  creme,  mas ainda nao senti grandes efeitos, talvez deva usar por mais tempo para obter um resultado. creme muito bom de passar no rosto,nao fica rosto melecado. boa absorçao. preço um tanto alto ma se der resultado dai compensa.</li>
            <li> This product is advertised as &amp;#34;Instant Deep Wrinkle Filler&amp;#34; resulting in an instant effect of filling in wrinkles. After following directions, applying the cream to my face and letting set for five minutes I noticed that the product was flaking on my skin and leaving white residue. The directions also states that you can apply makeup, however when I applied a liquid makeup it covered my skin unevenly. I had to scrub off the Tri-Aktiline cream before I could apply my makeup. I was so disappointed that I immediately repackaged the item with the goal of requesting a refund and writing a review of my experience, however, this product is NON-RETURNABLE.  Since I can&#x27;t get my money back, I don&#x27;t want anyone else to waste their money on Tri-Aktiline Instant Deep Wrinkle Filler.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it works better than any other product with same claims. I usually buy it at Kohl&#x27;s and even got a 2 oz. size once....yet recently tried to and they didn&#x27;t carry this exact formula anymore and the similar one they had was a bit costly. So, that prompted me to search Amazon. I am please with price. I was just a little concerned that the packaging was written in Chinese or Japanese I think...which made me wonder where it came from and is it fresh, with a good remaining shelf-life....given that this tube typically lasts a long time.  Time will tell I suppose.....</li>
            <li> This product is made by Estee Lauder unless it has been bought by someone else.  I think I can see temporary softer lines around my mouth and corners of my eyes.  However, I use it everyday and when re-doing make-up.  I don&#x27;t think it makes lines soften permanently, but for a few hours I don&#x27;t think I look like I have my lips around a straw.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for this product. It does not eliminate the puffiness, and the cream does not blend well.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS WELL COME. I AM VERY SATISFIED. I love this product that makes a beautiful skin. Thank you Tri Aktiline</li>
            <li> Wow what an INSTANT difference. I have frown lines between my brows, it&#x27;s a genetic thing, my mom&#x27;s side has em. It actually works instantly and smooths them out and claims if you keep using it it will make a permanent difference. I don&#x27;t doubt it. Nothing I have ever used worked this good. I am almost 29, and am using anti-wrinkle care because it&#x27;s better to do it prior to wrinkles as opposed to during.</li>
            <li> bought it before, love it. Recommend it for all skin types. Will order again. Thank you. I passes the info on to all my friends.</li>
