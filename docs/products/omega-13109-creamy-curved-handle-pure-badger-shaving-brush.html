            <li>Product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>Awesome brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!  </li>
            <li>It is a very good product I like it</li>
            <li>This is a very good, inexpensive brush.  </li>
            <li>I have had this brush for two months, it&#x27;s still working great, not losing hairs, and fits with my shaving kit perfect.</li>
            <li>After three months of use this beautiful (thatâ€™s all it is) shaving brush started to shed hair like my dog.  </li>
            <li>A great buy.</li>
            <li>The badger hairs feel great...</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel, works up a great lather, and feels superb on your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good-looking brush, too, and feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li>This brush has served me well for quite some time, and builds and holds good lather.      </li>
            <li>so if you want a good stand, you&#x27;ll have to purchase one separately.</li>
            <li>And it is good quality as well</li>
            <li>The brush makes good foam</li>
            <li>It feels like a good balance between stiffness and flexibility.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>and I would say this one is right up with the best.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think you can do better than this brush!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, quality and exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>If this one wears out I&#x27;ll be sure to buy another one!</li>
            <li>and you will get great, foamy cream that applies easily and protects your face.</li>
            <li>Water drains out of it very quickly and does a great job of working up a lather for your face.  </li>
            <li>Lathers great comfortable etc.</li>
            <li>My husband liked the product and the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman who makes my own shaving and complexion soap.</li>
            <li>Very attractive brush with a very dense knot.</li>
            <li>Greatly reduced razor burn and a smoother shave followed quickly after my purchase of this product (and soap).  </li>
            <li>The cut of the brush and quality of the bristles makes developing a good lather easy.  </li>
            <li>Very good brush  held the leather very well</li>
            <li>It holds a good amount of soap and brushes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first Badger brush and works great in all aspects for shaving.  </li>
            <li>I use shaving soap with it, and it glides on the face very smoothly.    </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Its soft, great bristles, light, great quality and easy to use\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The brush spreads the shaving cream well, and love the fit and finish!</li>
            <li>and I am looking forward to many years of enjoyment with this brush as it appears and feels well-made.  </li>
            <li>For those people that have never used a shaving brush, let me just say that it gives a much better shave than just lathering the soap on your face with your hands.      </li>
            <li>The bristles are longer and the brush can hold more soap.</li>
            <li>The omega lost at most one hair after months of use.  </li>
            <li>I expect this brush will hold up for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Like it better</li>
            <li>And since I don&#x27;t have a girlfriend, it does a much better job and brushing against my face.</li>
            <li>I just love the way it creates suds.  </li>
            <li>Does the job and cannot ask for more.  </li>
            <li>fit a max of 25mm!</li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>Need more time to evaluate.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it does such a great job.</li>
            <li>but the brush has held up great so far.</li>
            <li>I looked at many brushes and decided to buy this one because the I did not want to go too cheap and have to throw away a crappy brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m very pleased with it&#x27;s based on what I do know.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Great soft brush that holds and generates tons of lather.</li>
            <li>Great brush soft and the hair doesn&#x27;t come out, which is plus.</li>
            <li>Seems good quality and a reasonable price for a badger fur shaving brush...</li>
            <li>soft but scrubby and easily work up a great lather.</li>
            <li>Good quality but price too high</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s holding up fine.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>This brush though a bit prickly in the begining, quickly has become much better to the touch.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and springy and give me a pleasant tickling sensation as I apply shaving cream to my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for all around use, but it&#x27;s overall very light weight</li>
            <li>I know that the bristles aren&#x27;t quite as high of quality as some of the higher end brushes, but for under $30 this is a great value.</li>
            <li>I have seen similar badger brushes for over $55, so this brush seems like a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a clue - but - it is seems like a great entry level brush for the beginning double edge shaver.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again good for starting but you can do a lot better for this price.</li>
            <li>The only improvement I would ask for is a wooden handle instead of the plastic one, which makes the brush seem cheap when it is really a very nice one, actually a great one for the money.</li>
            <li>This makes a nice lather and would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Great value and looks like it will hold up for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read in several places that a badger hair brush was the way to go for the best shave, and I was looking for something (relatively) inexpensive, but good quality to start out my wet-shaving journey, since I also bought a safety razor and a new mug.  </li>
            <li>let me first say at first I was thrilled with this brush</li>
            <li>This my beginner&#x27;s brush, yet I do not feel compelled at all to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a best badger, super badger, or silvertip, although that seems to be the usual progression from what I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>Most brushes of this size and grade cost twice as much, even on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I get a much foamier soap and my skin handles the shave quite a bit better.</li>
            <li>an authentic manly shave (be that straight razor or safety)</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really ask for more can you?</li>
            <li>I bought this as a recommendation from The Art of Manliness, and I can say it&#x27;s not a bad start up brush...</li>
            <li>Also, be aware the Omega brushes are too large to fit in most brush holder/stands.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly.</li>
            <li>Received  my order within 2 days and the store was quick to respond.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and dries reasonably fast.</li>
            <li>Sheds water quickly when cleaning it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with cheap shaving brushes for quite a while and to finally upgrade to a nice one was quite a change.</li>
            <li>The Perfecto was a huge mistake, it disintegrated on the first shave, some bargains are no bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More foam  and very soft.  </li>
            <li>I fully recommend it to anyone that wants a quality brush for a quality shave!!</li>
            <li>It creates a beautifully consistent lather, is easy to clean and has held up very well.</li>
            <li>my first!  </li>
            <li>This product is the real deal with genuine badger tail hairs.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the investment</li>
            <li>Well made, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s everything I wanted and more.  </li>
            <li>He had just gotten interested in shaving the \\&quot;old way\\&quot; and after doing a little research, I found this to be the best start brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>This particular brush has a nice handle, and the bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>The price is right too.  </li>
            <li>This brush lathers much better than my previous brush and feels much better on my face.</li>
            <li>so you can hang it upside down for drying (good maintenance for the brush).</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t looking for any major difference, since the boar bristles have had many years to break in.  </li>
            <li>but I had high expectation and hoped this brush to be as lasting as it is fine-looking.</li>
            <li>The omega brush is the first I&#x27;ve bought online and would deff.</li>
            <li>Simply put, this brush just gets better with age and use.</li>
            <li>I have been shopping around for brushes to give as gifts to others, now that I have a better idea of what to look for, and if size matters (snicker), then you&#x27;re not likely to find a brush of this size and quality for the money.</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush was given to me by my father-in-law.  </li>
            <li>It was a boar bristle brush and it wasn&#x27;t anything like the smooth, soft brush that I was used to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brush 3-5 times a week for the last year and love it.</li>
            <li>The problem is that there are lots of short bristles around the front, and I think those are the more prickly ones.</li>
            <li>I have now owned two brushes, this one and one from Art of Shaving from when I first started straight-razor and DE shaving.</li>
            <li>This was one of many items I bought with last years tax returns along with a shave mug and shave soap.</li>
            <li>Wash it well in hot water to get the excess dye off.</li>
            <li>Its the first brush I&#x27;ve ever owned for shaving</li>
            <li>It was my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>but there are WAY better brushes out there for the same price.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made brush!</li>
            <li>Makes for a nice lather and holds water and heat extremely well.  </li>
            <li>When properly soaked, the bristles are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Great product that other company are charging double or triple for.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Omega Pure Badger Shaving Brush and see if it made  a difference from the boar hair brush.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does not hurt.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm, moist bristles massage my whiskers like hundreds of little hands.</li>
            <li>The plastic handle feels a bit cheap, but overall the brush works very well.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes the Omega shaving brush.</li>
            <li>He really enjoys shaving now and is buying this shave brush for his father and brother.  </li>
            <li>Before buying the Creamy I bought a Perfecto which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>+ year later this brush is comfortable and still keeping together.</li>
            <li>But the handle is nice and solid, and he likes it enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li>that well and the hair itself is kind of stiff.</li>
            <li>I originally bought a brush from CVS, thinking that it would be similar to the one I use.  </li>
            <li>I clean regularly.</li>
            <li>First thing noticed is how soft the bristles are.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also works very well, and has gotten better with age, as the bristles softened a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Much better than using your hands, especially when coupled with traditional shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It does feel a bit more coarse than the Art of Shaving basic brush</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a month now, and so far it&#x27;s really held up well.  </li>
            <li>Always use a badger hair brush and real (old fashioned) shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Was hoping to get more than a few years out of this brush.  </li>
            <li>Takes up minimal real estate on the sink and looks cool.</li>
            <li>Remember to soak the brush in warm water at least 10 minutes before using it.</li>
            <li>Have no complaint with the</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman brush is a fine brush for starting on, but if you are looking to start wetshaving and need a brush, I highly recommend you spend the extra 15-20 bucks for this brush.</li>
            <li>It is a very comfortable brush to use and the only maintenance done to it is to run water over it, tap it gently, and hang it up with the bristles facing down when done.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this new brush.  </li>
            <li>Plus, none of the hairs have fallen out, which can happen with some new brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that the shedding will eventually stop but may be buying a new brush if it continues.</li>
            <li>Although it is a little stiff it feels great on your face and produces an abundance of lather.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying this if you want to get into old school lather and shaving.</li>
            <li>When I first compared the two brushes dry, there didn&#x27;t seem to be much difference</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested, below was my initial review from two years ago:  </li>
            <li>I wish I could say more, but I don&#x27;t have any other brushes to compare this to, as I have just recently started shaving with safety razors.  </li>
            <li>This is the first and only badger brush I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Once you insert it in a bowl of hot water and form your lather it soaks up and retains the moist lather for the entire duration of your shave.</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t feel light but instead has a heavier feel to it than my previous brush.</li>
            <li>After the first shave the smell was virtually gone, and after the second it was completely gone.    </li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit rough to start, but soften quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, when I first lathered up with the Omega Creamy brush, there was an obvious and profound difference.  </li>
            <li>This is my second pure badger brush from Omega.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s going to smell a little bit, so I picked up a $3 bottle of pet shampoo from the store and washed it a few times and then let it soak for a good hour in a shampoo soak.  </li>
            <li>it are all crazy, fly away and frizzy ones that fall out and don&#x27;t seem tamed well and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using an old (30-40 yr old?)</li>
            <li>The badger bristles were soft and massaging</li>
            <li>It was a badger brush and it is probably 70 years old.  </li>
            <li>and I use it in circular motions to work natural lathers and lotions into my skin.</li>
            <li>I was never rough on it and am being extra gentle now.</li>
            <li>I expected the plastic handle to be a little better quality for the price...  </li>
            <li>They are off by at least 4-5 mm which is a big difference when most brush stands</li>
            <li>I live in southern us in a extremely humid hot environment.</li>
            <li>The badger hair holds water when you need it, and is firm enough to create a good lather, even with my hard water.  </li>
            <li>His old brush has bristles that were all the same length.  </li>
            <li>The brush is also still losing a few odd bristles here and there, but it does not feel cheap and it&#x27;s not shedding them quickly, just dropping the odd ones that weren&#x27;t bound tight in the first place.</li>
            <li>After a few uses though it has become much softer and my shave has improved considerably.</li>
            <li>The old brush lost clumps of hair every time I used it such that there was not much left of it after just two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are a little longer than I think they should be causing a little more soap slop than necessary.  </li>
            <li>This was my first brush, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li>It lost few if any bristles in the first couple of uses, and none noticeably  since.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Don&#x27;t think you can do better than this brush!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, quality and exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> If this one wears out I&#x27;ll be sure to buy another one!</li>
            <li> and you will get great, foamy cream that applies easily and protects your face.</li>
            <li> Water drains out of it very quickly and does a great job of working up a lather for your face.  </li>
            <li> Lathers great comfortable etc.</li>
            <li> My husband liked the product and the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who makes my own shaving and complexion soap.</li>
            <li> Very attractive brush with a very dense knot.</li>
            <li> Greatly reduced razor burn and a smoother shave followed quickly after my purchase of this product (and soap).  </li>
            <li> The cut of the brush and quality of the bristles makes developing a good lather easy.  </li>
            <li> Very good brush  held the leather very well</li>
            <li> It holds a good amount of soap and brushes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first Badger brush and works great in all aspects for shaving.  </li>
            <li> I use shaving soap with it, and it glides on the face very smoothly.    </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Its soft, great bristles, light, great quality and easy to use\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The brush spreads the shaving cream well, and love the fit and finish!</li>
            <li> and I am looking forward to many years of enjoyment with this brush as it appears and feels well-made.  </li>
            <li> For those people that have never used a shaving brush, let me just say that it gives a much better shave than just lathering the soap on your face with your hands.      </li>
            <li> The bristles are longer and the brush can hold more soap.</li>
            <li> The omega lost at most one hair after months of use.  </li>
            <li> I expect this brush will hold up for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Like it better</li>
            <li> And since I don&#x27;t have a girlfriend, it does a much better job and brushing against my face.</li>
            <li> I just love the way it creates suds.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and cannot ask for more.  </li>
            <li> fit a max of 25mm!</li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> Need more time to evaluate.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it does such a great job.</li>
            <li> but the brush has held up great so far.</li>
            <li> I looked at many brushes and decided to buy this one because the I did not want to go too cheap and have to throw away a crappy brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m very pleased with it&#x27;s based on what I do know.  </li>
            <li> and I am happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Great soft brush that holds and generates tons of lather.</li>
            <li> Great brush soft and the hair doesn&#x27;t come out, which is plus.</li>
            <li> Seems good quality and a reasonable price for a badger fur shaving brush...</li>
            <li> soft but scrubby and easily work up a great lather.</li>
            <li> Good quality but price too high</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s holding up fine.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> This brush though a bit prickly in the begining, quickly has become much better to the touch.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and springy and give me a pleasant tickling sensation as I apply shaving cream to my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good for all around use, but it&#x27;s overall very light weight</li>
            <li> I know that the bristles aren&#x27;t quite as high of quality as some of the higher end brushes, but for under $30 this is a great value.</li>
            <li> I have seen similar badger brushes for over $55, so this brush seems like a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a clue - but - it is seems like a great entry level brush for the beginning double edge shaver.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again good for starting but you can do a lot better for this price.</li>
            <li> The only improvement I would ask for is a wooden handle instead of the plastic one, which makes the brush seem cheap when it is really a very nice one, actually a great one for the money.</li>
            <li> This makes a nice lather and would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Great value and looks like it will hold up for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read in several places that a badger hair brush was the way to go for the best shave, and I was looking for something (relatively) inexpensive, but good quality to start out my wet-shaving journey, since I also bought a safety razor and a new mug.  </li>
            <li> let me first say at first I was thrilled with this brush</li>
            <li> This my beginner&#x27;s brush, yet I do not feel compelled at all to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a best badger, super badger, or silvertip, although that seems to be the usual progression from what I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> Most brushes of this size and grade cost twice as much, even on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I get a much foamier soap and my skin handles the shave quite a bit better.</li>
            <li> an authentic manly shave (be that straight razor or safety)</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really ask for more can you?</li>
            <li> I bought this as a recommendation from The Art of Manliness, and I can say it&#x27;s not a bad start up brush...</li>
            <li> Also, be aware the Omega brushes are too large to fit in most brush holder/stands.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly.</li>
            <li> Received  my order within 2 days and the store was quick to respond.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and dries reasonably fast.</li>
            <li> Sheds water quickly when cleaning it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with cheap shaving brushes for quite a while and to finally upgrade to a nice one was quite a change.</li>
            <li> The Perfecto was a huge mistake, it disintegrated on the first shave, some bargains are no bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More foam  and very soft.  </li>
            <li> I fully recommend it to anyone that wants a quality brush for a quality shave!!</li>
            <li> It creates a beautifully consistent lather, is easy to clean and has held up very well.</li>
            <li> my first!  </li>
            <li> This product is the real deal with genuine badger tail hairs.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the investment</li>
            <li> Well made, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s everything I wanted and more.  </li>
            <li> He had just gotten interested in shaving the \\&quot;old way\\&quot; and after doing a little research, I found this to be the best start brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> This particular brush has a nice handle, and the bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li> The price is right too.  </li>
            <li> This brush lathers much better than my previous brush and feels much better on my face.</li>
            <li> so you can hang it upside down for drying (good maintenance for the brush).</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t looking for any major difference, since the boar bristles have had many years to break in.  </li>
            <li> but I had high expectation and hoped this brush to be as lasting as it is fine-looking.</li>
            <li> The omega brush is the first I&#x27;ve bought online and would deff.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this brush just gets better with age and use.</li>
            <li> I have been shopping around for brushes to give as gifts to others, now that I have a better idea of what to look for, and if size matters (snicker), then you&#x27;re not likely to find a brush of this size and quality for the money.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush was given to me by my father-in-law.  </li>
            <li> It was a boar bristle brush and it wasn&#x27;t anything like the smooth, soft brush that I was used to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush 3-5 times a week for the last year and love it.</li>
            <li> The problem is that there are lots of short bristles around the front, and I think those are the more prickly ones.</li>
            <li> I have now owned two brushes, this one and one from Art of Shaving from when I first started straight-razor and DE shaving.</li>
            <li> This was one of many items I bought with last years tax returns along with a shave mug and shave soap.</li>
            <li> Wash it well in hot water to get the excess dye off.</li>
            <li> Its the first brush I&#x27;ve ever owned for shaving</li>
            <li> It was my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> but there are WAY better brushes out there for the same price.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made brush!</li>
            <li> Makes for a nice lather and holds water and heat extremely well.  </li>
            <li> When properly soaked, the bristles are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Great product that other company are charging double or triple for.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Omega Pure Badger Shaving Brush and see if it made  a difference from the boar hair brush.  </li>
            <li> It certainly does not hurt.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s warm, moist bristles massage my whiskers like hundreds of little hands.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle feels a bit cheap, but overall the brush works very well.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the Omega shaving brush.</li>
            <li> He really enjoys shaving now and is buying this shave brush for his father and brother.  </li>
            <li> Before buying the Creamy I bought a Perfecto which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> + year later this brush is comfortable and still keeping together.</li>
            <li> But the handle is nice and solid, and he likes it enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li> that well and the hair itself is kind of stiff.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a brush from CVS, thinking that it would be similar to the one I use.  </li>
            <li> I clean regularly.</li>
            <li> First thing noticed is how soft the bristles are.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works very well, and has gotten better with age, as the bristles softened a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Much better than using your hands, especially when coupled with traditional shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It does feel a bit more coarse than the Art of Shaving basic brush</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a month now, and so far it&#x27;s really held up well.  </li>
            <li> Always use a badger hair brush and real (old fashioned) shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Was hoping to get more than a few years out of this brush.  </li>
            <li> Takes up minimal real estate on the sink and looks cool.</li>
            <li> Remember to soak the brush in warm water at least 10 minutes before using it.</li>
            <li> Have no complaint with the</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman brush is a fine brush for starting on, but if you are looking to start wetshaving and need a brush, I highly recommend you spend the extra 15-20 bucks for this brush.</li>
            <li> It is a very comfortable brush to use and the only maintenance done to it is to run water over it, tap it gently, and hang it up with the bristles facing down when done.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this new brush.  </li>
            <li> Plus, none of the hairs have fallen out, which can happen with some new brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that the shedding will eventually stop but may be buying a new brush if it continues.</li>
            <li> Although it is a little stiff it feels great on your face and produces an abundance of lather.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying this if you want to get into old school lather and shaving.</li>
            <li> When I first compared the two brushes dry, there didn&#x27;t seem to be much difference</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested, below was my initial review from two years ago:  </li>
            <li> I wish I could say more, but I don&#x27;t have any other brushes to compare this to, as I have just recently started shaving with safety razors.  </li>
            <li> This is the first and only badger brush I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Once you insert it in a bowl of hot water and form your lather it soaks up and retains the moist lather for the entire duration of your shave.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t feel light but instead has a heavier feel to it than my previous brush.</li>
            <li> After the first shave the smell was virtually gone, and after the second it was completely gone.    </li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit rough to start, but soften quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, when I first lathered up with the Omega Creamy brush, there was an obvious and profound difference.  </li>
            <li> This is my second pure badger brush from Omega.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to smell a little bit, so I picked up a $3 bottle of pet shampoo from the store and washed it a few times and then let it soak for a good hour in a shampoo soak.  </li>
            <li> it are all crazy, fly away and frizzy ones that fall out and don&#x27;t seem tamed well and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using an old (30-40 yr old?)</li>
            <li> The badger bristles were soft and massaging</li>
            <li> It was a badger brush and it is probably 70 years old.  </li>
            <li> and I use it in circular motions to work natural lathers and lotions into my skin.</li>
            <li> I was never rough on it and am being extra gentle now.</li>
            <li> I expected the plastic handle to be a little better quality for the price...  </li>
            <li> They are off by at least 4-5 mm which is a big difference when most brush stands</li>
            <li> I live in southern us in a extremely humid hot environment.</li>
            <li> The badger hair holds water when you need it, and is firm enough to create a good lather, even with my hard water.  </li>
            <li> His old brush has bristles that were all the same length.  </li>
            <li> The brush is also still losing a few odd bristles here and there, but it does not feel cheap and it&#x27;s not shedding them quickly, just dropping the odd ones that weren&#x27;t bound tight in the first place.</li>
            <li> After a few uses though it has become much softer and my shave has improved considerably.</li>
            <li> The old brush lost clumps of hair every time I used it such that there was not much left of it after just two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are a little longer than I think they should be causing a little more soap slop than necessary.  </li>
            <li> This was my first brush, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> It lost few if any bristles in the first couple of uses, and none noticeably  since.  </li>
            <li> but with this one I&#x27;ve been forced to reevaluate how much badger were actually in my old brushes.</li>
            <li> It shed a few hairs early on, but none after the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s tricky getting those small spots like under the nose, besides I only really just shave my neck and cheek bones</li>
            <li> How long will it last...</li>
            <li> He said it&#x27;s a little pricklier than his old brush, but will likely soften with time.</li>
            <li> I have a normal sized face and this thing it just annoying since it will cover your entire face, which might be useful to some that want to shave their whole face.</li>
            <li> In the last month it&#x27;s been shedding every single time I use it.</li>
            <li> It is soft but little bit stronger.</li>
            <li> I have several other brushes in the &amp;#60;$100 range</li>
            <li> , that may just be due to the relative age difference of the two.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that its included stand is nowhere near the quality of the brush...</li>
            <li> I bought my last shaving brush in the &#x27;60s and wore it down to a condition I would call heartily wispy.</li>
            <li> This new Omega shaving brush is thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Considering my previous, under $10 brush purchased from a local drugstore,  this brush deserves a 6 star rating.  </li>
            <li> Keep this brush a bit wet</li>
            <li> When I initially received the brush it was harsh against my skin.</li>
            <li> I must say, when I bought this, I expected it to do what I needed.</li>
            <li> However, mine smells like a wet dog after every use.</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months back.</li>
            <li> I hang the brush after each use so it drips down to dry.  </li>
            <li> but this brush is way too wide to fit, which was a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I would buy this item again and also revisit this store for other beauty needs.   </li>
            <li> It feels like it will hold up well if the last few weeks are an indication!</li>
            <li> I use the brush every other day so it would not be from abuse or overuse.</li>
            <li> i agreed with all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It has a thick handle which allows a solid grip.  </li>
            <li> I could tell that I wasn&#x27;t going to just have to toughen up and endure the slight prickliness of boar bristles as I had grownaccustomed.  </li>
            <li> I got into wetshaving about 2 and a half years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the Stripey model</li>
            <li> plastic handle - previous brush had a porcelain handle which was heavy and tipsy in the stand.  </li>
            <li> If anything, it may take a little time to work it in--soften it a bit.</li>
            <li> Hubby started using  a shaving brush and soap a few years ago and found he got a closer shave and no burn.</li>
            <li> and I had wondered if I&#x27;d wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> A few hairs came out at the beginning, but 1</li>
            <li> $25 wasted on a brush stand</li>
            <li> First I am sorry to be the only one that give bad review for this product</li>
            <li> It holds it&#x27;s shape,stays firm without being hard.</li>
            <li> The plastic looks like ivory - not cheap and won&#x27;t crack like wood or dull like chrome.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he&#x27;s been using it for the past month.</li>
            <li> Overall the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s held up wonderfully, never shed hairs, and will probably last for decades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously had a  brush that would lose bristles every time I shaved which was quite annoying, this brush is very soft and has not shed one bristle in the 8 months I have had it.  </li>
            <li> However the bottom portion of the handle is too thick</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews say, the brush starts out awfully prickly, but after just 3-4 days use it gets much softer.</li>
            <li> Another note, this brush will not fit properly in this stand: [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]]  </li>
            <li> this bad is plain rip</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please save your money and buy something cheaper at least if it goes bad</li>
            <li> Their dimensions for the brush knot is wrong.</li>
            <li> It cost about $8, but unfortunately it was terrible.  </li>

            <li> Best badger brush I&#x27;ve used so far. The brush spreads the shaving cream well, and love the fit and finish!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the Omega shaving brush. He&#x27;s been using it for several months and no complaints. It holds it&#x27;s shape,stays firm without being hard. Drys quickly. Hubby started using  a shaving brush and soap a few years ago and found he got a closer shave and no burn. The omega brush is the first I&#x27;ve bought online and would deff. recommend the brush and store. Received  my order within 2 days and the store was quick to respond. I would buy this item again and also revisit this store for other beauty needs.   lee</li>
            <li> It has now been two years since I posted the review below, and I still say this is an awesome shaving brush. This my beginner&#x27;s brush, yet I do not feel compelled at all to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a best badger, super badger, or silvertip, although that seems to be the usual progression from what I&#x27;ve read. Maybe I&#x27;ll just add another brush to the rotation to give the Creamy a break every now and then.  Simply put, this brush just gets better with age and use. The bristles seem to soften over time and it holds water and lathers well with both cream and soap. I have been shopping around for brushes to give as gifts to others, now that I have a better idea of what to look for, and if size matters (snicker), then you&#x27;re not likely to find a brush of this size and quality for the money. Most brushes of this size and grade cost twice as much, even on Amazon.  I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!  If you&#x27;re interested, below was my initial review from two years ago:  I am very pleased with this brush.  I&#x27;d read in several places that a badger hair brush was the way to go for the best shave, and I was looking for something (relatively) inexpensive, but good quality to start out my wet-shaving journey, since I also bought a safety razor and a new mug.  I have been using an old (30-40 yr old?) boar bristle brush for years.  It was my grandfather&#x27;s brush and I just wanted to retire it for posterity&#x27;s sake.  I really wasn&#x27;t looking for any major difference, since the boar bristles have had many years to break in.  When I first compared the two brushes dry, there didn&#x27;t seem to be much difference and I had wondered if I&#x27;d wasted my money.  However, when I first lathered up with the Omega Creamy brush, there was an obvious and profound difference.  The badger bristles were soft and massaging and I could feel the lather working into my pores instead of just decorating the surface.  I could tell that I wasn&#x27;t going to just have to toughen up and endure the slight prickliness of boar bristles as I had grownaccustomed.  It was well worth the investment and I am looking forward to many years of enjoyment with this brush as it appears and feels well-made.  It&#x27;s a good-looking brush, too, and feels good in the hand.  Buy o shavingne.  You&#x27;ll thank yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought the Omega 13109 Shave Brush for my husband.  He went back to the safety razor and traditional shave soaps.  My husband loves this new brush.  \\&quot;Its soft, great bristles, light, great quality and easy to use\\&quot;.  He really enjoys shaving now and is buying this shave brush for his father and brother.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> For those people that have never used a shaving brush, let me just say that it gives a much better shave than just lathering the soap on your face with your hands.      My first shaving brush was given to me by my father-in-law.  It was a badger brush and it is probably 70 years old.  I still use it, but I needed another brush for traveling.        I originally bought a brush from CVS, thinking that it would be similar to the one I use.  It cost about $8, but unfortunately it was terrible.  It was a boar bristle brush and it wasn&#x27;t anything like the smooth, soft brush that I was used to.  I now know that you should stay away from any brush that is not BADGER.  BADGER bristles are the tops when it comes to shaving brushes.      This particular brush has a nice handle, and the bristles are soft.  I use shaving soap with it, and it glides on the face very smoothly.    The price is right too.  I have seen similar badger brushes for over $55, so this brush seems like a great deal.  I fully recommend it to anyone that wants a quality brush for a quality shave!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Omega Pure Badger Shaving Brush and see if it made  a difference from the boar hair brush.  It made a difference. More foam  and very soft.  I also read you can lay the brush on its side after you  rinse it with water and do not need a brush hanger. It is working for me too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my husband.  He had just gotten interested in shaving the \\&quot;old way\\&quot; and after doing a little research, I found this to be the best start brush for the price.  Such a hit!  He loves the way it lathers up his shaving cream and helps him achieve a close shave.</li>
            <li> Changing from shaving gel to the soap/brush combo was an eye-opener for me.  Greatly reduced razor burn and a smoother shave followed quickly after my purchase of this product (and soap).  This brush has served me well for quite some time, and builds and holds good lather.      The only negative is that its included stand is nowhere near the quality of the brush...so if you want a good stand, you&#x27;ll have to purchase one separately.</li>
            <li> I got into wetshaving about 2 and a half years ago. I&#x27;m a bit stingy when it comes to my shaving equipment, so spending $50+ for a brush seemed a bit out of the question. I had bought the [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] on Amazon and had been using that until about a month ago when I got this. The Tweezerman brush is a fine brush for starting on, but if you are looking to start wetshaving and need a brush, I highly recommend you spend the extra 15-20 bucks for this brush. The bristles are longer and the brush can hold more soap. I get a much foamier soap and my skin handles the shave quite a bit better. I know that the bristles aren&#x27;t quite as high of quality as some of the higher end brushes, but for under $30 this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Great product that other company are charging double or triple for. Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and isn&#x27;t synthetic.</li>
            <li> Keep this brush a bit wet and you will get great, foamy cream that applies easily and protects your face. It is easy to clean and dries reasonably fast. I&#x27;m very happy with the brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best and resonably priced shaving brush I have had in over 50 years.</li>
            <li> This brush though a bit prickly in the begining, quickly has become much better to the touch.  Water drains out of it very quickly and does a great job of working up a lather for your face.  The only improvement I would ask for is a wooden handle instead of the plastic one, which makes the brush seem cheap when it is really a very nice one, actually a great one for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush 3-5 times a week for the last year and love it. It creates a beautifully consistent lather, is easy to clean and has held up very well.</li>
            <li> My husband liked the product and the price.  He also was very happy that we received the product promtly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he&#x27;s been using it for the past month. He said it&#x27;s a little pricklier than his old brush, but will likely soften with time. The problem is that there are lots of short bristles around the front, and I think those are the more prickly ones. His old brush has bristles that were all the same length.  But the handle is nice and solid, and he likes it enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome.  I wish I could say more, but I don&#x27;t have any other brushes to compare this to, as I have just recently started shaving with safety razors.  Another note, this brush will not fit properly in this stand: [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]]  The stand does hold the brush, but not the way it was intended.  It holds it where the brush connects to the handle, not by the end of the handle.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for about two weeks.  It&#x27;s my first Badger brush and works great in all aspects for shaving.  Of course it being Badger hair it&#x27;s going to smell a little bit, so I picked up a $3 bottle of pet shampoo from the store and washed it a few times and then let it soak for a good hour in a shampoo soak.  After the first shave the smell was virtually gone, and after the second it was completely gone.    Overall the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Would recommend this brush to anyone.    I also purchased the Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand to hold both my Merkur razor and this brush but this brush is way too wide to fit, which was a little disappointing.  So keep that in mind if you&#x27;re looking for a stand.</li>
            <li> Very soft. Perfect for the money.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product I like it And it is good quality as well I just hope it&#x27;ll last I have it for about a month</li>
            <li> Good quality but price too high</li>
            <li> This is a terrific shaving brush for the price.  Makes for a nice lather and holds water and heat extremely well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought my last shaving brush in the &#x27;60s and wore it down to a condition I would call heartily wispy. This new Omega shaving brush is thick and sturdy. If anything, it may take a little time to work it in--soften it a bit. It might be called a gorilla of brushes. I fully expect it to outlast the last brush, and probably me. A great buy.</li>
            <li> Well made, well worth the price. Don&#x27;t think you can do better than this brush! Don&#x27;t by cheapie substitutes!  Quality.</li>
            <li> I have now owned two brushes, this one and one from Art of Shaving from when I first started straight-razor and DE shaving. This brush lathers much better than my previous brush and feels much better on my face. It does what it is supposed to and it does it well. The brush doesn&#x27;t feel light but instead has a heavier feel to it than my previous brush. It feels like it will hold up well if the last few weeks are an indication!</li>
            <li> This was my first brush, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.  Initially I was concerned about the quality of the light-weight plastic handle but the brush has held up great so far. The badger hairs feel great...soft but scrubby and easily work up a great lather. It shed a few hairs early on, but none after the first few uses.  I&#x27;m very happy with the Omega brush and I would recommend it to anyone starting out.</li>
            <li> When I initially received the brush it was harsh against my skin. After a few uses though it has become much softer and my shave has improved considerably.</li>
            <li> Considering my previous, under $10 brush purchased from a local drugstore,  this brush deserves a 6 star rating.  The old brush lost clumps of hair every time I used it such that there was not much left of it after just two weeks of use.  The omega lost at most one hair after months of use.  It is a very comfortable brush to use and the only maintenance done to it is to run water over it, tap it gently, and hang it up with the bristles facing down when done.  I expect this brush will hold up for many years to come.</li>
            <li> This was one of many items I bought with last years tax returns along with a shave mug and shave soap. The handle fits in my hand like a glove. The bristles are soft and springy and give me a pleasant tickling sensation as I apply shaving cream to my face. Just remember to hang it bristles-down after you&#x27;ve rinsed it out thoroughly to prevent mildewing. I would definitely recommend this to my friends as an old-school change of pace to their shaving routines.</li>
            <li> First I am sorry to be the only one that give bad review for this product but I had high expectation and hoped this brush to be as lasting as it is fine-looking. After three months of use this beautiful (thatâ€™s all it is) shaving brush started to shed hair like my dog.  Now I would expect to have some hair lost at the beginning but this was not he case, on the contrary it started loosing hair after two months. I use the brush every other day so it would not be from abuse or overuse. The handle is designed well,besides been made of plastic, and it fits well in hand.  The brush makes good foam but this is subjective and it is based on what shaving cream is used-mine is Proraso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spending $ 30 something dollar on product this bad is plain rip off.&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money and buy something cheaper at least if it goes bad it would not bother you. I am buying a cheaper one and this one goes in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an AOS brush that was falling apart.  I&#x27;ve used this for 2 years and appreciate the quality.  Holds water and heat well.  Sheds water quickly when cleaning it out.  UPDATED: After 3 years of use, the hairs fall out on a daily basis.  Was hoping to get more than a few years out of this brush.  I hang the brush after each use so it drips down to dry.  I clean regularly.</li>
            <li> Very good brush  held the leather very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Omega brushes for five years and I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with them. I&#x27;ve previously used the Stripey model but I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. I can&#x27;t say that I have any preference for the Creamy vs the Stripey but I can say that they are both quality products. Before buying the Creamy I bought a Perfecto which is much cheaper. The Perfecto was a huge mistake, it disintegrated on the first shave, some bargains are no bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a couple of pictures showing the brush after three weeks use. It&#x27;s holding up fine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, quality and exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;For an authentic manly shave (be that straight razor or safety) this product creates a marvelous lather with a shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Properly taken care of and stored it can / will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This is my second pure badger brush from Omega. Like it better then Edwin Jagger brand. It is soft but little bit stronger. I think density of packaged hair is stronger then in Edwin Jagger brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a month now, and so far it&#x27;s really held up well.  It holds a good amount of soap and brushes on smooth.  It has a thick handle which allows a solid grip.  This brush is a definite must have.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for two months, it&#x27;s still working great, not losing hairs, and fits with my shaving kit perfect.</li>
            <li> I must say, when I bought this, I expected it to do what I needed. But it went above those expectations. It&#x27;s warm, moist bristles massage my whiskers like hundreds of little hands. Sometimes I just brush around and around for 5 or 10 minutes. It&#x27;s like treating my face to a spa. It lathers my shaving soap like a pro latherer. Honestly, it does such a great job. I would suggest it to anyone. And since I don&#x27;t have a girlfriend, it does a much better job and brushing against my face. Highly recommend buying this if you want to get into old school lather and shaving.</li>
            <li> Had this brush for about 10 months now.  I look forward to using it every morning.  I just love the way it creates suds.  No hairs every fall out of the brush.  Great brush.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  No issues.  Does the job and cannot ask for more.  I will buy another in 20 years.</li>
            <li> A quality brush whose design looks like it hasn&#x27;t changed since the 50&#x27;s and that&#x27;s fine by me. Takes up minimal real estate on the sink and looks cool. The plastic looks like ivory - not cheap and won&#x27;t crack like wood or dull like chrome. Do it.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only badger brush I have purchased. I bought this brush when I decided to get into double-edged razor shaving. I looked at many brushes and decided to buy this one because the I did not want to go too cheap and have to throw away a crappy brush. Being a college student, I also did not feel it was necessary to splurge an a white or silver-tipped badger brush. A few hairs came out at the beginning, but 1+ year later this brush is comfortable and still keeping together.</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful. Although caution for consumers looking for brush stands. Their dimensions for the brush knot is wrong. They are off by at least 4-5 mm which is a big difference when most brush stands fit a max of 25mm! $25 wasted on a brush stand that&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> Very solid brush. Bristles don&#x27;t fall out. Does the job well.</li>
            <li> I expected the plastic handle to be a little better quality for the price...  I guess you pay for the fur.  Also, be aware the Omega brushes are too large to fit in most brush holder/stands.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m very pleased with it&#x27;s based on what I do know.  It lost few if any bristles in the first couple of uses, and none noticeably  since.  It has a nice feel, works up a great lather, and feels superb on your face.  Much better than using your hands, especially when coupled with traditional shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who makes my own shaving and complexion soap. I love this brush and I use it in circular motions to work natural lathers and lotions into my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it all of the time. No loss of badger hair, no badger stink, but lots of lather with both cream and soap.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal with genuine badger tail hairs. Once you insert it in a bowl of hot water and form your lather it soaks up and retains the moist lather for the entire duration of your shave.</li>
            <li> This is a very good, inexpensive brush.  The bristles are a bit rough to start, but soften quickly.  The plastic handle feels a bit cheap, but overall the brush works very well.</li>
            <li> I have several other brushes in the &amp;#60;$100 range and I would say this one is right up with the best.  The cut of the brush and quality of the bristles makes developing a good lather easy.  It does feel a bit more coarse than the Art of Shaving basic brush, that may just be due to the relative age difference of the two.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little longer than I think they should be causing a little more soap slop than necessary.  Wash it well in hot water to get the excess dye off.</li>
            <li> Very attractive brush with a very dense knot.</li>
            <li> Remember to soak the brush in warm water at least 10 minutes before using it. I&#x27;ve made the mistake a couple of times and its almost as if the bristles are scratching my face. When properly soaked, the bristles are nice and soft. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews say, the brush starts out awfully prickly, but after just 3-4 days use it gets much softer. Its the first brush I&#x27;ve ever owned for shaving and I haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaving brush.  The badger hair holds water when you need it, and is firm enough to create a good lather, even with my hard water.  The hairs can feel prickly at times, but only in the sense that your face may not be used to it.  It certainly does not hurt.  It feels like a good balance between stiffness and flexibility.  Plus, none of the hairs have fallen out, which can happen with some new brushes.  The handle is plastic and nothing to write home about, which is probably why I dropped the rating to 4 stars.  Overall, I think this is a good buy.  You&#x27;ll want to get a stand so you can hang it upside down for drying (good maintenance for the brush).</li>
            <li> Great value and looks like it will hold up for a long time to come. Have no complaint with the plastic handle - previous brush had a porcelain handle which was heavy and tipsy in the stand.  No problem with this one.</li>
            <li> Seems good quality and a reasonable price for a badger fur shaving brush...my first!  It loads up well and puts the soap where it belongs!  I have used it several times already and I am happy with it so far.  How long will it last...I don&#x27;t have a clue - but - it is seems like a great entry level brush for the beginning double edge shaver.</li>
            <li> Great soft brush that holds and generates tons of lather. However, mine smells like a wet dog after every use. I looked around online and found out that this will eventually go away, and if you want to speed up the removal of the smell wash the brush with hair shampoo, pet shampoo, or soak it in a borax solution. I&#x27;ve used some of my hair shampoo (without conditioner) and it reduced the smell a lot. Will have to do it another time or two to finish it off. The brush is also still losing a few odd bristles here and there, but it does not feel cheap and it&#x27;s not shedding them quickly, just dropping the odd ones that weren&#x27;t bound tight in the first place.</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months back. It was my first shaving brush. In the last month it&#x27;s been shedding every single time I use it. I was never rough on it and am being extra gentle now. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help. I&#x27;m hoping that the shedding will eventually stop but may be buying a new brush if it continues.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet. Need more time to evaluate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with cheap shaving brushes for quite a while and to finally upgrade to a nice one was quite a change. First thing noticed is how soft the bristles are. I&#x27;ve always had &amp;#34;badger shaving brushes&amp;#34; but with this one I&#x27;ve been forced to reevaluate how much badger were actually in my old brushes. This makes a nice lather and would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s everything I wanted and more.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I previously had a  brush that would lose bristles every time I shaved which was quite annoying, this brush is very soft and has not shed one bristle in the 8 months I have had it.  Note: I bought the Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand along with the the brush. However the bottom portion of the handle is too thick so the brush hangs in the middle where the brush meets the handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a recommendation from The Art of Manliness, and I can say it&#x27;s not a bad start up brush...but there are WAY better brushes out there for the same price. Such as whipped dog and you can get those custom made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush doesn&#x27;t hold water or heat that well and the hair itself is kind of stiff. It almost feels like a paint brush. Oh and the hairs on mine when I bought it are all crazy, fly away and frizzy ones that fall out and don&#x27;t seem tamed well and almost cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for all around use, but it&#x27;s overall very light weight but the loft size is too big. I have a normal sized face and this thing it just annoying since it will cover your entire face, which might be useful to some that want to shave their whole face. But it&#x27;s tricky getting those small spots like under the nose, besides I only really just shave my neck and cheek bones so this was overkill when it came to size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again good for starting but you can do a lot better for this price.</li>
            <li> I like to wait on reviews until I&#x27;ve used the product for awhile. Well, I bought this brush four years ago, and have used it since.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s held up wonderfully, never shed hairs, and will probably last for decades.&lt;br /&gt;It also works very well, and has gotten better with age, as the bristles softened a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Does what it was made for well, and will probably last forever. Can&#x27;t really ask for more can you?</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. Never shave with regular shaving cream ever again. Always use a badger hair brush and real (old fashioned) shaving soap.</li>
            <li> let me first say at first I was thrilled with this brush i agreed with all the other reviews. Lathers great comfortable etc. After a month though of vary meticulous care the plastic handle cracked. I live in southern us in a extremely humid hot environment. I don&#x27;t think this would occur in milder weather but something to consider for this type of environment. I will probably return and get a chrome handle brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush soft and the hair doesn&#x27;t come out, which is plus.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made brush! Although it is a little stiff it feels great on your face and produces an abundance of lather. I&#x27;m very happy with this brush. If this one wears out I&#x27;ll be sure to buy another one!</li>
