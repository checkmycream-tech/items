            <li>I love this face cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite and Amazon still carries it</li>
            <li>Taking all things into consideration, including my price range, I&#x27;m more than satisfied except for the packaging.</li>
            <li>Good Product, like it very much, light weight and applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Was recommended by my dermatologist, as this product is safe for my fragrance allergy.  </li>
            <li>so I bought 2 more as a gift to my reletives.</li>
            <li>thanks again for the great customer service</li>
            <li>So easy to shop via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Noticeably improves skin&#x27;s texture and smooths fine lines within days&lt;</li>
            <li>fine lines</li>
            <li>i liked so much.</li>
            <li>In the summer it feels light, and never makes me skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li>then it was no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a light moisturizer that keeps my face hydrated all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great product - makes a big difference to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>and thats important to me.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product after seeing the commercials.</li>
            <li>However, all that it promised in its ad wasn&#x27;t true for me.  </li>
            <li>What sounded good to me was the different things it was supposed to cover:&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick no problems w/</li>
            <li>In the winter it offers great moisturizing protection when skin becomes dry from indoor heat and the abrasiveness of the outdoor elements.</li>
            <li>No dramatic results, but I believe it was as effective as similar anti aging products.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin look which is key as I almost never wear any makeup or concealer.</li>
            <li>Found this provides my skin with the necessary nutrients to make my face appear better toned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53, and use it first, under my day cream.</li>
            <li>To get a 5 star rating it would have to be all natural, cruelty-free, produced &amp; packaged in an environmentally friendly way and, of course, be cheaper.</li>
            <li>Seems very effective; actually some visible improvement right after beginning to use and is adequate moisture for my skin (just a bit dry after washing with Cetaphil facial cleanser &amp; water).</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smooth skin&#x27;s surface; or tighten facial contours; or improve firmness, or reduce wrinkles, etc.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>When I began using the Roc products, I noticed major improvement the very first week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 tho&#x27; told look quite a bit younger; mostly due to good/lucky genes &amp; fairly good diet</li>
            <li>but I did not take more than very minimal care of my skin until I was in my mid-40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Cant&#x27;t say much yet since I just started using this particular L&#x27;Oreal product.</li>
            <li>However, I find that most products, especially moisturizers, containing SPF make my skin feel greasy and cause me to break out almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than retail and high quality product</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>high @ 59...............................</li>
            <li>Initial impression is very positive.</li>
            <li>Took away one star only because Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore for the $13.00 I was paying for it regularly, price went up significantly</li>
            <li>I am 34 years old and have sensitive combination skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I find it very convenient that I can use this cream twice a day, instead of having one moisturizer for daytime and a different one for nighttime.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>This cream is the perfect base for any makeup routine.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s not a heavy cream, a little goes a long way (though I do tend to use a bit more in the winter).</li>
            <li>The Revitalift Clinical leaves my skin soft, with some improved &amp;#34;tone&amp;#34; &amp; smooths lines a bit (as much as can be expected until that truly miracle product at low price finds its way to me.</li>
            <li>I noticed a marked improvement in my skin within days after I initially started using it two years ago.</li>
            <li>I am not very good about using night vs. day vs. special creams.  </li>

            <li> In short, this product actually does what it says it will do, in both the short and long term.</li>
            <li> I use it both day and night all year long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Skin-care experts implore us to use SPF on the faceall year long to protect against skin cancer and maintain youthful skin.</li>
            <li> I am using this with a 0.5mm derma roller and several other RevitaLift products.</li>
            <li> I am regular user of this product and this was not right.</li>
            <li> All dark spot has gone and her skin has become younger and brighter.</li>
            <li> Actual contents much less than packaging represents.</li>
            <li> Everything i expected.</li>
            <li> Im not very literate</li>
            <li> rough texture&lt;br /&gt;Brightens</li>
            <li> This one I oredered was empty  in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Overpriced, used with other Revitalift products as recommended, but not much better than many less expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a tube (less &amp;#34;packaging&amp;#34; and less waste of product - can always cut the bottom off a tube to get to the last dregs).</li>
            <li> A container would last me at least 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Had used previously but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> It puts moisture into skin and gives it a little firmness.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks I see a noticeable difference in my jawline, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> and I mean a LOT, now $25 for Amazon stock, but sometimes can find it for less from other non-Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> No strong smell either.</li>
            <li> so am not sure if it&#x27;s discontinued or what.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found it in stores lately</li>
            <li> If you also share this complaint, I recommend trying this cream under a BB cream or foundation with SPF in the daytime.</li>
            <li> This product was fake, and not genuine Loreal.</li>
            <li> It has a very unpleasant chemical smell, and left my face greasy.</li>
            <li> Fake fake fake.</li>
            <li> It smells bad, like chemicals.</li>
            <li> It made my skin break out in whiteheads and clogged my pores badly.</li>
            <li> I am fairly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*Perfect base for makeup&lt;br /&gt;*No</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheaper than retail and high quality product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about four weeks now and have not noticed any improvement in any area of my face.  I am fairly disappointed.  When I began using the Roc products, I noticed major improvement the very first week.  I will go back to using Roc.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing</li>
            <li> After reading the ad For L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Clinical formula in the Sept. Good Housekeeping, I decided to purchase it.  Of course, I used Amazon.com.  So easy to shop via Amazon.  However, all that it promised in its ad wasn&#x27;t true for me.  It didn&#x27;t smooth skin&#x27;s surface; or tighten facial contours; or improve firmness, or reduce wrinkles, etc.  Many promises, but not the results I&#x27;d like.  I think I&#x27;m hoping to buy a miracle in a moisturizer.  I do like the way the cream feels on my face, but I&#x27;m not believing these types of ads again.</li>
            <li> this product is excellent, I really enjoyed, leaves skin soft and beautiful. i liked so much. recommend to all. thanks</li>
            <li> Cant&#x27;t say much yet since I just started using this particular L&#x27;Oreal product. Will rate it once I have used some more.</li>
            <li> This seems to be doing the trick. My skin looks and feels better. Great price and I am very happy</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not greasy.  Absorbs quickly.  Does not cause skin break outs like some products of this genre.  Will definitely continue to use,</li>
            <li> Very nice product, absorbs easily on the skin  and feels good and the dispenser is very handy. A very good price</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am not very good about using night vs. day vs. special creams.  I just need a great product that makes my skin look and feel fresh and is meant to be used at any time of the day.  This product is perfect for me and I love the way it makes my skin look which is key as I almost never wear any makeup or concealer.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, used with other Revitalift products as recommended, but not much better than many less expensive creams. Actual contents much less than packaging represents.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product. I got it within a week in a very good condition. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product. It has a very unpleasant chemical smell, and left my face greasy. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Everything i expected. I searched for this item for months, couldn&#x27;t find it. Im not very literate when it comes to technology, i can get on the internet. I just prefer not to order on line.I was so in need of this product, i searched amazon, ( wonderful site, they have everything!) to my surprise, i now have my product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for helping me find Loreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works well for me!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT price and I love this stuff. I haven&#x27;t found it in stores lately so am not sure if it&#x27;s discontinued or what. I bought two to get stocked up on and probably should order more soon if it&#x27;s still available!</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve used makes me break out after 3 days. This did not. Skin feels smooth and I&#x27;m super impressed that I didn&#x27;t break out! And I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything.  No strong smell either. I love this product. I don&#x27;t understand why it was discontinued. Anyone?</li>
            <li> After trying numerous different facial moisturizers that either made my face break out, simply resulted in no noticeable anti-aging results, or both, I had almost resigned myself to having imperfect skin. Then I discovered this wonderful product. I have been using this cream for about two years; I absolutely love it and refuse to use anything else. I use it both day and night all year long. I am 34 years old and have sensitive combination skin that is prone to breakouts. This product seems to even out my complexion and has never caused me to break out. In the winter it offers great moisturizing protection when skin becomes dry from indoor heat and the abrasiveness of the outdoor elements. In the summer it feels light, and never makes me skin feel greasy. Even though it&#x27;s not a heavy cream, a little goes a long way (though I do tend to use a bit more in the winter). After washing my face and using astringent, I apply this cream before applying a makeup primer and then a tinted BB cream with SPF. This cream is the perfect base for any makeup routine. I find it very convenient that I can use this cream twice a day, instead of having one moisturizer for daytime and a different one for nighttime. It has no noticeable odor or color, which I also love. I noticed a marked improvement in my skin within days after I initially started using it two years ago. Today, people often remark on my \\&quot;porcelain complexion\\&quot; and inquire what I use on my face. In short, this product actually does what it says it will do, in both the short and long term. I HIGHLY recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Noticeably improves skin&#x27;s texture and smooths fine lines within days&lt;br /&gt;*Delivers on what it promises to do for your skin with continued use&lt;br /&gt;*Excellent year-round, day/night moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;*Light and non-greasy, yet moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;*Perfect base for makeup&lt;br /&gt;*No odor or color&lt;br /&gt;**No SPF (see note below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Skin-care experts implore us to use SPF on the faceall year long to protect against skin cancer and maintain youthful skin. However, I find that most products, especially moisturizers, containing SPF make my skin feel greasy and cause me to break out almost instantly. If you also share this complaint, I recommend trying this cream under a BB cream or foundation with SPF in the daytime. (I would like to note that I also tried the Revitalift Clinical Repair Day Cream with SPF; it was much too heavy and greasy, and did make my skin break out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*None!</li>
            <li> This product is the best for me in the last decade! It does everything and does not cause any blemishes!</li>
            <li> I love this face cream. It&#x27;s my favorite and Amazon still carries it and I&#x27;m so happy! This cream does well for me and always has. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, thank heavens for Amazon!</li>
            <li> Initial impression is very positive. To get a 5 star rating it would have to be all natural, cruelty-free, produced &amp; packaged in an environmentally friendly way and, of course, be cheaper. Taking all things into consideration, including my price range, I&#x27;m more than satisfied except for the packaging. I wish it came in a tube (less &amp;#34;packaging&amp;#34; and less waste of product - can always cut the bottom off a tube to get to the last dregs). I love that it&#x27;s ONE PRODUCT that does the best part of 10 others AND is for both night and day. Seems very effective; actually some visible improvement right after beginning to use and is adequate moisture for my skin (just a bit dry after washing with Cetaphil facial cleanser &amp; water). FYI I&#x27;m 66 tho&#x27; told look quite a bit younger; mostly due to good/lucky genes &amp; fairly good diet but I did not take more than very minimal care of my skin until I was in my mid-40&#x27;s. The Revitalift Clinical leaves my skin soft, with some improved &amp;#34;tone&amp;#34; &amp; smooths lines a bit (as much as can be expected until that truly miracle product at low price finds its way to me.</li>
            <li> Good Product, like it very much, light weight and applies smoothly.  Great for under makeup as well as using at night.</li>
            <li> This product was fake, and not genuine Loreal. I am regular user of this product and this was not right. The packaging was different. It smells bad, like chemicals. It made my skin break out in whiteheads and clogged my pores badly. There was not enough product in the tube. Fake fake fake.</li>
            <li> Had used previously but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. I ordered the last one you had.  Have they discontinue the  production of&lt;br /&gt;Revitalist clinical repair? It&#x27;s not greasy.  Feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my dermatologist, as this product is safe for my fragrance allergy.  No dramatic results, but I believe it was as effective as similar anti aging products.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so moist and soft.  Have been using it for over a year and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> The only thing that works for me. Perfect underneath my makeup. I really like the texture and feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> Found this provides my skin with the necessary nutrients to make my face appear better toned. I&#x27;m 53, and use it first, under my day cream. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is great for the price.  I use it in the am and pm, one week in and I can see the difference in couple of my stubborn areas! yeppy! flyin&#x27; high @ 59...............................</li>
            <li> With my skin, anything will help. It puts moisture into skin and gives it a little firmness. Area is dry where I live so it works okay.&lt;br /&gt;Still need to find something that works well on sagging neck line.....</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle cream or anything, but it does feel great on my skin, best ever face lotion feel.  Took away one star only because Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore for the $13.00 I was paying for it regularly, price went up significantly and I mean a LOT, now $25 for Amazon stock, but sometimes can find it for less from other non-Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after seeing the commercials. What sounded good to me was the different things it was supposed to cover:&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes fine lines&lt;br /&gt;Reduces wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Improves firmness&lt;br /&gt;Tightens facial contours&lt;br /&gt;Restores elasticity&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates dryness&lt;br /&gt;Smoothes skin’s surface&lt;br /&gt;Softens rough texture&lt;br /&gt;Brightens dullness&lt;br /&gt;Strengthens skin’s density&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for two weeks at night, I did not notice any of the results listed above. This product clogged my pores and created deep blemishes that have taken a month to remove. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before at box stores and had been using it for a while then it was no longer available in stores.  A container would last me at least 6 weeks.  This one I oredered was empty  in 2 weeks.  will not buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Creamy feeling. Little bit of a funky scent at first but I&#x27;m used to it now.</li>
            <li> This product works good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is a light moisturizer that keeps my face hydrated all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great product - makes a big difference to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks I see a noticeable difference in my jawline, neck and chest. I am using this with a 0.5mm derma roller and several other RevitaLift products. I am very happy with the effectiveness of this product line.</li>
            <li> It had a great effect on my mom&#x27;s skin. All dark spot has gone and her skin has become younger and brighter. It&#x27;s perfect so I bought 2 more as a gift to my reletives.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick no problems w/ this order and I like Loreal face products alot they always seem to do what they say they will do and thats important to me. thanks again for the great customer service</li>
