            <li>They do not dry out my face and they are great at removing long-wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>These facial cleaners worked great for me.</li>

            <li>I like how they work to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Effectively clean and remove oil and dirt.  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels really clean.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling very clean and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.  </li>
            <li>I use a few products to keep my face beautiful,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second time buying them, love it!</li>
            <li>A quick and mild wash for the face on a hot day.</li>
            <li>As someone who breaks out if my makeup isn&#x27;t completely removed, I love these cloths.  </li>
            <li>Overall, these clean well, are easy to use and makes my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Also, the Clean n Clear product didn&#x27;t leave me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling refreshed soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The cloths work and were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>love daily facials</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and really clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more effort to use than I expected, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product that&#x27;s made my skin feel healthy in a long time.</li>
            <li>Yet are still very gentle on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quick and convenient and keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It also does not remove eyeliner very well at all.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work</li>
            <li>My wife really likes these face cloths.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Leaves your face clean, but not dry.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t find the combination</li>
            <li>It surely cleanses well however, I thought it&#x27;d be like a little puffy pocket instead of a large paper-towel like cloth.</li>
            <li>I have found you can cut them into halves, and even fourths and have enough soap for a full face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Order off Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere in person, and this was a good price in comparison to similar wet wipes at places like Walmart or Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than the Clean n Clear disappearing sheets, no worries about accidentally grabbing 5 sheets with wet fingers or heaven forbid getting a drop of water in the case so all the sheets stick together.</li>
            <li>Love washing my face with these sheets during heavy makeup days.</li>
            <li>The oily parts feel normal.  </li>
            <li>We use the wet wipe facial cleansing wipes, they&#x27;re more convenient and easier.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I have no reaction with these cloths.</li>
            <li>Honestly only got these for long travel abroad (limited liquids after all), and so far am pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>I tried a few sheets at home and found that there was more than enough lather, so I actually cut them into quarters and still have enough product to get my face and neck clean.</li>
            <li>Also, the texture of the cloth is very smooth, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>I have severe acne problems and it keeps my face clear of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>They remove waterproof eye makeup like a dream and keep my face soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plenty to completely wash my face.  </li>
            <li>But if your in a jam and don&#x27;t have time for the regular routine these work very well.</li>
            <li>It cleans my makeup off completely.</li>
            <li>Plus they are gentle enough that you can use them everyday and they leave your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these facial cloths!</li>
            <li>I need a little more texture or roughness to exfoliate and really get the dirt that is deep down in my pores.  </li>
            <li>Using one supplies too much soap and much of it goes to waste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Complaints: The so called &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; side for deep cleaning and exfoliation is way to soft to do any sort of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is it could be a bit smaller &amp; more cloths.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>They are so sturdy, in fact, that after I was my face and d&amp;eacute;colletage, I use the cloth to wipe down a part of my shower - the little scrubbing beads do a great job of cleaning up soap scum!</li>
            <li>They work okay in removing makeup and so far I haven&#x27;t broken out, which usually happens since my skin is very sensitive.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s combination skin but at the same time it gets dry.</li>
            <li> Sounds strange, but let me explain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure regular liquid soap is cheaper, but cutting them in half helps.</li>
            <li> cause breakout, also face extremely dry after use</li>
            <li> So do the dry areas.</li>
            <li> If the flap doesn&#x27;t close correctly then the cloths dry out and are not usable.  </li>
            <li> You can definitely cut them in half and use a half at a time if you wish to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> My face is combination and after I&#x27;ve used these daily facials I&#x27;ve noticed my face is less oily.</li>
            <li> I also cut mine in half to make them last longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my facial cleanser since my skin is a bit &#x27;complicated&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Not really what i was expecting, which was a moist cloth.</li>
            <li> I may get blemishes if the dead skin is not removed properly.</li>
            <li> These are dry with little soap beads embedded into the cloth, so once you get them wet</li>
            <li> These cloths contain tiny micro-dots, which never dissolve, and enter out water and waste systems where they remain forever!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would forgo the moisturizer my skin felt a little dry after using.</li>
            <li> Been using them daily for a month now, and only noticed a bit of dryness, but that&#x27;s not uncommon for me anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fan of the rougher texture to help exfoliate and get the day&#x27;s sunscreen</li>
            <li> When you bring the package of the pre-moistened facial cloths sometimes they leak, or the flap loses it&#x27;s ability to stick and close.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these facial cloths for years but often have a difficult time finding them in my local shops.</li>
            <li> A lot of lather comes from one little half of a cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its all in one little wipe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are durable cloths that have little exfoliating microbeads embedded within.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> do fear these are a bit harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> They are a bit expensive for me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for these because the lather just wasn&#x27;t very convincing.  I always feel like there is still more to clean off on my face.  I just didn&#x27;t like the suds it produced.  Also, the texture of the cloth is very smooth, at least for me.  I need a little more texture or roughness to exfoliate and really get the dirt that is deep down in my pores.  It also does not remove eyeliner very well at all.</li>
            <li> These facial cleaners worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Not enough &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34;  on the side for scrubbing. Too &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; for actual facial scrub. Not as good as the ones I bought 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Love these. You can actually get two or three uses out of them.</li>
            <li> They remove waterproof eye makeup like a dream and keep my face soft</li>
            <li> I think they would be really nice and convenient but unfortunately I have sensitive skin and I broke out with a rash on my face from them,</li>
            <li> Love washing my face with these sheets during heavy makeup days.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve found for removing makeup.</li>
            <li> These are definitely made for a woman&#x27;s face or maybe pre-teen males. The pad snags on my face even after shaving.</li>
            <li> Honestly only got these for long travel abroad (limited liquids after all), and so far am pretty pleased. I tried a few sheets at home and found that there was more than enough lather, so I actually cut them into quarters and still have enough product to get my face and neck clean. Been using them daily for a month now, and only noticed a bit of dryness, but that&#x27;s not uncommon for me anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fan of the rougher texture to help exfoliate and get the day&#x27;s sunscreen off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order off Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere in person, and this was a good price in comparison to similar wet wipes at places like Walmart or Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than the Clean n Clear disappearing sheets, no worries about accidentally grabbing 5 sheets with wet fingers or heaven forbid getting a drop of water in the case so all the sheets stick together. Also, the Clean n Clear product didn&#x27;t leave me feeling clean. Maybe just my skin type though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would recommend, and will use again but only for travel reasons.</li>
            <li> These cloths contain tiny micro-dots, which never dissolve, and enter out water and waste systems where they remain forever!  Beware of how you add to the pollution of the world.</li>
            <li> These are convenient for travel if you&#x27;re trying to pack very light. You can definitely cut them in half and use a half at a time if you wish to make them last longer. A lot of lather comes from one little half of a cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do fear these are a bit harsh on my skin so I don&#x27;t use them daily, only for convenience when traveling.</li>
            <li> These have A LOT of soap in each one. I have found you can cut them into halves, and even fourths and have enough soap for a full face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaints: The so called &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; side for deep cleaning and exfoliation is way to soft to do any sort of exfoliation. I have very sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all.</li>
            <li> Use them every day, gentle yet effective.My skin is very sensitive and I have no reaction with these cloths. Great product, recommended!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!  It leaves my face feeling refreshed soft and smooth. My face is combination and after I&#x27;ve used these daily facials I&#x27;ve noticed my face is less oily. One wipe  removes all my makeup perfectly even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I use these every day to wash my face.  They&#x27;re quick and convenient and keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Have used Olay for many years and was very pleased with my purchase. I will purchase again from Amazon. The cloths work and were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I  love these. I get these on a subscription basis. I like how they work to clean my face. They are textured so it helps in the scrubbing of my skin</li>
            <li> As someone who breaks out if my makeup isn&#x27;t completely removed, I love these cloths.  They do not dry out my face and they are great at removing long-wearing makeup.  I also cut mine in half to make them last longer.  It&#x27;s plenty to completely wash my face.  I&#x27;m sure regular liquid soap is cheaper, but cutting them in half helps.</li>
            <li> I break these into halves so I get more use out of them. Using one supplies too much soap and much of it goes to waste. Overall, these clean well, are easy to use and makes my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Love these clothes. They are great for removing makeup. I love taking them when we travel. They are a lot easier to pack than a million different bottles of cleanser.  Plus they are gentle enough that you can use them everyday and they leave your face feeling clean and refreshed. I highly recommend these facial cloths!</li>
            <li> These are nice for when your traveling and don&#x27;t why to pack all you cleansing supplies. Its all in one little wipe. I don&#x27;t think I would forgo the moisturizer my skin felt a little dry after using. But if your in a jam and don&#x27;t have time for the regular routine these work very well.</li>
            <li> Cleanses my face as well as removes makeup.  It does not dry out my skin and I will buy again</li>
            <li> handy, clean, and effective--I love these for home or travel</li>
            <li> Great cleansing cloths....the best</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.  I have severe acne problems and it keeps my face clear of breakouts.  The ability to throw out the cloth keeps my face sanitary.  You can&#x27;t do that if you reuse washcloths as bacteria grows in dampness.</li>
            <li> Effectively clean and remove oil and dirt.  Good for combination skin.  But, I see no advantage over a washcloth with facial cleanser.  We use the wet wipe facial cleansing wipes, they&#x27;re more convenient and easier.</li>
            <li> I use these every day.  Oil of Olay products are excellent.</li>
            <li> cause breakout, also face extremely dry after use</li>
            <li> Very nice cleansing cloths. I was finished using the cloth before it was out of suds. The cloth itself is durable and did not tear during use. It left my face feeling very clean and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It surely cleanses well however, I thought it&#x27;d be like a little puffy pocket instead of a large paper-towel like cloth. But still great!</li>
            <li> Not really what i was expecting, which was a moist cloth. These are dry with little soap beads embedded into the cloth, so once you get them wet they lather up. They work okay in removing makeup and so far I haven&#x27;t broken out, which usually happens since my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It cleans my makeup off completely. I would have given it a 5. The only complaint I have is it could be a bit smaller &amp; more cloths. They are a bit expensive for me.</li>
            <li> The most convenient .. cleanser for my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love daily facials</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my facial cleanser since my skin is a bit &#x27;complicated&#x27;. It&#x27;s combination skin but at the same time it gets dry. I may get blemishes if the dead skin is not removed properly. These cloths are perfect - they exfoliate but are not rough on the skin. It&#x27;s my second time buying them, love it!</li>
            <li> Always a good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more effort to use than I expected, but it&#x27;s worth it. Leaves my skin soft and really clean. Perfect. The oily parts feel normal.  So do the dry areas. It&#x27;s the first product that&#x27;s made my skin feel healthy in a long time. I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work this well. Very pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> These cloths are so convenient when traveling.  Just a bit of water and suds for your face.  Very gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years. It is wonderful and very good for my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes these face cloths. Great price and fast delivery. Thanks</li>
            <li> I use a few products to keep my face beautiful,  I like the price and feel of these. Your skin feels really clean. Great to travel with.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful to travel with when you are taking on carry on luggage.  Sounds strange, but let me explain.  I have used the pre-moistened facial cloths for years.  When you bring the package of the pre-moistened facial cloths sometimes they leak, or the flap loses it&#x27;s ability to stick and close.  If the flap doesn&#x27;t close correctly then the cloths dry out and are not usable.  So these are so much better to travel with.  You can bring the amount that you need, put them in a ziplock and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful to clean my face each night. No breaking out and easy to carry on vacation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these facial cloths for years but often have a difficult time finding them in my local shops. I was happy to find them on Amazon and at a great price too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are durable cloths that have little exfoliating microbeads embedded within. My face is very clean and smooth after using and the cloths don&#x27;t fall apart in my hands. They are so sturdy, in fact, that after I was my face and d&amp;eacute;colletage, I use the cloth to wipe down a part of my shower - the little scrubbing beads do a great job of cleaning up soap scum! 😄 Yet are still very gentle on my super sensitive skin. Hey, I&#x27;m frugal, trust me on this.</li>
            <li> I use these when traveling, especially to Europe where wash clothes aren&#x27;t always provided.  Leaves your face clean, but not dry.</li>
            <li> This is part of my dream team that keeps my face looking great. I really can&#x27;t find the combination /oily wipes in the stores so I so happy that I can buy it here.</li>
            <li> A quick and mild wash for the face on a hot day.</li>
            <li> I have no idea where else I would use this to wash my face, but if you will be on a plane for 13 hours or maybe drive all night, This seems to be a good option. Bring the bottled water and face towel.</li>
