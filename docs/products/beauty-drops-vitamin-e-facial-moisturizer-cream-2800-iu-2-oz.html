            <li>I loved this!</li>
            <li>It absorbs great and is perfect for bedtime and still great for under make-up if you have SPF in your foundation.  </li>
            <li>LOL.  </li>
            <li>My friends are even commenting on how my face is glowing and they are joking saying,\\&quot;Ooh your husband must be keeping you happy.\\&quot;(LOL).</li>
            <li>This cream is GREAT.</li>
            <li>(LOL).</li>
            <li>That aside, it really is good for skin.</li>
            <li>They made good by it and sent me what I had ordered.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize and the vitamin E is supposed to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cost makes it a good choice to keep at work or in</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good on a budget</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>My daughter borrowed mine, and liked it.</li>
            <li>my skin had a nice glow all day.</li>
            <li>A nice product for the price.....</li>
            <li>i really liked it and</li>
            <li>Feels light and good on the face.</li>
            <li>This has been the best form of controlling my eczema and reducing my scarring on my face BY FAR.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it gets rid of wrinkles and fine lines, but it does give my skin an amazing complexion and glow.</li>
            <li>Love this face cream.  </li>
            <li>After washing my face in the morning I applied more to my skin.</li>
            <li>I also can wear it under makeup and it leaves my makeup looking better as well.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better, but they cost a lot more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To top it off I have had acne scarring (Not severe)</li>
            <li>I went today to get some more of the oil as i was running out and bought 10 bottles.</li>
            <li>I think this product works better than the pricey face creams that you buy in department stores plus it does not burn my eyes like some so-called wrinkle creams do.</li>
            <li>so why pay more.</li>
            <li>For someone with reactions to most creams, this is a blessing.</li>
            <li>you have skin that dries out easily</li>
            <li>kind of oily at first,</li>
            <li>My son has seen a HUGE inprovement, as well as my daughter, friends and family.  </li>
            <li>Then I thought it was just my imagination because this cream is too cheap to yield these results.</li>
            <li>I think the Beauty Drops Vitamin E Facial Moisturizer Cream is a great find.  </li>
            <li>She says it is good for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product is cheap and shipping cost more then the product, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E is such a great ingredient and really has SO many benefits.    </li>
            <li>really does the trick, its also great for sensitive skin since it is unscented and does not have a lot of ingredients in it that could irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>and I can not express enough how gorgeous my skin look.</li>
            <li>This product works well for me as a in the day, at night I like to wear it with the vitamin e oil layered over for extra moisture, but if you have oily/normal skin, the product on its own should do you just fine.</li>
            <li>It has helped me tremendously along with the Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>better value than what i was able to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li>Probably good for someone with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather oily than dry, and it does feel good</li>
            <li>I picked this stuff at the 99 cent store of all places in Los Angeles when I ran out of my department store moisturizer and it actually works better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m suprised I like a cream for my face that is not expensive!</li>
            <li>This is a very good moisturizer for those who have dry skin only; not for those with combination or oily skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d buy this exact product again.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more, but for now my daughter get a kick out of me asking her if I can use some of her cream.</li>
            <li>It is light and soft.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have expected much if I let the price be the guide, however, after reading reviews I agree it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and It did okay on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>My mom has a skin issue called rosacia on her face and the redness from it really cleared up from this lotion.</li>
            <li>but my face absorbs it fast</li>
            <li>and I am left with silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I also bought this product and it has kept my face nice and smooth and my face hasn&#x27;t broken out from it at all.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer cream works well so far and the price is right.</li>
            <li>My husband asked to use one of my facial moisturizers, since his skin gets dry in winter, so I bought him his own.</li>
            <li>Made my skin super soft and gave it a natural glow</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to enjoy it for as long as it lasts, but</li>
            <li>My skin is sooooo soft after just the first use.  </li>
            <li>and I have also seen a tremendous difference in the wrinkles I was starting to acquire at my age.</li>
            <li>Great value and helps mature skin to feel less tight</li>
            <li>I orginally bought this cream for my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>figured it would get old quick)So after doing my weekly mudd mask</li>
            <li>so I ordered the Beauty Drops eye cream and this cream with it since it said it was for sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li>, it leaves my skin soft and supple and I use it under makeup and before bed.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my eczema as well as my 6 year old daughter whom also has eczema.</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old</li>
            <li>I am going back to buy the whole box for myself.</li>
            <li>though it was well worth what i spent for it.</li>
            <li>I originally wanted eye cream because my eye area started to get irritated from my usual eye cream</li>
            <li>I know, to young for cream, but she always see me doing my beauty routine and begged me to buy her some cream,  because she said she didn&#x27;t want bumps like her big brother, who is 20.</li>
            <li>This cream is super thick and creamy, a dab spreads quite a bit.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This cream is super thick and creamy, a dab spreads quite a bit.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I discovered is that your skin must be totally dry before you apply it in order for it to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that needs constant moisture and this during the day time</li>
            <li> I have never had such results before and have spent hundreds on facial creams.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made for sensitive skin and has little to no fragrance (which I like).  </li>
            <li> greasy - it eventually soaks into the skin but takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will use it as long as I can get my hands on it....</li>
            <li> was looking for something to help my dry face that wouldn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels soothing spreading it on my face, but my skin feels slightly oily.</li>
            <li> This jar will last a very long time because you use so little at a time.</li>
            <li> I swear my little dry lines are dissapearing after 1 week</li>
            <li> It was as if there was a divider put down the center when they were filled and half the jar got the cream and the other half remained empty.  :(</li>
            <li> I think this will become my permanent cream and for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old female, who suffers from acne and blackheads, so I use this as a night cream and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I have had less breakouts.  </li>
            <li> all you need is a little dab.</li>
            <li> However, the big disappointment comes in opening the 2 jars I bought and finding that maybe, if combined, they might equal one.</li>
            <li> My friend had been out for a few weeks and as soon as she put this on her face she could tell the difference on how her shin looked and felt.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or thick.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> But the price is crazy, you can this where I&#x27;m at in any 99 cent Store for a dollar in California.</li>
            <li> SHOCKED THE HELL OUT OF ME.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> greasy - it eventually soaks into the skin but takes a long time.  Probably good for someone with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream.  Have been using it for a long time.  Feels light and good on the face.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my sister.  She has used this for several years and loves it.</li>
            <li> Great value and helps mature skin to feel less tight</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> I bought four jars at Amazon: two for my daughter and two for my husband.  My daughter borrowed mine, and liked it. She says it is good for her sensitive skin. This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t make her face feel oily. My husband asked to use one of my facial moisturizers, since his skin gets dry in winter, so I bought him his own.</li>
            <li> This cream works well in moisturizing. The only thing that I discovered is that your skin must be totally dry before you apply it in order for it to spread evenly. That aside, it really is good for skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and received the wrong product. They made good by it and sent me what I had ordered. I did not order this for myself but for a friend. The product is cheap and shipping cost more then the product, but it was worth it. My friend had been out for a few weeks and as soon as she put this on her face she could tell the difference on how her shin looked and felt. I just ordered her another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that needs constant moisture and this during the day time really does the trick, its also great for sensitive skin since it is unscented and does not have a lot of ingredients in it that could irritate the skin.

            <li> This is a very good moisturizer for those who have dry skin only; not for those with combination or oily skin. I must tell you all that this can be purchased for 1$ at the 99 Cent Only Store.</li>
            <li> I am not going to order it again.  It doesn&#x27;t compare t what I habe been using.</li>
            <li> This cream is super thick and creamy, a dab spreads quite a bit. This jar will last a very long time because you use so little at a time. It definitely feels soothing spreading it on my face, but my skin feels slightly oily. I&#x27;d rather oily than dry, and it does feel good so I&#x27;m going to enjoy it for as long as it lasts, but I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d buy this exact product again.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer cream works well so far and the price is right. It does moisturize and the vitamin E is supposed to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li> Ok. I gonna try and keep it short. I bumped into this cream by accident. I orginally bought this cream for my 5 year old daughter. I know, to young for cream, but she always see me doing my beauty routine and begged me to buy her some cream,  because she said she didn&#x27;t want bumps like her big brother, who is 20. LOL.  So I went to the 99cent store and pick this cream up for her. She only used it once(kinda figured it would get old quick)So after doing my weekly mudd mask, I realized i did not have any moisturizer left. I used the cream and the next morning my face was glowing. After washing my face in the morning I applied more to my skin. my skin had a nice glow all day. Then I thought it was just my imagination because this cream is too cheap to yield these results. So I decided to use it for a week to see if I would notice a difference. OMG I have been using this cream for a month and I can not express enough how gorgeous my skin look. My friends are even commenting on how my face is glowing and they are joking saying,\\&quot;Ooh your husband must be keeping you happy.\\&quot;(LOL). By the way I am 42 years and in just one month I have turned back the hands of time.  So don&#x27;t be fooled by the price like I was. This cream is GREAT. I will definitely buy more, but for now my daughter get a kick out of me asking her if I can use some of her cream. (LOL). I also plan to pick up there eye cream at the 99cent store and give a review on that.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted eye cream because my eye area started to get irritated from my usual eye cream so I ordered the Beauty Drops eye cream and this cream with it since it said it was for sensitive skin as well.  I really like this cream, it leaves my skin soft and supple and I use it under makeup and before bed.  I swear my little dry lines are dissapearing after 1 week and when I wake in the morning my face looks hydrated and well rested like it use to when I was younger (i&#x27;m 42).  I have never had such results before and have spent hundreds on facial creams.  I think this will become my permanent cream and for a lot less.</li>
            <li> A nice product for the price.....</li>
            <li> My mom has a skin issue called rosacia on her face and the redness from it really cleared up from this lotion. I also bought this product and it has kept my face nice and smooth and my face hasn&#x27;t broken out from it at all. I also can wear it under makeup and it leaves my makeup looking better as well. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it.  I use it day and night, along with the serum vitamin c</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this lotion! I am a 26 year old female, who suffers from acne and blackheads, so I use this as a night cream and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I can&#x27;t say it gets rid of wrinkles and fine lines, but it does give my skin an amazing complexion and glow. And hopefully it helps prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have expected much if I let the price be the guide, however, after reading reviews I agree it is amazing.  My skin is sooooo soft after just the first use.  It is not greasy or thick.  It absorbs great and is perfect for bedtime and still great for under make-up if you have SPF in your foundation.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star for the product itself. But the price is crazy, you can this where I&#x27;m at in any 99 cent Store for a dollar in California. Six dollars is a ripoff.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works well. I&#x27;ve used better, but they cost a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy this again. It&#x27;s cost makes it a good choice to keep at work or in the car.&lt;br /&gt;If you have skin that dries out easily this is a plus.</li>
            <li> I think the Beauty Drops Vitamin E Facial Moisturizer Cream is a great find.  I like it&#x27;s consistency and feel like it moisturizes well.  I apply it all over my face including the eye area.  It&#x27;s made for sensitive skin and has little to no fragrance (which I like).  I&#x27;m suprised I like a cream for my face that is not expensive! My sister tried it took and she wanted me to get her a jar too. Today I bought my second jar of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonderfully. Made my skin super soft and gave it a natural glow</li>
            <li> I discovered this stuff at the 99Cent Only Store in Southern California. It has helped me tremendously along with the Vitamin E oil. I use it on my eczema as well as my 6 year old daughter whom also has eczema. To top it off I have had acne scarring (Not severe) but i do have it on my face and it&#x27;s almost cleared up. I am 49 years old and I have also seen a tremendous difference in the wrinkles I was starting to acquire at my age. I have to say tho you MUST use it daily after showering and at night (after washing your face) before going to bed. I use this and the oil both. My son has seen a HUGE inprovement, as well as my daughter, friends and family.  Washing your face and applying this as well as the oil if you have severe or moderate acne scarring or eczema takes patients and dicipline.This has been the best form of controlling my eczema and reducing my scarring on my face BY FAR. The product is FATASTIC. SHOCKED THE HELL OUT OF ME. PS. GET THE OIL TOO. I went today to get some more of the oil as i was running out and bought 10 bottles. I am going back to buy the whole box for myself. I told the lady at the register (This is my youth serem). I will use it as long as I can get my hands on it....</li>
            <li> I think this product works better than the pricey face creams that you buy in department stores plus it does not burn my eyes like some so-called wrinkle creams do. Definitely a bargain for such a low price.</li>
            <li> seems to work  so why pay more. it&#x27;s good on a budget and It did okay on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn. It is light and soft. For someone with reactions to most creams, this is a blessing. It is affordable too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it has a tad bit of a greasy feel to it...making it take longer to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; on my face before I can put my makeup on.  I feel this moisturizer protects my face from my foundation sitting in my pores....I have had less breakouts.  I do recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this product for the price</li>
            <li> Hopefully this product will turn out to be beneficial....can&#x27;t comment on that yet since I just received it.  However, the big disappointment comes in opening the 2 jars I bought and finding that maybe, if combined, they might equal one. Since both jars were the same inside I don&#x27;t think this was a conincidence.  It was as if there was a divider put down the center when they were filled and half the jar got the cream and the other half remained empty.  :(</li>
            <li> I loved this! all you need is a little dab. kind of oily at first, but my face absorbs it fast and I am left with silky smooth skin. was looking for something to help my dry face that wouldn&#x27;t break me out. it did just that!</li>
            <li> has a creamy texture. i really liked it and though it was well worth what i spent for it. better value than what i was able to find in my local stores.</li>
