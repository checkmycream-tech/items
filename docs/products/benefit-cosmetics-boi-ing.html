    <ol>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for hiding imperfections with or without foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the BEST concealer I have ever used, so</li>
            <li>This item was bought for a Christmas gift, and the price was perfect!</li>
            <li>This is the best concealer I have found.</li>
            <li>Anyway, Benefit products are really very good.  </li>
            <li>Product does not give very good coverage.</li>
            <li>Got it in the mail very quickly and in perfect condition, the product was PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>Boing is just great.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Never in my life have I experienced any problems with my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this concealer for 5 years and it is great.</li>
            <li>Strictly as a concealer, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Used as a concealer, it&#x27;s great, maybe a touch oily.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this again, it is very effective for hiding flaws.</li>
            <li>Good concealer but not the easiest to apply</li>
            <li>It is a bit on the moist side so good for again dryer skin.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Did I mention I love it?!</li>
            <li>After trying 5 others-- this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I use another awesome product from Benefit, Some Kinda Wonderful, which is advertised as the \\&quot;non-cover-up cover-up\\&quot; because it is so natural if you get the right color for your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>If you blend it in over the whole eye, both top and under the eye, it looks very good.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years, (why change brands when it works perfectly?)</li>
            <li>Since I had always sort of blended the two colors in that kit, I wasn&#x27;t sure what color to order.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it many times though, and it works well without being overwhelmingly obivious like the full-face mask foundation</li>
            <li>so I just kept applying more and more of course.</li>
            <li>and I was tempted to send it back for a lighter shade but on my skin it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find Benefit products on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good concealer that lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t slide all of their face :)</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and blends easily with foundation or tinted sunblock</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering the light after receiving this, I will probably have to blend the two for the color I need.  </li>
            <li>I light acne, maybe a pimple or two every so often</li>
            <li>This is a good concealer and it is not heavy</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but this conceler is worth it!</li>
            <li>It is creamy and smooth, especially if you use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Just a quick shmear under my eyes</li>
            <li>After loyally using a drugstore brand I splurged on this product.</li>
            <li>it is definitely worth the price of having</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It covers up dark circles better than most.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best used with a finger, you need to sort of warm it up a bit so that it&#x27;s not super thick like clay.</li>
            <li>I have dark under-eye circles from my allergies and have tried many many concealers.  </li>
            <li>It would probably be rated higher if I had gotten the lightest shade instead of the medium.  </li>
            <li>I also got Benefits Lemon-Aid at the same time and that I do love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Boi-ing for a several years now and haven&#x27;t found a better product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re young and have no dark circles or fine lines, I&#x27;m sure you can use it as an under eye concealer (but then again if you&#x27;re that young</li>
            <li>Very compact &amp; covers my flaws.</li>
            <li>This is a good concealer that is thick and effectively covers all my blemishes and fixes my uneven skin tone underneath powders/foundation.</li>
            <li>and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really works, doesn&#x27;t come off easily and goes only quickly.  </li>
            <li>Product is oily, name comes out from container, color doesnt even look the same as original.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to have 2, but they will at least fit in my make-up bag!!  </li>
            <li>ALL of my acne is gone except for about two pimples and I am left with a chin FULL of acne scars...</li>
            <li>,This is the best thing to fix my problem,no more crazy dark circles in my face,when I wear makeup looks sooo soft under my eyes,seriously recommend,Im in shock with this :_D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Boi-ing for a few years now after having tried many, many other concealers.</li>
            <li>I ordered this directly from Benefit to insure i got the real deal.</li>
            <li>Goes on thick, but I dab it on and let it warm up than blend.  </li>
            <li>I have very dark circles with pale skin, and this does a great job camouflaging my fatigue.</li>
            <li>Also works great on spot cover for dark and red spots, in an instant they are simply gone!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sales lady at Ulta told me it is hypoallergenic which is complete baloney!</li>
            <li>I usually use primer, then concealer and then powder on top to set the concealer.</li>
            <li>Be aware, there are fakes everywhere especially on ebay</li>
            <li>I have pretty dark undereye circles and it conceals them really well.</li>
            <li>In reality, only cosmetic surgery really help fade circles.  </li>
            <li>I am 32 years old and using makeup for years...</li>
            <li>The next morning my eye was burning and very irritated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively tan and my color fluctuates drastically throughout the year because of sun in the summer and staying in during the winter but this shade works very well under makeup throughout the year.</li>
            <li>(my chin is completely covered with cystic acne and scars</li>
            <li>so order this direct from Benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I take a slightly wet q-tip and clean my inner eyes after I apply it.</li>
            <li>Works well to conceal several dark spots on my face before applying foundation, light powder, and blush.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a GREAT product for covering things up like dark circles and uneven areas.</li>
            <li>After using the whole product (about 7 weeks) I have EXTREME acne</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I honestly I have a horrible dark circles,I can never cover up with nothing not even sleeping or creams,Im in In lOVE with my bOi-iNg in medium color</li>
            <li> but it does last very long</li>
            <li> The prices are not high and they last.  </li>
            <li> Despite using eye cream underneath I ended up with severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting some dark circles and a couple of lines under my eyes, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I ordered the individual container because I didn&#x27;t like taking the other one when I traveled due to the bulkier shape/size.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other eye concealer.</li>
            <li> I had the Benefit &amp;#34;Conceal-Aholic&amp;#34; little kit for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I tried this for dark undereye circle.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles from allergies,etc.</li>
            <li> I use it to cover up dark spots, pimples and around my nose.</li>
            <li> Note, this looked way too dark for medium</li>
            <li> I love Benefit, unfortunately this product is such a bad imitation...</li>
            <li> The medium/light is also a little too dark for my skin</li>
            <li> , it seems as though half of it gets wasted in the make up sponge.  </li>
            <li> Also, it completely dried out the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put it in a small make-up bag.  </li>
            <li> I have olive skin and usually use the medium/light in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to settle, and I don&#x27;t usually like it without some sort of powder or foundation, but it covers well.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that this is NOT an under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> This product was a big disappointment all around.</li>
            <li> It arrived late and was sealed together.</li>
            <li> Obviously they do not check their merchandise before they ship it.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> had neck surgery two months ago and it left me with an ugly scar on my throat.</li>
            <li> I applied this concealer for my under eye circles and noticed that it was very thick.</li>
            <li> Well my acne kept getting worse and worse</li>
            <li> Later that evening, my had swelled up and very painful.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong one and gave it to my mother.  </li>
            <li> I was out in humid weather and the product felt very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I never write reviews, but this conceler is worth it! Just a quick shmear under my eyes and I look rested. I have very dark circles with pale skin, and this does a great job camouflaging my fatigue. Mom of two, on the go and it&#x27;s my go to when I leave the house or stay in! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a good concealer and it is not heavy so I like that but it does last very long</li>
            <li> Product covers well. I also use &#x27;powderflage&#x27; powder concealor by benefit to help keep the cream concealor from settling in the creases.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I discovered it sometime in December 2009.   I just ordered my second one.  It is creamy and smooth, especially if you use a good moisturizer.  It covers up dark circles better than most.  In reality, only cosmetic surgery really help fade circles.  If you blend it in over the whole eye, both top and under the eye, it looks very good.  I use another awesome product from Benefit, Some Kinda Wonderful, which is advertised as the \\&quot;non-cover-up cover-up\\&quot; because it is so natural if you get the right color for your skin tone.  I got the wrong one and gave it to my mother.  She loves it.  Anyway, Benefit products are really very good.  The prices are not high and they last.  Boing is just great.  I won&#x27;t use any other eye concealer.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail very quickly and in perfect condition, the product was PERFECT.  Works great and I will definitely reorder again.</li>
            <li> I honestly I have a horrible dark circles,I can never cover up with nothing not even sleeping or creams,Im in In lOVE with my bOi-iNg in medium color,This is the best thing to fix my problem,no more crazy dark circles in my face,when I wear makeup looks sooo soft under my eyes,seriously recommend,Im in shock with this :_D</li>
            <li> I tried this for dark undereye circle.  It would probably be rated higher if I had gotten the lightest shade instead of the medium.  But Benefits site states if in doubt order the medium.  Goes on thick, but I dab it on and let it warm up than blend.  I also got Benefits Lemon-Aid at the same time and that I do love.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and it brightenes up my eyes so I don&#x27;t look so sleep deprived.  I probably will not order this again, but if so, I would definately go lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Boi-ing for a few years now after having tried many, many other concealers. I have dark circles from allergies,etc. and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really works, doesn&#x27;t come off easily and goes only quickly.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and using makeup for years... This product gave me a Chalazion; an eyelid cyst. I have never had any problems with makeup before. I always use makeup remover and thoroughly wash my face after. I applied this concealer for my under eye circles and noticed that it was very thick. Sales lady at Ulta told me it is hypoallergenic which is complete baloney! I started to get eye irritation after 3 hours of use. I was out in humid weather and the product felt very uncomfortable. I removed the concealer as soon as I returned home. The next morning my eye was burning and very irritated. Later that evening, my had swelled up and very painful. It has been almost 2 weeks, 2 doctors visits, and still...a lump remains. If it does not go away in 3 weeks; I will have to have the Chalazion surgically removed. This procedure could permanently scar and deform my eye. I advise everyone to take extreme caution not to place this makeup anywhere near the eyes. Never in my life have I experienced any problems with my eyes. I will be contacting this company about my medical issue caused by this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, (why change brands when it works perfectly?) Goes on smoothly and blends easily with foundation or tinted sunblock</li>
            <li> I tried this before purchasing when I was up at the family cabin. I have pretty dark undereye circles and it conceals them really well. It is perfect for hiding imperfections with or without foundation. Did I mention I love it?!</li>
            <li> I had the Benefit &amp;#34;Conceal-Aholic&amp;#34; little kit for a very long time.  This stuff lasts FOREVER!  I ordered the individual container because I didn&#x27;t like taking the other one when I traveled due to the bulkier shape/size.  You can&#x27;t put it in a small make-up bag.  Since I had always sort of blended the two colors in that kit, I wasn&#x27;t sure what color to order.  I have olive skin and usually use the medium/light in the winter months.  I ended up ordering the light after receiving this, I will probably have to blend the two for the color I need.  I didn&#x27;t really want to have 2, but they will at least fit in my make-up bag!!  It&#x27;s the BEST concealer I have ever used, so it is definitely worth the price of having and like I said, it lasts forever!  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good concealer that lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t slide all of their face :)</li>
            <li> Good concealer but not the easiest to apply, it seems as though half of it gets wasted in the make up sponge.  I&#x27;ve bought it many times though, and it works well without being overwhelmingly obivious like the full-face mask foundation</li>
            <li> Too oily and actually emphasized lines.  The medium/light is also a little too dark for my skin but that is my fault for choosing it.</li>
            <li> After loyally using a drugstore brand I splurged on this product. I found it goes on like paint and does not blend. Also, it completely dried out the skin under my eyes. Despite using eye cream underneath I ended up with severely dry skin. This product was a big disappointment all around.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find Benefit products on Amazon.com! This item was bought for a Christmas gift, and the price was perfect!</li>
            <li> Product does not give very good coverage.</li>
            <li> This is a good concealer that is thick and effectively covers all my blemishes and fixes my uneven skin tone underneath powders/foundation. I&#x27;m relatively tan and my color fluctuates drastically throughout the year because of sun in the summer and staying in during the winter but this shade works very well under makeup throughout the year.</li>
            <li> Re-order this product all the time.  Very compact &amp; covers my flaws.</li>
            <li> I have been using this concealer for 5 years and it is great.It is a bit on the moist side so good for again dryer skin. After trying 5 others-- this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Strictly as a concealer, this stuff is great. It&#x27;s best used with a finger, you need to sort of warm it up a bit so that it&#x27;s not super thick like clay. I use it to cover up dark spots, pimples and around my nose. I learned the hard way that this is NOT an under eye concealer. If you&#x27;re young and have no dark circles or fine lines, I&#x27;m sure you can use it as an under eye concealer (but then again if you&#x27;re that young you might not even need to conceal under your eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid/late 20s and I&#x27;m getting some dark circles and a couple of lines under my eyes, not a big deal. But when you use this as an under eye concealer, you accentuate all the lines, all the creases, EVERYTHING. I usually use primer, then concealer and then powder on top to set the concealer. Halfway through the day, I saw my reflection and almost broke the mirror. It was like I had tissue paper than I crumpled up over and over throughout the day and taped it under my eyes. TERRIBLE. I learned my lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Used as a concealer, it&#x27;s great, maybe a touch oily. Don&#x27;t use this as an under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years - It totally makes my face look years younger when I use it under my eyes.  AND it stays on all day.  Great stuff.  To keep if from getting in my eyes I take a slightly wet q-tip and clean my inner eyes after I apply it.</li>
            <li> I light acne, maybe a pimple or two every so often so i bought this to cover up my pimples. Well my acne kept getting worse and worse and I assumed it was because I had recently changed medications so I just kept applying more and more of course. After using the whole product (about 7 weeks) I have EXTREME acne (my chin is completely covered with cystic acne and scars.. wish I could show pictures!) Well, I have stopped using boi-ing for about a week now. ALL of my acne is gone except for about two pimples and I am left with a chin FULL of acne scars... just wish I would have realized earlier that it was the reason for all my clogged pores and acne. Other than that its a GREAT product for covering things up like dark circles and uneven areas. BUT DO NOT USE ON ACNE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I will NEVER order this again off Amazon. It arrived late and was sealed together. It could not be opened!&lt;br /&gt;We tried everything we could think of to open t. Obviously they do not check their merchandise before they ship it.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I have found. It does tend to settle, and I don&#x27;t usually like it without some sort of powder or foundation, but it covers well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this directly from Benefit to insure i got the real deal. Be aware, there are fakes everywhere especially on ebay so order this direct from Benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I had neck surgery two months ago and it left me with an ugly scar on my throat. This Boing product covered it so well you can&#x27;t see it at all. Also works great on spot cover for dark and red spots, in an instant they are simply gone!&lt;br /&gt; I have medium tone skin with a bit of redness and 03 was perfect.&lt;br /&gt; Note, this looked way too dark for medium and I was tempted to send it back for a lighter shade but on my skin it was perfect! I will buy this again, it is very effective for hiding flaws.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Boi-ing for a several years now and haven&#x27;t found a better product. I have dark under-eye circles from my allergies and have tried many many concealers.  It blends well, covers well and stays on even in the Florida sun over the summer. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works well to conceal several dark spots on my face before applying foundation, light powder, and blush.</li>
            <li> I love Benefit, unfortunately this product is such a bad imitation... Product is oily, name comes out from container, color doesnt even look the same as original.</li>
