            <li>works great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>the good citizens who Solingen who supposedly manufacture these files have let Germanic manufacturing standards slip or (ii)</li>
            <li>Good Grief!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these nail files!</li>
            <li>And I love the length as well as the handle with the convenient finger rest!</li>

            <li>One of the best files I have ever bought, really smooths out the top of your nails quickly and easily!</li>
            <li>Works better than anything in the store.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product, and would buy more if I need them.</li>
            <li>I am retired and do have to watch the pennies. :-)</li>
            <li>Only time will tell about how well it holds up with use, but the quality is there and I will hope for the best.</li>
            <li>Works well on natural nails with no polish or &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; but probably would work great on those too.</li>
            <li>and I love the length and that it is pointed to clean nails while filing.</li>
            <li>This is smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are quite nice and really do the job correctly.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s important to her.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how often it is used it will pay for itself over using cheap throwaway emory boards.</li>
            <li>REALLY NICE FILE , CANNOT FIND DECENT NAIL FILES THESE DAYS</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many years it&#x27;s been since I could find a real nail file.  </li>
            <li>The smaller size would be good for nails and I am considering buying.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and it lasts forever!:)</li>
            <li>These store sell files that are apparently produced by stamping flat steel and she finds their performance marginal at best.  </li>
            <li>I own four of these nail files, and use them in preference to emery boards, which I despise, or cheap metal nail files which loose their tooth and quit working with monotonous regularity.</li>
            <li>Now all you can get are the paper kind that do not last or do the job well.</li>
            <li>I like them very very much.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it appears that it will last significantly longer than the commonly available items.  </li>
            <li>Have been through many glass nail files and decided to go back to a metal file.  </li>
            <li>Well, this is it - nice and long and well made and has a coarse and fine side.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>This is a good replacement, which I hope will last a long time; if so I would give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>One file has minor tooth irregularities on one edge, which is why I only gave four stars, but it still performs better than the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>Like most nail files, it has a fine and coarse option, but what sets it apart is that it is not too coarse or too fine, as is the case with other brands.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the tip of the &amp;#34;file sheet&amp;#34; that is smooth and does not have the embedded grains was noticeably different in area on the two samples.  </li>
            <li>Last order of 92 were all just thrown in all together in one box which couldn&#x27;t fit in</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>so much I like it.</li>
            <li>These really last (my original one is about twenty years old, and while worn, still works well enough in a pinch, so that I bought more when I found them at Amazon) and both rough and smooth sides work well.</li>
            <li>It lasts, and it has two surfaces for filing either coarse or fine action.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>These have a rough (GROS) and fine (FEIN) sides.  </li>
            <li>One side offers a very fine cut, while the other side offers rougher, faster cut.  </li>
            <li>Try filling down a toenail when you cannot reach your feet because your legs will not bend that far, or have a need to use a longer file than the 2 inch files that are normal for most applications.  </li>
            <li>The quality is outstanding, stays the same for a very very long time.</li>
            <li>This is well made and will last much longer than others, so I consider it an investment well made.</li>
            <li>The sides are not labeled as to which is gentle and which is coarse.  </li>
            <li>Pretty rough on both sides.  </li>
            <li>I only gave this item four stars because it is a little lighter in weight than my original.</li>
            <li>My old Revlon nail file, I finally realized, was worn out.  </li>
            <li>May be a little coarse for some but is right for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered two.  These have a rough (GROS) and fine (FEIN) sides.  All Pfeilring nail files that I have acquired in the past had both sides labeled and had the logo on both sides.  These did not.  Only the FEIN side is labeled.  One of the two that I received had the file installed backwards such that the rough side was actually on the side labeled as FEIN.  Furthermore, the tip of the &amp;#34;file sheet&amp;#34; that is smooth and does not have the embedded grains was noticeably different in area on the two samples.  I conclude that either (i) the good citizens who Solingen who supposedly manufacture these files have let Germanic manufacturing standards slip or (ii) these are not authentic Pfeilring products.</li>
            <li> My old Revlon nail file, I finally realized, was worn out.  This is a good replacement, which I hope will last a long time; if so I would give it 5 stars.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Have been through many glass nail files and decided to go back to a metal file.  This file works great and I love the length and that it is pointed to clean nails while filing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I prefer a metal file.  These are quite nice and really do the job correctly.  I like them very very much.</li>
            <li> One of the best files I have ever bought, really smooths out the top of your nails quickly and easily!</li>
            <li> One star if I ranked it on value for the money. No better than the ones I buy at the drugstore for far less money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read great things about Pfeilring files but this thing is a piece of junk. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a knock-off or something. Proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> An excellent nail file.  One side offers a very fine cut, while the other side offers rougher, faster cut.  Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this again.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy the Kcups from you again. Last order of 92 were all just thrown in all together in one box which couldn&#x27;t fit in anyone&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;kitchen cabinets.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many years it&#x27;s been since I could find a real nail file.  They&#x27;ve decided to produce these awful &amp;#34;emery board&amp;#34; nail files in recent years.  They WEAR OUT after one use!!  Good Grief!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail file is amazing.  It FILES!!!  It lasts, and it has two surfaces for filing either coarse or fine action.  I couldn&#x27;t believe when these files disappeared from the market - NOW I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;ve located them again at Amazon.com.  Bought 2 of them, and I&#x27;m considering purchasing another so that I have an extra for later (in case THESE, too disappear from the market!).</li>
            <li> Nice design, file is excellent. Con would be that it is a little flimsily for the price</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! This is well made and will last much longer than others, so I consider it an investment well made.</li>
            <li> We decided to purchase this nail file after shopping local drug and discount stores for a quality item.  These store sell files that are apparently produced by stamping flat steel and she finds their performance marginal at best.  This sapphire file, however, lives up to all of her performance expectations.  Additionally, it appears that it will last significantly longer than the commonly available items.  It&#x27;s a little bit of luxury that&#x27;s important to her.  Money well spent!</li>
            <li> There are times when you need a long metal file and this is it.  Try filling down a toenail when you cannot reach your feet because your legs will not bend that far, or have a need to use a longer file than the 2 inch files that are normal for most applications.  Well, this is it - nice and long and well made and has a coarse and fine side.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, well made, built to last.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Like most nail files, it has a fine and coarse option, but what sets it apart is that it is not too coarse or too fine, as is the case with other brands. The quality is outstanding, stays the same for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> a great file, works well</li>
            <li> Love these nail files!</li>
            <li> Been trying to find a file that doesn&#x27;t crap up your nails so decided to invest in this one from Germany and see how I will have this for decades. Leave the nail clipper behind!</li>
            <li> I have used this file now for about four months.  It works well and I like it.  Works better than anything in the store.  I had a Pfeilring File for over twenty years.  I only gave this item four stars because it is a little lighter in weight than my original.</li>
            <li> This is a very good nail for me.  May be a little coarse for some but is right for me.</li>
            <li> REALLY NICE FILE , CANNOT FIND DECENT NAIL FILES THESE DAYS&lt;br /&gt;ARRIVED IN TACK ,</li>
            <li> This nail file has been a disappointment.  The sides are not labeled as to which is gentle and which is coarse.  The coarse side used for filing lost its strength in a very short time.</li>
            <li> I own four of these nail files, and use them in preference to emery boards, which I despise, or cheap metal nail files which loose their tooth and quit working with monotonous regularity. These really last (my original one is about twenty years old, and while worn, still works well enough in a pinch, so that I bought more when I found them at Amazon) and both rough and smooth sides work well. One file has minor tooth irregularities on one edge, which is why I only gave four stars, but it still performs better than the cheap ones. I recommend this product, and would buy more if I need them.</li>
            <li> This is all that I hoped for in a nail file. Especially for me the larger size worked well as I need to file my toenails. Because of my eyesight problems it is difficult for me to see, and the longer size enables me to accomplish that feat (no pun intended).  I am also impressed by the quality of this file and would recommend it to anyone wanting a quality product. The smaller size would be good for nails and I am considering buying. I am retired and do have to watch the pennies. :-) Only time will tell about how well it holds up with use, but the quality is there and I will hope for the best. Depending on how often it is used it will pay for itself over using cheap throwaway emory boards.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a quality nail file forever. I used to have one that you could by at any drug store and lost it. Now all you can get are the paper kind that do not last or do the job well. This one is great. And I love the length as well as the handle with the convenient finger rest!</li>
            <li> I have had one just like it for 48 years and it is still the best nail file ever! I thought I&#x27;d buy another one to leave in my purse so much I like it. I highly recommend it and it lasts forever!:)</li>
            <li> works great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is smooth and easy to use. Works well on natural nails with no polish or &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; but probably would work great on those too. Pricey, so I hope it lasts longer than the crappy cheapies from the drug store. I got the long one for the bedside table for both of us to use, and a small one for my purse.</li>
            <li> Pretty rough on both sides.  One side may be just a bit smoother but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  Disappointed in how rough this is.</li>
