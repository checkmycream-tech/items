            <li> The plastic was a little softer than I wanted, but it would easily confirm to a tight space.  </li>
            <li> It has a small zipper pouch and a large one.</li>
            <li> Quality as expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  not overly jammed where I can&#x27;t zip</li>
            <li> Made well, not too big, not too small, zippers work well.</li>
            <li> The outside pocket is so convenient for separating my everyday make-up from the rest, so I don&#x27;t have to rummage through for mascara and eyebrow pencil!</li>
            <li> ...but not &amp;#34;Great.&amp;#34; The plastic is a little thinner than I&#x27;d hoped and the zippers seem a little minimal.</li>
            <li> I would buy a few for other family members if we travel together.</li>
            <li> Then, if I want to change purses, I can change purses within minutes or seconds instead of taking a half an hour!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth repacking to return.  :-(</li>
            <li> Too small for my purpose (my fault for not measuring and checking.)  </li>
            <li> It is versatile because it can also be used in your bathroom to store small items, and it could be used for travel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the zippers will hold up, but none have broken on me yet!</li>
            <li> Poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li> I bought this bag months ago, so unfortunately, it cannot be returned or exchanged.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I should have listened.  </li>
            <li> These are totally useless.</li>
            <li> Very thin material.</li>

            <li> I love the clear cosmetic bags. you can&#x27;t go wrong,, good quality, zipper doesnt stick and the ability to see everything in the bag is great. I use one for makeup, one for qtips, one for manicure supplies..etc..&lt;br /&gt;great for travel too!</li>
            <li> As a teacher I use the bags for children&#x27;s school supplies. The bags are a great size for limited storage space, durable, and last the school year. The order arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> The totes are perfect size to organize my daughters hair bows.</li>
            <li> Too small for my purpose (my fault for not measuring and checking.)  Strong smell when I opened the bag dissipated quickly.  Quality as expected.  I may find another application for it later, or give to my god-daughter for play.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these organizers! I saw how Peter Welch suggested using these on the Rachael Ray TV Show. I purchased several of these and love them! I can see what&#x27;s inside quickly. I have one that I use for receipts and coupons. Then, instead of cleaning out my whole purse all the time, I only have to clean out one pouch! Then, if I want to change purses, I can change purses within minutes or seconds instead of taking a half an hour! I also love the fact that I can put my cosmetics in one and if the powder spills, it won&#x27;t go all over the rest of the items in my purse or ruin the lining! Highly value this product! I don&#x27;t know how long the zippers will hold up, but none have broken on me yet!</li>

            <li> I bought this bag months ago, so unfortunately, it cannot be returned or exchanged.  However, I used it for the first time this weekend, and it came apart immediately.  Poorly constructed.  Stitching was faulty. Would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> The plastic was a little softer than I wanted, but it would easily confirm to a tight space.  The first time I used the front pocket the zipper feel off.  It&#x27;s ends hadn&#x27;t been stitched into the seam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth repacking to return.  :-(</li>
            <li> Very thin material. Plastic won&#x27;t hold itself up. I&#x27;m only keeping it because it&#x27;s too cheap for so much trouble to send it back.</li>
            <li> ...but not &amp;#34;Great.&amp;#34; The plastic is a little thinner than I&#x27;d hoped and the zippers seem a little minimal. Probably will NOT buy this again.</li>
            <li> Nice size, good quality.  Very roomy.  Perfect for my manicure supplies.  Love that it is clear so I can see the contents at a glance.</li>
            <li> Top zipper broke the first time I used it. I did not over stuff it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s usable , but wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it .</li>
            <li> Love technology bag. Using for my scrapbooking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple. It&#x27;s clear. It has a small zipper pouch and a large one. It&#x27;s perfect for finding your tiny makeup items that fall to the bottom of the bag. It&#x27;s also great for your liquids when going through a TSA screening. I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of makeup bags and this one is my favorite by far. I will order backups so I&#x27;ll never have to be without it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for traveling.....perfect sizes for toiletries.</li>
            <li> I bought these bags to use as &amp;#34;kits&amp;#34; to give to my mom and mother-in-law with baby supplies in them.  The zippers fell off shortly after use.  Many reviews I read complained about this, but I chose them anyways because of the size and price.  Needless to say, I should have listened.  These are totally useless.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Made well, not too big, not too small, zippers work well. The outside pocket is so convenient for separating my everyday make-up from the rest, so I don&#x27;t have to rummage through for mascara and eyebrow pencil!</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag is a great organizer for purses or totes that do not have compartments.  The side zipper comes in handy for small cosmetics like lipsticks, cosmetic pencils and so on.  The larger portion of the bag is very roomy and can hold a lot more stuff.  It is versatile because it can also be used in your bathroom to store small items, and it could be used for travel.</li>
