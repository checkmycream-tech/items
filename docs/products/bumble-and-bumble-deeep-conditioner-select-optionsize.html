            <li>I still get great results.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for anyone with frizzy or even just damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great and does the job:</li>

            <li>my hair feels &amp; looks great</li>
            <li>deeep :) &lt;3</li>
            <li>I get in the shower, wash my hair, use a good handful of this conditioner, brush it through my hair, then put my hair up and take a bath.  </li>
            <li>I had always heard bumble and bumble was good, but i had no idea</li>
            <li>just how good it was until i decided to buy it on a whim.</li>
            <li>People say it looks so healthy!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My hair is full of life again and so shiny!!</li>
            <li>It smells great and feels like a real spa treatment to \\&quot;deeeply\\</li>
            <li>I GLAD</li>
            <li>This is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>He keeps stealing mine, and I keep having to buy more for me.   </li>
            <li>I LOVE this</li>
            <li>brittle hair feels softer, more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Creme de Coco is better, but</li>
            <li>this product makes my hair stay strong and silk-like.</li>
            <li>My hair is longer, fine, and was over processed.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t distribute, it did nothing for my fine textured hair like it used to.  </li>
            <li>their products are so fabulous even my husband won&#x27;t buy anything else.  </li>
            <li>Have since discovered all B&amp;B products are available in my grocery store and I will never purchase again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m halfway through my first tube, and love it.  </li>
            <li>This was a great step up from my Nexxus and other \\&quot;Salon\\&quot; brands - they just didn&#x27;t give me that \\&quot;from the salon\\&quot; look</li>
            <li>I like the scent and the effect that this quick rinse has.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The best for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not use this product more frequently than every 7 days.  </li>
            <li>and if you are running out to quickly it is because your using way to much,</li>
            <li>&quot; condition my hair while I take a hot bath.  </li>
            <li>First bought this product at hair dressers.</li>
            <li>Not the real thing!  </li>
            <li>It makes his hair silky and flat so he can style it better</li>
            <li>Its ok as far as conditioner goes, but is FAR from the \\&quot;Deeeep</li>
            <li>This has enabled me to keep the length and have it look healthy, not broken and dry.  </li>
            <li>Yet, It is so much softer, healthier-looking, and manageable that I believe this is still a 5-star product.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need that much</li>
            <li>I really like the Bumble &amp; bumble line.</li>
            <li>a woman spends $26.00 on a product, she really loves it.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a tiny bit on the ends and kind of spread it around.</li>
            <li>I love this, it makes my dried out, damaged hair feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I expected something special for the price $$$$, but got nothing better than a store brand generic condtioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEDED.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off using plain conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing , it makes your hair looks so much healthier , i have really damaged coarse broken hair and this made it so pretty and shinny</li>
            <li>I think that the one which was sent to me was very old.</li>
            <li>I use this product once a week but for less than recommended the 20 minutes (I actually found that I get better results if I leave it on for 5/10 minutes instead).</li>
            <li>Nothing special, certainly not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Too much protein in the hair can actually cause the hair to break instead of restoring strength to the hair.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t expect that would send one that was so old.</li>
            <li>, I have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>I use it religiously, along with other B&amp;B products and it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My hair felt the complete opposite that it should feel after using a deep conditioner.  </li>

            <li> My long, damaged hair is like SILK.  </li>
            <li> I expected this to be a deep conditioner, as described.  </li>
            <li> These other people should try leaving it on the entire 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> dry hair was fried by an overprocessed color job.  </li>
            <li> so I tried their website directly and got it for at least $10.00 cheaper.</li>
            <li> (it works for me because in the military you have to keep your hair up).  </li>
            <li> It is really expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair due to coloring.</li>
            <li> This treatment helps weigh it down a little without making it flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> so due to the lack of services.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair softer than any other product.</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached white and past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> My hair tangles very easily, especially when wet, and it&#x27;s hard to brush this through my hair sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I always come back and ask my stylists (3 different onces so far) if my ends are bad and they always respond with, \\&quot;not at all.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and it lays down on his head now.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mess with it.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend is Hispanic and has short poofy, thick, frizzy hair and after he used it once, he is addicted.  </li>
            <li> Ouch, it&#x27;s expensive, but if you use the recommended amount, once a week, it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> , this is a must have , though it seems like alot of money for a small tube</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really thick and bushy.  </li>
            <li> Because bleaching is so horrible for hair, I did not expect this product to cure all breakage, but it significantly reduced it and has helped make my hair stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last month and was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 starts as it is expensive for 150 ml.</li>
            <li> But thought it was too expensive</li>
            <li> I am actually shocked at how crappy this product is.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> This was just crap!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> their products are so fabulous even my husband won&#x27;t buy anything else.  It&#x27;s great that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m halfway through my first tube, and love it.  I&#x27;m a long time hair-abuser, so I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.  I use this for a shorter interval than the 20 minutes they recommend (who has time during the week for a 20 minute treatment?). I still get great results.  My hair is longer, fine, and was over processed.  This has enabled me to keep the length and have it look healthy, not broken and dry.  This was a great step up from my Nexxus and other \\&quot;Salon\\&quot; brands - they just didn&#x27;t give me that \\&quot;from the salon\\&quot; look I wanted.  Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for over ten years and my stylist recommends I use B&amp;B products for at least the first couple of weeks after she colors my hair.  I have fine hair but *lots* of it so it&#x27;s really thick and bushy.  This treatment helps weigh it down a little without making it flat and lifeless.  I get in the shower, wash my hair, use a good handful of this conditioner, brush it through my hair, then put my hair up and take a bath.  It smells great and feels like a real spa treatment to \\&quot;deeeply\\&quot; condition my hair while I take a hot bath.  The only thing I would improve about it is it&#x27;s de-tangling ability.  My hair tangles very easily, especially when wet, and it&#x27;s hard to brush this through my hair sometimes.  Yet, It is so much softer, healthier-looking, and manageable that I believe this is still a 5-star product.  A word on price: Ouch, it&#x27;s expensive, but if you use the recommended amount, once a week, it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Well, gee, I wish I would have gotten it.   But I still have not, nor have I received a response from the company I purchased it from.</li>
            <li> The best for thin hair.  I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I have the curliest hair imaginable. I straighten it every week with a flat iron and this product makes my hair stay strong and silk-like. People say it looks so healthy! and that is a major compliment for someone who is always yelled at at the salon for having such dry ends due to my heat addiction. I had always heard bumble and bumble was good, but i had no idea just how good it was until i decided to buy it on a whim. BOY AM I GLAD I DID! this is the best conditioner i have ever used and I will continue to use it foreeeeever! My hair is full of life again and so shiny!! thanks deeep :) &lt;3</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  I deploy with the travel size and do not get my hair cut for 4 months or so due to the lack of services.  I use this product once a week applying just to my ends and letting it sit in my hair until the next day I wash it (it works for me because in the military you have to keep your hair up).  I always come back and ask my stylists (3 different onces so far) if my ends are bad and they always respond with, \\&quot;not at all.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  (and that&#x27;s a lot).  These other people should try leaving it on the entire 20 minutes.  My long, damaged hair is like SILK.  My boyfriend is Hispanic and has short poofy, thick, frizzy hair and after he used it once, he is addicted.  It makes his hair silky and flat so he can style it better and it lays down on his head now.  He keeps stealing mine, and I keep having to buy more for me.   This product is great for anyone with frizzy or even just damaged hair. HIGHLY RECOMMEDED.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff left my hair so tangled that I couldn&#x27;t comb through it!  My hair felt the complete opposite that it should feel after using a deep conditioner.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I use this product once a week but for less than recommended the 20 minutes (I actually found that I get better results if I leave it on for 5/10 minutes instead). Smells great and does the job: hair is shiny, soft and moisturised without being weighted down. I give it 4 starts as it is expensive for 150 ml.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! You only need to use a tiny bit on the ends and kind of spread it around. It makes my hair softer than any other product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dry hair was fried by an overprocessed color job.  This was just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brittle hair feels softer, more manageable.  I like the scent and the effect that this quick rinse has.  Treatment is almost instant in the shower...  I would recommend this to anyone with frizzy overprocessed colored hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is bleached white and past my shoulders.  I use a combination of argan oil (leave in hair for 2-3 days), Bumble and Bumble Mending Shampoo and conditioner, and this product to keep breakage to a minimum.  Because bleaching is so horrible for hair, I did not expect this product to cure all breakage, but it significantly reduced it and has helped make my hair stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this product more frequently than every 7 days.  Too much protein in the hair can actually cause the hair to break instead of restoring strength to the hair.</li>
            <li> I am actually shocked at how crappy this product is.  Left my hair dryer than before I used it.  Nothing special, certainly not worth the price.  Creme de Coco is better, but sheesh!  This was just crap!</li>
            <li> I love this, it makes my dried out, damaged hair feel smooth and soft. It is really expensive, but worth it. I have bleached hair, so I try and use this twice a week for 20 minutes. I&#x27;ve even found that it helps to add volume to my hair, I have very fine and thin hair so this is great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing , it makes your hair looks so much healthier , i have really damaged coarse broken hair and this made it so pretty and shinny , this is a must have , though it seems like alot of money for a small tube you don&#x27;t need that much and if you are running out to quickly it is because your using way to much,</li>
            <li> First bought this product at hair dressers. But thought it was too expensive so I tried their website directly and got it for at least $10.00 cheaper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last month and was extremely disappointed. I expected something special for the price $$$$, but got nothing better than a store brand generic condtioner. Its ok as far as conditioner goes, but is FAR from the \\&quot;Deeeep Conditioning\\&quot; it describes. Have since discovered all B&amp;B products are available in my grocery store and I will never purchase again.  Debbie Dominy  Dublin, GA</li>
            <li> I really like the Bumble &amp; bumble line. I have very dry hair due to coloring. I put this on in the shower &amp; let it for 20 minutes &amp; bam my hair feels &amp; looks great</li>
            <li> I was the foremost advocate for this product for the last 10 years and my last tube went into my hair like dirt.  It didn&#x27;t distribute, it did nothing for my fine textured hair like it used to.  I took it back thinking it was defective and they have me another tube to try.  Same thing.  I took that back and then they told me they changed their formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a woman spends $26.00 on a product, she really loves it.  Don&#x27;t mess with it.  I tried to contact the company to get an explanation and couldn&#x27;t find a way to contact them.  Done with you Bumbling Idiots!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it religiously, along with other B&amp;B products and it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> FRAUD!!  Not the real thing!  Extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it worked always well for my hair but not this time. I think that the one which was sent to me was very old. I know it was discontinued but I wouldn&#x27;t expect that would send one that was so old.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a deep conditioner, as described.  Instead it leaves my hair dry and coarse feeling.  I&#x27;m better off using plain conditioner.</li>
