            <li>This really helps to keep the facial skin smooth.</li>

            <li>and it seemed to clear up some of the acne</li>
            <li>at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face</li>

            <li> I am a 30 year old female with combination skin.  </li>
            <li> However, do NOT get any into your eyes because it burns like crazy and is hard to get it completely out; just use lots of cool water and a clean rag.  </li>
            <li> It is not a magical solution to acne, but it seems to keep it at bay as long as I am not under stress and use it regularly (which I almost never do).</li>
            <li> but it never really did the job I expected it to!</li>
            <li> I will not be rebuying this product and would not really recommend it for acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> I had tried other products like proactive and skin ID</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and my skin is constantly changing due to hormones!</li>
            <li> After I used half of the container</li>
            <li> i had slight acne before i started with murad.</li>
            <li> not fun!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that you should use it everyday.</li>
            <li> At this point I would consider my acne severe, Its worse than its ever been in my entire life.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what happened</li>
            <li> It seemed to make my skin go crazy, in the past it worked, this time is made my skin red and bumpy.</li>
            <li> and I was using it everyday on my face once I get out shower and within 4 days my face got worse.</li>
            <li> But instead of just going away it got worse and worse, I even started to notice that i had blackheads.</li>
            <li> I used them for approximately 3 months, I used everything from the Clarifying Mask, Blackhead remover, Clarifying Lotion, Eye cream, Cleansers and vitamins.  </li>
            <li> I kept using Murad and my skin was getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I will only use it if and when I am beginning to breakout horribly at once.</li>
            <li> then i am use to seeing and as it heals it is itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> The reason why I give this 2 stars is because this is not for people who have really bad acne.</li>
            <li> Even if you do have bad acne</li>
            <li> About a month ago I broke out really bad.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i used to love this face wash and i started using it again. Its not working like it used to, but my skin has probably changed. It really is worth trying. It makes you skin feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried many SO CALL great cleansers to keep moderate breakouts away, this has definitely given me lasting results, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooo many things in the past for my acne prone..oily skin and was to my wits end. This is an awesome product. Within a week my skin had cleared up visibly and remains clear to this day. I won&#x27;t use anything else. Murad leaves my skin feeling clean and I use it along side the moisturizer....gosh this sounds like a infomercial for Murad! I do try and recommend this product to as many people with the same issues as I have. I WAS in my 30\\&quot;s and still having problems with acne....not fun! Well...NOT anymore! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have used just about everything on the market for acne prone skin I am in my late 20&#x27;s and my skin is constantly changing due to hormones! At first this product worked really well I used it twice a day and it seemed to clear up some of the acne but it never really did the job I expected it to! After I used half of the container my  face started to break out even more! I will not be rebuying this product and would not really recommend it for acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> I got this for a good cost and came in good time frame. The reason why I give this 2 stars is because this is not for people who have really bad acne. Even if you do have bad acne I don&#x27;t think that you should use it everyday. This stuff is really strong for any skin type. Any body who use Murad clarifying cleanser should only use it once or twice a week NOT everyday to avoid more breakout. I start exercise 5 days a week and I was using it everyday on my face once I get out shower and within 4 days my face got worse. I stop using it and start back using Neutrogena. Now my face is getting back to its norm. I will only use it if and when I am beginning to breakout horribly at once.</li>
            <li> I struggled with acne since puberty now turning 26 I have discovered Murad. I have tried EVERYTHING but this is the only one that works. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This cleanser is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a subtle, pleasant scent and you can feel it work on your skin right as you rub it in. It has a cooling sensation, and works well on my oily/combination skin. It is not a magical solution to acne, but it seems to keep it at bay as long as I am not under stress and use it regularly (which I almost never do). The price is fantastic, because this product takes FOREVER to finish. I&#x27;m barely more than halfway finished, and I bought it months ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now, and I love it. I will definitely keep using this</li>
            <li> i had slight acne before i started with murad. I had tried other products like proactive and skin ID but they never fully got rid of my pimples. So then I tried murad ibought the whole line of product for my face. at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face i had never had anything like that in my whole life. But instead of just going away it got worse and worse, I even started to notice that i had blackheads.I had not seen blackheads on my face since i was a teen. Even though i have stopped using murad for about two weeks it&#x27;s damage is still being done. my face has those big red pimples all over it and some are still coming up because of the blackheads. The healing process is taking longer then i am use to seeing and as it heals it is itching like crazy. All i have to say is buyer beware.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It&#x27;s the only cleanser that stops my break out and it&#x27;s gentle.  Would definitely recommend this cleanser to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend to anyone to try any Murad products. I used them for approximately 3 months, I used everything from the Clarifying Mask, Blackhead remover, Clarifying Lotion, Eye cream, Cleansers and vitamins.  I have moderate acne, at first it worked really well and cleared up my blemishes,. About a month ago I broke out really bad. I kept using Murad and my skin was getting worse and worse. At this point I would consider my acne severe, Its worse than its ever been in my entire life. I am not sure what happened but obviously it stopped working right after 3 months. Don&#x27;t but this, you will regret it.</li>
            <li> Where has this stuff been all my life?! Absolutely love this stuff! Will be buying for years to come!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Brand new in the box.</li>
            <li> I received the product pretty quickly and cheaper than other vendors.  They even stuck a free  mirror in the box.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything free. I thought that was obsolete.  :-)</li>
            <li> It seemed to make my skin go crazy, in the past it worked, this time is made my skin red and bumpy.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing gel!!  I am a 30 year old female with combination skin.  For some reason, my skin started breaking out more often and for no obvious reason.  This product is what got my skin back to being clear.  I use it twice a day.  I also like the toner &amp; the acne gel, but I do not believe those are necessary with this cleanser.  I use a neutrogena moisterizer; I did find that the Murad lotion was not quite moisturizing enough for my skin after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This was chosen in place of a cleanser that I used to use  and it is a great replacement.  However, do NOT get any into your eyes because it burns like crazy and is hard to get it completely out; just use lots of cool water and a clean rag.  This really helps to keep the facial skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this with my clairasonic and my face has only had one baby zit for a &amp;#34;breakout&amp;#34; Very happy with this porduct!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works well with clearing up your skin. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It gets my skin clean without over drying it. Plus the ingredients helps to keep my skin from breaking out.</li>
            <li> I tried this many years ago, and I have to say that it is definitely one of the best, if not THE best cleanser I have ever used. LOVE!!!</li>
