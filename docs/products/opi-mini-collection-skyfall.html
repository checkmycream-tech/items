            <li>I bought these for my sister for Christmas &amp; she loved them!</li>
            <li>But it looks good!</li>
            <li>I have tried all four colors, and they are splendid.</li>
            <li>the colors are great.</li>
            <li>Bought these for a friend and she loved them, so 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I loved this collection of colors.</li>
            <li>It would be great if Opi had more choices in their miniatures.</li>
            <li>Just did by toes in the Spy that Loved Me :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I liked all colors in this set.</li>
            <li>She really liked them.</li>
            <li>This is a great collection i just wish i could of got the full size ones</li>
            <li>a good sample for later buying the one you liked best...</li>
            <li>The colors are nice &amp; rich!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my nails when I&#x27;m wearing the shiny gold.</li>
            <li>so i would have more</li>
            <li>My favorite is the metallic-y gray.</li>
            <li>She love all of the colors and the quality of the polish.</li>
            <li>Love the chance to try on all these colors without buying the full bottle.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish on the inside was fine, but because this is a gift, I am unsaticfied.</li>
            <li>I would prefer to buy a regular size bottle of nail polish but this made a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>No one around here carries it.&amp;#34; The colors are rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great way to try colors since i rarely use a whole normal sized</li>
            <li>OPI is a quality product, so I&#x27;m glad these went on sale since they generally cost more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine getting much use out of the bottles unless you don&#x27;t apply many coats.</li>
            <li>It seems that so often I will buy a full botlle of a seasonal shade and just cant use it up before the season is over.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, I love goldeneye, the spy who loved me, and live and let die.</li>
            <li>But they were super mini in size....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rare to have a mini collection where I want all the colors.</li>
            <li>I wish they sold large bottles of the gold color!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It was great that they were sample size because I got to try a few out before buying a larger version.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li>But I thought that The world is not enough and live and let die would be more solid.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying these little bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li>This kit offers a nice assortment of colors but the bottles are sooo little!</li>
            <li>All of the colors have sparkle but the golden eye is transparent with only sparkles.</li>
            <li>As with many Opi colors, these have subtly that makes them more exciting that ordinary colors.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love glittery stuff!</li>
            <li>I prefer this, as I have limited space and only use so much nail polish at a time.</li>
            <li>red and dark green are more opaque.</li>

            <li> red and dark green are more opaque.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a Christmas present for a friend of mine, but I was unhappy when I found the top of the box was crushed during shipping.</li>
            <li> than i expected, about 1/4 a regular bottle.</li>
            <li> Do keep in mind that it&#x27;s a mini collection, so the bottles are much smaller than the average bottle.</li>
            <li> The set is really tiny and comes with little bottles of polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last since I&#x27;ve just used them once</li>
            <li> The green is dark so it can look black from far away</li>
            <li> The other 3 are a sparkly red, a glittery dark green and a glittery gold</li>
            <li> brush part is a little small to hold but not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is it black?</li>
            <li> These are little bottles, 1/8 oz each.</li>
            <li> silver is nicer than i thought, it&#x27;s greyish silver, not too dark and not too silver bling!</li>
            <li> Is it green?</li>
            <li> The other colors aren&#x27;t bad, either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed how small the bottles are.</li>

            <li> I bought this for a friend as these shades of nail polish are her style. The set is really tiny and comes with little bottles of polish. I can&#x27;t imagine getting much use out of the bottles unless you don&#x27;t apply many coats. I would prefer to buy a regular size bottle of nail polish but this made a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold large bottles of the gold color! I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my nails when I&#x27;m wearing the shiny gold. The other colors aren&#x27;t bad, either.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Item arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from seller. These are little bottles, 1/8 oz each. OPI is a quality product, so I&#x27;m glad these went on sale since they generally cost more.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a friend and she loved them, so 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This kit offers a nice assortment of colors but the bottles are sooo little! I&#x27;ve used 2 of the colors and they stayed on for a week!</li>
            <li> This is a great collection i just wish i could of got the full size ones so i would have more</li>
            <li> Love the chance to try on all these colors without buying the full bottle.  It seems that so often I will buy a full botlle of a seasonal shade and just cant use it up before the season is over.  Just did by toes in the Spy that Loved Me :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my youngest sister for Christmas. We received it with enough time to wrap it and put it under the tree. Christmas Day she unwrapped it and exclaimed with delight...&amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been looking for this! No one around here carries it.&amp;#34; The colors are rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li> the colors are great. But they were super mini in size.... a good sample for later buying the one you liked best...</li>

            <li> These skyfall nail polishes are smaller than i expected, about 1/4 a regular bottle. I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last since I&#x27;ve just used them once but it&#x27;s a great way to try colors since i rarely use a whole normal sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush part is a little small to hold but not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red and dark green are more opaque. All of the colors have sparkle but the golden eye is transparent with only sparkles. It probably needs four coats to be opaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silver is nicer than i thought, it&#x27;s greyish silver, not too dark and not too silver bling! Either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good collection. The green is dark so it can look black from far away but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered for my girlfriend, overall from what I can tell women like OPI and she should like it. I&#x27;m just disappointed how small the bottles are.</li>
            <li> I liked all colors in this set. My favorite is the metallic-y gray. The other 3 are a sparkly red, a glittery dark green and a glittery gold</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying these little bottles of nail polish. As with many Opi colors, these have subtly that makes them more exciting that ordinary colors. My only regret is that this collection, though called &amp;#34;Skyfall,&amp;#34;does not contain the eponymous color, &amp;#34;Skyfall.&amp;#34;I had to purchase that one separately in the regular size.  It would be great if Opi had more choices in their miniatures.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister for Christmas &amp; she loved them! The colors are nice &amp; rich! She really liked them.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She love all of the colors and the quality of the polish. She also couldn&#x27;t get enough of the Skyfall packaging.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love glittery stuff! But I thought that The world is not enough and live and let die would be more solid. Overall though, I love goldeneye, the spy who loved me, and live and let die. The last color is perplexing to me. Is it black? Is it green? I have no idea. But it looks good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so rare to have a mini collection where I want all the colors. I have tried all four colors, and they are splendid. Do keep in mind that it&#x27;s a mini collection, so the bottles are much smaller than the average bottle. I prefer this, as I have limited space and only use so much nail polish at a time.</li>
            <li> I loved this collection of colors. It was great that they were sample size because I got to try a few out before buying a larger version. Thanks!</li>
