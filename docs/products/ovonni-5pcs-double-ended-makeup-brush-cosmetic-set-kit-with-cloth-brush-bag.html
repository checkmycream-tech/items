            <li>greate price, awesome product</li>
            <li>Aside from that, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Very nice brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re absolutely perfect for the shade light contour palette by Kat Von D!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good brush set for a beginner, but I would recommend buying it with 2 or 3 blending brushes to replace the scratchy ones it comes with.</li>
            <li>I received my brushes on time and packaging was good.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good now.  </li>
            <li>Good variety of dual ended brushes for the price.  </li>
            <li>Its like they take off more makeup than they put on!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>3 out of 4 of the blending brushes were scratchy so if like me you liked the set because of the blending brushes it comes with</li>
            <li>I wanted a set of brushes but did not want to spend a whole lot of money, these work perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Nice brushes.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it!!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are a good travel set to carry in your purse or bag for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>but they are just ok.</li>
            <li>Love the brushes, but not the case.</li>
            <li>There is one angled brush that I do love to use to apply shadow to the outer V</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and cute.</li>
            <li>I ordered two sets and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Had a chemical smell but are soft and work great for applying eye liner</li>
            <li>I was really hoping these would be good</li>
            <li>Very nice looking set good-quality just too soft.</li>
            <li>The zippered pocket had a strong smell</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting the best quality, but they feel super stiff and synthetic sometimes.</li>
            <li>nice quality, soft bristles and overall size, perfect to have it inside your purse or travel with them.</li>
            <li>but for everything else, they seem fine.</li>
            <li>Great brushed soft and feel study, they are definitely of good quality and can do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and the case is nice.</li>
            <li>but they aren&#x27;t even good enough for that.  </li>
            <li>At first I was excited to get these as they look SUPER PRETTY in the photo!</li>
            <li>Love my brush set especially for such a good price</li>
            <li>Arrived as expected and good quality set of brushes.</li>
            <li>One of them looks exactly like the sigma e25</li>
            <li>I love the color and the double ended concept.</li>
            <li>In addition to that, the white paint on the wood by the metal chipped so it&#x27;s not as elegant looking as it appears on the photo.</li>
            <li>The brushes are good, but if you are used to sigma or mac brushes you will not really enjoy the set.</li>
            <li>These would only be good for a pre teen to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; at putting make up on.</li>
            <li>They do shed a bit, and they should definitely be washed before use, but they are good brushes overall.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li>Very practical and usable.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend them for any type of powder product because they don&#x27;t seem to pick up powders very well,</li>
            <li>Soft to the touch on your face, yet strong enough to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>Two of the brushes were exactly the same</li>
            <li>Soft brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are synthetic and soft but I think that it doesn&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow too well.  </li>
            <li>2 of the brushes, which are also the scratchy ones, shedded too much the first time I played with them (the white blending brush and the mini white brush next to it in the photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes an extra few strokes to try to pick up eyeshadow with this brush and once you get product on the brush and apply to your eyes, it goes on quite light.  </li>
            <li>Love the brushes and that they are travel size but hate the free brush bag they came in!</li>
            <li>A little disappointed as these are pretty nice brushes!</li>
            <li>No funny (new) smell either.</li>

            <li> I like the 29 pc brush set. It&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s not great. It does come with a paint scent, both the case and the brushes but it goes away after a while so it didn&#x27;t bother me that much. The brushes are good, but if you are used to sigma or mac brushes you will not really enjoy the set. The packaging was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 of the brushes were scratchy (i&#x27;ll insert a photo of these 5 brushes). 3 out of 4 of the blending brushes were scratchy so if like me you liked the set because of the blending brushes it comes with i&#x27;ll skip this set and just buy some sigma, bdellium, eco tools, elf or it cosmetics blending brushes. Thank God I bought this set along with sigma blending brushes. One of them looks exactly like the sigma e25 but it is way too scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also 2 of the brushes, which are also the scratchy ones, shedded too much the first time I played with them (the white blending brush and the mini white brush next to it in the photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good brush set for a beginner, but I would recommend buying it with 2 or 3 blending brushes to replace the scratchy ones it comes with. I like the case and the other brushes so I don&#x27;t regret my purchase but it isn&#x27;t to die for either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. i&#x27;m not a verified reviewer since I don&#x27;t have a credit card so someone else bought it for me on Amazon.</li>
            <li> greate price, awesome product</li>
            <li> nice quality, soft bristles and overall size, perfect to have it inside your purse or travel with them. Very practical and usable.</li>
            <li> Had a chemical smell but are soft and work great for applying eye liner</li>
            <li> Everything arrived on time. The brushes are soft and the case is nice.</li>
            <li> I have used these ONce and one of the brushes is coming apart already. I was really hoping these would be good but they are just ok. I love the color and the double ended concept.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes, but not the case. Since the brushes are dual-ended, it&#x27;s kinda difficult to get them into the elastic loops without ruffing them up. I tossed the case. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble from the brushes. One thing is that the biggest ones aren&#x27;t very big,</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I bought these to keep in my travel bag but they aren&#x27;t even good enough for that.  These would only be good for a pre teen to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; at putting make up on.</li>
            <li> Love my brush set especially for such a good price</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes were exactly the same instead of there being 5 all different ones. A little disappointed as these are pretty nice brushes!</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting the best quality, but they feel super stiff and synthetic sometimes. Depends on the brush though. Not bad, but not excellent.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes and that they are travel size but hate the free brush bag they came in!</li>
            <li> Soft brushes. Haven&#x27;t used it but the only problem was its case. The slings don&#x27;t hold on to the brushes. Aside from that, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great brushed soft and feel study, they are definitely of good quality and can do the trick for me. I wanted a set of brushes but did not want to spend a whole lot of money, these work perfect for me.  No funny (new) smell either. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes on time and packaging was good.  The zippered pocket had a strong smell but I let it air out for a few days and it&#x27;s good now.  Good variety of dual ended brushes for the price.  The bristles are synthetic and soft but I think that it doesn&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow too well.  It takes an extra few strokes to try to pick up eyeshadow with this brush and once you get product on the brush and apply to your eyes, it goes on quite light.  There is one angled brush that I do love to use to apply shadow to the outer V but as for the shader brushes, it just doesn&#x27;t apply color too well to the lid.</li>
            <li> They look pretty, but these brushes are terrible. Its like they take off more makeup than they put on!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it!!! I love them! They&#x27;re absolutely perfect for the shade light contour palette by Kat Von D!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and good quality set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and cute.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft. Very nice looking set good-quality just too soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a good travel set to carry in your purse or bag for a quick touch up. They do shed a bit, and they should definitely be washed before use, but they are good brushes overall. I would not recommend them for any type of powder product because they don&#x27;t seem to pick up powders very well, but for everything else, they seem fine.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. I ordered two sets and I am glad I did. I washed them and they did well. I have not used them yet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t grab eyevshawdow.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes.  Soft to the touch on your face, yet strong enough to apply makeup.  For the price I have no complaints.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these brushes, but I was disappointed. They were terrible quality and cheap.</li>
            <li> At first I was excited to get these as they look SUPER PRETTY in the photo! Within a couple of days of using it, the metallic part attached to the wood was loose. Mind you, I was applying make up, not doing anything fancy or forceful with it to strain it. In addition to that, the white paint on the wood by the metal chipped so it&#x27;s not as elegant looking as it appears on the photo.</li>
