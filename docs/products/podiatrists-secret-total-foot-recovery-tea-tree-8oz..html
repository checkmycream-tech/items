            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as Gehwol, but it&#x27;s also cheaper.</li>
            <li>My feet have never looked better or felt smoother!</li>
            <li>Kind of creasy</li>
            <li>This foot cream is the absolute best on market.</li>

            <li>Best product of this kind hands down.  </li>

            <li>This is definitely the best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever tried and it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(Update - my old favorite at the link is back to its original formula - best stuff ever!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth considering is the likewise odorless O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme which I have recently tried and found to be very effective.</li>
            <li>Your feet feel better right away</li>
            <li>Feels rich and cooling when applying, not greasy.</li>
            <li>I am by no means saying that you will feel so invigorated after having used this medicinal product for an appropriate period of time that you will be ready to dance up a storm, but I am quite certain that you will feel better for having done so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She later told my mother how good it works</li>
            <li>/&gt;This foot cream, which has a uniquely pleasant medicinal smell and is supposedly quite effective if infections/circulation problems might be playing a role in the less than optimal health of one or both feet, really does work</li>
            <li>If your feet are dry and cracked and the skin on your feet - in  general - has seen better days, this easily applied remedy which passes directly into the skin will put you on the right path to once again having happy feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the odor of the cream</li>
            <li>Good price and works as advertised which in my case, is much better than the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li>: If you purchase this item directly through the FootSmart Web Site like I do, you can avail yourself of a buy 2 get 1 free offer that is regularly available for the 4 oz and 8 oz sizes of both versions of this cream - see there.</li>
            <li>He got the fastest results when he put it on right after his shower every day.</li>
            <li>This is an effective product for turning crusty feet into feet you want be relutant to let your significant other see.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and have never found anything else that really keeps your feet this soft or alleviates cracked heels as well.</li>
            <li>and I am lovin my new feet!!!</li>
            <li>It is sure does cool dry hot feet.</li>
            <li>I felt the difference after the first time.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many different kinds.  </li>
            <li>and this keeps them looking and feeling so much softer .Nice</li>
            <li>Very soothing.  </li>
            <li>You do not need to use a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Smells good, not greasy, and absolutely does away with thick callouses and cracks on my feet.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other creams and lotions none comes close to this product.</li>
            <li>Smells like old furniture polish at first bit</li>
            <li>It keeps my feet pretty soft but doesn&#x27;t seem to do any healing on cracked/drying skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps soften skin, smooth rough patches, and refreshes with Tea Tree.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t happen overnight but with consistent application every day there was a huge improvement in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years, and it really does the trick of keeping my feet soft.</li>
            <li>It has some methyol in it which normally I don&#x27;t mind smelling</li>
            <li>I use this everyday before I put on socks for sure .</li>
            <li>: The soles of my feet are much improved with smoother and softer skin as as well as an overall healthier, fresher appearance since I purchased my first tube of this item quite some time</li>
            <li>Some foot cremes are very liquid, but this has a consistency similar to vaseline.</li>
            <li>Completely stopped cracked heals without all the scrubbing and scaping.  </li>
            <li>It keeps your feet soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many other creams for my feet, and there is nothing out there that compares to Podiatrist&#x27;s Secret Total Foot Recovery cream!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another salve/cream that I would also recommend for this type of extremely dry foot problem is the original odorless version of Podiatrist&#x27;s Secret Total Foot Recovery Cream without the Tea Tree Oil (also available in 4 oz and 8 oz tubes from FootSmart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>bought three different products to try to replace my old faithful</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous products to heal my severely cracked heels and have had little success.</li>
            <li>I use it because I have such dry feel as I get older</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use it because I have such dry feel as I get older</li>
            <li> fragrance, thick and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I really like it.  </li>
            <li> the modest price being asked, you really have nothing to lose and everything to gain by giving Podiatrist&#x27;s Secret Total Foot Recovery Cream with Tea Tree Oil the one-tube test and then taking it from there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li> Has softened not only my feet but my elbows and dry legs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I have found that keeps my feet from getting too dry.  </li>
            <li> It is the only cream that moistures my feet and helps with dry heels during sandal season.  </li>
            <li> We tried many different products but this is the only one that healed the deep, painful crack in my husband&#x27;s heel.</li>
            <li> really dislike how hard it is to wash off one&#x27;s hands after applying to feet.</li>
            <li> Lastsummer a long time.</li>
            <li> This cream really does soften hard dry skin on your heels.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to use on my dry feet.  </li>
            <li> Is it improving my dry feet?  </li>
            <li> In one week my deeply cracked feet are vastly improved no painful fissures, yay, and feet don&#x27;t feel rough against the sheet or tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was sorry to see the product go from a nice jar to a tube as it&#x27;s very hard to get the last little bit out of the tube.</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful that I don&#x27;t get it on my face as it burns.</li>
            <li> It takes away and keeps away rough, itchy feet.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying any other creams from now on.</li>
            <li> It is not easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> All versions of this brand help keep my feet softer and I have to remove calluses less often.</li>
            <li> Just think what we put our feet through everyday.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few</li>
            <li> I found Podiatrist&#x27;s Secret at a local beauty store.</li>
            <li> I got a pumice sponge and began to use that every time I bathed followed by applying Foot Recovery Cream while my feet were still damp but towel dried.</li>
            <li> It worked in a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li> so not sure what the problem is.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve been that way for the past 17 years.</li>
            <li> and I mean very few that, given a few minutes, the pain is under control.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s also not a good idea because it stains your linen permanently.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed</li>

            <li> This is amazing foot cream and this is the best price I have seen anywhere. It really helps soften skin, smooth rough patches, and refreshes with Tea Tree.</li>

            <li> Bought this to use on my dry feet.  I&#x27;m not sure I really like it.  Kind of creasy and it has a peculiar smell.  It has some methyol in it which normally I don&#x27;t mind smelling so not sure what the problem is.  Is it improving my dry feet?  Somewhat...</li>
            <li> This cream really does soften hard dry skin on your heels.  I have tried just about every type of foot cream available and nothing does the job that Podiatrist&#x27;s Secret does.  I have used this for many years and have never found anything else that really keeps your feet this soft or alleviates cracked heels as well.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with how well the cream, is working.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the odor of the cream and I have to be careful that I don&#x27;t get it on my face as it burns.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!  I love this product.  Has softened not only my feet but my elbows and dry legs.  It is sure does cool dry hot feet.</li>
            <li> All versions of this brand help keep my feet softer and I have to remove calluses less often. Just think what we put our feet through everyday.</li>
            <li> Best product of this kind hands down.  Smells like old furniture polish at first bit it goes away.  Lastsummer a long time.</li>
            <li> We tried many different products but this is the only one that healed the deep, painful crack in my husband&#x27;s heel. He got the fastest results when he put it on right after his shower every day. It didn&#x27;t happen overnight but with consistent application every day there was a huge improvement in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product for turning crusty feet into feet you want be relutant to let your significant other see.</li>
            <li> I wish products like this would list all ingredients in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought three different products to try to replace my old faithful [[ASIN:B000HG80HM Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Oil Foot Balm ~6 Oz]] that changed its formula and now has parabens and is no longer certified organic and vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update - my old favorite at the link is back to its original formula - best stuff ever!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this cream if I&#x27;d realized it too had parabens.</li>
            <li> I have a type of inflammation of the nerves in my feet. I have found that was soon as I shower while my feet are moist I  apply the Cream, rub it in until it is gone then apply a bit more. It is one of the few and I mean very few that, given a few minutes, the pain is under control. Sometimes I have to apply it again in the night but feet must be moist before applying. If not it will cause a strong stinging sensation. But that might be my individual foot problem.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday before I put on socks for sure . I use it because I have such dry feel as I get older and this keeps them looking and feeling so much softer .Nice fragrance, thick and easily absorbed. Your feet feel better right away and I will use it from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many other creams for my feet, and there is nothing out there that compares to Podiatrist&#x27;s Secret Total Foot Recovery cream! Smells good, not greasy, and absolutely does away with thick callouses and cracks on my feet. I recommend it to everyone I know... this stuff works!</li>
            <li> Some foot cremes are very liquid, but this has a consistency similar to vaseline. It is not easily absorbed by the skin. Even hours later you still have a greasy layer on your skin. It&#x27;s best to use it before you go to bed or you will smear it all over the carpet. But that&#x27;s also not a good idea because it stains your linen permanently. Yet, we still like it. It&#x27;s good for your feet and the smell is rather pleasant. It&#x27;s not as good as Gehwol, but it&#x27;s also cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good price and works as advertised which in my case, is much better than the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream. I use it after each shower. My feet have never looked better or felt smoother!</li>
            <li> have had a probem with my feet for over 10 years and finally found something that relieves the dryness and itching.</li>
            <li> In one week my deeply cracked feet are vastly improved no painful fissures, yay, and feet don&#x27;t feel rough against the sheet or tight and uncomfortable. Feels rich and cooling when applying, not greasy. Will be reordering!</li>
            <li> If your feet are dry and cracked and the skin on your feet - in  general - has seen better days, this easily applied remedy which passes directly into the skin will put you on the right path to once again having happy feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foot cream, which has a uniquely pleasant medicinal smell and is supposedly quite effective if infections/circulation problems might be playing a role in the less than optimal health of one or both feet, really does work: The soles of my feet are much improved with smoother and softer skin as as well as an overall healthier, fresher appearance since I purchased my first tube of this item quite some time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another salve/cream that I would also recommend for this type of extremely dry foot problem is the original odorless version of Podiatrist&#x27;s Secret Total Foot Recovery Cream without the Tea Tree Oil (also available in 4 oz and 8 oz tubes from FootSmart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth considering is the likewise odorless O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme which I have recently tried and found to be very effective. You can find this item here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am by no means saying that you will feel so invigorated after having used this medicinal product for an appropriate period of time that you will be ready to dance up a storm, but I am quite certain that you will feel better for having done so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the modest price being asked, you really have nothing to lose and everything to gain by giving Podiatrist&#x27;s Secret Total Foot Recovery Cream with Tea Tree Oil the one-tube test and then taking it from there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: If you purchase this item directly through the FootSmart Web Site like I do, you can avail yourself of a buy 2 get 1 free offer that is regularly available for the 4 oz and 8 oz sizes of both versions of this cream - see there.</li>

            <li> Completely stopped cracked heals without all the scrubbing and scaping.  Gave some to a friend, she said her feet look better than her face :)</li>
            <li> Great product. This product was recommended to a friend of the family after undergoing foot surgery. She later told my mother how good it works and we&#x27;ve been using it since. It&lt;br /&gt;works wonders on my entire family&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is the absolute best on market. I began using maybe 6 months ago. My feet look and feel like I just came from salon. It takes away and keeps away rough, itchy feet. I felt the difference after the first time. You do not need to use a whole lot. I use this cream every night and I am lovin my new feet!!! Try it. You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years, and it really does the trick of keeping my feet soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products to heal my severely cracked heels and have had little success. This foot cream combined with the &amp;#34;tip to toe&amp;#34; callus remover has resolved the condition.&lt;br /&gt;My heels had gotten to the point where they had deep cracks and would sometimes bleed. It took about a week using this combination to heal my feet.</li>
            <li> One of the best foot creams I&#x27;ve used.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.  It is the best foot cream I ever used and I have tried many different kinds.  This is the only one I will buy from now on!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and I love it. It&#x27;s the only thing I have found that keeps my feet from getting too dry.  I was sorry to see the product go from a nice jar to a tube as it&#x27;s very hard to get the last little bit out of the tube. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> In my 40&#x27;s I began to notice my feet were getting fissures in the heels. My sister was having the same problem, too. We both tried just about everything out there for this problem including PedEggs, files, every kind of abrasive cream, etc... I found Podiatrist&#x27;s Secret at a local beauty store. I got a pumice sponge and began to use that every time I bathed followed by applying Foot Recovery Cream while my feet were still damp but towel dried. It worked in a matter of a few days. My feet look like I&#x27;ve just come from a spa every day and they&#x27;ve been that way for the past 17 years. My sister, who never was sold on my formula, still struggles with her heel cracks. Some people just don&#x27;t listen!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It keeps your feet soft.  Since I have been using this, I don&#x27;t have to get a pedicure as often.</li>
            <li> It keeps my feet pretty soft but doesn&#x27;t seem to do any healing on cracked/drying skin. Helps with itching though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really dislike how hard it is to wash off one&#x27;s hands after applying to feet. Makes my hand smell like menthol all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as advertised!</li>
            <li> I love this foot cream!!!  It is the only cream that moistures my feet and helps with dry heels during sandal season.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great, the best I ever tried. I have tried many other creams and lotions none comes close to this product.</li>
