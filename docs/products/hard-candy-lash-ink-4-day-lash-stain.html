    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need anything that adds volume, just something that colors the blonde/brown ends of my lashes and this works perfectly for that.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hesitant to die my lashes, and this was the best alternative I could find.</li>
            <li>I know maybe this is not the best practice</li>
            <li>I find Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo to be the best prep wash to use before I apply it.  </li>
            <li>to wake up to perfect lashes</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a great lash stain!  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>; claim, but it&#x27;s great for an all-day look for me.  </li>
            <li>Better than salon dye, cleaner than mascara!!  </li>
            <li>but it makes my eyes look a LOT better and the best part is</li>
            <li>This is not for everyone but for those of us who loved Marathon for years</li>
            <li>I feel that I am extremely fair and understanding when it comes to reviewing items, but I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I figured I could use it before leaving on a backpack trip and be good for the weekend.  </li>
            <li>Loved this.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>That said you might not want to use this kind if you wish to make your lashes fuller.</li>
            <li>But, it is a very nice, smooth consistency going on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to get off if you do it that way.</li>
            <li>:) Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this lash stain.</li>
            <li>I love dying my eye lashes...</li>
            <li>this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Most days I didn&#x27;t want to bother with putting makeup on..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Apply a coat or 2 to the top lashes of one eye, then immediately separate your lashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This probably isn&#x27;t for everybody, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it is the most waterproof mascara I have ever tried, but</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li>I did not leave it on for more than one day because I take my eye makeup off every night before bed, so I can&#x27;t speak about the &amp;#34;4 day&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Yes my eyes are healthy.</li>
            <li>This product is really great and really does work.  </li>
            <li>I also notice that when I am in a more humid climate I have more underneath my eyes in the morning or at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It IS a bit clumpy &amp; I wish it was a bit thicker, but in terms of sheer convenience for someone who often forgets to wear make up, it keeps my eyes looking great!</li>
            <li>I love this lash stain, I won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on this and thought that it might be ok for me.....</li>
            <li>Nope...used it 3 times and that was too many.  </li>
            <li>in all, I definitely have to say that this is the best mascara that I have used, aside from the wand, which is why it lost one star.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get mascara tracks that stay if you don&#x27;t get them off when they happen :)</li>
            <li>genuinely please, I cant every wear mascara except for that one kind that does a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; effect on the lash.</li>
            <li>I think it would be best suited for use if one were out for an extended time in nature and not only doesn&#x27;t want to appear overly &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; but won&#x27;t have a mirror or opportunity to do so.</li>
            <li>, you might okay with this.</li>
            <li>So glad it worked for so many others, just not me.</li>
            <li>But doesn&#x27;t ok as a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>but in reality it&#x27;s more like a (maaaaaaaaaaybe) 3 day mascara, clumped together lashes and all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lashes were darker, sure, but they also stuck together</li>
            <li>Anytime is okay to apply this, but for some reason I find it easier to do when I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying make</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>But I thought, hey, if it lasts awhile then that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I get frequent compliments on how naturally beautiful my lashes look since I&#x27;ve used this stuff.</li>
            <li>However, it does not last more than a day, but it IS a very good water-proof mascara, and I will buy it again.  </li>
            <li>It was dry by the time I got in to bed, and in the morning it&#x27;s still perfect-</li>
            <li>If I am going out and want my lashes a bit more bold, I just swipe on a coat of regular mascara over top, because it layers wonderfully.</li>
            <li>And it clumps the lashes most most importantly</li>
            <li>and I love being able to wake up with my mascara looking perfect and not having to mess with doing my makeup</li>
            <li>may buy again just because I am partial to stains over mascaras, but it&#x27;s nothing awesome.</li>
            <li>but I loved this so much I had to review</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it goes on smooth &amp; easy.</li>
            <li>It was relatively easy to remove with eye makeup remover, but there is no way you can take it off with a face wipe, so be</li>
            <li>I managed quite easily.  </li>
            <li>Does not wash off easy.</li>
            <li>I have tried professional salons where they dye your lashes and prefer to do this on my own now that I have found this!  </li>
            <li>I have heard that the new brush is not as good, so I have concerns about buying the newest version.</li>
            <li>I have fair lashes, actually light red, I have a very fair completion, I love this because it does last for 4 days on my light lashes, using this I don&#x27;t need to apply mascara every day, I don&#x27;t look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It made me look cheap, and I was distressed to have to look at myself in the mirror all day until I could get home and use make up remover to get it off.</li>
            <li>so feel free to cry and swim without fear of raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>However, it is available at walmart for seven dollars</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34;, just a smooth mascara; so it gets four stars because it is not quite as advertised.</li>
            <li>/more natural looking (on fair complexions)</li>
            <li>I liked the old formula better.  </li>
            <li>Using a lash-comb right after applying gives you a great separation and natural look with no lashes clumping together.</li>
            <li>Great if your lashes are long.  </li>
            <li>It is more like runny ink, but the first time I put it on I was in a moving car.</li>
            <li>the Walmart where I live is ALWAYS sold out of this kind...</li>
            <li>The stain does last about 4 days when I use the wand that came with the product; when I use my own wand it lasts about 2-3 days, depending on how many coats i put on.</li>
            <li>The reason I love this so much is because I have extremely light lashes (I&#x27;m a redhead)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have very light eyelashes, so I&#x27;m very thankful to this stuff.</li>
            <li>This seemed like a good solution, but it does actually flake off quite a lot within the 4-day span that it claims to stay on for.  </li>
            <li>There is not one thing on the package that is true in my experience of using it.</li>
            <li>Overall a good mascara.</li>
            <li>Again, they will not be super full like mascara...</li>
            <li>As far as mascaras go, it&#x27;s fine, just don&#x27;t expect anything more.</li>
            <li>You have to do it quick though, as the stain dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love to use this product to help me feel more put-together</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but just wasn&#x27;t able to make it work for me.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It looks great until you wash your face... Gets black under the eyes.</li>
            <li>Being a full time student with two jobs, I am ALWAYS on the go, and I could never find a mascara that didn&#x27;t end up giving me gross raccoon eyes by lunch, but this has been amazing.</li>
            <li>Though it does not actually last four days, I love the easy glide on color that doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>It really just makes them darker which is fine by</li>
            <li>When I do this i can add as many layers of stain i want for the desired effect and it looks perfectly natural.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Now after 4 days, when it starts to come off... it comes off kind of different.  </li>
            <li>so I appreciate being able to enjoy the effort for several days.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li>when I first applied I was to quick to apply,  </li>
            <li>I pat them with a tissue, it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>Great color, goes on thick and full.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last the full four days, more like three because it starts to wear off at the root of the lash first.</li>
            <li>If you have long lashes, have q-tips and remover handy because your lashes will touch your eyelids</li>
            <li>It works great last for several days will NOT flake off onto your cheeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has lasted me as long as 7 days, but if you sleep on your face it will wear off more quickly.</li>
            <li>When I found Lash Ink it is very much like the Revlon product.  </li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and the price is affordable.  </li>
            <li>I love that it stays on for several days but</li>
            <li>Overall, I really love this stuff</li>
            <li>Love if actually lasted thru a water park visit</li>
            <li>First of all my name is not Kevin (he is my husband).</li>
            <li>Even the first application dose not leave flakes of junk hanging off my lashes.</li>
            <li>The actual review: I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mascara, but definitely doesn&#x27;t last 4 days.</li>
            <li>Very dark black and is more attractive then normal mascara and lasts 4 days!</li>
            <li>I just need to re-apply it to the very ends where it seems to wear-off first.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for anyone who wants natural-looking darker lashes with color that has some serious staying power.</li>
            <li>kind of like black glue or something.  </li>
            <li>I certainly can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>On top of that it feels exactly like every other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This brush has a &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; head and so separates and defines really well.</li>
            <li>I assume this is because the coats are much thinner.</li>
            <li>haha).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this really lasts 3 days</li>
            <li>This product really helps me with that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent WAAY more money on expensive-brand mascara and not gotten results like this.</li>
            <li>so thank goodness I do not have to worry too much about that.</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come off unless you take some time, remover, and real effort to it</li>
            <li>and you aren&#x27;t very fussy about quality</li>
            <li>Just takes too much time.</li>
            <li>Stiff and kind of clumpy, even when I separated my lashes.</li>
            <li>I still apply it more than every 4 days but have generally found when applying it daily</li>
            <li>I have extremely long, fine, blond lashes.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to rub much, just let it sit on your lashes a while, then rinse and wash with your normal mascara remover/cleanser to remove the oil.  </li>
            <li>First off, just as many others have said, this will not give you the dramatic full lash look that mascara will.  </li>
            <li>It is like someone mixed a smashed up sharpie with super glue and then said to put it on your lashes..</li>
            <li>Application is messy and takes a talented hand to get it on without getting a bunch under and above the eye.</li>
            <li>Then If I need some extra volume I will use some standard mascara on top of the lash stain.  </li>
            <li>lasts longer than most REGULAR mascaras but it is not a tint it does not last for days.  </li>
            <li>just like when you use regular mascara only I&#x27;d take a little more time with this since it will stay on for more than just a day.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know, I use high end mascara</li>
            <li>you go to apply it, please realize that it takes a little more time than mascara.  </li>
            <li>, it dries out super hard and stiff, making your eyelashes more brittle and easily breakable.</li>
            <li>every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must start with completely clean dry lashes or it won&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li>I like a lot of seperation, because my lashes are naturally fairly full and WAY long, so I buy packs of disposable wands.</li>
            <li>But its more like heavy duty mascara that doesn&#x27;t wash off for days.</li>
            <li>From now on, if I want the look of wearing mascara, then I will just put on normal washable mascara.</li>
            <li>I love a very long lasting mascara.  </li>
            <li>I live in AZ</li>
            <li>I love to use it as I work from home and also have a small baby at home</li>
            <li>It dries pretty fast and once its dry, your lashes will be soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it before I left because it was a mess.  </li>
            <li>Crusty, hard lashes that don&#x27;t even begin to stay put for more than a day.</li>
            <li>I have almost clear eyelashes</li>
            <li>Looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It is a lash stain, and works very well for me since I have blonde eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hoping they&#x27;d tint my near invisible lashes.</li>
            <li>I got two days from it and the second day was very faded.</li>
            <li>and some rubbing to get it completely off, therefore, risking eyelash loss.</li>
            <li>I like the product to use in between professional salon lash tints but it does tend to get all over the place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The second time I really took my time.</li>
            <li>This mascara does NOT thicken or lengthen lashes at all, so at home I&#x27;ll use it as top coat for late nights to help prevent smudging, over a lengthening/thickening mascara.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t run but just seeps into my eyes enough to make them burn and water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much worth the initial extra time to save me from having to put mascara on every morning.  </li>
            <li>No mess unless you goop it on and have an unsteady hand.  </li>
            <li>Well...it lasts longer than normal mascaras, I&#x27;ll give it that, but it doesn&#x27;t last near 4 days.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think anyone would like to have tinted lashes that stick together for 3 days that you also couldnt use regular mascara with to make them look full and lush (due to them being stuck together and hard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little still remains on my eyelashes even after washing with face soap, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>It is not as thick as regular mascara and takes some practice to get the hang of using it but for everyday use it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>it is just not thick enough of a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it came off in the shower (the first day) just like any other mascara, all over my face.</li>
            <li>It smeared right after applying and blinking and throughout the day flaked or put black under my eyes.</li>
            <li>so I have maybe what some would consider a lot of lash hairs close together) which made using REGULAR mascara impossible; and this stuff by itself is MOST definitely not adequate to use alone for a nice &#x27;mascara lashes&#x27; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered it my senior year of high school and used it a few times, but I really started to appreciate it in college.</li>
            <li>So I am not sure how much of a stain it really is, or how waterproof it is.</li>
            <li>By the second day it had faded considerably.</li>
            <li>It barely lasts one.  </li>
            <li>I have light eyelashes and don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make up, and don&#x27;t like to apply this thick.  </li>
            <li>This new one flakes off and definitely does not last 4 days.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need anything that adds volume, just something that colors the blonde/brown ends of my lashes and this works perfectly for that.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hesitant to die my lashes, and this was the best alternative I could find.</li>
            <li> I know maybe this is not the best practice</li>
            <li> I find Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo to be the best prep wash to use before I apply it.  </li>
            <li> to wake up to perfect lashes</li>
            <li> Great product!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great lash stain!  </li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> ; claim, but it&#x27;s great for an all-day look for me.  </li>
            <li> Better than salon dye, cleaner than mascara!!  </li>
            <li> but it makes my eyes look a LOT better and the best part is</li>
            <li> This is not for everyone but for those of us who loved Marathon for years</li>
            <li> I feel that I am extremely fair and understanding when it comes to reviewing items, but I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I figured I could use it before leaving on a backpack trip and be good for the weekend.  </li>
            <li> Loved this.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> That said you might not want to use this kind if you wish to make your lashes fuller.</li>
            <li> But, it is a very nice, smooth consistency going on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to get off if you do it that way.</li>
            <li> :) Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this lash stain.</li>
            <li> I love dying my eye lashes...</li>
            <li> this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Most days I didn&#x27;t want to bother with putting makeup on..</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Apply a coat or 2 to the top lashes of one eye, then immediately separate your lashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This probably isn&#x27;t for everybody, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it is the most waterproof mascara I have ever tried, but</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li> I did not leave it on for more than one day because I take my eye makeup off every night before bed, so I can&#x27;t speak about the &amp;#34;4 day&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Yes my eyes are healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is really great and really does work.  </li>
            <li> I also notice that when I am in a more humid climate I have more underneath my eyes in the morning or at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It IS a bit clumpy &amp; I wish it was a bit thicker, but in terms of sheer convenience for someone who often forgets to wear make up, it keeps my eyes looking great!</li>
            <li> I love this lash stain, I won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this and thought that it might be ok for me.....</li>
            <li> Nope...used it 3 times and that was too many.  </li>
            <li> in all, I definitely have to say that this is the best mascara that I have used, aside from the wand, which is why it lost one star.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get mascara tracks that stay if you don&#x27;t get them off when they happen :)</li>
            <li> genuinely please, I cant every wear mascara except for that one kind that does a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; effect on the lash.</li>
            <li> I think it would be best suited for use if one were out for an extended time in nature and not only doesn&#x27;t want to appear overly &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; but won&#x27;t have a mirror or opportunity to do so.</li>
            <li> , you might okay with this.</li>
            <li> So glad it worked for so many others, just not me.</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t ok as a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> but in reality it&#x27;s more like a (maaaaaaaaaaybe) 3 day mascara, clumped together lashes and all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lashes were darker, sure, but they also stuck together</li>
            <li> Anytime is okay to apply this, but for some reason I find it easier to do when I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying make</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> But I thought, hey, if it lasts awhile then that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I get frequent compliments on how naturally beautiful my lashes look since I&#x27;ve used this stuff.</li>
            <li> However, it does not last more than a day, but it IS a very good water-proof mascara, and I will buy it again.  </li>
            <li> It was dry by the time I got in to bed, and in the morning it&#x27;s still perfect-</li>
            <li> If I am going out and want my lashes a bit more bold, I just swipe on a coat of regular mascara over top, because it layers wonderfully.</li>
            <li> And it clumps the lashes most most importantly</li>
            <li> and I love being able to wake up with my mascara looking perfect and not having to mess with doing my makeup</li>
            <li> may buy again just because I am partial to stains over mascaras, but it&#x27;s nothing awesome.</li>
            <li> but I loved this so much I had to review</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it goes on smooth &amp; easy.</li>
            <li> It was relatively easy to remove with eye makeup remover, but there is no way you can take it off with a face wipe, so be</li>
            <li> I managed quite easily.  </li>
            <li> Does not wash off easy.</li>
            <li> I have tried professional salons where they dye your lashes and prefer to do this on my own now that I have found this!  </li>
            <li> I have heard that the new brush is not as good, so I have concerns about buying the newest version.</li>
            <li> I have fair lashes, actually light red, I have a very fair completion, I love this because it does last for 4 days on my light lashes, using this I don&#x27;t need to apply mascara every day, I don&#x27;t look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> It made me look cheap, and I was distressed to have to look at myself in the mirror all day until I could get home and use make up remover to get it off.</li>
            <li> so feel free to cry and swim without fear of raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> However, it is available at walmart for seven dollars</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34;, just a smooth mascara; so it gets four stars because it is not quite as advertised.</li>
            <li> /more natural looking (on fair complexions)</li>
            <li> I liked the old formula better.  </li>
            <li> Using a lash-comb right after applying gives you a great separation and natural look with no lashes clumping together.</li>
            <li> Great if your lashes are long.  </li>
            <li> It is more like runny ink, but the first time I put it on I was in a moving car.</li>
            <li> the Walmart where I live is ALWAYS sold out of this kind...</li>
            <li> The stain does last about 4 days when I use the wand that came with the product; when I use my own wand it lasts about 2-3 days, depending on how many coats i put on.</li>
            <li> The reason I love this so much is because I have extremely light lashes (I&#x27;m a redhead)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I have very light eyelashes, so I&#x27;m very thankful to this stuff.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a good solution, but it does actually flake off quite a lot within the 4-day span that it claims to stay on for.  </li>
            <li> There is not one thing on the package that is true in my experience of using it.</li>
            <li> Overall a good mascara.</li>
            <li> Again, they will not be super full like mascara...</li>
            <li> As far as mascaras go, it&#x27;s fine, just don&#x27;t expect anything more.</li>
            <li> You have to do it quick though, as the stain dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love to use this product to help me feel more put-together</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but just wasn&#x27;t able to make it work for me.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It looks great until you wash your face... Gets black under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Being a full time student with two jobs, I am ALWAYS on the go, and I could never find a mascara that didn&#x27;t end up giving me gross raccoon eyes by lunch, but this has been amazing.</li>
            <li> Though it does not actually last four days, I love the easy glide on color that doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li> It really just makes them darker which is fine by</li>
            <li> When I do this i can add as many layers of stain i want for the desired effect and it looks perfectly natural.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Now after 4 days, when it starts to come off... it comes off kind of different.  </li>
            <li> so I appreciate being able to enjoy the effort for several days.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li> when I first applied I was to quick to apply,  </li>
            <li> I pat them with a tissue, it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> Great color, goes on thick and full.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last the full four days, more like three because it starts to wear off at the root of the lash first.</li>
            <li> If you have long lashes, have q-tips and remover handy because your lashes will touch your eyelids</li>
            <li> It works great last for several days will NOT flake off onto your cheeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has lasted me as long as 7 days, but if you sleep on your face it will wear off more quickly.</li>
            <li> When I found Lash Ink it is very much like the Revlon product.  </li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and the price is affordable.  </li>
            <li> I love that it stays on for several days but</li>
            <li> Overall, I really love this stuff</li>
            <li> Love if actually lasted thru a water park visit</li>
            <li> First of all my name is not Kevin (he is my husband).</li>
            <li> Even the first application dose not leave flakes of junk hanging off my lashes.</li>
            <li> The actual review: I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara, but definitely doesn&#x27;t last 4 days.</li>
            <li> Very dark black and is more attractive then normal mascara and lasts 4 days!</li>
            <li> I just need to re-apply it to the very ends where it seems to wear-off first.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for anyone who wants natural-looking darker lashes with color that has some serious staying power.</li>
            <li> kind of like black glue or something.  </li>
            <li> I certainly can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> On top of that it feels exactly like every other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This brush has a &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; head and so separates and defines really well.</li>
            <li> I assume this is because the coats are much thinner.</li>
            <li> haha).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this really lasts 3 days</li>
            <li> This product really helps me with that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent WAAY more money on expensive-brand mascara and not gotten results like this.</li>
            <li> so thank goodness I do not have to worry too much about that.</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off unless you take some time, remover, and real effort to it</li>
            <li> and you aren&#x27;t very fussy about quality</li>
            <li> Just takes too much time.</li>
            <li> Stiff and kind of clumpy, even when I separated my lashes.</li>
            <li> I still apply it more than every 4 days but have generally found when applying it daily</li>
            <li> I have extremely long, fine, blond lashes.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to rub much, just let it sit on your lashes a while, then rinse and wash with your normal mascara remover/cleanser to remove the oil.  </li>
            <li> First off, just as many others have said, this will not give you the dramatic full lash look that mascara will.  </li>
            <li> It is like someone mixed a smashed up sharpie with super glue and then said to put it on your lashes..</li>
            <li> Application is messy and takes a talented hand to get it on without getting a bunch under and above the eye.</li>
            <li> Then If I need some extra volume I will use some standard mascara on top of the lash stain.  </li>
            <li> lasts longer than most REGULAR mascaras but it is not a tint it does not last for days.  </li>
            <li> just like when you use regular mascara only I&#x27;d take a little more time with this since it will stay on for more than just a day.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know, I use high end mascara</li>
            <li> you go to apply it, please realize that it takes a little more time than mascara.  </li>
            <li> , it dries out super hard and stiff, making your eyelashes more brittle and easily breakable.</li>
            <li> every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must start with completely clean dry lashes or it won&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li> I like a lot of seperation, because my lashes are naturally fairly full and WAY long, so I buy packs of disposable wands.</li>
            <li> But its more like heavy duty mascara that doesn&#x27;t wash off for days.</li>
            <li> From now on, if I want the look of wearing mascara, then I will just put on normal washable mascara.</li>
            <li> I love a very long lasting mascara.  </li>
            <li> I live in AZ</li>
            <li> I love to use it as I work from home and also have a small baby at home</li>
            <li> It dries pretty fast and once its dry, your lashes will be soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it before I left because it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> Crusty, hard lashes that don&#x27;t even begin to stay put for more than a day.</li>
            <li> I have almost clear eyelashes</li>
            <li> Looks natural.  </li>
            <li> It is a lash stain, and works very well for me since I have blonde eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping they&#x27;d tint my near invisible lashes.</li>
            <li> I got two days from it and the second day was very faded.</li>
            <li> and some rubbing to get it completely off, therefore, risking eyelash loss.</li>
            <li> I like the product to use in between professional salon lash tints but it does tend to get all over the place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second time I really took my time.</li>
            <li> This mascara does NOT thicken or lengthen lashes at all, so at home I&#x27;ll use it as top coat for late nights to help prevent smudging, over a lengthening/thickening mascara.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t run but just seeps into my eyes enough to make them burn and water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very much worth the initial extra time to save me from having to put mascara on every morning.  </li>
            <li> No mess unless you goop it on and have an unsteady hand.  </li>
            <li> Well...it lasts longer than normal mascaras, I&#x27;ll give it that, but it doesn&#x27;t last near 4 days.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think anyone would like to have tinted lashes that stick together for 3 days that you also couldnt use regular mascara with to make them look full and lush (due to them being stuck together and hard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little still remains on my eyelashes even after washing with face soap, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> It is not as thick as regular mascara and takes some practice to get the hang of using it but for everyday use it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> it is just not thick enough of a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it came off in the shower (the first day) just like any other mascara, all over my face.</li>
            <li> It smeared right after applying and blinking and throughout the day flaked or put black under my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I have maybe what some would consider a lot of lash hairs close together) which made using REGULAR mascara impossible; and this stuff by itself is MOST definitely not adequate to use alone for a nice &#x27;mascara lashes&#x27; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discovered it my senior year of high school and used it a few times, but I really started to appreciate it in college.</li>
            <li> So I am not sure how much of a stain it really is, or how waterproof it is.</li>
            <li> By the second day it had faded considerably.</li>
            <li> It barely lasts one.  </li>
            <li> I have light eyelashes and don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make up, and don&#x27;t like to apply this thick.  </li>
            <li> This new one flakes off and definitely does not last 4 days.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a stain, it was a thin mascara (no thickening or lengthening), which means that keeping it on for more than a day creates the same situation as keeping any other mascara on - it dries out your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those are my two requirements, and the first one is reallllllly hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wipe</li>
            <li> It definitely stains my lashes to a noticeable effect!&lt;br /&gt;The brush it comes with can make things a little clumpy, so I actually use a mascara wand I saved and washed from an old mascara I had.</li>
            <li> I think they must have used too much but even then I&#x27;m not sure how it would become that way.</li>
            <li> and wow not a smudge or dark  circle anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I used this product twice and both times it didn&#x27;t even stay on as long as regular waterproof mascara would have.  </li>
            <li> clumps &amp; doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even have to be long wearing.</li>
            <li> That happened with my last lash stain though, so it was expected for the nature of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it out and two of those were extensively long and soapy (giving my dogs a bath).</li>
            <li> Then do the lower lashes and the other eye the same way.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it came in other shades like dark-brown...</li>
            <li> then cried making the lashes thin and spider leggy - stick together and clump for 3 days - and I only left it on that long out of sheer perverse curiosity to see how long it actually would last.....</li>
            <li> I dry my lashes thoroughly with a paper towel before applying as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry eye and thought my days of wearing eye makeup were over.</li>
            <li> so my lashes had time to dry, and finish the night by applying this with a separate wand.</li>
            <li> It has to dry between coats.</li>
            <li> Also, it takes a while to dry so</li>
            <li> waste your money, get an actual lash stain/dye for the SAME price.</li>
            <li> With a name like Lash Ink, I expected a thin liquid that would dye my lashes, rather than a clumpy mess that hardens into a flaking and a cheap -looking coating on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Not good mascara, as it&#x27;s very clumpy.</li>
            <li> By the next morning, I have very little of it left on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It not a quick apply and out the door as regular mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Second of all I am not really a super make up type person</li>
            <li> I wash my face am and pm with African Black soap and it stayed put.</li>
            <li> It simply adds a bit of lasting color to dull lashes.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I can see why some people are frustrated with this product, HOWEVER, it does work just as it is supposed to if used correctly.</li>
            <li> My lashes were still darker than usual but barely.</li>
            <li> I expected longer-term color from a product with &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; in the name.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a couple tries.</li>
            <li> It takes me some time to carefully apply my mascara to the point</li>
            <li> but it did last during a few incidents of stub toe tears.</li>
            <li> I tossed it after 3 tries.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.  </li>
            <li> so my expectations of what mascara should make my lashes look like might be askew -</li>
            <li> While in the military, I use 1 coat of this mascara and it stays on no matter what until I wash it off.  </li>
            <li> This is not easy to remove once on, and should not be applied in multiple layers like a mascara.  </li>
            <li> Couldnt live without my Hard Candy lash ink!</li>
            <li> I check the mascara from time to time as I find it sometimes attracts small bits of lint especially when still wet from the shower.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> So it may last 3-5 days, but it&#x27;s too messy to keep on!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind going without any other makeup</li>
            <li> I would instead say it&#x27;s an extremely stubborn waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even THAT dark.</li>
            <li> I always get dark undereyes.</li>
            <li> I wash my face daily using soaps in the shower and allow this mascara to slowly wear away.  </li>
            <li> I guess that it is not as thick as regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Beats any mascara hands down.</li>
            <li> It defiantly does not run down my face or give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Again I buy something because the reviews are so favorable and again just let down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It made a slight difference in the darkness of my lashes, noticeable if you&#x27;re looking for it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear any makeup to work because I spend half my shift underwater until my friend gave me this stuff as a gift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good as a regular mascara either.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are already long and thick</li>
            <li> I am certainly guilty at not making it home to put on new makeup properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am certainly guilty at not making it home to put on new makeup properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they seem a little risky, not to mention pricey.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get in trouble</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It;&#x27;s not a mascara for everyday use because it requires an oily mascara remover on a cotton ball</li>
            <li> the review that said it was heavy</li>
            <li> Even worse, it only looks like you&#x27;re wearing mascara for about 2 days, then you get the feel without the look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got white eyelashes on one eye and am hugely tired of applying mascara every day.  </li>
            <li> and I also use plain coconut oil to remove it.</li>
            <li> , it last as long as 3 to 4 days as long as you don&#x27;t wash it off with an oil base soap like dove or eye cream.</li>
            <li> Very hard to remove, but also made to stay on so that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> Sounds bad but it really isnt..</li>
            <li> However, in the morning only the bases of my lashes have color, and there are random chunks hanging everywhere else.</li>
            <li> It stays on well but is way too stiff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard on the eyes and on the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> so its hard to get.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t hard and brittle like</li>
            <li> the wand before you use it or it may splatter on your face and be hard to get off, or make your lashes clump a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have an unusually hard time keeping mascara where it belongs.  </li>
            <li> Hard Candy Lash Ink does darken one&#x27;s lashes, but it also gives them a hard plastic feel.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to get it on.  </li>
            <li> I used it at least 3 times.  </li>
            <li> I wear a thick moisturizer on my face at night.</li>
            <li> Needs to be applied slow because it splatters.  </li>
            <li> I can see that if you like to apply this thick you would end up with clumps like some of the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, four days.  </li>
            <li> I HATE heavy makeup to a point where I only wear lip stains.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I think fat lashes look really terrible on most people though some can pull it off.</li>
            <li> Little flakes of makeup are very irritating when they get stuck to your eye.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Hard Candy!</li>
            <li> The liquid is so thin that it gets inside my eye</li>
            <li> brush is thin and the product is a thin liquid, takes time to get the hang of it to apply,</li>
            <li> think the person who says it is messy is crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am equally confused about the people that say it came off in the shower.</li>
            <li> You can also use false eyelash remover on a q-tip to get it off your skin.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I&#x27;m back to the drawing board. :(</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed to have been sold a product that was supposed to be like an ink, but is instead like the worst clumping mascara ever.</li>
            <li> but I wear long wearing contacts and hate when I use an oil based remover having to remove the contacts to avoid the oily residue.  </li>
            <li> This is awful stuff and doesn&#x27;t live up to its claims at all.</li>
            <li> It is super waxy, clumps terribly, and nearly impossible to get off.</li>
            <li> Try this product you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I would also end up with clumps of makeup stuck to my lashes (no matter how expensive of a brand I bought) and even the water proof ones gave me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> only beef: $14 are you crazy!!!!</li>
            <li> only beef: $14 are you crazy!!!!</li>
            <li> But sadly it didn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li> Can be difficult to remove from surface and skin.</li>
            <li> I am very confused.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not for people who want ugly ghoulish fat eye lashes.</li>
            <li> If you are buying this, order a pack of disposable mascara wands as well, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> We all know what happens then :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> So disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Worst.</li>
            <li> but my eyes look terrible without darker lashes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> long-lasting, doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried this, but it goes on clumpy and does not stay on any longer than mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for an eyelash stain that only darkens the lashes, that leaves them semi-soft and doesn&#x27;t flake. I&#x27;ve considered eyelash dyes before but they seem a little risky, not to mention pricey. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be long wearing. Well...here I was thinking that this might have been what I wanted. Nope. First off it&#x27;s not even THAT dark. It darkened my short, sparse lashes but only just. On top of that it feels exactly like every other mascara I&#x27;ve used. Stiff and kind of clumpy, even when I separated my lashes. But I thought, hey, if it lasts awhile then that&#x27;s pretty good. Well...it lasts longer than normal mascaras, I&#x27;ll give it that, but it doesn&#x27;t last near 4 days. By the second day it had faded considerably. My lashes were still darker than usual but barely. I also woke up with flakes of it everywhere, especially in my eyes. Those things hurt! So needless to say I&#x27;m back to the drawing board. :(</li>
            <li> It came 2 days after I ordered it.. Works great</li>
            <li> ehh. seems just like mascara to me.</li>
            <li> I expected longer-term color from a product with &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; in the name. This is just mascara. Not good mascara, as it&#x27;s very clumpy.</li>
            <li> Just mascara. Didn&#x27;t last any longer.</li>
            <li> Couldnt live without my Hard Candy lash ink! Beats any mascara hands down. Never worry about mascara running/smudging again! Try this product you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Great.  Goes on smooth.  Looks natural.  Great if your lashes are long.  Washes off well, if you prefer to put on daily,</li>
            <li> I love this lash stain. It works great last for several days will NOT flake off onto your cheeks. I purchased mine at walmart for $7.</li>
            <li> With a name like Lash Ink, I expected a thin liquid that would dye my lashes, rather than a clumpy mess that hardens into a flaking and a cheap -looking coating on my lashes. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed to have been sold a product that was supposed to be like an ink, but is instead like the worst clumping mascara ever. It made me look cheap, and I was distressed to have to look at myself in the mirror all day until I could get home and use make up remover to get it off. This is awful stuff and doesn&#x27;t live up to its claims at all. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very hard to remove, but also made to stay on so that was to be expected. Great product.</li>
            <li> It looks great until you wash your face... Gets black under the eyes. So it may last 3-5 days, but it&#x27;s too messy to keep on!</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I used it at least 3 times.  Unfortunately, it feels like you&#x27;re actually wearing mascara for 3 days or more.  After about the 3rd or 4th use, my eyes started having an allergic reaction.  I totally do not recommend this product.  It&#x27;s hard on the eyes and on the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I can see why some people are frustrated with this product, HOWEVER, it does work just as it is supposed to if used correctly. It is a lash stain, and works very well for me since I have blonde eyelashes. I love to use it as I work from home and also have a small baby at home so I only put on &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; makeup when heading out. But - I still like to look and feel fresh-faced and this product helps quite a lot! It definitely stains my lashes to a noticeable effect!&lt;br /&gt;The brush it comes with can make things a little clumpy, so I actually use a mascara wand I saved and washed from an old mascara I had. This brush has a &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; head and so separates and defines really well. I just either stick it in the tube and use it or brush through my lashes with it immediately after using the wand the stain came with. You have to do it quick though, as the stain dries quickly. When I do this i can add as many layers of stain i want for the desired effect and it looks perfectly natural. When I use the wand that came with the stain, things look clumpier. The stain does last about 4 days when I use the wand that came with the product; when I use my own wand it lasts about 2-3 days, depending on how many coats i put on. I assume this is because the coats are much thinner. Overall, I love to use this product to help me feel more put-together (when I&#x27;m actually not! haha). Also, it only takes about 1-2 minutes to put on, even when taking my time!</li>
            <li> It smeared right after applying and blinking and throughout the day flaked or put black under my eyes. Clumped upon applying. I had high hopes, but just wasn&#x27;t able to make it work for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Does not run or irritate my eyes. Last three days. I love dying my eye lashes...this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this really lasts 3 days but it does stay on and not smudge ALL DAY. I have NEVER found a mascara that didn&#x27;t end up as raccoon eyes until this one. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I started using this mascara while I was working an outdoor environmental job with a bunch of males. Primping in the morning while camping out on the job site had to go FAST and unnoticed. Most days I didn&#x27;t want to bother with putting makeup on..&lt;br /&gt;I have very light eyelashes, so I&#x27;m very thankful to this stuff. It does stay on your lashes for a day or two, doesnt require touch-up and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I even wore this while I was at Fort Lee Ordnance Corps in Virginia with the Army...and females were NOT allowed to wear makeup!! I GOT AWAY WITH IT USING LASH INK! Undetectable! I had Sergeants in my face a lot (as we all did) and I didn&#x27;t get in trouble even ONCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying this...the Walmart where I live is ALWAYS sold out of this kind...so its hard to get. I will continue to order off of amazon!!</li>
            <li> This product delivers what it promises.  I love it.  One day it stayed on through 3 showers in the 98 degree weather. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and the price is affordable.  Thank you, Hard Candy!</li>
            <li> I love that it stays on for several days but applying it is like trying to apply water. The liquid is so thin that it gets inside my eye and then I have to start all over. I stopped using it after a couple tries.</li>
            <li> Worst. Thing. Ever.... It is like someone mixed a smashed up sharpie with super glue and then said to put it on your lashes.. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> First off, just as many others have said, this will not give you the dramatic full lash look that mascara will.  You can put mascara over it though.  The reason I love this so much is because I have extremely light lashes (I&#x27;m a redhead) and I don&#x27;t always have time to put make up on.  I don&#x27;t mind going without any other makeup but my eyes look terrible without darker lashes. This product really helps me with that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you go to apply it, please realize that it takes a little more time than mascara.  I would recommend that you do one eye at a time.  Apply a coat or 2 to the top lashes of one eye, then immediately separate your lashes.  I use a pointed set of tweezers.  I just separate the lashes if several of them try to clump together... just like when you use regular mascara only I&#x27;d take a little more time with this since it will stay on for more than just a day. Then do the lower lashes and the other eye the same way.  It dries pretty fast and once its dry, your lashes will be soft.  They aren&#x27;t hard and brittle like mascara makes them feel.  Again, they will not be super full like mascara... but it makes my eyes look a LOT better and the best part is, it lasts for 4 days.  Seriously, four days.  It&#x27;s very much worth the initial extra time to save me from having to put mascara on every morning.  Now after 4 days, when it starts to come off... it comes off kind of different.  You can pull it off.. kind of like black glue or something.  Sounds bad but it really isnt.. Just use eye makeup remover when it starts to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This probably isn&#x27;t for everybody, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Crusty, hard lashes that don&#x27;t even begin to stay put for more than a day. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> For those of us with blond lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t flake/end up as a ring under your eye through the day, and makes your lashes look dark.&lt;br /&gt;Those are my two requirements, and the first one is reallllllly hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wipe the wand before you use it or it may splatter on your face and be hard to get off, or make your lashes clump a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss Revlon&#x27;s discontinued colorstay overtime lash tint, but this is the closest I&#x27;ve come to a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the Peter Lamas lash tint for something brown/more natural looking (on fair complexions)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for anyone who wants natural-looking darker lashes with color that has some serious staying power. My lashes are already long and thick so I don&#x27;t need anything that adds volume, just something that colors the blonde/brown ends of my lashes and this works perfectly for that. I get frequent compliments on how naturally beautiful my lashes look since I&#x27;ve used this stuff. I still apply it more than every 4 days but have generally found when applying it daily I just need to re-apply it to the very ends where it seems to wear-off first. Using a lash-comb right after applying gives you a great separation and natural look with no lashes clumping together. Overall, I really love this stuff and I don&#x27;t think I could be swayed to try anything else; especially given the price. I&#x27;ve spent WAAY more money on expensive-brand mascara and not gotten results like this. I only wish it came in other shades like dark-brown...</li>
            <li> I expected a stain that would leave my eyelashes soft. It is super waxy, clumps terribly, and nearly impossible to get off.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long, fine, blond lashes. I purchased this hoping they&#x27;d tint my near invisible lashes. I had lasik recently so I&#x27;m hesitant to die my lashes, and this was the best alternative I could find. This does not stain or tint you lashes. I would instead say it&#x27;s an extremely stubborn waterproof mascara. Even my mascara remover doesn&#x27;t take it off. However, in the morning only the bases of my lashes have color, and there are random chunks hanging everywhere else. I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it is the most waterproof mascara I have ever tried, but only three because it doesn&#x27;t provide 2 days coverage, let alone the 4 advertised.</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay. Application is messy and takes a talented hand to get it on without getting a bunch under and above the eye. That happened with my last lash stain though, so it was expected for the nature of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made a slight difference in the darkness of my lashes, noticeable if you&#x27;re looking for it but nothing spectacular. I did not leave it on for more than one day because I take my eye makeup off every night before bed, so I can&#x27;t speak about the &amp;#34;4 day&amp;#34; claim. It did not flake throughout the day though and did not smudge at all. It was relatively easy to remove with eye makeup remover, but there is no way you can take it off with a face wipe, so be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may buy again just because I am partial to stains over mascaras, but it&#x27;s nothing awesome.</li>
            <li> Better than salon dye, cleaner than mascara!!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Does not last at all! I got two days from it and the second day was very faded.</li>
            <li> I could get the same reults from waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make it to four days but I do like it.</li>
            <li> Though it does not actually last four days, I love the easy glide on color that doesn&#x27;t clump.  It is definitely water-proof so feel free to cry and swim without fear of raccoon eyes. It;&#x27;s not a mascara for everyday use because it requires an oily mascara remover on a cotton ball and some rubbing to get it completely off, therefore, risking eyelash loss.</li>
            <li> I used to use a product made by Revlon that was called 3 Day Mascara.  They quit making it and I was always looking for a replacement.  I love a very long lasting mascara.  When I found Lash Ink it is very much like the Revlon product.  I wash my face daily using soaps in the shower and allow this mascara to slowly wear away.  I know maybe this is not the best practice but I wear long wearing contacts and hate when I use an oil based remover having to remove the contacts to avoid the oily residue.  I check the mascara from time to time as I find it sometimes attracts small bits of lint especially when still wet from the shower.  It takes me some time to carefully apply my mascara to the point I want it so I appreciate being able to enjoy the effort for several days.  Yes my eyes are healthy.</li>
            <li> I like the product to use in between professional salon lash tints but it does tend to get all over the place.</li>
            <li> Love if actually lasted thru a water park visit</li>
            <li> clumps &amp; doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> This product is really great and really does work.  I have an unusually hard time keeping mascara where it belongs.  However, it is available at walmart for seven dollars and I paid double....ugh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lash stain for months and I love being able to wake up with my mascara looking perfect and not having to mess with doing my makeup every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must start with completely clean dry lashes or it won&#x27;t stick.  I find Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo to be the best prep wash to use before I apply it.  I dry my lashes thoroughly with a paper towel before applying as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has lasted me as long as 7 days, but if you sleep on your face it will wear off more quickly. You can also use false eyelash remover on a q-tip to get it off your skin. I use a metal lash/brow comb to separate my lashes as I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some finesse but it&#x27;s so worth it to wake up to perfect lashes every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I also use plain coconut oil to remove it. You don&#x27;t need to rub much, just let it sit on your lashes a while, then rinse and wash with your normal mascara remover/cleanser to remove the oil.  It&#x27;s very easy to get off if you do it that way.</li>
            <li> This is what I have been searching for since CG discontinued Marathon Mascara. I have almost clear eyelashes and this stuff stays on and doesn&#x27;t come off or flake!! It is not as thick as regular mascara and takes some practice to get the hang of using it but for everyday use it&#x27;s great. Then If I need some extra volume I will use some standard mascara on top of the lash stain.  This is not for everyone but for those of us who loved Marathon for years this is the closest thing I have found.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I do like this product. I wear a thick moisturizer on my face at night. So when I wake up it is underneath my eyes. So I am not sure how much of a stain it really is, or how waterproof it is. I also notice that when I am in a more humid climate I have more underneath my eyes in the morning or at the end of the day.  I live in AZ so thank goodness I do not have to worry too much about that.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  It stays on about 5 days for me!  It IS a bit clumpy &amp; I wish it was a bit thicker, but in terms of sheer convenience for someone who often forgets to wear make up, it keeps my eyes looking great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a SCUBA diver and I can put this stuff on and go dive in the aquariums at work get out, shower, and it&#x27;s still perfect. And it does last for days even though I&#x27;m always in the water. I can&#x27;t wear any makeup to work because I spend half my shift underwater until my friend gave me this stuff as a gift. :) Love it!</li>
            <li> This works, it&#x27;s just like a mascara but it lasts several days!</li>
            <li> I have fair lashes, actually light red, I have a very fair completion, I love this because it does last for 4 days on my light lashes, using this I don&#x27;t need to apply mascara every day, I don&#x27;t look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is thin and the product is a thin liquid, takes time to get the hang of it to apply, when I first applied I was to quick to apply,  I did get some spots on eyelids but removed that with eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It not a quick apply and out the door as regular mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can still apply mascara over it, when I remove the regular mascara my lashes are still tinted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I really took my time. Works for me!!</li>
            <li> I love this lash stain, I won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone though. Watery Liquid consistency.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake off or get in my eyes. I have chronic dry eye and thought my days of wearing eye makeup were over.This one doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and no raccoon eyes ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this and thought that it might be ok for me.....Nope...used it 3 times and that was too many.  I feel that I am extremely fair and understanding when it comes to reviewing items, but I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  Wish I got my money back.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction which required a doctor visit and bill. I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> First of all my name is not Kevin (he is my husband). Second of all I am not really a super make up type person but I loved this so much I had to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacts and I kept getting crud form the regular mascaras in my eyes! Little flakes of makeup are very irritating when they get stuck to your eye. I would also end up with clumps of makeup stuck to my lashes (no matter how expensive of a brand I bought) and even the water proof ones gave me raccoon eyes. I thought I would try this and it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the person who says it is messy is crazy. You apply it just like regular mascara. No mess unless you goop it on and have an unsteady hand.  I guess that it is not as thick as regular mascara. It is more like runny ink, but the first time I put it on I was in a moving car. I managed quite easily.  It was not drippy or sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the review that said it was heavy I am very confused. I HATE heavy makeup to a point where I only wear lip stains. Even the first application dose not leave flakes of junk hanging off my lashes. I think they must have used too much but even then I&#x27;m not sure how it would become that way. I applied two coatings just to see what would happen and it still is not flaking off it is just not thick enough of a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not for people who want ugly ghoulish fat eye lashes. Sorry, I think fat lashes look really terrible on most people though some can pull it off. I certainly can&#x27;t.  It simply adds a bit of lasting color to dull lashes. That said you might not want to use this kind if you wish to make your lashes fuller. It really just makes them darker which is fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am equally confused about the people that say it came off in the shower. No. It defiantly does not run down my face or give me raccoon eyes. I took 5 showers in the four days I tried it out and two of those were extensively long and soapy (giving my dogs a bath). I wash my face am and pm with African Black soap and it stayed put. The only thing I can think of is that maybe some of the reviewers put it on over non water proof mascara and mistook that for the lash ink. I am certainly guilty at not making it home to put on new makeup properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef: $14 are you crazy!!!! I got mine for $7 at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: I am not understanding why people are complaining about it not coming off. Is that not the point?ck soap and it stayed put. The only thing I can think of is that maybe some of the reviewers put it on over non water proof mascara and mistook that for the lash ink.

            <li> I was under the impression this was &amp;#34;lash ink&amp;#34; or a temporary type of dye so I would not have to use mascara all the time since my lashes are blonde. No, it&#x27;s just another mascara. And it came off in the shower (the first day) just like any other mascara, all over my face. As far as mascaras go, it&#x27;s fine, just don&#x27;t expect anything more.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a &amp;#34;lash stain&amp;#34;. It is a waterproof mascara. It comes off in the nightly face wash. There was NO color the next day.</li>
            <li> Before I say anything, just know that I DON&#x27;T use the wand that it came with. I like a lot of seperation, because my lashes are naturally fairly full and WAY long, so I buy packs of disposable wands. The wand in this mascara is very basic, and does nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW. The actual review: I absolutely love this. I really do. I discovered it my senior year of high school and used it a few times, but I really started to appreciate it in college. I would take a shower, then do all of my face stuff so my lashes had time to dry, and finish the night by applying this with a separate wand. It was dry by the time I got in to bed, and in the morning it&#x27;s still perfect- if it sticks my lashes together a bit, I just use a brow comb and separate them which takes about twenty seconds tops. It doesn&#x27;t last the full four days, more like three because it starts to wear off at the root of the lash first. About the third day I touch it up, removing the last bits with a q-tip and some eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;I only apply it once, and for THREE DAYS I don&#x27;t have to worry about my mascara! If I am going out and want my lashes a bit more bold, I just swipe on a coat of regular mascara over top, because it layers wonderfully. Then when I take a shower, the regular comes off and the stain stays put! Being a full time student with two jobs, I am ALWAYS on the go, and I could never find a mascara that didn&#x27;t end up giving me gross raccoon eyes by lunch, but this has been amazing. It doesn&#x27;t come off unless you take some time, remover, and real effort to it haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I definitely have to say that this is the best mascara that I have used, aside from the wand, which is why it lost one star. If you are buying this, order a pack of disposable mascara wands as well, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. If you have long lashes, have q-tips and remover handy because your lashes will touch your eyelids and you&#x27;ll get mascara tracks that stay if you don&#x27;t get them off when they happen :)</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it goes on smooth &amp; easy. However, it does not last more than a day, but it IS a very good water-proof mascara, and I will buy it again.  It isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34;, just a smooth mascara; so it gets four stars because it is not quite as advertised.</li>
            <li> There are clump problems. Don&#x27;t get on skin. genuinely please, I cant every wear mascara except for that one kind that does a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; effect on the lash. Cant say it lasts through the shower or washing face but it did last during a few incidents of stub toe tears.</li>
            <li> This is not Mascara, but it&#x27;s not quite a &amp;#34;stain.&amp;#34;  Hard Candy Lash Ink does darken one&#x27;s lashes, but it also gives them a hard plastic feel.  This is not easy to remove once on, and should not be applied in multiple layers like a mascara.  I think it would be best suited for use if one were out for an extended time in nature and not only doesn&#x27;t want to appear overly &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; but won&#x27;t have a mirror or opportunity to do so.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it recommended on Dr. Oz.  What a joke.  I figured I could use it before leaving on a backpack trip and be good for the weekend.  Not so. I&#x27;m glad I tried it before I left because it was a mess.  Runs very easily -- definitely not waterproof and has no lasting color.  If you&#x27;re expecting 4 days, forget it.  If you just want mascara and you aren&#x27;t very fussy about quality, you might okay with this. I tossed it after 3 tries.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a sheer, lightweight lash tint. But its more like heavy duty mascara that doesn&#x27;t wash off for days. Instead it stays on just enough to feel wierd and flakes off onto your face over the course of 3 to 4 days. Even worse, it only looks like you&#x27;re wearing mascara for about 2 days, then you get the feel without the look. From now on, if I want the look of wearing mascara, then I will just put on normal washable mascara.</li>
            <li> It stays on well but is way too stiff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got white eyelashes on one eye and am hugely tired of applying mascara every day.  This seemed like a good solution, but it does actually flake off quite a lot within the 4-day span that it claims to stay on for.  It&#x27;s not good as a regular mascara either.  Disappointing!</li>
            <li> This product says 4 days of mascara that stays on.  Absolutely not.  I used this product twice and both times it didn&#x27;t even stay on as long as regular waterproof mascara would have.  It comes off without any effort for instance if my eyes water and I pat them with a tissue, it comes right off.  The package says shower, or what ever and it stays on.  I didn&#x27;t get to try it in the shower since it was gone by the time I would have taken a shower.  Not only that but it&#x27;s hard to get it on.  It doesn&#x27;t stick on to my lashes so it doesn&#x27;t get to \\&quot;tint\\&quot; them.  There is not one thing on the package that is true in my experience of using it. So glad it worked for so many others, just not me.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  But sadly it didn&#x27;t measure up. It doesn&#x27;t last 4 days to start. But I wanted to use it on my bottom lashes. I always get dark undereyes. It&#x27;s takes a while to build the product up. It has to dry between coats. Just takes too much time. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a stain..just sticks to your eyelashes..when you wake up your eyelashes are bent or crimpy depending on your sleep position...too bad..they shouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Needs to be applied slow because it splatters.  Can be difficult to remove from surface and skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing but a long-lasting waterproof mascara. And it clumps the lashes most most importantly, it dries out super hard and stiff, making your eyelashes more brittle and easily breakable. I took it off with waterproof eye maker remover two hours after putting it on as I felt that I was going to lose eyelashes. I am going back to using Roux eyelash tint or equivalent. This shouldn&#x27;t be called &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; but long-lasting waterproof mascara.  The name is misleading.  But doesn&#x27;t ok as a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Loved this.  This is the only product I have found that truly stays on, which is a godsend for oily skin.  I haven&#x27;t kept it on overnight so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;4 day&amp;#34; claim, but it&#x27;s great for an all-day look for me.  I have heard that the new brush is not as good, so I have concerns about buying the newest version. Overall, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Garbage, literally that&#x27;s where this ended up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly it&#x27;s marketed as a lash stain - which is why I bought it - but in reality it&#x27;s more like a (maaaaaaaaaaybe) 3 day mascara, clumped together lashes and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this SEVERAL times and each time I got the same result. Lashes were darker, sure, but they also stuck together (I have thicker lashes so I have maybe what some would consider a lot of lash hairs close together) which made using REGULAR mascara impossible; and this stuff by itself is MOST definitely not adequate to use alone for a nice &#x27;mascara lashes&#x27; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, I use high end mascara so my expectations of what mascara should make my lashes look like might be askew - but I don&#x27;t think anyone would like to have tinted lashes that stick together for 3 days that you also couldnt use regular mascara with to make them look full and lush (due to them being stuck together and hard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could go back and tell myself &amp;#34;dont buy this, it&#x27;s obviously a gimmick&amp;#34; I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I basically looked like I applied mascara and then cried making the lashes thin and spider leggy - stick together and clump for 3 days - and I only left it on that long out of sheer perverse curiosity to see how long it actually would last.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, get an actual lash stain/dye for the SAME price.</li>
            <li> I have blonde eyelashes and got this because you can&#x27;t have eyelash extensions and use mascara. Very dark black and is more attractive then normal mascara and lasts 4 days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara, but definitely doesn&#x27;t last 4 days. Also, it takes a while to dry so can end up on your lids or cheeks. But, it is a very nice, smooth consistency going on.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this and quit for a while and then purchased again.  They&#x27;ve changed the formula so that now it is supposed to increase the length and volume.  I liked the old formula better.  This new one flakes off and definitely does not last 4 days.  It barely lasts one.  By the next morning, I have very little of it left on my eyelashes.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product works for me.  I have light eyelashes and don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make up, and don&#x27;t like to apply this thick.  I can see that if you like to apply this thick you would end up with clumps like some of the reviews I read.  I have tried professional salons where they dye your lashes and prefer to do this on my own now that I have found this!  The salons get the dye all over my skin and with this I don&#x27;t. Anytime is okay to apply this, but for some reason I find it easier to do when I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying make up - like in the evening after moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is a great lash stain!  It is the only mascara I have used that is truly smudge proof/sweat proof/water proof.  While in the military, I use 1 coat of this mascara and it stays on no matter what until I wash it off.  A little still remains on my eyelashes even after washing with face soap, but not bad.  This mascara does NOT thicken or lengthen lashes at all, so at home I&#x27;ll use it as top coat for late nights to help prevent smudging, over a lengthening/thickening mascara.</li>
            <li> This is one of my faviorate eye secrets.  I like it because it does not bleed or smudge onto the under eye.  After a day of smiling and laughing you look in a mirror and wow not a smudge or dark  circle anywhere.  I love it, it last as long as 3 to 4 days as long as you don&#x27;t wash it off with an oil base soap like dove or eye cream.</li>
            <li> Great color, goes on thick and full. Does not wash off easy. Does not last 4 days as indicated. Does not stain lashes as indicated.  Overall a good mascara.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a stain, it was a thin mascara (no thickening or lengthening), which means that keeping it on for more than a day creates the same situation as keeping any other mascara on - it dries out your eyelashes. That being said, I think I&#x27;ll like it for my bottom lashes when I&#x27;m wearing mascara since it just provides color.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!  Again I buy something because the reviews are so favorable and again just let down.  Does this happen to anyone else?&lt;br /&gt;This lasts longer than most REGULAR mascaras but it is not a tint it does not last for days.  About 12 hours tops on my oily skin.  It really doesn&#x27;t run but just seeps into my eyes enough to make them burn and water. We all know what happens then :(&lt;br /&gt;It is just a mascara and I am just a  bummed out puppy on the search again....</li>
