            <li>Makes your skin feel nice</li>
            <li>It is so nice to have it in one formula.</li>
            <li>OK but not as good as my doctor prescribed retinol.</li>
            <li>smells nice, isn&#x27;t oily, makes my face feels rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on my face, but don&#x27;t notice any benefits</li>
            <li>she says that it is a great product and asked me where she could get more... :)</li>
            <li>Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy this is my first experience!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s amazing I&#x27;ll update :)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no issues or irritation with this product which is great!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaged nicely!</li>
            <li>My face feels very smooth after using this product.  </li>
            <li>What I have found with this product is that it has a nice consistency and goes on easily, absorbs into the skin and does not feel tacky or greasy.</li>
            <li>Good price, delivered quick and it&#x27;s smoothing out my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Just got it, really nice and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The Bellafab retinol wrinkle reducer is truly a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I’m so much more confident to go without makeup</li>
            <li>and this does a better job on wrinkles for 1/4</li>
            <li>If you do use during the day be sure to use a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>Love this as part of my beauty treatment.</li>
            <li>I need more of this for my skin</li>
            <li>After a week of use I feel like my skin complexion is slightly more even</li>
            <li>and my face seems fuller and more hydrated taking away some of the sallow/tired look.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found one.</li>
            <li>I love it because I can wear it under my makeup with no issues</li>
            <li>Sagging skin can be an issue for many people.</li>
            <li>I wait a minute or two and then top with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Hopefully my skin gets better.</li>
            <li>(I have a great story about giving myself a chemical burn while at South by Southwest, thanks Neutrogena).</li>
            <li>I love this gel-like consistency of this retinol.</li>
            <li>but then was ok...</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it !</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I am able to start using this just as I begin to &amp;#34;age&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Tried so many.</li>
            <li>I like this alot, I don&#x27;t know if its safe to use under your eyes</li>
            <li>Love using this at night.</li>
            <li>Love this serum. :-)</li>
            <li>I love these skin care products along with this one.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to have a better tone also</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Price wise is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t really understand how these kind of products work, but I know that this one DOES!  </li>
            <li>It works great on adult acne.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know where to start with taking care of adding skin, so with the whole retinol thing, this was as good a place to start as any.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other retinol creams but this one has delivered the best results for me (again, I&#x27;m using this for scars, not wrinkles).</li>
            <li>and it’s easy to apply in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li>Easy to work into my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>Reduces the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I use it day and nite to help w breakouts and fine lines.</li>
            <li>My skin tone seems to be evening out and my fine lines are softened.</li>
            <li>i use it nightly and feel like it helps my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective Vitamin A</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak to effectiveness yet - just started using but no adverse affects, and as others report it goes on light and absorbs immediately with no remaining residue.</li>
            <li>And I found my face becomes bright and soft?</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my skin is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and isn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
            <li>My smile lines around my eyes are getting just a touch more noticeable</li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>So far it feels good on my skin</li>
            <li>This serum is light and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>got the product for such a great price that it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>It drastically improves the look and fit of your skin giving you a more youthful and vibrant look.</li>
            <li>I am noticing that makeup is more like a necessity and not so much something that was optional.</li>
            <li>a full bottle.</li>
            <li>Silky texture with quick absorption.</li>
            <li>I have been using this at night, the main thing that I like is that now when I put makeup on, my chin does not have as many &amp;#34;ripples&amp;#34; or grooves.</li>
            <li>Am very pleased and have ordered it several times!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I did have a bit of break out at first because it&#x27;s just so hydrating!  </li>
            <li>my face is looking younger and has a healthy glow!</li>
            <li>This is very nice - easy to apply and you can feel instant &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; - I like that this has several vitamins in it -&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
            <li>So I would take it easy with this one and start with just a few days a week if you have sensitive skin as I do and also please don&#x27;t forget retinol products make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so get a good sunscreen and use it every day!</li>
            <li>After I use the whole bottle&lt;br /&gt;I will be able to give a better and second review.</li>
            <li>I have tried out many products and this is one of my favorites, makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>This serum goes on without stickiness and it also soaks right in.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I break out easy.</li>
            <li>fair, sensitive, acne prone, oily skin and my holy grail sunscreens are all Japanese, in particular Sofina and Kao Biore, which you can find for a relatively cheap price here on Amazon or on Ebay.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>My skin has more of a glow and seems a little firmer:)</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and dries on the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>This one is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Worked well, just be sure to wear sunscreen the next day.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>It makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended! !</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>After two weeks I&#x27;m seeing a difference, my skin seems more refined and smooth and the lines do seem to be less.  </li>
            <li>I must say I think that it’s the reason why my skin has stayed pretty much wrinkle free so far in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel soft and smooth, absorbs quickly, i use this under my eyes as well to help try to reduce the bags under my eyes, i love the way it makes my skin have a slight glow to it as well!</li>
            <li>This shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li>Love this product more than I expected will definitely order again</li>
            <li>This serum has really helped my complexion look much smoother,definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it where I get the most wrinkles and on my chin where my skin has started to loose elasticity.</li>
            <li>and she really loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of this retinol serum</li>
            <li>This serum has really helped my complexion look much smoother.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve the quality of their skin!</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>She said she doesn&#x27;t really notice a difference in her skin.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Really works, honestly, it really does.</li>
            <li>It feels so smooth after applying in my face, and even next morning still feel that way.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face smooth and I have noticed the improvement of my overall face.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>The bright side is that this serum has made my skin feel young and removed wrinkles in the past two months i&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li>Find this effective, but it does;t last too long compared to the Vitamin C  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see that this does anything even with a full month of daily use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  </li>
            <li>My main areas of concern are in between my brows and around my eyes, but I&#x27;ve felt no stinging or irritation after massaging this around my eyes.</li>
            <li>After trying tons of the skincare creams and lotions on the market, most of which were extremely expensive, I can honestly say that the retinol has made the most difference in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li>In just a few days of using this retinol ,i noticed smoother skin, a total improvement in my skin tone, smaller pores and the best part is that i have some brown sun spots that are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It may be my overall happiness with this product coloring my impression, but I really do feel that my lines are less pronounced and now barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this Retinol.</li>
            <li>I do not feel like my skin is getting flaky or dried out and there does seem to be a plumping effect which give the impression of being more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just now starting to get grumpy about my smile lines and self conscious about my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>It really did help my regular routine so much.</li>
            <li>So far I think I see  difference already!</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients in this formula; it contains 2.5% Retinol + 11% Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Organic Green Tea + Organic Aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil!</li>
            <li>I dont have wrinkles, i am just 34 years old, but it never late to star takimg care of your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only in my twenties, but I have a busy lifestyle that really wears on my under-eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 50 with sensitive combination skin and still get break outs.  </li>
            <li>Made skin luminous and filled in the cracks in a few weeks</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I really saw a difference after using this product for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Fewer wrinkles, soft glowing skin.</li>
            <li>I did not break out after using it, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but yes, us old people have wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>but like it so far.</li>
            <li>I could immediately feel the potency of the active ingredients because it caused some mild stinging and reddening of my skin after application.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very light gel that is neither too runny or too thick, so it&#x27;s very easy to apply a thin even layer to the skin.</li>
            <li>This by far has been my favorite serum out of the past 5 that I tried!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to test out the wrinkle effects, but it makes my skin feel super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Right now for winter I use this during the day and night but in the summer I may alternate only using this at night because of the sun.</li>
            <li>but somehow it wasn&#x27;t even half full. ..</li>
            <li>My daughter told me the other day that I have a chin wrinkle when I smile.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products in the past that all claim to work, but none did.  </li>
            <li>It is backed by a money back guarantee...which I am sure few people ever send it back.</li>
            <li>I probably only use this product once a week because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I notice more that my skin looks sallow and tired and that I just don&#x27;t have that youthful appearance anymore.</li>
            <li>I was in desperate need of a good serum</li>
            <li>and I have to screw the top back on, but no matter how tight it keeps loosening, perhaps I just received a slightly defective pump bottle?</li>
            <li>and I noticed that if I use it more than once a week my face begins to break out because it&#x27;s a little too harsh for me.</li>
            <li>Burns aa little at first</li>
            <li>My only complaint with this serum has to do with the packaging, after a couple pumps the top keeps coming loose from the rest of the bottle</li>
            <li>This made my face very tight and dry at first, but after researching I see this is normal.</li>
            <li>I have used other retinol products and i highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I have noticed I have a few less fine lines around my mouth</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Makes your skin feel nice</li>
            <li> It is so nice to have it in one formula.</li>
            <li> OK but not as good as my doctor prescribed retinol.</li>
            <li> smells nice, isn&#x27;t oily, makes my face feels rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my face, but don&#x27;t notice any benefits</li>
            <li> she says that it is a great product and asked me where she could get more... :)</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy this is my first experience!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s amazing I&#x27;ll update :)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no issues or irritation with this product which is great!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and packaged nicely!</li>
            <li> My face feels very smooth after using this product.  </li>
            <li> What I have found with this product is that it has a nice consistency and goes on easily, absorbs into the skin and does not feel tacky or greasy.</li>
            <li> Good price, delivered quick and it&#x27;s smoothing out my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Just got it, really nice and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The Bellafab retinol wrinkle reducer is truly a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I’m so much more confident to go without makeup</li>
            <li> and this does a better job on wrinkles for 1/4</li>
            <li> If you do use during the day be sure to use a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> Love this as part of my beauty treatment.</li>
            <li> I need more of this for my skin</li>
            <li> After a week of use I feel like my skin complexion is slightly more even</li>
            <li> and my face seems fuller and more hydrated taking away some of the sallow/tired look.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I found one.</li>
            <li> I love it because I can wear it under my makeup with no issues</li>
            <li> Sagging skin can be an issue for many people.</li>
            <li> I wait a minute or two and then top with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Hopefully my skin gets better.</li>
            <li> (I have a great story about giving myself a chemical burn while at South by Southwest, thanks Neutrogena).</li>
            <li> I love this gel-like consistency of this retinol.</li>
            <li> but then was ok...</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it !</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I am able to start using this just as I begin to &amp;#34;age&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Tried so many.</li>
            <li> I like this alot, I don&#x27;t know if its safe to use under your eyes</li>
            <li> Love using this at night.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. :-)</li>
            <li> I love these skin care products along with this one.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to have a better tone also</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Price wise is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t really understand how these kind of products work, but I know that this one DOES!  </li>
            <li> It works great on adult acne.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know where to start with taking care of adding skin, so with the whole retinol thing, this was as good a place to start as any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other retinol creams but this one has delivered the best results for me (again, I&#x27;m using this for scars, not wrinkles).</li>
            <li> and it’s easy to apply in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> Easy to work into my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Reduces the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it day and nite to help w breakouts and fine lines.</li>
            <li> My skin tone seems to be evening out and my fine lines are softened.</li>
            <li> i use it nightly and feel like it helps my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective Vitamin A</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to effectiveness yet - just started using but no adverse affects, and as others report it goes on light and absorbs immediately with no remaining residue.</li>
            <li> And I found my face becomes bright and soft?</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my skin is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and isn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
            <li> My smile lines around my eyes are getting just a touch more noticeable</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> So far it feels good on my skin</li>
            <li> This serum is light and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> got the product for such a great price that it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> It drastically improves the look and fit of your skin giving you a more youthful and vibrant look.</li>
            <li> I am noticing that makeup is more like a necessity and not so much something that was optional.</li>
            <li> a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Silky texture with quick absorption.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at night, the main thing that I like is that now when I put makeup on, my chin does not have as many &amp;#34;ripples&amp;#34; or grooves.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased and have ordered it several times!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I did have a bit of break out at first because it&#x27;s just so hydrating!  </li>
            <li> my face is looking younger and has a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> This is very nice - easy to apply and you can feel instant &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; - I like that this has several vitamins in it -&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
            <li> So I would take it easy with this one and start with just a few days a week if you have sensitive skin as I do and also please don&#x27;t forget retinol products make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so get a good sunscreen and use it every day!</li>
            <li> After I use the whole bottle&lt;br /&gt;I will be able to give a better and second review.</li>
            <li> I have tried out many products and this is one of my favorites, makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> This serum goes on without stickiness and it also soaks right in.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I break out easy.</li>
            <li> fair, sensitive, acne prone, oily skin and my holy grail sunscreens are all Japanese, in particular Sofina and Kao Biore, which you can find for a relatively cheap price here on Amazon or on Ebay.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My skin has more of a glow and seems a little firmer:)</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and dries on the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> This one is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Worked well, just be sure to wear sunscreen the next day.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> It makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! !</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> After two weeks I&#x27;m seeing a difference, my skin seems more refined and smooth and the lines do seem to be less.  </li>
            <li> I must say I think that it’s the reason why my skin has stayed pretty much wrinkle free so far in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel soft and smooth, absorbs quickly, i use this under my eyes as well to help try to reduce the bags under my eyes, i love the way it makes my skin have a slight glow to it as well!</li>
            <li> This shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li> Love this product more than I expected will definitely order again</li>
            <li> This serum has really helped my complexion look much smoother,definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it where I get the most wrinkles and on my chin where my skin has started to loose elasticity.</li>
            <li> and she really loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture of this retinol serum</li>
            <li> This serum has really helped my complexion look much smoother.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve the quality of their skin!</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> She said she doesn&#x27;t really notice a difference in her skin.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Really works, honestly, it really does.</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth after applying in my face, and even next morning still feel that way.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face smooth and I have noticed the improvement of my overall face.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> The bright side is that this serum has made my skin feel young and removed wrinkles in the past two months i&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> Find this effective, but it does;t last too long compared to the Vitamin C  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that this does anything even with a full month of daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  </li>
            <li> My main areas of concern are in between my brows and around my eyes, but I&#x27;ve felt no stinging or irritation after massaging this around my eyes.</li>
            <li> After trying tons of the skincare creams and lotions on the market, most of which were extremely expensive, I can honestly say that the retinol has made the most difference in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li> In just a few days of using this retinol ,i noticed smoother skin, a total improvement in my skin tone, smaller pores and the best part is that i have some brown sun spots that are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It may be my overall happiness with this product coloring my impression, but I really do feel that my lines are less pronounced and now barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this Retinol.</li>
            <li> I do not feel like my skin is getting flaky or dried out and there does seem to be a plumping effect which give the impression of being more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just now starting to get grumpy about my smile lines and self conscious about my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> It really did help my regular routine so much.</li>
            <li> So far I think I see  difference already!</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this formula; it contains 2.5% Retinol + 11% Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Organic Green Tea + Organic Aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil!</li>
            <li> I dont have wrinkles, i am just 34 years old, but it never late to star takimg care of your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my twenties, but I have a busy lifestyle that really wears on my under-eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 with sensitive combination skin and still get break outs.  </li>
            <li> Made skin luminous and filled in the cracks in a few weeks</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I really saw a difference after using this product for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Fewer wrinkles, soft glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I did not break out after using it, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but yes, us old people have wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> but like it so far.</li>
            <li> I could immediately feel the potency of the active ingredients because it caused some mild stinging and reddening of my skin after application.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very light gel that is neither too runny or too thick, so it&#x27;s very easy to apply a thin even layer to the skin.</li>
            <li> This by far has been my favorite serum out of the past 5 that I tried!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to test out the wrinkle effects, but it makes my skin feel super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Right now for winter I use this during the day and night but in the summer I may alternate only using this at night because of the sun.</li>
            <li> but somehow it wasn&#x27;t even half full. ..</li>
            <li> My daughter told me the other day that I have a chin wrinkle when I smile.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products in the past that all claim to work, but none did.  </li>
            <li> It is backed by a money back guarantee...which I am sure few people ever send it back.</li>
            <li> I probably only use this product once a week because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I notice more that my skin looks sallow and tired and that I just don&#x27;t have that youthful appearance anymore.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a good serum</li>
            <li> and I have to screw the top back on, but no matter how tight it keeps loosening, perhaps I just received a slightly defective pump bottle?</li>
            <li> and I noticed that if I use it more than once a week my face begins to break out because it&#x27;s a little too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> Burns aa little at first</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this serum has to do with the packaging, after a couple pumps the top keeps coming loose from the rest of the bottle</li>
            <li> This made my face very tight and dry at first, but after researching I see this is normal.</li>
            <li> I have used other retinol products and i highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I have noticed I have a few less fine lines around my mouth</li>
            <li> Fixed middle aged woman&#x27;s problem!!</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see any differences.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see a change yet.</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had for long</li>
            <li> As with new skin products I usually try on my hands and wrists.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find something that I don&#x27;t have a bad reaction to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin - other &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; serums that I have purchased have left my skin raw and puffy</li>
            <li> , let it dry and then use your night time moisturizer -</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this, especially if you&#x27;ve been scared off by harsh products in the past.</li>
            <li> My face seems to be tighter and my skin is not as loose.</li>
            <li> I know I have some around my neck, and I&#x27;ve been using this for only a little while now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Works well after only a few days</li>
            <li> But not strong enough to make you gag.</li>
            <li> but can leave skin a little dry..</li>
            <li> This makes me worry that the serum&#x27;s active ingredients may degrade due to repeated exposure to the air.</li>
            <li> So many products that I have used in the past smell so bad that I would rather not put it on my face.</li>
            <li> so I get dark circles under my eyes and sometimes get puffy.</li>
            <li> I previously had been using Ole Henriksen products which are also gel like</li>
            <li> Less lines, Smoother Face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum on my face for three weeks now, with none of the typical side effects I&#x27;ve encountered before.</li>
            <li> Just started using it but have noticed slight difference.</li>
            <li> is much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I am seeing a little bit of a difference, looking forward to seeing how the results progress as days/weeks go by</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of smell though.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use the product for a few weeks before reviewing.</li>
            <li> Ive been using mine for a few days now and my skin quality/tightness has already started improving.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, no deal on product</li>
            <li> In just a few days, I have noticed a difference in my Face.</li>
            <li> Will update review within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I can already see a difference after a few days.</li>
            <li> So I adjusted and use very little in those areas</li>
            <li> Understandably, I&#x27;ve become wary of such products.</li>
            <li> This product makes me look MUCH less tired.</li>
            <li> and my family hardly recognizes me anymore.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working slowly.</li>
            <li> All of which I have used in the past separately!</li>
            <li> I had acne on the chin when I was younger, so that combined with sagging skin leaves a rippled ugly layer behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54, and its sad to admit</li>
            <li> Bought this at a crazy discounted price.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Will Help To Eliminate Those Nasty Under The Eye Bags</li>
            <li> this item is very bad for your eyes.dont buy!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for my nighttime regime. Gentle and effective Vitamin A</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she really loves it. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to effectiveness yet - just started using but no adverse affects, and as others report it goes on light and absorbs immediately with no remaining residue. If it&#x27;s amazing I&#x27;ll update :)</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>

So I would take it easy with this one and start with just a few days a week if you have sensitive skin as I do and also please don&#x27;t forget retinol products make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so get a good sunscreen and use it every day!

This makes me worry that the serum&#x27;s active ingredients may degrade due to repeated exposure to the air. If the bottle didn&#x27;t have this issue I would rate this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I see a difference already!  It seemed like the wrinkles are leveling out - I don&#x27;t really understand how these kind of products work, but I know that this one DOES!  I have tried so many different products in the past that all claim to work, but none did.  This one is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Great product! Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This serum has really helped my complexion look much smoother. I have made this part of my nighttime regime</li>
            <li> Just use 3 days and i can feel my face is softer and more touchable !</li>
            <li> The Bellafab retinol wrinkle reducer is truly a fabulous product! After trying tons of the skincare creams and lotions on the market, most of which were extremely expensive, I can honestly say that the retinol has made the most difference in the least amount of time. It’s the best product available for the cost without compromising the quality, and the results are remarkable! I’m so much more confident to go without makeup and it’s easy to apply in the morning and at night. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve the quality of their skin!</li>
            <li> I know there were several in the reviews that were paid, I am not.  I must say I am happy with the results on this product.  After two weeks I&#x27;m seeing a difference, my skin seems more refined and smooth and the lines do seem to be less.  I&#x27;m over 50 with sensitive combination skin and still get break outs.  I previously had been using Ole Henriksen products which are also gel like and this does a better job on wrinkles for 1/4 the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I did have a bit of break out at first because it&#x27;s just so hydrating!  So I adjusted and use very little in those areas but hey, those aren&#x27;t the wrinkle areas anyway!  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> This product might work for some people, but the only difference I saw it was drier skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot recognize my self!!&lt;br /&gt;everyone compliments me that i look way younger then i did before using this!&lt;br /&gt;I heard good things about this product, and now i can prove it my self!&lt;br /&gt;Great, easy to use and safe&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Very smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I have only been using it for a week, but I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> Great product - works well</li>
            <li> Good but can leave skin a little dry..</li>
            <li> My mother loves this! She calls it her youth fountain!</li>
            <li> As with new skin products I usually try on my hands and wrists. So far I think I see  difference already!</li>
            <li> I have already noticed a difference in my skin using this Bellafab retintol! Lines are diminishing! I love it!</li>
            <li> Made skin luminous and filled in the cracks in a few weeks</li>
            <li> feels great on the skin. Have not used it long enough to see any differences. Will update review.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. Reduces the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Fixed middle aged woman&#x27;s problem!!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel nice</li>
            <li> So far I really like this Retinol. I have been using Retinol ever since my teenage Acne days! I must say I think that it’s the reason why my skin has stayed pretty much wrinkle free so far in my 30&#x27;s. I love the ingredients in this formula; it contains 2.5% Retinol + 11% Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Organic Green Tea + Organic Aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil! All of which I have used in the past separately! It is so nice to have it in one formula. Right now for winter I use this during the day and night but in the summer I may alternate only using this at night because of the sun. If you do use during the day be sure to use a sunscreen. I have sensitive skin and have had no issues or irritation with this product which is great! Also I have acne prone skin and this has not caused me to break out in any way either! I would recommend to anyone looking to add anti-aging ingredients to their skincare routine. Work well under makeup too ( I use it instead of a makeup printer).</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! It works great on adult acne.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Actually think I am seeing results</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel soft and smooth, absorbs quickly, i use this under my eyes as well to help try to reduce the bags under my eyes, i love the way it makes my skin have a slight glow to it as well!</li>
            <li> Great price and almost immediate results seen around the eyes!</li>
            <li> Great product and will continue to use for more results.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use the product for a few weeks before reviewing. I have noticed I have a few less fine lines around my mouth but my brow creases haven&#x27;t improved. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks. Hopefully it will improve with time</li>
            <li> This shipped pretty fast I love the product but somehow it wasn&#x27;t even half full. ..</li>
            <li> Love this as part of my beauty treatment.</li>
            <li> makes me break out everytime I use it!</li>
            <li> Have been so impressed with this serum I will be ordering more. I use it at night before bed, and have noticed, in the 3 weeks since I began using, fresher, firmer skin, especially around my forehead where I have expression lines from years of stressful work. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I need more of this for my skin it&#x27;s helping repair and restore my skin</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister as a gift. She said she doesn&#x27;t really notice a difference in her skin. She said she will continue to use it maybe it takes longer to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> If you are like me you may have not really bothered with skin care regimes and taking care of your skin while you were young. Now that I am in my 30&#x27;s I am noticing that makeup is more like a necessity and not so much something that was optional. I notice more that my skin looks sallow and tired and that I just don&#x27;t have that youthful appearance anymore. What I have found with this product is that it has a nice consistency and goes on easily, absorbs into the skin and does not feel tacky or greasy. After a week of use I feel like my skin complexion is slightly more even and my face seems fuller and more hydrated taking away some of the sallow/tired look. I do not feel like my skin is getting flaky or dried out and there does seem to be a plumping effect which give the impression of being more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If results continue I can foresee myself ordering again.</li>
            <li> this product is GREAT! Ive been using mine for a few days now and my skin quality/tightness has already started improving.</li>
            <li> I use it for three days. And I found my face becomes bright and soft? I&#x27;ll keep use !</li>
            <li> This is my savior product!! I was in desperate need of a good serum and I am so glad I found one. I love it because I can wear it under my makeup with no issues and it&#x27;s weightless. Just remember to wear your sunscreen if you are going to be outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now. My skin is very sensitive and I break out easy. It&#x27;s hard to find something that I don&#x27;t have a bad reaction to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this. I do see a difference in my skin. It looks healthier. Of course I was expecting miracles... but, oh well. My finer lines have smoothed out. I&#x27;ll keep buying. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This by far has been my favorite serum out of the past 5 that I tried! It is very lightweight and dries on the skin quickly. I noticed a difference in my skin in only 1 week after trying it. My skin has more of a glow and seems a little firmer:)</li>
            <li> I really saw a difference after using this product for several weeks.  Am very pleased and have ordered it several times!</li>
            <li> my skin feels so good when I use it</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it day and nite to help w breakouts and fine lines. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no adverse reaction to it</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see a difference at all</li>
            <li> Sagging skin can be an issue for many people. I know I have some around my neck, and I&#x27;ve been using this for only a little while now and I&#x27;m already noticing improvement in the &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; area. It drastically improves the look and fit of your skin giving you a more youthful and vibrant look.</li>
            <li> It works very well. I would use it again</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that this does anything even with a full month of daily use.</li>
            <li> Worked well, just be sure to wear sunscreen the next day.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on without stickiness and it also soaks right in. I wait a minute or two and then top with my moisturizer. When I wake up in the morning my skin is silky smooth. My skin tone seems to be evening out and my fine lines are softened. Overall, I love this and I will order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  You need to continue using for best results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have allergies so I get dark circles under my eyes and sometimes get puffy. I have only had this product for a short time but I can already see a difference! Easy to work into my skin care regimen. Quality product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, no deal on product so I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Noticeable sifter skin after use. Will Help To Eliminate Those Nasty Under The Eye Bags</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome. I use it every niget and have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. I have used other retinol products and i highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> After using this for 2 weeks I have to say i look younger! great product</li>
            <li> This serum feels wonderful and has a nice light scent. So many products that I have used in the past smell so bad that I would rather not put it on my face. This is pleasant. I will update as I see results.</li>
            <li> In just a few days, I have noticed a difference in my Face. Less lines, Smoother Face.  Will Continue using on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time. It was manufactured 1/14 and has a shelf life of 2 years, so I do have another year. Also, the pump doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I got the product for such a great price that it&#x27;s still worth it. Hopefully my skin gets better.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin - other &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; serums that I have purchased have left my skin raw and puffy (I have a great story about giving myself a chemical burn while at South by Southwest, thanks Neutrogena). Understandably, I&#x27;ve become wary of such products. I have been using this serum on my face for three weeks now, with none of the typical side effects I&#x27;ve encountered before. My main areas of concern are in between my brows and around my eyes, but I&#x27;ve felt no stinging or irritation after massaging this around my eyes. This serum is light and clean feeling. Once I apply this, it absorbs well into my skin without leaving a residue on my hands.There&#x27;s virtually no odor, either, so no worries about going to bed smelling like a chemical factory.&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I&#x27;m 28. I&#x27;m just now starting to get grumpy about my smile lines and self conscious about my crow&#x27;s feet. It may be my overall happiness with this product coloring my impression, but I really do feel that my lines are less pronounced and now barely noticeable. I would highly recommend this, especially if you&#x27;ve been scared off by harsh products in the past.</li>
            <li> Great product, my skin is smoother after just a week</li>
            <li> Have been using this on my face every night and can feel the difference. Great product!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see a change yet.</li>
            <li> This made my face very tight and dry at first, but after researching I see this is normal. Then one morning BAM!! Fewer wrinkles, soft glowing skin. I swear I look 5 years younger! Woo hoo!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like a month from now!! I will keep you updated!!</li>
            <li> Works well after only a few days</li>
            <li> I love this gel-like consistency of this retinol. I&#x27;ve actually been using this on some scars on my thighs and face and they have noticeably reduced in redness. I&#x27;ve used other retinol creams but this one has delivered the best results for me (again, I&#x27;m using this for scars, not wrinkles). Great price, too.</li>
            <li> Just started using it but have noticed slight difference. Silky texture with quick absorption. Will update review within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Burns aa little at first but then was ok...I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> OK but not as good as my doctor prescribed retinol.</li>
            <li> I probably only use this product once a week because I have very sensitive skin and I noticed that if I use it more than once a week my face begins to break out because it&#x27;s a little too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> In just a few days of using this retinol ,i noticed smoother skin, a total improvement in my skin tone, smaller pores and the best part is that i have some brown sun spots that are starting to fade. I am proud to say that my search is over. I highly recommend this product. You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It makes my face so soft and smooth. I can already see a difference after a few days. My face seems to be tighter and my skin is not as loose. Highly recommended! !</li>
            <li> Great product!  So far it feels good on my skin and I hope to see some amazing results soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and have not noticed a difference in my skin.  Will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Really works, honestly, it really does. I&#x27;m only in my twenties, but I have a busy lifestyle that really wears on my under-eyes. This product makes me look MUCH less tired. It&#x27;s smooth and isn&#x27;t oily at all. I struggle with ance and this product hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth after applying in my face, and even next morning still feel that way. I would keep ordering this item !</li>
            <li> Very good product, i got it today. I dont have wrinkles, i am just 34 years old, but it never late to star takimg care of your skin.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it, her skin looks younger already.</li>
            <li> This is very nice - easy to apply and you can feel instant &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; - I like that this has several vitamins in it -&lt;br /&gt;Apply, let it dry and then use your night time moisturizer -</li>
            <li> Love it!  Good price, delivered quick and it&#x27;s smoothing out my wrinkles.  What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> I like many others who have tried this product are impressed with the ingredients and the results. I have been using it where I get the most wrinkles and on my chin where my skin has started to loose elasticity. I had acne on the chin when I was younger, so that combined with sagging skin leaves a rippled ugly layer behind. I have been using this at night, the main thing that I like is that now when I put makeup on, my chin does not have as many &amp;#34;ripples&amp;#34; or grooves. It seems to be plumping that area or allowing it to fill itself. It is backed by a money back guarantee...which I am sure few people ever send it back.</li>
            <li> Just got it, really nice and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it ! I have ALWAYS heard that Retinol is the only thing that helps wrinkles. I am SO glad I am able to start using this just as I begin to &amp;#34;age&amp;#34;. My smile lines around my eyes are getting just a touch more noticeable and I can&#x27;t wait to diminish them! Arrived quickly and packaged nicely!</li>
            <li> perfect for skin repair.</li>
            <li> Love this product more than I expected will definitely order again</li>
            <li> My daughter told me the other day that I have a chin wrinkle when I smile.  I have been using this product for 5 days now and my chin wrinkle is gone as well as in between my brows wrinkle and my crows feet is much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Works well with hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> Tried so many. This is honestly one of the very best retinol I have. Lavish, luxurious and glowing skin</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to test out the wrinkle effects, but it makes my skin feel super soft and silky. I did not break out after using it, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This serum has really helped my complexion look much smoother,definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! Use this every morning after I was my face</li>
            <li> I already wrote a brief review. This product seems to be working slowly. After I use the whole bottle&lt;br /&gt;I will be able to give a better and second review. I have used 2 different Bellafab products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I still have plenty of all 3 products and use them off &amp; on. I like the quality and feel of the products, along&lt;br /&gt;with a full bottle. Price wise is very reasonable. Thank you Bellafab. VRLT.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, will buy it again</li>
            <li> Leaves my face smooth and I have noticed the improvement of my overall face.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I like this alot, I don&#x27;t know if its safe to use under your eyes but I do, trying to eliminate those under eye bags. But this is a really good product  been using it about twice a day, once in the morning and once at night and I feel like I am seeing a little bit of a difference, looking forward to seeing how the results progress as days/weeks go by</li>
            <li> Love using this at night. I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> people noticed a difference in me by the 3rd week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54, and its sad to admit but yes, us old people have wrinkles. The bright side is that this serum has made my skin feel young and removed wrinkles in the past two months i&#x27;ve been using it and my family hardly recognizes me anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. :-) my face is looking younger and has a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> I love these skin care products along with this one. Bellafab did it again.</li>
            <li> smells nice, isn&#x27;t oily, makes my face feels rejuvenated. i use it nightly and feel like it helps my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything for my skin!</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my face, but don&#x27;t notice any benefits</li>
            <li> was a present for my mother...she says that it is a great product and asked me where she could get more... :)</li>
            <li> I like it so far. It has a little bit of smell though. But not strong enough to make you gag.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for Retinol. I have tried out many products and this is one of my favorites, makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had for long but like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. I have noticed my akin becomes smoother, wrinkle line become lighter and my face feel tightened. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! The seller was awesome! Will purchase again! It leaves my skin feeling fabulous and have seen a great wrinkle reduction!</li>
            <li> It really works! Bought this at a crazy discounted price. I didn&#x27;t know where to start with taking care of adding skin, so with the whole retinol thing, this was as good a place to start as any. I&#x27;m so happy this is my first experience! I don&#x27;t put it on every night, because I forget. But, when I do put it on I can see such a difference when I wake up. It really did help my regular routine so much. Thank you for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for great skin care products that are affordable and this is a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> My face feels very smooth after using this product.  My skin seems to have a better tone also</li>
            <li> After using 1 bottle I have not noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> this item is very bad for your eyes.dont buy!</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough.  Feels smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> Find this effective, but it does;t last too long compared to the Vitamin C  Would recommend this product to help with aging.</li>
            <li> Been using for several months now and I&#x27;m pleased with the results. Skin feels firmer and some noticeable improvement in over all tone.</li>
