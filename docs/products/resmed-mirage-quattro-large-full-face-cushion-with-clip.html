            <li>Amazing good fit very pleased</li>

            <li>Arrived fast and works great.</li>

            <li>So glad it turned out well for him.</li>
            <li>(Like most)</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>Thank You  ( OUTSTANDING VALUE )</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing many more of these.</li>
            <li>My Insurance people want more $ even with the deductible??????</li>
            <li>I got TWO more mediums.  </li>
            <li>Pleased</li>
            <li>and there is nothing more to add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found the price very reasonable, the packaging and quality just as good and in the two months I&#x27;ve used them</li>
            <li>brand new in package,,,, great price</li>
            <li>Fits perfect and lots cheap than ordering for medical supply company!!!!</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li>This is so much cheaper and works great, since it is the cushion that wears out so quickly.</li>
            <li>For CPAP users, this is the most important and comfortable part of the CPAP mask.  </li>
            <li>This part works great as long as you keep it clean for a good seal when full volocity  of air is in affect.</li>
            <li>this is probably one of the best face masks you can buy - others are the same or close - this was at a reasonable price - for the price don&#x27;t even consider the robber baron DME&#x27;s (Durable Home Equipment suppliers) that rip you off at increased price rates I have seen from 100 to 200% more.  </li>
            <li>Good for refurbishing a mask instead of spending a fortune on a new one.</li>
            <li>Does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>This cushion was such a great price I purchased two.</li>
            <li>It was just what I ordered it fit my mask.</li>
            <li>Have been using Resmed products for almost 4 years now and so far it has been a good relationship for me.  </li>
            <li>original equipment works well</li>
            <li>Replaces my original Quattro face cushion.  </li>
            <li>Exact replacement from ResMed, as expected, priced well and the quality is very good.  </li>
            <li>but it is true.</li>
            <li>Deliver was processed quickly and I had it in no time.</li>
            <li>It sure beats paying full price for a brand new mask.  </li>
            <li>This is a factory cushion that was easy to install and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wasted money on other masks but this one seems to be the best and most comfortable for me.</li>
            <li>actually better than my old cushion.</li>
            <li>I like this model better than others and this order was to renew the full face cushion and restore the needed tight fit of the mask on the face.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what was advertised.  </li>
            <li>Is exactly the same as one that I was charged 4X more for.</li>
            <li>The products were a direct fit replacement for the originals.  </li>
            <li>First time purchase.</li>
            <li>Exact replica to the parts that came with my CPAP machine.</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted without all the hassle</li>
            <li>all the products they make are real winners and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Shipment arrived in a timely manner and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It creates a good seal around the facial area and allows lots of oxygen to reach my nose for proper nighttime breathing.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I pay twice as much for from my doctor&#x27;s recommended provider.</li>
            <li>The only portion of the mask that needs replacing regularly for me is the cushion and this is a good quality and reasonably priced replacement.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the large....</li>
            <li>I contacted the dealer to tell them the problem and instead of sending me a large replacement.....</li>
            <li>Thanks NIMS......</li>
            <li>It was also sealed in plastic as if it had came straight from the factory.</li>
            <li>Great price for product local medical supply store wanted 85$ for the same product.</li>
            <li>my ResMed S9 and this mask is much more flimsy and doesn&#x27;t seal as well as the last one that is over 6 months old and well used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OEM replacement; quality same as original.</li>
            <li>This fits perfectly, was simply to attach and should last at least 3-4 months before it needs to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I have always had full mask replacements through our medical supplier.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like my mask is brand new again!</li>
            <li>This just makes sense, my insurance would buy a whole new set-up bu not the replacement cushion -</li>
            <li>This is the real deal replacement and works like new.</li>
            <li>Although the new cushion and clip are a tad bit bigger than my old one, i was able to use my old clip and make it work.</li>
            <li>Thank you, because this particular part... was a difference of over $130.00 cheaper for him.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as sturdy as the original mask.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this cushion and renew my face mask for much less than buying a new mask.  </li>
            <li>so I could not afford to buy a new one I will keep buying my parts for my ResMed machine here</li>
            <li>Arrived brand new in factory packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying my replaceable CPAP supplies from Amazon vendors in the future and highly recommend this alternative to buying from the original vendor.</li>
            <li>getting enough sleep everyday is very important to me.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than if I obtained it locally.  </li>
            <li>a working professional</li>
            <li>replaced old seal on sleep mask.  </li>
            <li>my old one was 3 years old</li>
            <li>did get it faster than expected and the price was right there with all the others I&#x27;ve bought, so that is why I am giving it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As soon as i placed my order, i sent No Insurance Medical Suplies an e-mail asking them to please send this new cushion to me as soon as posible because my old cushion had ripped and was unusable causing sleepless nights.</li>
            <li>I took one star off the review because the plastic clip has a bottom notch that does not quite fit correctly and leaves a small gap, leading to air leaking and causing my CPAP to frantically try to inflate me.  </li>
            <li>I noticed how much these companies were charging for his supplies and started looking for other options to help save him some money!</li>

            <li> I noticed how much these companies were charging for his supplies and started looking for other options to help save him some money!</li>
            <li> It took me under 10 seconds to remove the clip from my previous cushion and put it on the new one.</li>
            <li> My mask had several years of use and due to the daily usage I was experiencing massive air leaks all around my mask.</li>
            <li> They recommend changing masks, seals, &amp; hoses a regular basis to keep infections down.</li>
            <li> We have finally learned to change the CPAP cushions often - much less chafing for his face.  </li>
            <li> My CPAP provider will only replace the entire assembly at ridiculous prices (they assume they are gouging an insurance company and not an individual).  </li>
            <li> does work, but I have to wear the mask tighter than all the other masks I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased these type of supplies from my local CPAP vendor (at 2-3 times the cost of what I payed here!).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a fake but the real thing.</li>
            <li> These places should be burned down.  </li>
            <li> Hope they keep the price down.</li>
            <li> Got it here for about 70% less.</li>
            <li> It seals well and has few leaks.</li>
            <li> the co-pay an deductable alone were well over double the cost, not to mention that charging up stupid and excessive costs to insurance just raises all our premiums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a hundred different combinations, including just removing the forehead cushion, to make me not so ugly in the morning.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the worst health insurance</li>
            <li> Expensive piece but needed it.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with the mask itself, just the cushion in the mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is wrong size and</li>
            <li> Face mask material thinner, softer and horrible quality compared to factory product!!!</li>

            <li> Delivered in a timely manner.  Price was MUCH better than I&#x27;ve found anywhere else.  This fits perfectly, was simply to attach and should last at least 3-4 months before it needs to be replaced.  Maybe longer.</li>
            <li> I look around for a replacement for my C pap and found this one it works great with my system and it came in fast.</li>
            <li> Great replacement just like the original one</li>
            <li> Expensive piece but needed it.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what was advertised.  Arrived fast and works great.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect and lots cheap than ordering for medical supply company!!!!</li>
            <li> This part works great as long as you keep it clean for a good seal when full volocity  of air is in affect.</li>
            <li> I have purchased over 30 of these over the years since I&#x27;ve had my ResMed S9 and this mask is much more flimsy and doesn&#x27;t seal as well as the last one that is over 6 months old and well used.&lt;br /&gt;It does work, but I have to wear the mask tighter than all the other masks I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;I did get it faster than expected and the price was right there with all the others I&#x27;ve bought, so that is why I am giving it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I will find another provider when I need the next one.</li>
            <li> Started to order one through our insurance provider, Kaiser Permenente. Because of the deductable it was going to cost over $100 after shipping. Got it here for about 70% less. Deliver was processed quickly and I had it in no time. I will be getting all my CPAP supplies here from now on.</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found - much cheaper than if I obtained it locally.  Is exactly the same as one that I was charged 4X more for.</li>
            <li> This cushion was such a great price I purchased two. I could not believe the price for brand name.....but it is true. Awesome buy, great service and wonderful nights sleep. Thank You and Kuddos to you. I will shop here again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Husband is very happy!</li>
            <li> original equipment works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I found this on amazon. My mask had several years of use and due to the daily usage I was experiencing massive air leaks all around my mask. There was nothing wrong with the mask itself, just the cushion in the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without having to replace the entire mask I was just able to pop this cushion and clip in and it&#x27;s like my mask is brand new again! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CPAP for some time now. Thanks to the worst health insurance a working professional I have to buy everything out of pocket. I&#x27;ve wasted money on other masks but this one seems to be the best and most comfortable for me. I am about to buy another Mirage Quattro face cushion. This mask is quiet so my wife sleeps. That allows me to sleep too. Each their own but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, will order again</li>
            <li> Exact replacement from ResMed, as expected, priced well and the quality is very good.  I travel extensively, so I like to have an extra wth me.</li>
            <li> im a truck driver, so getting enough sleep everyday is very important to me. As soon as i placed my order, i sent No Insurance Medical Suplies an e-mail asking them to please send this new cushion to me as soon as posible because my old cushion had ripped and was unusable causing sleepless nights. they responded to me imedietly telling me they would send it out that day. I received my order a couple of days earlier than the estimated arrival date. Although the new cushion and clip are a tad bit bigger than my old one, i was able to use my old clip and make it work. Fits my face like a glove. actually better than my old cushion. Sleeping through the night again. Will be using them for more supplies. Thanks NIMS......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave from Hughson, Cali</li>
            <li> I have a friend who is chanllenged and he comes to me to pay his bills and such. I noticed how much these companies were charging for his supplies and started looking for other options to help save him some money! Thank you, because this particular part... was a difference of over $130.00 cheaper for him. For people on low income... that is A LOT of money. So glad it turned out well for him.</li>
            <li> I heartily recommend Sleep Apnea solutions. Excellent service and a value price point. The resmed mask is an excellent choice as well, but figure on replacing the cushion on a three month basis. (Like most)</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased these type of supplies from my local CPAP vendor (at 2-3 times the cost of what I payed here!).  I found the price very reasonable, the packaging and quality just as good and in the two months I&#x27;ve used them I&#x27;ve had no issues whatsoever.  The products were a direct fit replacement for the originals.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying my replaceable CPAP supplies from Amazon vendors in the future and highly recommend this alternative to buying from the original vendor.</li>
            <li> This is a factory cushion that was easy to install and works very well.  It seals well and has few leaks.</li>
            <li> First time purchase. Extremely pleased. It sure beats paying full price for a brand new mask.  Would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> This was a very good deal. I would have paid double or triple what I paid for it with Amazon. It was also sealed in plastic as if it had came straight from the factory. Thank You  ( OUTSTANDING VALUE )</li>
            <li> Exact replica to the parts that came with my CPAP machine. I&#x27;ll be purchasing many more of these.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I pay twice as much for from my doctor&#x27;s recommended provider. This is a great source of reoccuring equipment for those of us using CPAP machines.</li>
            <li> OEM replacement; quality same as original.</li>
            <li> Great price for product local medical supply store wanted 85$ for the same product. Legit brand fits mask perfectly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have always had full mask replacements through our medical supplier. This is so much cheaper and works great, since it is the cushion that wears out so quickly. I think I can triple the time between actual mask replacements using this cushion. This has been a great great product.</li>
            <li> Best price around.  My Insurance people want more $ even with the deductible??????</li>
            <li> We have finally learned to change the CPAP cushions often - much less chafing for his face.  Delivery and product always great!</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine. Only downside to this mask/cushion is the imprint on the forehead. I&#x27;ve tried a hundred different combinations, including just removing the forehead cushion, to make me not so ugly in the morning. With all that, still the best system I&#x27;ve found for a great seal most of the night.</li>
            <li> replaced old seal on sleep mask.  They recommend changing masks, seals, &amp; hoses a regular basis to keep infections down.</li>
            <li> this is probably one of the best face masks you can buy - others are the same or close - this was at a reasonable price - for the price don&#x27;t even consider the robber baron DME&#x27;s (Durable Home Equipment suppliers) that rip you off at increased price rates I have seen from 100 to 200% more.  Prime example of why Healthcare is so fubar.  These places should be burned down.  And don&#x27;t play the internet versus bricks and mortar card - that&#x27;s baloney.  I am a financial exec from both worlds.</li>
            <li> brand new in package,,,, great price</li>
            <li> Replaces my original Quattro face cushion.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product replacement.</li>
            <li> It is wrong size and now im out 35 bucks</li>
            <li> I ordered the large....I got the medium.  I contacted the dealer to tell them the problem and instead of sending me a large replacement.....I got TWO more mediums.  In the process of returning them now.  No hope of seeing my money returned.  Please don&#x27;t use this dealer.</li>
            <li> These are perfect factory replacements.  I&#x27;m glad to have found this source through Amazon, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This just makes sense, my insurance would buy a whole new set-up bu not the replacement cushion - the co-pay an deductable alone were well over double the cost, not to mention that charging up stupid and excessive costs to insurance just raises all our premiums.</li>
            <li> Great value, great price. A life saver for someone like me who has no insurance and my cpap is my lifeline. Hope they keep the price down. Pleased</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a replacement part and there is nothing more to add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fake but the real thing.</li>
            <li> It will be great to have extras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sleep apnea patient using CPAP therapy and this mask is my choice for use with my machine.  I like this model better than others and this order was to renew the full face cushion and restore the needed tight fit of the mask on the face.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted without all the hassle</li>
            <li> fits great..best price iv&#x27;e found</li>
            <li> This is the real deal replacement and works like new. Good for refurbishing a mask instead of spending a fortune on a new one.</li>
            <li> Good price and great quality!</li>
            <li> It was just what I ordered it fit my mask. my old one was 3 years old and I was very happy to get the new one at a good price. the place where I got my machine was charging the price of 3 so I could not afford to buy a new one I will keep buying my parts for my ResMed machine here were I can afford them. thank you</li>
            <li> For my situation, a great full face mask. I get about six months out of each one, rotating back and forth between two of these.</li>
            <li> For CPAP users, this is the most important and comfortable part of the CPAP mask.  It creates a good seal around the facial area and allows lots of oxygen to reach my nose for proper nighttime breathing.  Have been using Resmed products for almost 4 years now and so far it has been a good relationship for me.  Seems like all the products they make are real winners and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> perfect fit, exactly like the original that came with the mask.</li>
            <li> Mask fits and works just like they should</li>
            <li> Not nearly as sturdy as the original mask.</li>
            <li> Best full face cushion on the market</li>
            <li> My CPAP provider will only replace the entire assembly at ridiculous prices (they assume they are gouging an insurance company and not an individual).  The only portion of the mask that needs replacing regularly for me is the cushion and this is a good quality and reasonably priced replacement.  I took one star off the review because the plastic clip has a bottom notch that does not quite fit correctly and leaves a small gap, leading to air leaking and causing my CPAP to frantically try to inflate me.  It took me under 10 seconds to remove the clip from my previous cushion and put it on the new one.</li>
            <li> Amazing good fit very pleased</li>
            <li> Not even close to factory quality!!! Enough said!!! Face mask material thinner, softer and horrible quality compared to factory product!!!</li>
            <li> great product.  good seller</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived in a timely manner and item was exactly as described. Packaging was</li>
            <li> at a price point discounted versus buying from the local medical dist. Arrived brand new in factory packaging. I will order again when the need arises.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and worked as advertised. The product was also cheaper then the co pay for my insurance so it was win win</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this cushion and renew my face mask for much less than buying a new mask.  Perfect fit and easy to install.</li>
