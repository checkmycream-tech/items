            <li>Not feeling it is making a huge change to continue investing in it.</li>
            <li>I got free delivery on it and got it for a steal of a deal.</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser everyday and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>so your face feels refreshed and clean w/o having to scrub off 2 layers of skin.  </li>
            <li>Not to abrasive and is just right!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for four years now and it has never disappointed me, it keeps my face sterile and fresh.</li>
            <li>This stuff is truly powerful.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I use this everyday!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light grapefruity scent and little scrubbing beads</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Just want to say thanks!</li>
            <li>My skin is also really clear and blemish free.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what my skin needs.</li>
            <li>Thanks and keep making this stuffs!  </li>
            <li>First time she had tried this particular product in this line.  </li>
            <li>Notice that in the image the bottle says \\&quot;LIGNE CLARIFYL,\\&quot; mine says \\&quot;LIGNE SPECIALE.\\&quot; The container/bottle is completely different than the image on the product page, and opening it, there isn&#x27;t a pleasant \\&quot;grapefruit\\&quot; smell like the other reviews have mentioned -</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the fact that this formula is combined with a quality wash and exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your face well and has gentle exfoliation beads.</li>
            <li>I was looking for Pevonia Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser and purchased this by accident.</li>
            <li>but it really works for me</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, I won&#x27;t use anything else for my face</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for everyday use and leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean but not to dry after using it.</li>
            <li>Make my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft .</li>
            <li>I first used this product while getting a facial in a salon</li>
            <li>Only tricky part is you must use it consistently twice a day to get the maximum effect.  </li>
            <li>It only requires a small amount applied to the finger with a bit of water to create a nice sudsy lather.</li>
            <li>Although I like the consistency of the product, more of a gel than a cream with grit like my previous product, the smell is enough never purchase this product again.  </li>
            <li>skin feels soft after using...but don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.  </li>
            <li>My skin was too sensitive for this gel version.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the holy grail of scrubbing your face clean without destroying it.</li>
            <li>I went right back to my usual routine 2x day and my face is starting to clear up.  </li>

            <li> I know from previous experience when I stop using this</li>
            <li> and oh boy did my face become an uncontrollable mess.  </li>
            <li> this does what it advertises but the smell is a little weird/gross.</li>
            <li> No need for astringents or lotion astringents for left behind residue.</li>
            <li> Removes the dead skin that can create acne from build up.</li>
            <li> I have followed in the past after washing with this product a astringent type lotion.</li>
            <li> One of these bottles usually lasts me almost 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and will steer clear of future Pevonia products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do like this product...skin feels soft after using...but don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.  Not feeling it is making a huge change to continue investing in it.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome product I have ever used.  Have been using this product for over 20 years... Yes over 20 years. Gentle and great exfoliating.  Only need to use once or twice a week. Pevonia is the best facial products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 years now and it&#x27;s amazing. It has a wonderful light fruity scent that gives you that feeling as if you have left the spa. It only requires a small amount applied to the finger with a bit of water to create a nice sudsy lather. I know from previous experience when I stop using this I begin to have almost immediate flare ups of blemishes. I have followed in the past after washing with this product a astringent type lotion. I used this to challenge the product to see if it removed all of the oil and make up residue. It so happened that it removed every trace of it. No need for astringents or lotion astringents for left behind residue.I really appreciate the fact that this formula is combined with a quality wash and exfoliating beads. Not to abrasive and is just right! Removes the dead skin that can create acne from build up.</li>
            <li> Ótima compra! Produto chegou antes do prazo estimado e estou muito satisfeita com o produto! Superou minhas espectativas! Para quem tem pele oleosa, não tem igual!</li>
            <li> Great cleaner you can use every day. Make my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the holy grail of scrubbing your face clean without destroying it. It also smells good. Win.</li>
            <li> This is very nice for the face ..I used this with my clarisonic brush and it has a refreshing feel after u rinse your face .. I use the peel to this brand also and I love it</li>
            <li> I used it with my clarisonic, great for 3 times a week exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Clean smell not over powering, I like it for all in one for traveling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly powerful. Great product that washes all the oil off. After 2 weeks of bi-daily use all of my blackheads were gone and pores appeared visibly tighter. Magic!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I love it. Makes your skin feel smooth and soft. I use it every day. It lasts a long time. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using this for years,can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> Gift for daughter.  She loved the great way her skin felt after use.  First time she had tried this particular product in this line.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 3rd bottle.  There was a short period of time where I stopped using it (about 1-2 months) and began using a different face wash and oh boy did my face become an uncontrollable mess.  I went right back to my usual routine 2x day and my face is starting to clear up.  It has a nice light grapefruity scent and little scrubbing beads so your face feels refreshed and clean w/o having to scrub off 2 layers of skin.  You really do not need to use a lot - about a dime size for the entire face. It lasts me about 3 months, using it 2 times daily.  Highly recommend this product, I won&#x27;t use anything else for my face and I have gone through tons of face washes.    Also, this is my 3rd purchase from SkinDermStore (seller) and they are wonderful!  Product is shipped promptly and packaged well.  Just want to say thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product I order it all the time.</li>
            <li> Good product - when it arrived, it wasn&#x27;t in the box that goes with it - looks like it rattled around in the outer box. Also, the lid came apart the first time I opened it so receiving packages like that is kind of a bummer. I do know that it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for four years now and it has never disappointed me, it keeps my face sterile and fresh. i love the smooth effect after i use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for about 8 years now. I highly recommend it. It really cleans your face well and has gentle exfoliation beads. And it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I purchased Pevonia while on a cruise and resently ran out of my exfoliator. I thought this was the same product but after one use I determined I was sorely mistaken.  Although I like the consistency of the product, more of a gel than a cream with grit like my previous product, the smell is enough never purchase this product again.  I am very disappointed and will steer clear of future Pevonia products.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! My face feels clean but not to dry after using it. My skin is also really clear and blemish free.</li>
            <li> Not as exfoliating as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s very soft .</li>
            <li> used for years great exfiliator</li>
            <li> love it , fast ship&lt;br /&gt;trust which is very great business relationship with customers.&lt;br /&gt;buyers need to trust them  and buy it because i have great positive feel with them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last two years and I can&#x27;t be without it.  It is gentle enough for everyday use and leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.  It does a great job of clearing out blackheads.  I will keep using this product as long as I have access to it.  I have even purchased it as gifts for family and friends and they all like it as well.  I have combination skin and I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t cause dryness.  I have used it with moisturizers from other product lines but now I am switching to this product line for toners and face creams.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product wanting to give my skin more of a healthy appearance. However, this product is not what I ordered in the mail (although this order did arrive promptly). Notice that in the image the bottle says \\&quot;LIGNE CLARIFYL,\\&quot; mine says \\&quot;LIGNE SPECIALE.\\&quot; The container/bottle is completely different than the image on the product page, and opening it, there isn&#x27;t a pleasant \\&quot;grapefruit\\&quot; smell like the other reviews have mentioned - it smells soapy and non-pleasant. I am going to contact the seller in hopes that this was just a mixup, and I will try to add to this in an update.</li>
            <li> i bought this product because i LOVE the phytogel face wash and their face lotion. this does what it advertises but the smell is a little weird/gross. i&#x27;ll continue to use it given the price, but i won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> perfect. best exfoliator that already had, not dry out the skin and to wear all day if you want, my skin is much better now and thanks!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what my skin needs.</li>
            <li> I first used this product while getting a facial in a salon and they were asking $40 for the products... No thanks! It works great and its a nice gentle exfoliate. I only use a couple times a week at night.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. Works best with the Power Repair Age Correction Marine Collagen Cream (also by Pevonia).</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I use this everyday!  Pevonia has a lot of talented folks who come up with the perfect blend that suits everyone!  Thanks and keep making this stuffs!  Love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Pevonia Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser and purchased this by accident. My skin was too sensitive for this gel version.</li>
            <li> Keeps acne away with the ingredient triclosan. Follow with problemstic skin care cream.  Only tricky part is you must use it consistently twice a day to get the maximum effect.  I have never had a severe acne breakout while using this product, ever!</li>
            <li> i bought this locally in Trinidad and decided to renew it by purchasing from amazon........ i loved it before and still inlove with this product. If you are like me and have alil acne this is the way to go interms of it helps to keep the face from being to greasy and also helps like dry up the acne.... i cant explain it but it really works for me so I will be buying again next time i am in need. I got free delivery on it and got it for a steal of a deal. I will be doing research on other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser everyday and have been very happy with the results. One of these bottles usually lasts me almost 3 months.</li>
    </ol>
