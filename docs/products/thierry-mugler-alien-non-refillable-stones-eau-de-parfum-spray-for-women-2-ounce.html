            <li>I love this smell and did not want to pay $100.00 for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Just like others who mentioned: my code was cut out from the box...not sure why.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>She loves this perfume and I do love it on her.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>and I wear it most often in the evening.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and it stays on my clothes and in my hair all day.</li>
            <li>Perfect for personal use or as a gift.</li>
            <li>Many compliments Ive recv&#x27;d</li>
            <li>It was floral (on me) without being overbearing or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Its her favorite.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell</li>
            <li>This is  my favorite i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>serial number was cut out of the top of the lid</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragance.  </li>
            <li>got so many compliments</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve been asked \\&quot;What are you wearing?</li>
            <li>By all means, you can wear it whenever you wish, but to me, it is more of an evening or dress-up affair.</li>
            <li>The name of this fragrance could not be more appropriate:</li>
            <li>you like adventurous fragrances</li>
            <li>you like adventurous fragrances</li>
            <li>Meaning, that with this type of perfume they will put more oil in the perfume as opposed to the alcohol content.</li>
            <li>It is one of my top 3.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!nd intriguing form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, but it is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like amethyst and has very detailed and intriguing form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great, but only lasts about an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Some folks may disliked this fragrance but for me it was just perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of trouble finding a scent that suits me perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I found out that Ulta.com has it cheaper, free shipping as well and 3 day delivery</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s more worth buying at the department store and get 2 sprays vs. buying discount for 15 sprays.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;, NOT in this case because this is a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite perfume, every time I wear it I get so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>A unique scent with hints of flowers and herbs.  </li>
            <li>This is a unique smell</li>
            <li>Alien is *perfect* for mine!</li>
            <li>It seems to be original product and packaging</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s original or not.</li>
            <li>It is rich and earthy.</li>
            <li>Alien&#x27;s potency is perfect.</li>
            <li>and I was right!  </li>
            <li>Have even had the odd man or 2 asking what that gorgeous smell is!  </li>
            <li>I bought this because while the reviews were mixed, the majority of reviews claimed that this was the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; even though the code in the box was cut out, and the price was too good to not give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Love it and so does everyone else when they are near me!!!</li>
            <li>I was incredibly worried about the negative reviews but am pleased to say that this is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your good money on this product, get the real thing at the department store if you want it to stay with you.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>but sometimes it&#x27;s fun to just take a chance.  </li>
            <li>but, it must be more than 6 months old.</li>
            <li>Powerful and fragrant perfume.</li>
            <li>it has a distinct smell I couldn&#x27;t wait to wear it.it</li>
            <li>put a smile on her face.</li>
            <li>Other than that it smells good.</li>
            <li>I find that this has just the right seductive balance for day or evening.</li>
            <li>She has many different types of perfume, but this is by far my and her favorite.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>i only can say i love it</li>
            <li>get compliments when I wear this fragrance and as soon as I get low on this bottle I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Speed on time and was pleased overall!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more before I run out.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell, last all day.</li>
            <li>I really feel that I get my money&#x27;s worth here.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of *mostly* light fragrances such as Ralph, Clinique&#x27;s Happy, Eternity, etc., then Alien might not be for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not alien, it&#x27;s not exactly bad, but it&#x27;s just not something I would want.</li>
            <li>Strong and long lasting for sure.  </li>
            <li>I am positive this is not the real fragrance.</li>
            <li>Definitely try a sample if you can since scents vary so much based on the person wearing it but give it a chance because it really is quite special!</li>
            <li>Unique, mysterious, and very glorious scent!</li>
            <li>Alien is an exotic, rich, intricate fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very musky.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and she did really appreciate.</li>
            <li>wife&#x27;s been wearing this perfume for years, she can tell it&#x27;s not the real deal.</li>
            <li>I was very please with the perfume I like to smell very well</li>
            <li>and my husband really really loves it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend buying perfume that way</li>
            <li>I like bolder perfumes and really this one hits the spot on me.  </li>
            <li>A man who frequents my place of employment loves it so much that he bought it for his wife - however,</li>
            <li>What I recieved was the real deal.</li>
            <li>for this fact alone i will be giving this product 1 star because no customer should have to worry about whether a product they buy is real or not.</li>
            <li>She loves it and it has such a unique scent.</li>
            <li>I appreciate sunny and earthy fragrances; as my husband says, I have a perfume for nearly every outfit and season! ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>I have purchased this perfume from department stores several times, and decided to purchase through Amazon this time because of the significant discount.</li>
            <li>An amazing, and unique fragrance,  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and the scent is long lasting!</li>
            <li>For the amount that you have to use, might as well pay full price for it at department store and it will actually last all day.</li>
            <li>i surprised it really does!</li>
            <li>You wont be let down :)</li>
            <li>Based on the previous reviews, I am probably better off purchasing this at a department store.</li>
            <li>I love to wear it when I go out to a nightclub or a black dress dinner.</li>
            <li>, it was just 3 dollars more expensive than amazon, otherwise I would have order from here. :-)</li>
            <li>This perfume is a lot more expensive in Israel,so I am glad I could get it for my niece on Amazon...</li>
            <li>this seems to be a problem with a lot of amazon sellers when it comes to high end perfumes so you&#x27;re always taking a gamble when you buy one...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend no mater what your age is.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li>It is like a little piece of artwork to be displayed on your vanity or dresser top.</li>
            <li>A couple or few dabs of the scent lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Package was open and code cut out but for the price its still worth it.</li>
            <li>When dried, Alien is extremely sexy and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>That makes me wonder how this is a brand new unopened box if the code has been cut out.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I was so excited to see it at such a low price.</li>
            <li>I love Thierry Mugler&#x27;s, Alien.</li>
            <li>Smells the exact same.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>the fragrance i received does not seem watered down as it still smells very powerful</li>
            <li>Go easy on the spray - it is a heavy scent</li>
            <li>I was told that the perfume sold on Amazon is old that is why they can sell it so cheap, and perfume does sour when it is old.</li>
            <li>A bit too loud to use during the day.</li>
            <li>, is that Alien?&amp;#34; And they&#x27;re always surprised I could tell.</li>
            <li>but it will get worn quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>but wow was</li>
            <li>Though it smells nothing like Opium, I would classify it as an Opium like scent as far as heaviness and sophistication goes.</li>
            <li>Personally, my taste in scent is very eclectic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my bottle for nearly a year now</li>
            <li>i first smelled this from one of those rub off samples inside a magazine, i noticed that i smelled it all day long!</li>
            <li>I only wear fragrances that make me want to make love to myself, or catch the attention of others, and Alien hits the spot.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE Alien fan.</li>
            <li>i loved the smell and decided to order it hoping the actual product smelled like the paper sample,i was skeptical</li>
            <li>this is a heavenly scent that truly lasts untill you wash it off, ie all day and night, but be cautioned that it is strong so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I have been buying this perfume for a couple of years from a major department store.</li>
            <li>&quot; Alien is a unique fragrance that turns heads and makes a statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long a a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just received a sample on one of my magazines (Lucky magazine) and it has a small spray sample.</li>
            <li>from smelling fabulous, Alien is very long lasting.</li>
            <li>From the first spritz to the final dry down to the base notes, it has meshed beautifully with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely pleased with Alien!!!</li>

            <li> My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Just like others who mentioned: my code was cut out from the box...not sure why.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> She loves this perfume and I do love it on her.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> and I wear it most often in the evening.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and it stays on my clothes and in my hair all day.</li>
            <li> Perfect for personal use or as a gift.</li>
            <li> Many compliments Ive recv&#x27;d</li>
            <li> It was floral (on me) without being overbearing or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Its her favorite.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell</li>
            <li> This is  my favorite i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> serial number was cut out of the top of the lid</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragance.  </li>
            <li> got so many compliments</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve been asked \\&quot;What are you wearing?</li>
            <li> By all means, you can wear it whenever you wish, but to me, it is more of an evening or dress-up affair.</li>
            <li> The name of this fragrance could not be more appropriate:</li>
            <li> you like adventurous fragrances</li>
            <li> you like adventurous fragrances</li>
            <li> Meaning, that with this type of perfume they will put more oil in the perfume as opposed to the alcohol content.</li>
            <li> It is one of my top 3.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!nd intriguing form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, but it is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like amethyst and has very detailed and intriguing form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great, but only lasts about an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Some folks may disliked this fragrance but for me it was just perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble finding a scent that suits me perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I found out that Ulta.com has it cheaper, free shipping as well and 3 day delivery</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s more worth buying at the department store and get 2 sprays vs. buying discount for 15 sprays.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;, NOT in this case because this is a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume, every time I wear it I get so many compliments.  </li>
            <li> A unique scent with hints of flowers and herbs.  </li>
            <li> This is a unique smell</li>
            <li> Alien is *perfect* for mine!</li>
            <li> It seems to be original product and packaging</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s original or not.</li>
            <li> It is rich and earthy.</li>
            <li> Alien&#x27;s potency is perfect.</li>
            <li> and I was right!  </li>
            <li> Have even had the odd man or 2 asking what that gorgeous smell is!  </li>
            <li> I bought this because while the reviews were mixed, the majority of reviews claimed that this was the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; even though the code in the box was cut out, and the price was too good to not give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Love it and so does everyone else when they are near me!!!</li>
            <li> I was incredibly worried about the negative reviews but am pleased to say that this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your good money on this product, get the real thing at the department store if you want it to stay with you.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> but sometimes it&#x27;s fun to just take a chance.  </li>
            <li> but, it must be more than 6 months old.</li>
            <li> Powerful and fragrant perfume.</li>
            <li> it has a distinct smell I couldn&#x27;t wait to wear it.it</li>
            <li> put a smile on her face.</li>
            <li> Other than that it smells good.</li>
            <li> I find that this has just the right seductive balance for day or evening.</li>
            <li> She has many different types of perfume, but this is by far my and her favorite.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> i only can say i love it</li>
            <li> get compliments when I wear this fragrance and as soon as I get low on this bottle I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Speed on time and was pleased overall!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more before I run out.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell, last all day.</li>
            <li> I really feel that I get my money&#x27;s worth here.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of *mostly* light fragrances such as Ralph, Clinique&#x27;s Happy, Eternity, etc., then Alien might not be for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not alien, it&#x27;s not exactly bad, but it&#x27;s just not something I would want.</li>
            <li> Strong and long lasting for sure.  </li>
            <li> I am positive this is not the real fragrance.</li>
            <li> Definitely try a sample if you can since scents vary so much based on the person wearing it but give it a chance because it really is quite special!</li>
            <li> Unique, mysterious, and very glorious scent!</li>
            <li> Alien is an exotic, rich, intricate fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very musky.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and she did really appreciate.</li>
            <li> wife&#x27;s been wearing this perfume for years, she can tell it&#x27;s not the real deal.</li>
            <li> I was very please with the perfume I like to smell very well</li>
            <li> and my husband really really loves it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend buying perfume that way</li>
            <li> I like bolder perfumes and really this one hits the spot on me.  </li>
            <li> A man who frequents my place of employment loves it so much that he bought it for his wife - however,</li>
            <li> What I recieved was the real deal.</li>
            <li> for this fact alone i will be giving this product 1 star because no customer should have to worry about whether a product they buy is real or not.</li>
            <li> She loves it and it has such a unique scent.</li>
            <li> I appreciate sunny and earthy fragrances; as my husband says, I have a perfume for nearly every outfit and season! ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> I have purchased this perfume from department stores several times, and decided to purchase through Amazon this time because of the significant discount.</li>
            <li> An amazing, and unique fragrance,  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and the scent is long lasting!</li>
            <li> For the amount that you have to use, might as well pay full price for it at department store and it will actually last all day.</li>
            <li> i surprised it really does!</li>
            <li> You wont be let down :)</li>
            <li> Based on the previous reviews, I am probably better off purchasing this at a department store.</li>
            <li> I love to wear it when I go out to a nightclub or a black dress dinner.</li>
            <li> , it was just 3 dollars more expensive than amazon, otherwise I would have order from here. :-)</li>
            <li> This perfume is a lot more expensive in Israel,so I am glad I could get it for my niece on Amazon...</li>
            <li> this seems to be a problem with a lot of amazon sellers when it comes to high end perfumes so you&#x27;re always taking a gamble when you buy one...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend no mater what your age is.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> It is like a little piece of artwork to be displayed on your vanity or dresser top.</li>
            <li> A couple or few dabs of the scent lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> Package was open and code cut out but for the price its still worth it.</li>
            <li> When dried, Alien is extremely sexy and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> That makes me wonder how this is a brand new unopened box if the code has been cut out.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I was so excited to see it at such a low price.</li>
            <li> I love Thierry Mugler&#x27;s, Alien.</li>
            <li> Smells the exact same.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> the fragrance i received does not seem watered down as it still smells very powerful</li>
            <li> Go easy on the spray - it is a heavy scent</li>
            <li> I was told that the perfume sold on Amazon is old that is why they can sell it so cheap, and perfume does sour when it is old.</li>
            <li> A bit too loud to use during the day.</li>
            <li> , is that Alien?&amp;#34; And they&#x27;re always surprised I could tell.</li>
            <li> but it will get worn quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> but wow was</li>
            <li> Though it smells nothing like Opium, I would classify it as an Opium like scent as far as heaviness and sophistication goes.</li>
            <li> Personally, my taste in scent is very eclectic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my bottle for nearly a year now</li>
            <li> i first smelled this from one of those rub off samples inside a magazine, i noticed that i smelled it all day long!</li>
            <li> I only wear fragrances that make me want to make love to myself, or catch the attention of others, and Alien hits the spot.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE Alien fan.</li>
            <li> i loved the smell and decided to order it hoping the actual product smelled like the paper sample,i was skeptical</li>
            <li> this is a heavenly scent that truly lasts untill you wash it off, ie all day and night, but be cautioned that it is strong so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume for a couple of years from a major department store.</li>
            <li> &quot; Alien is a unique fragrance that turns heads and makes a statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long a a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received a sample on one of my magazines (Lucky magazine) and it has a small spray sample.</li>
            <li> from smelling fabulous, Alien is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> From the first spritz to the final dry down to the base notes, it has meshed beautifully with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely pleased with Alien!!!</li>
            <li> 3) it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting .</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and that&#x27;s an amazing plus when expensive scents are concerned.</li>
            <li> does not stay on long, maybe an hour.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product was new, as the serial number inside the box was cut out.</li>
            <li> This fragrance lasts so long!</li>
            <li> Should spray on wrists, press wrists together for about 10 seconds and then wave them to air dry.</li>
            <li> Several reviews I read said the code was cut out of the box and the perfume seemed watered down.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a total whim after running out of my go to perfume, Tom Ford Black Orchid.</li>
            <li> it came on time, as expected,</li>
            <li> expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not a really a jeans and T-shirt fragrance, but to \\&quot;each/own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of alien, pay the extra money and buy it somewhere else.</li>
            <li> When I wear Alien, it stays with me all day, and sometimes until the next day.</li>
            <li> This perfume is HEAVILY diluted with alcohol compared to older versions of Alien I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It has a very faint, clean, floral smell.</li>
            <li> When Alien dries on the skin, there is a faint metallic vibe; however, it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> plenty of perfume in this bottle to last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> fragrance is not exactly suited for everyday wear, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I get orchid, Myrrh and an ever so slight ting of vanilla (or something of the like).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a single complaint</li>
            <li> Does tend to wear off a little thru the day, but come 6pm</li>
            <li> It comes with a teared code from inside which is a little bit fishy.</li>
            <li> Box was missing the authenticity code.</li>
            <li> the code in my box was missing even 2)</li>
            <li> This fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay with me even for a few hours.</li>
            <li> However my code was missing from inside the box.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, not too heavy, always get people asking what am I wearing.  </li>
            <li> is that it came with some little cards with a code on it for you to join the alien something they were missing they were removed</li>
            <li> usual nothing to say about the service and punctuality of delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disgusted that the company has become so cheap that they feel the need to dilute their perfumeâ€“â€“changing the scent!  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing Alien for years, always getting my bottle refilled at Nordstrom or Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> no more discount for me.</li>
            <li> If you favor coco Chanel or Lolita lempicka you may like alien.</li>
            <li> I was so mad, and immediately tried to get a return in motion on Amazon, only to find out that you can&#x27;t return perfumes.  </li>
            <li> , i think it is fake or watered down,</li>
            <li> With Alien, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I use it as least twice a week!</li>
            <li> It smelled up the entire office but was not an annoying fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad that I&#x27;m out the $60 I wasted on this perfume.  </li>
            <li> and therefore I was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive, but remember you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be a fake, for the price I paid a bad fake at that.....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s divergent and very difficult to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> Frankly, I hate it and refuse to use it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> The one i just received is awful</li>
            <li> so I bought it figuring it couldn&#x27;t be horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have purchased this perfume from Amazon before and it was great. The one i just received is awful, i think it is fake or watered down, does not stay on long, maybe an hour. When i buy it at Macys its lasts all day. I was told that the perfume sold on Amazon is old that is why they can sell it so cheap, and perfume does sour when it is old. Would never buy again....</li>
            <li> Have had many complements when I have this on. It has a very nice and fresh smell to it. Something I noticed when I passed a woman and ashed her what her cologne was. I&#x27;ve been wearing it ever since.</li>
            <li> very nice, doesn&#x27;t appear to be a rip off.</li>
            <li> The product was wonderful. Delivery time was great and it arrive intact. Thanks!</li>
            <li> An amazing, and unique fragrance,  a little goes a long way. Very long lasting .</li>
            <li> Accurate description of product and excellent deliver service</li>
            <li> Very musky. Staying power is great.</li>
            <li> The aroma is not my favorite. A bit too loud to use during the day. Probably best use in the evenings outage.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a gift, she loves it, I love the smell of it on her. She receives many compliments on it from strangers.</li>
            <li> love this perfume, always get compliments when I wear it, bought one as a gift for my sister too</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product was new, as the serial number inside the box was cut out.</li>
            <li> i only can say i love it&lt;br /&gt;and my friends always ask for.&lt;br /&gt;you will like it i am sure</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and in great shape.  I love this smell and did not want to pay $100.00 for it.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments when I wear this fragrance and as soon as I get low on this bottle I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat this price. My favorite perfume. you do not need many sprays for it to stay on all day because its great quality. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter...it came on time, as expected, good price, she loved it!</li>
            <li> Great perfume. Delivered well sealed and shipped immediately. Just like others who mentioned: my code was cut out from the box...not sure why. Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. ....so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she did really appreciate. She loves this perfume and I do love it on her.&lt;br /&gt;As usual nothing to say about the service and punctuality of delivery, amazon is always good.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but only lasts about an hour or so. Box was missing the authenticity code. For the amount that you have to use, might as well pay full price for it at department store and it will actually last all day.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE Alien fan. I stop people all the time and say &amp;#34;you smell amazing, is that Alien?&amp;#34; And they&#x27;re always surprised I could tell. It&#x27;s the best perfume. That&#x27;s why I was so excited to see it at such a low price. I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I bought it here but I wish I had. 1) the code in my box was missing even 2) it&#x27;s a completely different smell. It&#x27;s not alien, it&#x27;s not exactly bad, but it&#x27;s just not something I would want. 3) it doesn&#x27;t last long. If you&#x27;re a fan of alien, pay the extra money and buy it somewhere else.</li>
            <li> love it!  expensive, but worth it.  A unique scent with hints of flowers and herbs.  Go easy on the spray - it is a heavy scent and I wear it most often in the evening.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long a a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s been wearing this perfume for years, she can tell it&#x27;s not the real deal. I got hooked by the Prime reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time I buy a perfume on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,</li>
            <li> plenty of perfume in this bottle to last at least 6 months. Love this fragrance and it stays on my clothes and in my hair all day. This fragrance lasts so long!</li>
            <li> I love Thierry Mugler&#x27;s, Alien. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over a year. I only wear fragrances that make me want to make love to myself, or catch the attention of others, and Alien hits the spot. Perfect for personal use or as a gift. With Alien, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! ðŸ˜‰ Came one time, perfectly packaged and described. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Love it and so does everyone else when they are near me!!! Lol</li>
            <li> Smelled this in the Florida Mall in Dillards. LOVED it! Ordered it online bc it was cheaper. Smells the exact same. Does tend to wear off a little thru the day, but come 6pm I can still sell it on me! Many compliments Ive recv&#x27;d with this pick! You wont be let down :)</li>
            <li> This perfume is HEAVILY diluted with alcohol compared to older versions of Alien I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I&#x27;m disgusted that the company has become so cheap that they feel the need to dilute their perfumeâ€“â€“changing the scent!  I was so mad, and immediately tried to get a return in motion on Amazon, only to find out that you can&#x27;t return perfumes.  I&#x27;m so mad that I&#x27;m out the $60 I wasted on this perfume.  DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> Some folks may disliked this fragrance but for me it was just perfect.  It was floral (on me) without being overbearing or overwhelming.  From the first spritz to the final dry down to the base notes, it has meshed beautifully with my body chemistry.

Based on the previous reviews, I am probably better off purchasing this at a department store.</li>
            <li> She likes it, says it smells good.  I think so too.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely beautiful on my wife! Speed on time and was pleased overall!  Much better value vs the in store price!</li>
            <li> I was very please with the perfume I like to smell very well</li>
            <li> Great perfume at a great price</li>
            <li> I am absolutely pleased with Alien!!! I love it and my husband really really loves it. I will definitely be buying more before I run out.</li>
            <li> This is a unique smell but I absolutely love it!  I tried this on a total whim after running out of my go to perfume, Tom Ford Black Orchid. Honestly I liked the bottle so I bought it figuring it couldn&#x27;t be horrible and I was right!  I don&#x27;t really recommend buying perfume that way but sometimes it&#x27;s fun to just take a chance.  I will say it won&#x27;t take the spot of my Tom Ford but it will get worn quite frequently.  I like bolder perfumes and really this one hits the spot on me.  Strong and long lasting for sure.  Definitely try a sample if you can since scents vary so much based on the person wearing it but give it a chance because it really is quite special! I will buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I but this perfume for my daughter. She loves it and it has such a unique scent. Its her favorite. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> it smelled amazing but shipping took more then a week</li>
            <li> Intoxicating scent.  I have received so many random compliments on this fragrance.  A man who frequents my place of employment loves it so much that he bought it for his wife - however, the composition of the perfume was not a match with her body chemistry so it wasn&#x27;t nearly as attractive on her.  Different perfumes work on different types of skin.  Alien is *perfect* for mine!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble finding a scent that suits me perfectly. I don&#x27;t like anything to overpowering. I find that this has just the right seductive balance for day or evening.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the exactly same as the sample I found it in the magazine.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so unbelievably good that people stop me while I&#x27;m out to inquire what I&#x27;m wearing. What a wonderfully amazing scent!</li>
            <li> It was a gift from me to one of my friends , she loves it, I probably order for myself too . !</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Alien for years, always getting my bottle refilled at Nordstrom or Macy&#x27;s. I bought this because while the reviews were mixed, the majority of reviews claimed that this was the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; even though the code in the box was cut out, and the price was too good to not give it a shot. I am positive this is not the real fragrance. When I wear Alien, it stays with me all day, and sometimes until the next day. This fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay with me even for a few hours. Do not waste your good money on this product, get the real thing at the department store if you want it to stay with you.</li>
            <li> I just received a sample on one of my magazines (Lucky magazine) and it has a small spray sample. I LOVE the smell so I decided to search for prices and I have to say I went to 3 sites that have fair prices (including amazon) and I found out that Ulta.com has it cheaper, free shipping as well and 3 day delivery, it was just 3 dollars more expensive than amazon, otherwise I would have order from here. :-)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Unique, mysterious, and very glorious scent! Every time I wear it I get asked about it! I have made it my signature scent!!</li>
            <li> The bottle was great size. The product still properly packaged in its box. Very happy. Amazon never disappoints</li>
            <li> This is  my favorite i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and got it at a great price. However the Thierry Mugler code to register yourself for circle.theirrymugler was stolen from my box. It was totally cut out. I am disappointed! It makes me wonder how else my product may have been tampered with.</li>
            <li> Fragrance  is for a person with really strong personallity ,  Its nice  but if you exceed the amount of perfum, it would cause you sickness .. lol..</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I bought it from amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper. What I recieved was the real deal. However my code was missing from inside the box. That makes me wonder how this is a brand new unopened box if the code has been cut out.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a lot more expensive in Israel,so I am glad I could get it for my niece on Amazon...Great value for money</li>
            <li> The code had been removed, this item was obviously opened. Would like a replacement for the cost of it. Bad</li>
            <li> my wife tried this o&#x3D;in a store and she liked it. Its flowery. But if you like flowery smell then go for it. Its really awesome. It was my valentine gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> serial number was cut out of the top of the lid so you cant check the authenticity of the product don&#x27;t buy this.Its a scam,</li>
            <li> Smells great, but as the reviews stated...it just doesn&#x27;t last. You have to over spray. When I say it doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m  talking 1-2 hours after. Great price, but, it&#x27;s more worth buying at the department store and get 2 sprays vs. buying discount for 15 sprays. It seems to be original product and packaging but, it must be more than 6 months old. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson....no more discount for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Powerful and fragrant perfume. A couple or few dabs of the scent lasts most of the day. If you favor coco Chanel or Lolita lempicka you may like alien.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to me from my husband. It smells so good and I&#x27;m about to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell, last all day.</li>
            <li> while this perfume does smell beautiful and the bottle is amazing and looks to be the real deal with all the original packaging the code on the inside has been cut out... for this fact alone i will be giving this product 1 star because no customer should have to worry about whether a product they buy is real or not. this seems to be a problem with a lot of amazon sellers when it comes to high end perfumes so you&#x27;re always taking a gamble when you buy one... the fragrance i received does not seem watered down as it still smells very powerful so it was probably refilled at a store like macy&#x27;s and then repackaged.</li>
            <li> The perfume was diluted and the code inside the package was cut out.  This appears to be a scam.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume for a couple of years from a major department store. I decided to buy it this time from Amazon because of the low price. Frankly, I hate it and refuse to use it. I lost my money because it cannot be returned. &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;, NOT in this case because this is a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> perfume is very sexy it has a distinct smell I couldn&#x27;t wait to wear it.it arrives othe only thing is that it came with some little cards with a code on it for you to join the alien something they were missing they were removed and therefore I was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> It turned out to be a fake, for the price I paid a bad fake at that.....</li>
            <li> My grandmother loves this perfume and she can&#x27;t stop spraying it on everyone who comes to visit her.&lt;br /&gt;Really put a smile on her face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragance.  A friend of mine at work was wearing it.  It smelled up the entire office but was not an annoying fragrance.  It lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is wonderful I was wearing it all the time and need to get more.</li>
            <li> Guys, you must buy this for your girlfriends, wives, mothers, etc...This is an incredible scent.  Women, you must buy this for yourselves!!! You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> It comes with a teared code from inside which is a little bit fishy. Other than that it smells good. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s original or not.</li>
            <li> i first smelled this from one of those rub off samples inside a magazine, i noticed that i smelled it all day long! i loved the smell and decided to order it hoping the actual product smelled like the paper sample,i was skeptical but wow was i surprised it really does! this is a heavenly scent that truly lasts untill you wash it off, ie all day and night, but be cautioned that it is strong so a little goes a long way so 1 spritz is all you will need. i love it love it love it! got so many compliments</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume, every time I wear it I get so many compliments.  Highly recommend no mater what your age is.</li>
            <li> Alien is an exotic, rich, intricate fragrance. IT is seductive and PERFECTLY suited for evening. I love to wear it when I go out to a nightclub or a black dress dinner. I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve been asked \\&quot;What are you wearing? You smell so good!\\&quot; Alien is a unique fragrance that turns heads and makes a statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is not exactly suited for everyday wear, in my opinion. By all means, you can wear it whenever you wish, but to me, it is more of an evening or dress-up affair. For me, it&#x27;s not a really a jeans and T-shirt fragrance, but to \\&quot;each/own.\\&quot; Also, this is not a fruity, sunny fragrance. It is rich and earthy. Though it smells nothing like Opium, I would classify it as an Opium like scent as far as heaviness and sophistication goes. If you are a fan of *mostly* light fragrances such as Ralph, Clinique&#x27;s Happy, Eternity, etc., then Alien might not be for you. Personally, my taste in scent is very eclectic. I appreciate sunny and earthy fragrances; as my husband says, I have a perfume for nearly every outfit and season! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The notes are very interesting. I get orchid, Myrrh and an ever so slight ting of vanilla (or something of the like). When Alien dries on the skin, there is a faint metallic vibe; however, it is not unpleasant. When dried, Alien is extremely sexy and sophisticated. The name of this fragrance could not be more appropriate: it&#x27;s divergent and very difficult to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from smelling fabulous, Alien is very long lasting. A little goes a long way, and that&#x27;s an amazing plus when expensive scents are concerned. I really feel that I get my money&#x27;s worth here. I&#x27;ve had my bottle for nearly a year now and I use it as least twice a week! Alien&#x27;s potency is perfect. It&#x27;s strong, but it is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the bottle. Let&#x27;s talk about the bottle. It is like a little piece of artwork to be displayed on your vanity or dresser top. It looks like amethyst and has very detailed and intriguing form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like adventurous fragrances, this is your scent to explore. Love, love, love!nd intriguing form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like adventurous fragrances, this is your scent to explore. Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents! I have purchased this perfume from department stores several times, and decided to purchase through Amazon this time because of the significant discount. I was incredibly worried about the negative reviews but am pleased to say that this is the real deal! Several reviews I read said the code was cut out of the box and the perfume seemed watered down. That is not the case with mine! Box was still sealed in plastic wrap and everything was in tact. Smells amazing and the scent is long lasting! SO happy about this purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this a a present for my wife. She loved it.  She has many different types of perfume, but this is by far my and her favorite.  It has a very faint, clean, floral smell.</li>
            <li> Wow!  You must have this in your collection!  Lasts all day, not too heavy, always get people asking what am I wearing.  Have even had the odd man or 2 asking what that gorgeous smell is!  You have to get it!!</li>
            <li> My niece came to see me and had this perfume and let me try it. Just 2 sprays and it lasted all day and all night. The next day I still could smell it on what I was wearing. Yes it is expensive, but remember you get what you pay for. Meaning, that with this type of perfume they will put more oil in the perfume as opposed to the alcohol content. And to add another tip when applying any perfume. When applying to your wrists, NEVER rub it in as this cause the perfume to burn (so to speak, not literally) and it will wear off a lot faster. Should spray on wrists, press wrists together for about 10 seconds and then wave them to air dry. Will make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would highly recommend this perfume. It is one of my top 3. I do get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Its a great perfume for a great price but you won&#x27;t be getting the code with it. Package was open and code cut out but for the price its still worth it.</li>
