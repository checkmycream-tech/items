            <li>and I could see a great great difference on her face since she started using this product ..</li>
            <li>works great for the price.</li>
            <li>a great buy.</li>
            <li>It was a great price to pay for this olay regenerist crème.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I liked this product</li>
            <li>I am noticing a remarkable difference, smooth ,and even skin tone.</li>
            <li>supposed to treat fine lines, i still have them, this just seems like a good moisturizer but</li>
            <li>sure enough.all in $35.00 range now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems that if there were more than it may provide better results.  </li>
            <li>I guess they want you to keep buying more.</li>
            <li>and I can already see the difference, I love it.</li>
            <li>and hopefully I&#x27;ll not get any more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Lancôme products my whole life with great satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>great also.we live in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I am a huge Olay Regenerist fan and love the convenience of ordering online.</li>
            <li>I have fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>using for 8 months (2 tubes) there is no change in the fine lines on my face</li>
            <li>This entire line is great - it works to help aging skin and gives the impression of erasing lines -</li>
            <li>no bad experiences with it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t visibly seen the results yet...would be to quick to tell.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>It is more effective than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I have used diligently but has not decreased the fine wrinkles that I had.</li>
            <li>It does not feel that great on my face, waste of time and money</li>
            <li>Secondly, I had some kind of reaction to all the perfume in the product and my face looked like an acne prone teenager</li>
            <li>the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Ended up in the hospital for two weeks right after I got this lotion</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know yet how it will perform; too early to tell, but nice and soft consistency (not watery).  </li>
            <li>It also has done a pretty good job of reducing the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It has reduced wrinkles on forehead , neck , around eyes and also made her face look more brighter and younger ...</li>
            <li>l first tried this product,months ago,it was $20.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I think this cream really softens the laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>must use consistently though and use with the age defying serum as a set.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the product doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase with this line of products.</li>
            <li>At 62, I use this product daily and it has definitely helped to reduce most of the fine lines that come with aging around the eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>All positive feedback.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually us these products, but since it was a good price, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>She loves it so much</li>
            <li>Thanks to olay</li>
            <li>Thanks ,</li>
            <li>Product works very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Having spent a great deal of time outside as a child I had major skin &amp;#34;spotting&amp;#34; from sun exposure and this product appears to have reduced that effect.  </li>
            <li>when I use the product..leave my face nice a smooth...and definitly helps those pesky little lines!</li>
            <li>she told me that most brands,doing same job all went up in price at the same day.she</li>
            <li>this particular product.&lt;br /&gt;I went to the particular counter to check it out ad</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who are fighting with wrinkles ...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and my fine lines are barely visible.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to try it out completely</li>
            <li>but the shipping was fast as far as I can tell</li>
            <li>I it now to smile lines only now.</li>
            <li>;  I&#x27;ve throughly researched to understand that improvement can only occur with powerful form of Retinyl- &amp;#34;Vitamin A, the  &amp;#34;PROPIONATE&amp;#34;, not the cheaper inferior &amp;#34;Palmitate&amp;#34; These two ingredients are found in $100 skin care products.</li>
            <li>Also, I am very sensitive to scents and this does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I am a big Regenerist fan, this particular cream seems to be doing the trick except not so much witih the age spot.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would cause me more acne, because everything causes me more acne (I&#x27;m half Scottish!), but it didn&#x27;t, it just seemed to attack my wrinkles and give my face a glow that I have never experienced before.  </li>
            <li>For African American women, this will absolutely cause sunburn.!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing some form of eyewear whether its glasses or contacts for nearly all my life.  </li>
            <li>And the price on Amazon beat any of the store prices I have found so far.</li>
            <li>If you really want to get rid of wrinkles, you have to use Botox or a similar product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and have adult acne.</li>
            <li>and it never felt soft and moist like it use d to.  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li>bought as a gift and got it for a third of the instore price, shipped fast and no complaints here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pushing 70 years old.  </li>
            <li>Since it is difficult to find in stores anymore I was very pleased to find that Amazon still carries the product.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, has no scent (at least none that I noticed) and</li>
            <li>After buying strictly olay products and despite the postive reviews, i was surprised just how dry this product left my skin after application</li>
    </ol>

            <li> 5 Stars, one of the very few lower cost skin cream that actually contains useful Active Ingredients that work.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d worn glasses for about the past 20 or so years; and now that I&#x27;ve gotten older (50&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> and I do not have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that it worked as well as the regular red jar regenerist cream I usually use.  </li>
            <li> Use it faithfully not sure I can see a difference yet, but have only had it about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have seen such a difference in my skin health from using this for the past month.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> For those of us who don&#x27;t want to go that route, this Intensive Repair Treatment does make some wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> price less then if you purchase in drug store.</li>
            <li> You won&amp;#34;t be disappointed if you try this fabulous product today</li>
            <li> Read a mag article that said expensive skin care is a waste of time and gave this product a high rating.  </li>
            <li> The olday regenerist line never lets your down!  </li>
            <li> A waste of money and</li>
            <li> A tad heavy</li>
            <li> I am 47 now, I seen this in stores but was a little skeptical about how well it would work, I have only been using it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> It seems to work well, however feels a little thick.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve gotten &#x27;eyeglass wrinkles&#x27; which were a lot worse than I thought.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!!!!!!!!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The olday regenerist line never lets your down!  I can always see a difference....when I use the product..leave my face nice a smooth...and definitly helps those pesky little lines!</li>
            <li> Did not improve my skin at all</li>
            <li> Best product  ... I purchased 4 for my mom .. She loves it so much and I could see a great great difference on her face since she started using this product .. It has reduced wrinkles on forehead , neck , around eyes and also made her face look more brighter and younger ...I highly recommend this product to anyone who are fighting with wrinkles ... Thanks to olay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing some form of eyewear whether its glasses or contacts for nearly all my life.  Well, I&#x27;ve gotten &#x27;eyeglass wrinkles&#x27; which were a lot worse than I thought.  I&#x27;d worn glasses for about the past 20 or so years; and now that I&#x27;ve gotten older (50&#x27;s) I&#x27;d decided to try contacts again and when I looked in the mirror I was horrified at my reflection.  I&#x27;d used Olay products from my 20&#x27;s until my40&#x27;s, and now I&#x27;m back to using Olay again.  The &#x27;eyeglass wrinkles&#x27; are almost all gone (thank you Olay). and I&#x27;m back to using only Olay products.</li>
            <li> Suits my skin regime.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job well and quickly.it is what my skin wants!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cost great also.we live in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;When l first tried this product,months ago,it was $20.&lt;br /&gt;Very recently,I went to purchase the same product and it was $35.00 at the same l spoke to a salesperson&lt;br /&gt;And she told me that most brands,doing same job all went up in price at the same day.she had done the price changes&lt;br /&gt;For this particular product.&lt;br /&gt;I went to the particular counter to check it out ad sure enough.all in $35.00 range now.&lt;br /&gt;So we checked on the iPad.  Thanks ,B?H?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and see no difference what so ever. A waste of money and I will not be returning to purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that it worked as well as the regular red jar regenerist cream I usually use.  I have always used Olay products and I feel like I look younger than I am.</li>
            <li> After using this constantly for months I notice no difference. This defiantly NOT a repurchase!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it works well but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.  I have fine lines and wrinkles. It seems that if there were more than it may provide better results.  I guess they want you to keep buying more.</li>
            <li> Giving this a three star.  Have been using for almost four weeks.  No difference on my face.  I&#x27;ll continue to use until it&#x27;s gone just to see if things change since it hasn&#x27;t caused any side effects for my skin.</li>
            <li> Recommend it. works great for the price. a great buy. no bad experiences with it. All positive feedback. Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t visibly seen the results yet...would be to quick to tell.</li>
            <li> I think this cream really softens the laugh lines.  I could see a difference after about a week. Use morning and night.</li>
            <li> Use it faithfully not sure I can see a difference yet, but have only had it about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay products since I was about 17. I am 47 now, I seen this in stores but was a little skeptical about how well it would work, I have only been using it for a couple of weeks and I can already see the difference, I love it.</li>
            <li> Product works very well. Noticed a difference in days. You won&amp;#34;t be disappointed if you try this fabulous product today</li>
            <li> I have seen such a difference in my skin health from using this for the past month. And the price on Amazon beat any of the store prices I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Olay Regenerist fan and love the convenience of ordering online.</li>
            <li> After buying strictly olay products and despite the postive reviews, i was surprised just how dry this product left my skin after application and I do not have dry skin.  No wonder why you need to follow with a lot of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> If you really want to get rid of wrinkles, you have to use Botox or a similar product.  For those of us who don&#x27;t want to go that route, this Intensive Repair Treatment does make some wrinkles less noticeable.  But, again, it&#x27;s not surgery.  It goes on easily, has no scent (at least none that I noticed) and the price is right.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hopefully I&#x27;ll not get any more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and have adult acne. Within a week, it has cleared the acne about 90%. No change in the few dark spots I have but a definite decrease in the smile lines. For African American women, this will absolutely cause sunburn.!! I woke up one morning and I was literally about 3 shades darker!! Be careful! Piona cream and Koji soap cleared all of that up but do use a sunscreen. I it now to smile lines only now.</li>
            <li> Ended up in the hospital for two weeks right after I got this lotion so I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to try it out completely but the shipping was fast as far as I can tell the Product does what it says it&#x27;s going to do</li>
            <li> Great price! Quick delivery.  I am a big Regenerist fan, this particular cream seems to be doing the trick except not so much witih the age spot.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Doesn&#x27;t take much. I just use it under my eyes and on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This entire line is great - it works to help aging skin and gives the impression of erasing lines - must use consistently though and use with the age defying serum as a set.</li>
            <li> It was a great price to pay for this olay regenerist crème. I use it every so often but I like it and I would recommend to any woman.</li>
            <li> I use this around my mouth area and 11 line and lines around the eyes.  Don&#x27;t know yet how it will perform; too early to tell, but nice and soft consistency (not watery).  You might want to try, price less then if you purchase in drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Lancôme products my whole life with great satisfaction.  Read a mag article that said expensive skin care is a waste of time and gave this product a high rating.  WRONG!!!!!!!!  Firstly, the product doesn&#x27;t work.  Secondly, I had some kind of reaction to all the perfume in the product and my face looked like an acne prone teenager and it never felt soft and moist like it use d to.  Never again.  I&#x27;m going back to Lancôme!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually us these products, but since it was a good price, I decided to try it.  I am really surprised at the results.  I really thought it would cause me more acne, because everything causes me more acne (I&#x27;m half Scottish!), but it didn&#x27;t, it just seemed to attack my wrinkles and give my face a glow that I have never experienced before.  I say buy it and try it if you have never used a wrinkle reducer before.  It is more effective than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Great deal!  Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> At 62, I use this product daily and it has definitely helped to reduce most of the fine lines that come with aging around the eyes and mouth.  It also has done a pretty good job of reducing the dark circles under my eyes.  Having spent a great deal of time outside as a child I had major skin &amp;#34;spotting&amp;#34; from sun exposure and this product appears to have reduced that effect.  Since it is difficult to find in stores anymore I was very pleased to find that Amazon still carries the product.</li>
            <li> A tad heavy but I like the results.  I would recommend using this at night or when you do not plan to use foundation.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase with this line of products. It seems to work well, however feels a little thick.</li>
            <li> I have used diligently but has not decreased the fine wrinkles that I had. It has also contributed to pimple break out that I never had before.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars, one of the very few lower cost skin cream that actually contains useful Active Ingredients that work.  NIACINAMIDE*, C12-15 &amp;#34;RETINYL PROPIONATE&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve throughly researched to understand that improvement can only occur with powerful form of Retinyl- &amp;#34;Vitamin A, the  &amp;#34;PROPIONATE&amp;#34;, not the cheaper inferior &amp;#34;Palmitate&amp;#34; These two ingredients are found in $100 skin care products. I am noticing a remarkable difference, smooth ,and even skin tone. A excellent quality product and good value am a repeat customer and use it along with vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and my fine lines are barely visible.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
            <li> I see no difference by using this product.  It does not feel that great on my face, waste of time and money</li>
            <li> supposed to treat fine lines, i still have them, this just seems like a good moisturizer but&lt;br /&gt;after using for 8 months (2 tubes) there is no change in the fine lines on my face</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and got it for a third of the instore price, shipped fast and no complaints here</li>
            <li> I liked this product but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin. It did go well under my makeup. But no visible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pushing 70 years old.  This did not make me look like I&#x27;m 35, but I do see improved skin tone and moisture.  Also, I am very sensitive to scents and this does not bother me at all.</li>
