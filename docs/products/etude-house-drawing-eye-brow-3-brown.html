            <li>Honestly this is one of my favorite brow pencils!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>The brown color is perfect and matches my brow color very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have to sharpen the pencil as well.</li>
            <li>Well, I still love the color of the crayon and the brush feels good.</li>
            <li>this is certainly a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li>; look that is so popular in Korea.</li>
            <li>It is fool proof and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy for girl who just start to make up.</li>
            <li>This Etude House brow pencil is very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to use...</li>
            <li>; as in &amp;#34;very creamy texture&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s just very easy to work with).</li>
            <li>Its very easy to over do it with this.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is suitable for any type of eyebrow shape you want.</li>
            <li>For my natural looking eyebrow, this is the best.</li>
            <li>This us by far the best brow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already bought 3 of these pencils, and honestly I can&#x27;t recommend them more.</li>
            <li>The edge of the liner easily creates an even brow shape!</li>
            <li>Both are easy to achieve with this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>This eyebrow pencil is absolutely awesome - the color is very natural, the pencil is shaped into a triangular prism so it applies easily, and the brush helps even it out.</li>
            <li>However, the color is very light compared to the image shown.  </li>
            <li>the #3 brown still looks good even if it is more of a cool brown now.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, since it&#x27;s a brand I&#x27;ve never heard of.  </li>
            <li>Luv this brow liner, I use a brush powder and this is better.</li>
            <li>just ok</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>Thank you A-Poly and Etudehouse. :)</li>

            <li>Love this eyebrow pencil.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the spool on the end and the angled tip.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>and i love that it have a eyebrow brush on it.</li>
            <li>Love the quality.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>, I do not reccommend buying this if you want something like this right away because it takes a good month to get here but</li>
            <li>The color matched my hair perfectly and lasted for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>The best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>Glides on easily. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of an ashy Brown and it matches my dark hair perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Great angle for making natural brows.</li>
            <li>It was very cheap although shipping is a bit pricey, but in this case it was worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and goes just as easy.</li>
            <li>Angled tip makes it easy to draw</li>
            <li>easy to draw.</li>
            <li>It lasts through a workout and sleeping with it on, but it will come off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>The angled tip makes it really easy to use</li>
            <li>This makes lining and filling your brows easy.  </li>
            <li>I have dark brown eyebrows and the color matches great!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Which I like to subconsciously rub my face, lol.</li>
            <li>It stays on and has a precise angled tip.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean off and wont irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>This is so cheap comparing to those high-end cosmetics, but it gave the glide-on feeling when you use it (but it&#x27;s not &amp;</li>
            <li>An overall great product</li>
            <li>Overall , this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not drawing smoothly</li>
            <li>The mascara brush on the other end  helps to blend the color, does very good job  and doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look drawn on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very powerful brow filling/drawing tool.</li>
            <li>One side, is a brow brush, which is very useful for prepping your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>the angle the pencil has its soo unique that makes it even easier to apply.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to use, and I was happy to find a brush on the other end under a cap.</li>
            <li>color i chose is ideal for people with black to brown/black hair.  </li>
            <li>Okay, well, one, A-Poly really secured this product so well.</li>
            <li>You can layer up for a more intense look if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>This would be a good product for someone just starting to learn how to fill in their brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was easy to apply, the color was pretty true to the package but it wiped off SO easily.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately...</li>
            <li>i really love it!&lt;br /&gt;its slightly darker than i thought it would be but in my case that was a good thing</li>
            <li>On other days when I want some drama, I thicken my strokes and the pencil still works to create a heavier fill-in.&lt;br /&gt;Before this product I had been using Maybelline&#x27;s Define-A-Brow, which is also great</li>
            <li>the brush makes the outcome look even more smooth and natural</li>
            <li>This is coming from someone with a super oily T-zone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this is better by leaps and bounds, especially because a) the tip is shaped like a very acute triangle, meaning that there&#x27;s more thick-to-thin control, and b) on its other end</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is better then my $80 eyebrow kit from a high end line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite eyebrow pencil and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I actually use it for eyeliner more than for my brows!</li>
            <li>:) looks quite natural and stays on super well.</li>
            <li>The shape takes a little getting used to but the color is great and it doesn&#x27;t fade by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that the package came with two little Skinfood Gold Caviar Cream samples :D</li>
            <li>Used it everyday and it works great</li>
            <li>I rather use a brush to create a more natural look than to use this.</li>
            <li>Completely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought and tried almost every kind, from powder/brush sets, twisty eyebrow pencils, regular eyebrow pencils, waterproof eyebrow pens...</li>
            <li>It rubs off easier than most eyebrow pencils but It&#x27;s so natural that I don&#x27;t mind-</li>
            <li>very natural and super easy to apply</li>
            <li>The color is very rich, and the product is soft.  </li>
            <li>whereas the other pencil was more gray-ish, taupe and a lot more subtle/natural.</li>
            <li>Out of numerous eyebrow pencils I have tried I find this looks the most natural and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The color is just right for the color of my hair.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from Rescue Warrior Inc, they sent me this, a long with 3 free samples (a cute hair bow, skin food cream, and etude house lipstick)  </li>
            <li>Can easily go up and down, and the application is easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>(Also, love the little samples I got from Etude House -- the Mint Choux was my favorite and makes me wish I had purchased that instead of the E.L.F. Mineral</li>
            <li>By all means try this pencil, but if you like it, order a replacement right away, so that you will have it by the time the first one runs out.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get a natural looking brow.</li>
            <li>I like the shape of the pen and the core, texture, and color very much.  </li>
            <li>This is the first eyebrow anything that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>The kohl is soft and smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s probably made for women who completely draw in their brows; but no matter how many times I tried I couldn&#x27;t get this pencil to look natural.</li>
            <li>The pencil is shaped in a triangle which is different but very cool.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair a dark brown with warm highlights and needed a lighter brow color.</li>
            <li>Took less than a week to arrive and it came with awesome little sample packs.</li>
            <li>Bought #3 very natural color!!</li>
            <li>They really care about the items they sell, so this product came all in one piece.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The shipping was also incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>When you completely &amp;#34;unscrew&amp;#34; the product to see how much pencil is included, there&#x27;s barely more than 1&amp;#34; of the actual eyebrow pencil in the case.</li>
            <li>The seller is very helpful too.</li>
            <li>Thx so much.</li>
            <li>I really recommend buying from this seller, the item shipped</li>
            <li>very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive</li>
            <li>I was naturally really</li>
            <li>This product was much better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>The color is a bit darker than expected, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>for the price, I would have to say it is very economical and especially when compared to many major brands with similar features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a really cute packaging from Korea or wherever and one end is the pencil the other is the brush.</li>
            <li>like to go to for the light look and fill my brows in short strokes with the pencil, and it achieves the exact natural &#x27;Korean&#x27; type look that I would go for.</li>
            <li>the formula is creamy, easy to apply, and the color is what I expected (brown).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had very light eyebrows very dark hair since birth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love the spool brush at the other end for blending and grooming!!</li>
            <li>Great product ,just as dark as I want it ,doesnt go on chalky and cakey like store bought eyebrow pencils and last a long time</li>
            <li>It definitely gives off more of a natural look, but with a heavy hand you can get a bold look.</li>
            <li>Onto trying new brows things now.</li>
            <li>Im always trYing new products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself was brand new and sealed.</li>
            <li>This one stayed solid after dropping it on PURPOSE from a higher height.</li>
            <li>With normal pencils, it&#x27;s hard for me to control how much I apply on my eyebrows, but with this, I can easily control it.</li>
            <li>eyebrows never looked so natural and</li>
            <li>I went back to using NYX eyebrow powder with a brush, which works very well.</li>
            <li>I like how the lead of the pencil is thicker and angled for a natural eyebrow look.</li>
            <li>but I have been pleasantly surprised by the pencil.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t disappear into the brow in a natural way.  </li>
            <li>The color itself is cooler in nature making it look natural.</li>
            <li>Product came 1 1/2 week early than estimated delivery.</li>
            <li>and it looks totally natural.  </li>
            <li>The pencil shape is angled, and it&#x27;s perfect to get the thick side, and the thin side.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too soft (which I hate for brow pencil) and the brush works awesome.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and definitely repurchasing!</li>
            <li>Just order far enough in advance because it can take a while to get to you.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s much too wide to use strategically.</li>
            <li>Arched, straight, slightly arched, and everything in between.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Honestly this is one of my favorite brow pencils!</li>
            <li> However, it works fantastic and does a great job at filling in my brows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> The brown color is perfect and matches my brow color very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have to sharpen the pencil as well.</li>
            <li> Well, I still love the color of the crayon and the brush feels good.</li>
            <li> this is certainly a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li> ; look that is so popular in Korea.</li>
            <li> It is fool proof and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy for girl who just start to make up.</li>
            <li> This Etude House brow pencil is very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to use...</li>
            <li> ; as in &amp;#34;very creamy texture&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s just very easy to work with).</li>
            <li> Its very easy to over do it with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye brow pencil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This is suitable for any type of eyebrow shape you want.</li>
            <li> For my natural looking eyebrow, this is the best.</li>
            <li> This us by far the best brow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought 3 of these pencils, and honestly I can&#x27;t recommend them more.</li>
            <li> The edge of the liner easily creates an even brow shape!</li>
            <li> Both are easy to achieve with this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is absolutely awesome - the color is very natural, the pencil is shaped into a triangular prism so it applies easily, and the brush helps even it out.</li>
            <li> However, the color is very light compared to the image shown.  </li>
            <li> the #3 brown still looks good even if it is more of a cool brown now.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, since it&#x27;s a brand I&#x27;ve never heard of.  </li>
            <li> Luv this brow liner, I use a brush powder and this is better.</li>
            <li> just ok</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> Thank you A-Poly and Etudehouse. :)</li>
            <li> and I love the color.</li>
            <li> I do recommend to everyone :)</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Love the triangle-shaped tip of this pencil.</li>
            <li> I love how the brush has a cap</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never wanTed to recommend a product more.</li>
            <li> this stuff is ok, i order this for my gf,,, she like it</li>
            <li> Love the shape of the brow pencil.</li>
            <li> I have rather light hair and chose #3, it works wonders!</li>
            <li> Love the shape of the pencil and love the way it transfers on.</li>
            <li> Love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> ordered 2 more since my sister also like it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the spool on the end and the angled tip.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT..</li>
            <li> and i love that it have a eyebrow brush on it.</li>
            <li> Love the quality.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> , I do not reccommend buying this if you want something like this right away because it takes a good month to get here but</li>
            <li> The color matched my hair perfectly and lasted for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> The best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> Glides on easily. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of an ashy Brown and it matches my dark hair perfectly!  </li>
            <li> Great angle for making natural brows.</li>
            <li> It was very cheap although shipping is a bit pricey, but in this case it was worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and goes just as easy.</li>
            <li> Angled tip makes it easy to draw</li>
            <li> easy to draw.</li>
            <li> It lasts through a workout and sleeping with it on, but it will come off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The angled tip makes it really easy to use</li>
            <li> This makes lining and filling your brows easy.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown eyebrows and the color matches great!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Which I like to subconsciously rub my face, lol.</li>
            <li> It stays on and has a precise angled tip.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean off and wont irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> This is so cheap comparing to those high-end cosmetics, but it gave the glide-on feeling when you use it (but it&#x27;s not &amp;</li>
            <li> An overall great product</li>
            <li> Overall , this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not drawing smoothly</li>
            <li> The mascara brush on the other end  helps to blend the color, does very good job  and doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look drawn on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very powerful brow filling/drawing tool.</li>
            <li> One side, is a brow brush, which is very useful for prepping your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> the angle the pencil has its soo unique that makes it even easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to use, and I was happy to find a brush on the other end under a cap.</li>
            <li> color i chose is ideal for people with black to brown/black hair.  </li>
            <li> Okay, well, one, A-Poly really secured this product so well.</li>
            <li> You can layer up for a more intense look if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This would be a good product for someone just starting to learn how to fill in their brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was easy to apply, the color was pretty true to the package but it wiped off SO easily.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately...</li>
            <li> i really love it!&lt;br /&gt;its slightly darker than i thought it would be but in my case that was a good thing</li>
            <li> On other days when I want some drama, I thicken my strokes and the pencil still works to create a heavier fill-in.&lt;br /&gt;Before this product I had been using Maybelline&#x27;s Define-A-Brow, which is also great</li>
            <li> the brush makes the outcome look even more smooth and natural</li>
            <li> This is coming from someone with a super oily T-zone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is better by leaps and bounds, especially because a) the tip is shaped like a very acute triangle, meaning that there&#x27;s more thick-to-thin control, and b) on its other end</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is better then my $80 eyebrow kit from a high end line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite eyebrow pencil and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I actually use it for eyeliner more than for my brows!</li>
            <li> :) looks quite natural and stays on super well.</li>
            <li> The shape takes a little getting used to but the color is great and it doesn&#x27;t fade by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that the package came with two little Skinfood Gold Caviar Cream samples :D</li>
            <li> Used it everyday and it works great</li>
            <li> I rather use a brush to create a more natural look than to use this.</li>
            <li> Completely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and tried almost every kind, from powder/brush sets, twisty eyebrow pencils, regular eyebrow pencils, waterproof eyebrow pens...</li>
            <li> It rubs off easier than most eyebrow pencils but It&#x27;s so natural that I don&#x27;t mind-</li>
            <li> very natural and super easy to apply</li>
            <li> The color is very rich, and the product is soft.  </li>
            <li> whereas the other pencil was more gray-ish, taupe and a lot more subtle/natural.</li>
            <li> Out of numerous eyebrow pencils I have tried I find this looks the most natural and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The color is just right for the color of my hair.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Rescue Warrior Inc, they sent me this, a long with 3 free samples (a cute hair bow, skin food cream, and etude house lipstick)  </li>
            <li> Can easily go up and down, and the application is easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> (Also, love the little samples I got from Etude House -- the Mint Choux was my favorite and makes me wish I had purchased that instead of the E.L.F. Mineral</li>
            <li> By all means try this pencil, but if you like it, order a replacement right away, so that you will have it by the time the first one runs out.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to get a natural looking brow.</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the pen and the core, texture, and color very much.  </li>
            <li> This is the first eyebrow anything that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> The kohl is soft and smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s probably made for women who completely draw in their brows; but no matter how many times I tried I couldn&#x27;t get this pencil to look natural.</li>
            <li> The pencil is shaped in a triangle which is different but very cool.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair a dark brown with warm highlights and needed a lighter brow color.</li>
            <li> Took less than a week to arrive and it came with awesome little sample packs.</li>
            <li> Bought #3 very natural color!!</li>
            <li> They really care about the items they sell, so this product came all in one piece.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The shipping was also incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> When you completely &amp;#34;unscrew&amp;#34; the product to see how much pencil is included, there&#x27;s barely more than 1&amp;#34; of the actual eyebrow pencil in the case.</li>
            <li> The seller is very helpful too.</li>
            <li> Thx so much.</li>
            <li> I really recommend buying from this seller, the item shipped</li>
            <li> very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive</li>
            <li> I was naturally really</li>
            <li> This product was much better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit darker than expected, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> for the price, I would have to say it is very economical and especially when compared to many major brands with similar features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a really cute packaging from Korea or wherever and one end is the pencil the other is the brush.</li>
            <li> like to go to for the light look and fill my brows in short strokes with the pencil, and it achieves the exact natural &#x27;Korean&#x27; type look that I would go for.</li>
            <li> the formula is creamy, easy to apply, and the color is what I expected (brown).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very light eyebrows very dark hair since birth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the spool brush at the other end for blending and grooming!!</li>
            <li> Great product ,just as dark as I want it ,doesnt go on chalky and cakey like store bought eyebrow pencils and last a long time</li>
            <li> It definitely gives off more of a natural look, but with a heavy hand you can get a bold look.</li>
            <li> Onto trying new brows things now.</li>
            <li> Im always trYing new products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product itself was brand new and sealed.</li>
            <li> This one stayed solid after dropping it on PURPOSE from a higher height.</li>
            <li> With normal pencils, it&#x27;s hard for me to control how much I apply on my eyebrows, but with this, I can easily control it.</li>
            <li> eyebrows never looked so natural and</li>
            <li> I went back to using NYX eyebrow powder with a brush, which works very well.</li>
            <li> I like how the lead of the pencil is thicker and angled for a natural eyebrow look.</li>
            <li> but I have been pleasantly surprised by the pencil.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t disappear into the brow in a natural way.  </li>
            <li> The color itself is cooler in nature making it look natural.</li>
            <li> Product came 1 1/2 week early than estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> and it looks totally natural.  </li>
            <li> The pencil shape is angled, and it&#x27;s perfect to get the thick side, and the thin side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft (which I hate for brow pencil) and the brush works awesome.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and definitely repurchasing!</li>
            <li> Just order far enough in advance because it can take a while to get to you.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s much too wide to use strategically.</li>
            <li> Arched, straight, slightly arched, and everything in between.</li>
            <li> This pencil didn&#x27;t take that long to get here actually.</li>
            <li> Long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it didn&#x27;t take so long to arrive.  </li>
            <li> This will only work well for someone who draws their eyebrows on entirely, and will not work well if you&#x27;re like me &amp; use pencil only to outline &amp; then fill in with brow powder or other filler.</li>
            <li> My natural brow is black.</li>
            <li> it has the only brow brush known to man that is not too harsh to thin out what I had filled in before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have black brows and expected the brown color to show, but I was surprised to find that it blended in quite well.</li>
            <li> I have both the brown and dark grey versions of this pencil and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I tried outlining my brows using different angles and each time I ended up with way too wide of a line.&lt;br /&gt;The brush that&#x27;s included on the back end of the pencil ends in a metal point and is completely straight without any tapering, so once again it&#x27;s useless for any strategic blending or grooming; you can only use it sideways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it for half month, the crayon inside the pen broke and now I have to open it carefully every time I use it.</li>
            <li> One is a redish brown that is pretty dark (keep in mind I have thick black eyebrows)</li>
            <li> Totally empty.</li>
            <li> I expected it to deliver to me within 20-30 days as Amazon noticed, but I got it in my mail box just around 1 week after my order.</li>
            <li> I came sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I could even forgive the fact that there is so little of the product included if it was better quality, but combine the minuscule amount compared to other brow products with the awkwardly shaped tip and unnatural look, I&#x27;d say that I struck out.</li>
            <li> And I am planning to try other products from this buyer.</li>
            <li> So first off, I was really skeptical on the quality of the pencil</li>
            <li> The other side is the product, it&#x27;s a retractable</li>
            <li> pen is thicker on one end and pointed at the other.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier then promised,  however it was very dry making it hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> I do like it however the crayon part is so thin and broke off pretty quick for me :(</li>
            <li> Drawing is easier for me with this, however the color I got is a bit to dark for me, oops.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that if I were to run my finger through it it&#x27;d smear.</li>
            <li> The #3 in brown and the #1 in dark brown.</li>
            <li> it matches my eyebrow color and its not to dark..</li>
            <li> Rather dark.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my fault in not choosing black, but the color is still not as dark as you might think.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again in a different shade.</li>
            <li> It stays on well and the color is a bit brunette for my dyed midnight black hair.</li>
            <li> and I have naturally black brows, but the color matched well and didn&#x27;t make my brows look too</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was so highly rated, but I really fail to understand why.</li>
            <li> I had to press down quite firmly to get any color onto the eyebrow area.  </li>
            <li> I just go over it will a little face powder</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t to dark or heavy but still did the job it was designed to do!</li>
            <li> I have spars eyebrow and this looked too harsh on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try &amp;Eacute;tude House for some time now, after hearing about it on a few beauty blogs.</li>
            <li> Infused Face Primer in Green</li>
            <li> Stiff, may need to be warmed before using.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pen takes a very slight hand to apply.  </li>
            <li> product is not good if you don&#x27;t have eyebrows or have extremely sparse/thin eyebrow sand need to draw them on from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I use it in my everyday makeup routine!</li>
            <li> and you can do small strokes for a lighter shade or heavier strokes for a darker shade.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to press so hard.</li>
            <li> I like Eye Brow#3 Brown, but it was broken to pieces too soon.</li>
            <li> I find it awkward to use and the color is lighter than I preferred.</li>
            <li> Price is not so bad.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people can hate this eyebrow</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is by far the best eye brow pencil I&#x27;ve used.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, since it&#x27;s a brand I&#x27;ve never heard of.  However, it works fantastic and does a great job at filling in my brows.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier then promised,  however it was very dry making it hard to apply.  I had to press down quite firmly to get any color onto the eyebrow area.  As a result, I cannot recommend this product.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> Best pencil I have used yet. Lasted me just over 2 months.  Mine just ran out while on vacation and im ordering another now. I have dark brown eyebrows and the color matches great! I love rhe slanted tip which makes for an easy application and a great look! I would recomend this pencil to anyone! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It works great for a brow pencil</li>
            <li> Great pencil &amp; color is a med brown, it draws great its not tough but just perfect</li>
            <li> I like it! This is the first eyebrow anything that I&#x27;ve purchased. Drawing is easier for me with this, however the color I got is a bit to dark for me, oops. The only complaint I have is that if I were to run my finger through it it&#x27;d smear. Which I like to subconsciously rub my face, lol. Anyways, great packaging and speedy delivery. Onto trying new brows things now.</li>
            <li> Luv this brow liner, I use a brush powder and this is better.</li>
            <li> very natural and super easy to apply</li>
            <li> I like the ease on use and drawing, will purchase again</li>
            <li> This is actually my third time ordering this. It&#x27;s my favorite eyebrow pencil and can&#x27;t live without it. Glides on easily. :)</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows never looked so natural and the angle the pencil has its soo unique that makes it even easier to apply. Best eyebrow pencil ever.</li>
            <li> This is a great product....goes on smoothly and blends well!</li>
            <li> I like Eye Brow#3 Brown, but it was broken to pieces too soon. I don&#x27;t recommend it to my friend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and goes just as easy. I like it a lot. The color is just right for the color of my hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a try since the reviews were good.  This pencil works just ok but I don&#x27;t love it.  I went back to using NYX eyebrow powder with a brush, which works very well.</li>
            <li> I love this brow pencil! It is fool proof and very easy to use. For a while I was using Anastasia&#x27;s brow pencil, but I got this one and fell in love with it! The brown color is perfect and matches my brow color very well. It was very cheap although shipping is a bit pricey, but in this case it was worth it! Very happy with this product and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It wasn&#x27;t to dark or heavy but still did the job it was designed to do! The color matched my hair perfectly and lasted for quite a long time. No complaints from me what so ever</li>
            <li> Angled tip makes it easy to draw and I was very impressed with the quality of the spooley.</li>
            <li> Great color and coverage, blends nicely with my brows (ash brown). The mascara brush on the other end  helps to blend the color, does very good job  and doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look drawn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Only drawback is the tip doesn&#x27;t stay sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, I would have to say it is very economical and especially when compared to many major brands with similar features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again. And I am planning to try other products from this buyer.</li>
            <li> I like this product! Okay, well, one, A-Poly really secured this product so well. They really care about the items they sell, so this product came all in one piece. Secondly, this is a twist up pencil. Can easily go up and down, and the application is easy and smooth. The angled pencil shape is very handy. With normal pencils, it&#x27;s hard for me to control how much I apply on my eyebrows, but with this, I can easily control it. This is suitable for any type of eyebrow shape you want. Arched, straight, slightly arched, and everything in between. I recommend this product to anyone. Thank you A-Poly and Etudehouse. :)</li>
            <li> I love this brow pencil!  It stays on and has a precise angled tip.  I actually use it for eyeliner more than for my brows!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy for girl who just start to make up.</li>
            <li> This Etude House brow pencil is very easy to use and I love the color. Easy to clean off and wont irritate the skin. It came with brow brush at the end of the pencil. Price is not so bad. I do recommend to everyone :)</li>
            <li> inexpensive, color is good. easy to draw. For my natural looking eyebrow, this is the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people like the shape of this brow pencil. I find it awkward to use and the color is lighter than I preferred. I rather use a brush to create a more natural look than to use this. I have spars eyebrow and this looked too harsh on me. The only thing I do like was the brush.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is one of my favorite brow pencils! It&#x27;s amazing for the price. I like how the lead of the pencil is thicker and angled for a natural eyebrow look. It&#x27;s nice to not have to sharpen the pencil as well. I love the spool brush at the other end for blending and grooming!! Cannot beat this quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I have been pleasantly surprised by the pencil. The shape takes a little getting used to but the color is great and it doesn&#x27;t fade by the end of the day. I will definitely be ordering again. Shipping took maybe a week since it came from Korea and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The color was perfect for me. It went on easily and fills out my eyebrows beautifully. I&#x27;ve never owned a eyebrow pencil before, but I think I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from Etude again. The shipping was also incredibly fast. Took less than a week to arrive and it came with awesome little sample packs.</li>
            <li> I am practically kicking myself for paying around $30 for an Anastasia brow pencil when this thing existed all along. My Anastasia pencil broke broke into chunks after accidentally dropping onto the ground from a short height. This one stayed solid after dropping it on PURPOSE from a higher height. And how can you beat this price? You can&#x27;t! Just order far enough in advance because it can take a while to get to you. Completely worth the wait. I have both the brown and dark grey versions of this pencil and use it daily. You can layer up for a more intense look if you&#x27;d like. Will be ordering these again and again.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good eyebrow pencil. I bought 2 colors. The #3 in brown and the #1 in dark brown. To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t tell which one was which after I took the sticker labels off! haha! but the colors are very similar. One is a redish brown that is pretty dark (keep in mind I have thick black eyebrows) whereas the other pencil was more gray-ish, taupe and a lot more subtle/natural. Both were good for the price! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This was easy to apply, the color was pretty true to the package but it wiped off SO easily.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately...</li>
            <li> really really great :) looks quite natural and stays on super well. the brush makes the outcome look even more smooth and natural i really love it!&lt;br /&gt;its slightly darker than i thought it would be but in my case that was a good thing</li>
            <li> love it but it took a min to recieve</li>
            <li> Great product ,just as dark as I want it ,doesnt go on chalky and cakey like store bought eyebrow pencils and last a long time, I do not reccommend buying this if you want something like this right away because it takes a good month to get here but in the sense that this is shipped from another country I give it cfredit</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it is made by a Korean company and I though that it would match my asian brow hair well.  However, the color is very light compared to the image shown.  It doesn&#x27;t disappear into the brow in a natural way.  Perhaps my fault in not choosing black, but the color is still not as dark as you might think.</li>
            <li> Love the triangle-shaped tip of this pencil. Makes it so easy to use, and I was happy to find a brush on the other end under a cap. I got the wrong color, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again in a different shade.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect, and it&#x27;s natural looking :D</li>
            <li> will definitely re-purchase.....excellent!</li>
            <li> I kept twisting and twisting for the pencil to come out of the end and it never did. So I took it apart and there was nothing inside of it. Totally empty. How can you ship out an eye brow pencil with no pencil to use inside of the tube. I am returning and will not reorder another one.</li>
            <li> This pencil didn&#x27;t take that long to get here actually. So first off, I was really skeptical on the quality of the pencil but I absolutely love it! It has a really cute packaging from Korea or wherever and one end is the pencil the other is the brush. I love how the brush has a cap so it&#x27;s protected and doesn&#x27;t get damaged. The pencil is shaped in a triangle which is different but very cool. Great shade too! I seriously love this eyebrow pencil! Will be getting more for sure !!!!</li>
            <li> This us by far the best brow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve had very light eyebrows very dark hair since birth. Im always trYing new products.&lt;br /&gt;this is better then my $80 eyebrow kit from a high end line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never wanTed to recommend a product more.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was so highly rated, but I really fail to understand why. When you completely &amp;#34;unscrew&amp;#34; the product to see how much pencil is included, there&#x27;s barely more than 1&amp;#34; of the actual eyebrow pencil in the case. Instead of a traditional &amp;#34;point&amp;#34; on the pencil, it&#x27;s a triangle shape that&#x27;s much too wide to use strategically. This will only work well for someone who draws their eyebrows on entirely, and will not work well if you&#x27;re like me &amp; use pencil only to outline &amp; then fill in with brow powder or other filler. I tried outlining my brows using different angles and each time I ended up with way too wide of a line.&lt;br /&gt;The brush that&#x27;s included on the back end of the pencil ends in a metal point and is completely straight without any tapering, so once again it&#x27;s useless for any strategic blending or grooming; you can only use it sideways.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably made for women who completely draw in their brows; but no matter how many times I tried I couldn&#x27;t get this pencil to look natural. I could even forgive the fact that there is so little of the product included if it was better quality, but combine the minuscule amount compared to other brow products with the awkwardly shaped tip and unnatural look, I&#x27;d say that I struck out.</li>
            <li> this stuff is ok, i order this for my gf,,, she like it some what</li>
            <li> The edge of the liner easily creates an even brow shape!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use... The seller is very helpful too. Thx so much.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the quality of this pen is just soso. After using it for half month, the crayon inside the pen broke and now I have to open it carefully every time I use it. Well, I still love the color of the crayon and the brush feels good.</li>
            <li> Love the shape of the brow pencil. Applies smoothly and my brows look great afterwards!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try &amp;Eacute;tude House for some time now, after hearing about it on a few beauty blogs. I have rather light hair and chose #3, it works wonders! Love the shape of the pencil and love the way it transfers on.</li>
            <li> Love this eyebrow pencil. it took a ew days to get to use to it but it works perfect!</li>
            <li> Bought #3 very natural color!! The shape of the pencil is good!</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil! I am happy it comes with a spoolie brush and the formula is creamy, easy to apply, and the color is what I expected (brown). It stays on, for me, all day and I use it in my everyday makeup routine! I highly recommend and definitely repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the pen and the core, texture, and color very much.  I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is absolutely awesome - the color is very natural, the pencil is shaped into a triangular prism so it applies easily, and the brush helps even it out. Long lasting as well. Definitely a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a eyebrow pencil from another branch and i found this. It is similar to what i was looking for. I decided to give it a try. I expected it to deliver to me within 20-30 days as Amazon noticed, but I got it in my mail box just around 1 week after my order. Thumbs up for seller.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 more since my sister also like it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the delivery time. I came sooner than I expected. The product itself was brand new and sealed. Very powerful brow filling/drawing tool. This is so cheap comparing to those high-end cosmetics, but it gave the glide-on feeling when you use it (but it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;glide-on&amp;#34; as in &amp;#34;very creamy texture&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s just very easy to work with). I was actually surprised that the package came with two little Skinfood Gold Caviar Cream samples :D An overall great product</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people can hate this eyebrow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great! It lasts through a workout and sleeping with it on, but it will come off easily with makeup remover. This is coming from someone with a super oily T-zone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel pencil is soft and perfectly angled for perfect eyebrows. I&#x27;ve already bought 3 of these pencils, and honestly I can&#x27;t recommend them more. It takes playing around with them a bit to get your eyebrow tactic just right but when you do.. Dang, your eyebrows are going to look GOOD!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect for me, I dyed my hair a reddish brown that has faded quite a bit, and the #3 brown still looks good even if it is more of a cool brown now. The color itself is cooler in nature making it look natural.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Rescue Warrior Inc, they sent me this, a long with 3 free samples (a cute hair bow, skin food cream, and etude house lipstick)  I really recommend buying from this seller, the item shipped very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now about the product. There is two halfs of this. One side, is a brow brush, which is very useful for prepping your eyebrows. The other side is the product, it&#x27;s a retractable so you don&#x27;t have to sharpen it. The pencil shape is angled, and it&#x27;s perfect to get the thick side, and the thin side. The color it&#x27;s matched my eyebrows perfectly.</li>
            <li> It stays on well and the color is a bit brunette for my dyed midnight black hair.</li>
            <li> Overall , this is a great product.  Very inexpensive and it is easy to maneuver and control to create the perfect filled-in brow.  Would definitely buy again!  (Also, love the little samples I got from Etude House -- the Mint Choux was my favorite and makes me wish I had purchased that instead of the E.L.F. Mineral Infused Face Primer in Green...but there&#x27;s always next time!)</li>
            <li> Product came 1 1/2 week early than estimated delivery. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it. The perfect color!</li>
            <li> Will buy again. The best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit gray!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s not drawing smoothly</li>
            <li> I do like it however the crayon part is so thin and broke off pretty quick for me :(</li>
            <li> Great pencil and nice color! I dyed my hair a dark brown with warm highlights and needed a lighter brow color. My natural brow is black. I have this in 2 colors and I hope they don&#x27;t change the packaging. I love the spool on the end and the angled tip.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT..its great..it matches my eyebrow color and its not to dark..and i love that it have a eyebrow brush on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit picky when it comes to brow products--I&#x27;ve bought and tried almost every kind, from powder/brush sets, twisty eyebrow pencils, regular eyebrow pencils, waterproof eyebrow pens...so when I was about to purchase this Etude House Drawing Eye Brow pen I was naturally really skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn&#x27;t have been, at all.&lt;br /&gt;I like to go to for the light look and fill my brows in short strokes with the pencil, and it achieves the exact natural &#x27;Korean&#x27; type look that I would go for. On other days when I want some drama, I thicken my strokes and the pencil still works to create a heavier fill-in.&lt;br /&gt;Before this product I had been using Maybelline&#x27;s Define-A-Brow, which is also great but this is better by leaps and bounds, especially because a) the tip is shaped like a very acute triangle, meaning that there&#x27;s more thick-to-thin control, and b) on its other end it has the only brow brush known to man that is not too harsh to thin out what I had filled in before.&lt;br /&gt;I used the \\&quot;brown\\&quot; color and I have naturally black brows, but the color matched well and didn&#x27;t make my brows look too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any of Etude House&#x27;s products, and this one is no exception. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product was much better than I had expected. The angled tip makes it really easy to use and you can do small strokes for a lighter shade or heavier strokes for a darker shade. Both are easy to achieve with this product! I have black brows and expected the brown color to show, but I was surprised to find that it blended in quite well. I would definitely recommend this to anybody!</li>
            <li> I love the color! It&#x27;s more of an ashy Brown and it matches my dark hair perfectly!  It definitely gives off more of a natural look, but with a heavy hand you can get a bold look.</li>
            <li> I love this product...works great</li>
            <li> Great buildable color so it&#x27;s easy to get a natural looking brow. It rubs off easier than most eyebrow pencils but It&#x27;s so natural that I don&#x27;t mind- some primer helps to fix that.</li>
            <li> One of the nicer eyebrow pencils I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The tip is desired in today&#x27;s style regarding eyebrow drawing.  I&#x27;ve been drawing my eyebrows for years and always use a pointy tip to do it, however to keep myself current this is certainly a nice alternative.  The kohl is soft and smooth so you don&#x27;t need to press so hard.</li>
            <li> Great angle for making natural brows. Rather dark. Stiff, may need to be warmed before using.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pen takes a very slight hand to apply.  The color is very rich, and the product is soft.  Its very easy to over do it with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color i chose is ideal for people with black to brown/black hair.  If you hair is lighter than this, go for a lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen is thicker on one end and pointed at the other.  This makes lining and filling your brows easy.  I use the brow brush to set before application and blend following application.  This would be a good product for someone just starting to learn how to fill in their brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not good if you don&#x27;t have eyebrows or have extremely sparse/thin eyebrow sand need to draw them on from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the shape of the applicator is ideal for producing the popular &amp;#34;straight brow&amp;#34; look that is so popular in Korea.</li>
            <li> smears, not waterproof.</li>
            <li> Out of numerous eyebrow pencils I have tried I find this looks the most natural and is very easy to use. It darkens some of my eyebrows that are lightening with age and makes my eyebrows look thicker. I already bought a second one.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is great! It goes on easily and smoothly.  It has good staying power, and the angled shape is helpful. The color is a bit darker than expected, but that&#x27;s ok.  I just go over it will a little face powder and it looks totally natural.  I only wish that it didn&#x27;t take so long to arrive.  By all means try this pencil, but if you like it, order a replacement right away, so that you will have it by the time the first one runs out.</li>
            <li> Perfect brow pencil.  Love the quality.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s not too soft (which I hate for brow pencil) and the brush works awesome. Used it everyday and it works great</li>
            <li> great product and delivery!</li>
    </ol>
