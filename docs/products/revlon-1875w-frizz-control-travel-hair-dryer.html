            <li>it&#x27;s soooo girly with its bright pink color.</li>

            <li>this was a gift - don&#x27;t know how it works - but it sure is cute and PINK!</li>
            <li>I can take it anywhere I travel, and it works very, very well.  </li>
            <li>Love that it came with an attachment just like my regular sized one did.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive, lightweight, cute color, and it had a converter thingie for the different electricity.  </li>
            <li>When we first got to France, I plugged it into one of those converter things I&#x27;d brought along anyway and just used it that way.  </li>
            <li>this is my 4 th same dryer, I love it , light and veery powerful, i have lots of hair dry fast, and light</li>
            <li>, it sometimes last 2 year, but I still love, cheap and very good, buy this folded travel one, don&#x27;t buy the one looks same but can&#x27;t folded, its more heavy and not powerful than this one .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight makes this dryer easy to use and the power lets you dry hair fast.</li>
            <li>very noisy and too hot</li>
            <li>It did OK on low, but when we tried high, it started smoking --</li>
            <li>It folds well and buttons are easy to use unlike the gigantic Revlon &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer I just sent back!</li>
            <li>Just a minor annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But its longevity and power make me love it so much.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really equate to being a travel dryer.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this small hairdryer.</li>
            <li>so much I am using it every night.</li>
            <li>I love my girly pink hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>I also love it because it&#x27;s nice and small folds and is PINK!!)</li>
            <li>So bought a new, identical one to replace it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits in my small or large suitcase, it&#x27;s light, and it folds to become compact.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this same exact blow dryer since I was 14 years old.</li>
            <li>I love this blowdryer because of how high powered it is and how fast it dries my long hair, and the light weight so my arm doesnt get tired holding it for too long,  Update:</li>
            <li>so your hand won&#x27;t be tired and nice to travel</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has two settings -- Low and High.</li>
            <li>Dried my hair faster than my full sized.</li>
            <li>but ran a little too hot on high.</li>
            <li>it does cool down for a short stime, but then goes back to the high setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful but still small.</li>
            <li>After turning it back on High, it would have very low heat/airflow for several moments (as if it were on Low) before going to High again.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think that with it&#x27;s small size it might take longer to work, but I think it works just as quickly as my full-size dryer at home.  </li>
            <li>I only used High, and it was powerful for such a small dryer!</li>
            <li>It is about the average sound of a regular hair dryer, but takes less than 1/3 of the space in my bag.  </li>

            <li> Love it. Dries quickly and packs well for travel.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would be that tiny! Does the job though</li>
            <li> this is my 4 th same dryer, I love it , light and veery powerful, i have lots of hair dry fast, and light so your hand won&#x27;t be tired and nice to travel, it sometimes last 2 year, but I still love, cheap and very good, buy this folded travel one, don&#x27;t buy the one looks same but can&#x27;t folded, its more heavy and not powerful than this one .</li>
            <li> very noisy and too hot</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer as it had 2 heat settings and a multiple voltage.  I can only get one of the heat settings to work and its very difficult to adjust the voltage.  I bought the dryer as a travel dryer, however the cord is so thick and heavy it doesn&#x27;t really equate to being a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling and tried it before my trip. I&#x27;m glad I did! It&#x27;s light weight and compact but it made my hair frizzy. I tried it twice and got the same results.</li>
            <li> Works great...it does cool down for a short stime, but then goes back to the high setting.  Not a problem for me.  The size and power make this a perfect travel dryer.</li>
            <li> My mom whose a stylist and uses all professional products was shocked when she used my dryer. She was like that&#x27;s the fastest I&#x27;ve ever dried my hair your blow dryer kicks butt!! 👍 (plus I also love it because it&#x27;s nice and small folds and is PINK!!) ☺️</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this small hairdryer. It&#x27;s very powerful but still small. And most important thing is dual voltage, so you can carry it in your luggage all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it&#x27;s soooo girly with its bright pink color.</li>
            <li> Purchased this prior to a trip to DC, is a smaller travel size version of my at home regular sized blow dryer I use on a daily basis. Love that it came with an attachment just like my regular sized one did. Works great, very powerful.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer definitely packs a punch. Dried my hair faster than my full sized. I haven&#x27;t tried it out of the country yet, just a little road trip. It&#x27;s a great product, works well &amp; definitely woth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect little travel dryer. It fits in my small or large suitcase, it&#x27;s light, and it folds to become compact. It&#x27;s not too small either. I have long hair and it works great. The color is fun and I recommend buying one with the attachment this comes with.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight dryer with lots of power.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in Europe.  It was inexpensive, lightweight, cute color, and it had a converter thingie for the different electricity.  When we first got to France, I plugged it into one of those converter things I&#x27;d brought along anyway and just used it that way.  It did OK on low, but when we tried high, it started smoking -- like immediately!  Later, we tried using the converter thingie that comes on the handle, turned it on low, and it sounded very strange.  From then on, we were wary of using it at all.  It&#x27;s terrible.  Keep shopping.</li>
            <li> I love this blowdryer because of how high powered it is and how fast it dries my long hair, and the light weight so my arm doesnt get tired holding it for too long,  Update: it&#x27;s been about a year since I bought this blowdryer, and it&#x27;s still going strong. I have been buying this same exact blow dryer since I was 14 years old. Only had two buy it two times since then because they last that long, and I&#x27;m 22 now! I love it.</li>
            <li> ideal for my Granddaughter from Santa</li>
            <li> I stuck white pokadot stickers on it for granddaughter. She uses it for play</li>
            <li> I love my girly pink hair dryer!  I can take it anywhere I travel, and it works very, very well.  It is about the average sound of a regular hair dryer, but takes less than 1/3 of the space in my bag.  You&#x27;d think that with it&#x27;s small size it might take longer to work, but I think it works just as quickly as my full-size dryer at home.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll replace my big dryer at home when it dies...I may just use my petite, pink dryer instead.</li>
            <li> light weight and easy to pack....but ran a little too hot on high.</li>
            <li> Super noisy and difficult for manage the cooler botton!</li>
            <li> I only take a carryon when I travel and this is the perfect size and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Works well but takes some getting used to when the high heat setting automatically changes to low/cool every half minute or so.  It&#x27;s still way bigger than my last travel hair dryer too.  It folds well and buttons are easy to use unlike the gigantic Revlon &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer I just sent back!</li>
            <li> Great product. I keep it in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these blow dryers about three years ago while living in another state. I ended up using this baby every single day!! It also traveled with me. It finally kicked the bucket a month ago after suffering injuries from its millionth plane ride. So bought a new, identical one to replace it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two settings -- Low and High. I only used High, and it was powerful for such a small dryer! Very strong airflow and good heat. It did have one little quirk: Sometimes I would turn it off after using it for a few minutes on High, then I&#x27;d realize I needed to turn it on again. After turning it back on High, it would have very low heat/airflow for several moments (as if it were on Low) before going to High again. Just a minor annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But its longevity and power make me love it so much. And it folds up so nicely and travels well. And it&#x27;s pink! I could write a Shakespearean sonnet about this stupid thing. Just buy it!</li>
            <li> this was a gift - don&#x27;t know how it works - but it sure is cute and PINK!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight makes this dryer easy to use and the power lets you dry hair fast. The folding feature makes it great for travel. Hi and low power settings gives you styling flexibility. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for our camper since it folds up. I like it so much I am using it every night.</li>
