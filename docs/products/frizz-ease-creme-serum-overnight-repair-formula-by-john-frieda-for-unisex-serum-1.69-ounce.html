            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a win, win because in the morning your hair after washing is not as frizzy....</li>
            <li>This product is very nice on your hair.  </li>
            <li>It also smells very nice.</li>
            <li>It still felt good though which was a plus...</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to Loreal Everstrong Overnight Hair Repair Treatment, which works great and is free of parabens, sulfates, etc.</li>
            <li>It was amazing...</li>
            <li>I like this product it seems to work and smells really nice, but the instructions are to use it at night before you are going to shampoo your hair.</li>
            <li>put it in, go to bed, your hair smells nice</li>
            <li>I have long,curly/frizzy hair so far this is the BEST!!</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly, and really does a great job!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light</li>
            <li>I love this John Frieda product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not what the bottle directed, but I thought it would be ok.  </li>
            <li>I guess, like with most products, it can vary for everyone.     </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s overnight..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>After so many years of looking for a solution for my unruly hair</li>
            <li>Not the best product I have used, but I actually use it when I get out of the shower, not at night.</li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars. :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this product given that the reviews were good and because some times we don&#x27;t have much time or patience to wait for a product to work on our hair!    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good on your hair alone...</li>
            <li>I use a lot of different Frizz Ease Products to treat my hair, and they are all good, but this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>such a great product, I keep using it more and more.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use....</li>
            <li>When I applied it the first night, my hair looked and felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it at a bargain/discount store; I don&#x27;t feel as foolish as I would have if I&#x27;d paid full price.  </li>
            <li>The Overnight Repair Formula didn&#x27;t hurt my hair, but I honestly felt it didn&#x27;t do much for it either.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely light with no build up.</li>
            <li>It makes her hair look untangle, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>and it is a light way to add some hydration to your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looked great when I walked out the door, but by lunch, the look/feel was gone and my hair looked extremely dry and not as smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited for the results it would give me.</li>
            <li>It is so worth getting!</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>So the no-residue part of the claim is true, and after washing my hair the next day it looked freakin&#x27; amazing!</li>
            <li>All silky and soft and lying in perfect waves that sort of flowed around altogether, and when I brushed my hair during the day I didn&#x27;t get those pieces breaking off</li>
            <li>I dye my hair quite often, and this certainly does the job to help keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li>This product is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>I see no difference, its honestly just another creme serum that really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I am African american, and this works perfectly on my hair.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to use it consistently, but I bet you&#x27;ll see an improvement the very first time you use it!</li>
            <li>I have tried hair masks, but due to the location I am in, I have to go outside to use the latrine (bathroom) and have to wash the hair mask out, so this is perfect to leave in overnight, and really does help leave my hair feeling  a lot better.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good product but don&#x27;t expect it to change your hair or leave it all new and soft and shiny..</li>
            <li>My hair used to be really fine and straight</li>
            <li>, I double process my own hair</li>
            <li>and this is our favorite, by far.</li>
            <li>Truly worth the money.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll be offended and pleased at the same time; it&#x27;s fun to confuse her.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great my hair straightens easily, it&#x27;s not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>So maybe it would have made a bigger difference if my hair was normally more frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Occasionally I also will add Alterna Anti-Aging Caviar Hair Rescue, which works pretty well, but I see more immediate results with the Everstrong.</li>
            <li>The next day you just wash your hair normally and it will be really soft, with a nice shine!    </li>
            <li>haha!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products on her</li>
            <li>Thanks Frizz-Ease!</li>
            <li>I have tried several other products and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>once I put it on to sleep and had to go out fast.. didn&#x27;t do much to my hair and it looked  pretty well with it!</li>
            <li>For a TINY little bottle, I was hoping for a more concentrated, deeply effective treatment.  </li>
            <li>It dries up pretty fast, you don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything in your hair, so it won&#x27;t leave stains.    </li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone with dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on my hair that day (and I was long overdue for a cut)!  </li>
            <li>Actually, my hair looked drier than normal, although that could have just been my perception because I read rave reviews and was expecting more from this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very frizzy within the first day of being straightened, but using this helps SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better for my dry and frizzy hair</li>
            <li>all most of my dry split-ends were gone.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and has been damaged due to coloring and heat.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe that through a tiny free sample I stumbled upon a product that absolutely delivers what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the hair very well.</li>
            <li>It was sticky, and my very frizzy, poofy hair didn&#x27;t like it, but i didn&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li>I have very course, wavy, and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I put it on in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready and just leave it on all day.  </li>
            <li>My mother (Caucasian) raved about this product and the results that it gave her, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>but if your hair is very frizzy (like mine..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone battle the frizz!</li>
            <li>This product rocks so much.</li>
            <li>And yes, this works on any hairtype plus it really does repair you hair.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>You also seem to get more for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used more than I was supposed to the first night because I didn&#x27;t believe a little bit of anything would work on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to use on dry hair when you notice a little frizz.</li>
            <li>When I was drying my hair the next day, I was absolutely amazed at how soft and smooth my hair felt.  </li>
            <li>I have used it in it my hair overnight and true to its word, no residue is left on the pillow.</li>
            <li>I live this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much more success with other products, such as anything by Ion.</li>
            <li>Okay, I admit it, I used nearly half the bottle, and it didn&#x27;t leave anything on my bedding.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair healthier and more conditioned (and less static-prone in the Winter) without making it greasy or getting all over my pillow.</li>
            <li>I do notice my hair feels softer and looks a little better after using it overnight.  </li>
            <li>I have fine wavy flyaway hair which constantly flies away especially in humid weather--no matter how much mousse gel or spray</li>
            <li>My 2 year old daughter has very curly hair that rapidly frizzes.</li>
            <li>I had applied and my hair looked drier than normal.</li>
            <li>I use this every night and after just a few days there&#x27;s a huge difference in the quality of my hair, I am finding John Frieda&#x27;s product line is very affordable and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very versatile; I comb it through clean, damp hair and let it dry naturally or sprunch as I blow dry, and I get pretty, soft, nice-smelling waves.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I applied to the ends, tied it back and went to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference when it came to my hair after the first night of using it.</li>
            <li>AT first I used it only for 2-3 hours and thought it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m working my way down to the recommended amount and my hair still looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li>In the past I used the clear gel which was OK</li>
            <li>My hair breaks easily, frizzes, is fine and limp with little body.</li>
            <li>I bought this only because of the reviews here, which (until now) have been unanimously and overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and extremely soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Seriously, it really didn&#x27;t, and there was enough in my hair that my chihuahua was trying to eat it.  </li>
            <li>I hope those are natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have put it in her dry hair a few times and it noticeably improves it, but I prefer to use it as a styling/smoothing cream instead of the many serums we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s long, straight and frizzy)..</li>
            <li>Though my hair is not perfect, it feels much better and looks healthier!</li>
            <li>I actually put it in right after her bath when her hair is still wet.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to reduce frizz and transform my dry, slightly frizzy hair into \\&quot;smooth, glossy\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to be dry, as curly hair often does, particularly in the Summer and Winter.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and it is so dry that this is a must.</li>
            <li>, I have very long, wavy hair that I blow dry straight every day, so it has some heat damage.  </li>
            <li>It made my dry, damaged hair feel soft and smoother just after one application.  </li>
            <li>I saw NO DIFFERENCE on my naturally curly/wavy anglo hair after multiple uses overnight on dry hair,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not extremely frizzy normally, just a little.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It absorbs into the hair very well.</li>
            <li> It was sticky, and my very frizzy, poofy hair didn&#x27;t like it, but i didn&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li> I have very course, wavy, and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready and just leave it on all day.  </li>
            <li> My mother (Caucasian) raved about this product and the results that it gave her, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> but if your hair is very frizzy (like mine..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone battle the frizz!</li>
            <li> This product rocks so much.</li>
            <li> And yes, this works on any hairtype plus it really does repair you hair.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> You also seem to get more for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used more than I was supposed to the first night because I didn&#x27;t believe a little bit of anything would work on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to use on dry hair when you notice a little frizz.</li>
            <li> When I was drying my hair the next day, I was absolutely amazed at how soft and smooth my hair felt.  </li>
            <li> I have used it in it my hair overnight and true to its word, no residue is left on the pillow.</li>
            <li> I live this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much more success with other products, such as anything by Ion.</li>
            <li> Okay, I admit it, I used nearly half the bottle, and it didn&#x27;t leave anything on my bedding.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair healthier and more conditioned (and less static-prone in the Winter) without making it greasy or getting all over my pillow.</li>
            <li> I do notice my hair feels softer and looks a little better after using it overnight.  </li>
            <li> I have fine wavy flyaway hair which constantly flies away especially in humid weather--no matter how much mousse gel or spray</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter has very curly hair that rapidly frizzes.</li>
            <li> I had applied and my hair looked drier than normal.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and after just a few days there&#x27;s a huge difference in the quality of my hair, I am finding John Frieda&#x27;s product line is very affordable and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very versatile; I comb it through clean, damp hair and let it dry naturally or sprunch as I blow dry, and I get pretty, soft, nice-smelling waves.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I applied to the ends, tied it back and went to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference when it came to my hair after the first night of using it.</li>
            <li> AT first I used it only for 2-3 hours and thought it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working my way down to the recommended amount and my hair still looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li> In the past I used the clear gel which was OK</li>
            <li> My hair breaks easily, frizzes, is fine and limp with little body.</li>
            <li> I bought this only because of the reviews here, which (until now) have been unanimously and overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and extremely soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it really didn&#x27;t, and there was enough in my hair that my chihuahua was trying to eat it.  </li>
            <li> I hope those are natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have put it in her dry hair a few times and it noticeably improves it, but I prefer to use it as a styling/smoothing cream instead of the many serums we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s long, straight and frizzy)..</li>
            <li> Though my hair is not perfect, it feels much better and looks healthier!</li>

            <li> It made my dry, damaged hair feel soft and smoother just after one application.  </li>
            <li> I saw NO DIFFERENCE on my naturally curly/wavy anglo hair after multiple uses overnight on dry hair,</li>

            <li> I think that&#x27;s fine since it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
            <li> It dries soft and curly in little ringlets, without any stiffness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three stars because it didn&#x27;t leave a residue on my pillow, and did make a minor difference.</li>

            <li> Because I don&#x27;t put anything into it, it&#x27;s become damaged, and dry.</li>
            <li> It was slightly easier to comb through my wet hair than usual (my hair gets very knotty), but</li>

            <li> I also found that it was a little difficult to distribute through may mangled mop as easily as I hoped for.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll try it on wet hair as a leave-in, but I&#x27;m not keeping my hopes up.  </li>
            <li> I spent weeks buying all sorts of conditioners - of all prices and types.  </li>
            <li> I admit I have been using it in wet hair and as a leave in it works so well.  </li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling a little weighed down.  </li>
            <li> we usually sleep at night with nothing in our hair.. and you put this on and it actually does something!</li>
            <li> I applied just a little after flat ironing it, and in the morning, my hair was sleek and MUCH less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I just wish I could jump up and down about it like other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Just a little less knotty.</li>
            <li> This serum is terrific, my hair is long thin &amp; frizzy!</li>
            <li> so it gets a little fried, so</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length hair that tends to feel rough underneath from split/dry ends.  </li>
            <li> and if you use it everyday you will get that result..</li>
            <li> It was not any softer than usual, nor any shinier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been improvising and using a small dab when my hair is damp, and noticed it helps keep my style from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my pillow sticky, and it didn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, but it&#x27;s basically no better than any deep conditioner you can get at a drug store.</li>
            <li> I wish this would have worked for me, but i guess my hair is too thick for this.</li>
            <li> I mean think about it..</li>
            <li> I had color correction done after a bad dye job and my hair was majorly damaged.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works on thick hair, it probably works on people who have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m narcoleptic and take a lot of naps so my hair ALWAYS looks terrible -- frizzed up on one side and flattened on the other, then it slowly bushes out until my next nap.  </li>
            <li> and I mean a very small amount of it, took hopelessly damaged, fried, frizzed ends and changed their texture!</li>
            <li> Too bad that it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> Sadly, i woke up, washed my hair, and....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say it didn&#x27;t transform my hair.  </li>
            <li> I hate to waste money</li>
            <li> that make it impossible to grow my hair longer than my shoulders.</li>
            <li> so I needed this product badly to prevent split ends.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this John Frieda product. It absorbs into the hair very well. Improves the health and condition of my hair overnight.</li>
            <li> With all the glowing reviews, i had to try this. The night i received the product, i immediately tried it. I was so excited for the results it would give me. It was sticky, and my very frizzy, poofy hair didn&#x27;t like it, but i didn&#x27;t give up on it. Sadly, i woke up, washed my hair, and....Nothing! It didn&#x27;t do anything. I tried it again the third night, and nothing. I&#x27;m almost out with no result. I wish this would have worked for me, but i guess my hair is too thick for this.</li>
            <li> A man&#x27;s review:    I have very course, wavy, and frizzy hair.  I use a lot of different Frizz Ease Products to treat my hair, and they are all good, but this one is the best by far.  In the past I used the clear gel which was OK but it left my hair feeling a little weighed down.  Not this.  This adds shine and my hair actually cooperates with me when I style it!  It layers perfectly.  I don&#x27;t use it as an overnight treatment.  I put it on in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready and just leave it on all day.  My hair just looks great with this stuff.  It has actually improved my self confidence! 5 STARS</li>
            <li> I bought this only because of the reviews here, which (until now) have been unanimously and overwhelmingly positive. I put a quarter-sized amount into my hair and left it on overnight, washed it the next day, and the difference was tiny. It was slightly easier to comb through my wet hair than usual (my hair gets very knotty), but aside from that, nothing. It was not any softer than usual, nor any shinier. Just a little less knotty. I tried it again a couple of weeks later, with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have very long, wavy hair that I blow dry straight every day, so it has some heat damage.  It&#x27;s not extremely frizzy normally, just a little. So maybe it would have made a bigger difference if my hair was normally more frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars because it didn&#x27;t leave a residue on my pillow, and did make a minor difference. I just wish I could jump up and down about it like other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Product is so convenient to use, just apply to hair and the next morning shampoo.  It leaves my hair shiny and extremely soft to the touch. -jhodgkin</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length hair that tends to feel rough underneath from split/dry ends.  The first time I used this product, I applied to the ends, tied it back and went to sleep.  When I was drying my hair the next day, I was absolutely amazed at how soft and smooth my hair felt.  I got so many compliments on my hair that day (and I was long overdue for a cut)!  It really is great and I use it any time my hair feels rough.  It is so worth getting!</li>
            <li> For a TINY little bottle, I was hoping for a more concentrated, deeply effective treatment.  I saw NO DIFFERENCE on my naturally curly/wavy anglo hair after multiple uses overnight on dry hair, which is what the directions say.  I&#x27;ll try it on wet hair as a leave-in, but I&#x27;m not keeping my hopes up.  Glad I bought it at a bargain/discount store; I don&#x27;t feel as foolish as I would have if I&#x27;d paid full price.  I&#x27;ve had much more success with other products, such as anything by Ion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works, I double process my own hair so it gets a little fried, so I use this every night and after just a few days there&#x27;s a huge difference in the quality of my hair, I am finding John Frieda&#x27;s product line is very affordable and such a great product, I keep using it more and more.  Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried does what it claims except for this product, thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to reduce frizz and transform my dry, slightly frizzy hair into \\&quot;smooth, glossy\\&quot; hair.  When I applied it the first night, my hair looked and felt amazing.  I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.  However by the next morning, it didn&#x27;t look like I had applied anything at all the night before.  I&#x27;m sorry to say it didn&#x27;t transform my hair.  Actually, my hair looked drier than normal, although that could have just been my perception because I read rave reviews and was expecting more from this product.  I next tried applying it in the morning before heading to work.  That&#x27;s not what the bottle directed, but I thought it would be ok.  My hair looked great when I walked out the door, but by lunch, the look/feel was gone and my hair looked extremely dry and not as smooth.  It still felt good though which was a plus...I guess.  Since the morning application was a bust, I went back to applying it at night as recommeneded.  The Overnight Repair Formula didn&#x27;t hurt my hair, but I honestly felt it didn&#x27;t do much for it either.  I hate to waste money so I used the entire bottle, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed with Caucasian, Black and Native American, so I have a lot to contend with when it comes to my hair. My mother (Caucasian) raved about this product and the results that it gave her, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me. I also found that it was a little difficult to distribute through may mangled mop as easily as I hoped for. I guess, like with most products, it can vary for everyone.     I&#x27;ve since switched to Loreal Everstrong Overnight Hair Repair Treatment, which works great and is free of parabens, sulfates, etc. You also seem to get more for nearly the same price. Occasionally I also will add Alterna Anti-Aging Caviar Hair Rescue, which works pretty well, but I see more immediate results with the Everstrong.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product given that the reviews were good and because some times we don&#x27;t have much time or patience to wait for a product to work on our hair!    This one is not greasy, and does not stain or stick on the pillow. The next day you just wash your hair normally and it will be really soft, with a nice shine!    I would recommend it. Too bad that it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease Creme Serum product wouldn&#x27;t work on ethnic hair but it does. The non-greasy serum works wonders! it&#x27;s completely light with no build up. I flat iron my hair daily so I needed this product badly to prevent split ends. My hair is very healthy looking with a great lustre I love it! I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s overnight.. I mean think about it.. we usually sleep at night with nothing in our hair.. and you put this on and it actually does something! But okey it&#x27;s not a miracle.. it does help the hair to be softer and less frizzy the next night.. and if you use it everyday you will get that result.. but if your hair is very frizzy (like mine.. that&#x27;s long, straight and frizzy).. it won&#x27;t end ALL the frizz, just some of it.    Nonetheless, i do see some difference on the days that I use it.. actually if it wasn&#x27;t just for night it&#x27;s pretty good on your hair alone... once I put it on to sleep and had to go out fast.. didn&#x27;t do much to my hair and it looked  pretty well with it! haha!    It dries up pretty fast, you don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything in your hair, so it won&#x27;t leave stains.    So it&#x27;s a good product but don&#x27;t expect it to change your hair or leave it all new and soft and shiny.. just maybe a littlebit.. I think that&#x27;s fine since it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
            <li> This did nothing to improve frizz or split ends, but it did make my hair softer feeling and didn&#x27;t leave any residue on my pillow. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> Received quickly in good condition.  This product is very nice on your hair.  My hair is very fine and has been damaged due to coloring and heat.  I do notice my hair feels softer and looks a little better after using it overnight.  It is not a miracle cure for the damage I have but it does help.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter has very curly hair that rapidly frizzes. I&#x27;ve tried many different products on her (Frizz Ease day serum, Redken Anti-Snap, Sebastian Potion 9) and this is our favorite, by far. I actually put it in right after her bath when her hair is still wet. It dries soft and curly in little ringlets, without any stiffness. I have put it in her dry hair a few times and it noticeably improves it, but I prefer to use it as a styling/smoothing cream instead of the many serums we&#x27;ve tried. I love it!</li>
            <li> I had color correction done after a bad dye job and my hair was majorly damaged.  I spent weeks buying all sorts of conditioners - of all prices and types.  This product was the cure.  It made my dry, damaged hair feel soft and smoother just after one application.  Though my hair is not perfect, it feels much better and looks healthier!</li>
            <li> Frizz-Ease Creme Serum Overnight helps condition my hair before shampooing. My hair breaks easily, frizzes, is fine and limp with little body. This product helps with all these problems.</li>
            <li> It did make my hair softer, but it wasn&#x27;t any shinier than before I used the product. And \\&quot;repair\\&quot; is definitely a bit of a stretch in this instance. It didn&#x27;t make my pillow sticky, and it didn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, but it&#x27;s basically no better than any deep conditioner you can get at a drug store.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly, and really does a great job!  I dye my hair quite often, and this certainly does the job to help keep it healthy.  I have tried hair masks, but due to the location I am in, I have to go outside to use the latrine (bathroom) and have to wash the hair mask out, so this is perfect to leave in overnight, and really does help leave my hair feeling  a lot better.  Thanks Frizz-Ease!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this overnight serum but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed, it just didn&#x27;t deliever. I did notice that it leaves my hair a bit softer, but once I wash it out I see no difference, its honestly just another creme serum that really doesn&#x27;t do much. I don&#x27;t think it works on thick hair, it probably works on people who have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have tried several other products and this is by far the best.  I use it as a leave in conditioner also and it works great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this stuff works.  I&#x27;ve never written a review on anything before, but I feel strongly enough about this product to write one.  My hair used to be really fine and straight but it&#x27;s recently become coarser and thicker and frizzy.  Now that I think about it, it looks a lot like my last boyfriend&#x27;s pub... um, hair.  Oh God, I have to stock up on this product so I can get that image out of my head.  Off my head.  I&#x27;m going to Target as soon as I&#x27;m done here.  Anyway, I used more than I was supposed to the first night because I didn&#x27;t believe a little bit of anything would work on my hair.  Okay, I admit it, I used nearly half the bottle, and it didn&#x27;t leave anything on my bedding.  Seriously, it really didn&#x27;t, and there was enough in my hair that my chihuahua was trying to eat it.  I hope those are natural ingredients.  So the no-residue part of the claim is true, and after washing my hair the next day it looked freakin&#x27; amazing! All silky and soft and lying in perfect waves that sort of flowed around altogether, and when I brushed my hair during the day I didn&#x27;t get those pieces breaking off that make it impossible to grow my hair longer than my shoulders. I&#x27;m narcoleptic and take a lot of naps so my hair ALWAYS looks terrible -- frizzed up on one side and flattened on the other, then it slowly bushes out until my next nap.  I now have nap-proof hair.  I&#x27;m working my way down to the recommended amount and my hair still looks fabulous.  I absolutely love this stuff.  I&#x27;m getting my sister enough to last until her perm grows out. She&#x27;ll be offended and pleased at the same time; it&#x27;s fun to confuse her.</li>
            <li> I have long,curly/frizzy hair so far this is the BEST!! overnight hair treatment ever use LOVE IT!!! and recommended to anybody.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny!  I cannot believe that through a tiny free sample I stumbled upon a product that absolutely delivers what it says it will do. Imagine that:  A PRODUCT THAT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO!!  This product, and I mean a very small amount of it, took hopelessly damaged, fried, frizzed ends and changed their texture! And the results don&#x27;t revert; the ends get softer, smoother and straighter with each use.  THERE IS NO BUILDUP.  With this I don&#x27;t need a flat iron or a curling iron which I don&#x27;t like to use anyway.  Girls, run and buy this product.  I immediately went out and bought two bottles.  I admit I have been using it in wet hair and as a leave in it works so well.  I will never be without this.</li>
            <li> This does for hair what night cream does for your face.  I live in Arizona and it is so dry that this is a must.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy flyaway hair which constantly flies away especially in humid weather--no matter how much mousse gel or spray I use to keep it in place.  With this product my hair stays put under all weather conditions and looks great.  After so many years of looking for a solution for my unruly hair I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve finally found one!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I bought to my daughter and she loved it!!!  It makes her hair look untangle, shiny and smooth.I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is a dream come true. I have used it in it my hair overnight and true to its word, no residue is left on the pillow. It&#x27;s also very light so I don&#x27;t have to shampoo it out the next day. It&#x27;s also very versatile; I comb it through clean, damp hair and let it dry naturally or sprunch as I blow dry, and I get pretty, soft, nice-smelling waves. It&#x27;s also great to use on dry hair when you notice a little frizz.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream for someone that needs added moisture. Not the best product I have used, but I actually use it when I get out of the shower, not at night. I mix it with my hair serum and it is a light way to add some hydration to your hair. It also smells very nice.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair (without the use of any serums, etc, because they tend to make my hair greasy). Because I don&#x27;t put anything into it, it&#x27;s become damaged, and dry. It&#x27;s very frizzy within the first day of being straightened, but using this helps SO MUCH. I applied just a little after flat ironing it, and in the morning, my hair was sleek and MUCH less frizzy. I highly recommend this product for anyone battle the frizz!</li>
            <li> This serum is terrific, my hair is long thin &amp; frizzy! This stuff is great my hair straightens easily, it&#x27;s not greasy at all! I live this product!</li>
            <li> Frizz-Ease Creme Serum Overnight Repair formula by John Frieda for Unisex. This is very good for my hair for the day time after use at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for close to a month now. It&#x27;s definitely helped improve the overall condition of my hair, and I am seeing less split ends and less breakage. I&#x27;ve also been improvising and using a small dab when my hair is damp, and noticed it helps keep my style from being frizzy. It smells pretty good, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone with dry, damaged hair. You&#x27;ll need to use it consistently, but I bet you&#x27;ll see an improvement the very first time you use it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry, as curly hair often does, particularly in the Summer and Winter. This makes my hair healthier and more conditioned (and less static-prone in the Winter) without making it greasy or getting all over my pillow. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am African american, and this works perfectly on my hair. I noticed a big difference when it came to my hair after the first night of using it. This is definetly a product everyone should have in their stash of beauty products. If you want your hair to feel and look its best, this is the product for you. This product rocks so much. And yes, this works on any hairtype plus it really does repair you hair. I give it 5 stars. :)</li>
            <li> There is nothing better for my dry and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It really works. AT first I used it only for 2-3 hours and thought it doesn&#x27;t work but then I tried it as per the instructions and used it overnight. It was amazing...all most of my dry split-ends were gone. Truly worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;Pour kitchen olive oil on your head, is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;enjoy!</li>
            <li> I had applied and my hair looked drier than normal.</li>
            <li> I like this product it seems to work and smells really nice, but the instructions are to use it at night before you are going to shampoo your hair. The problem with it is that I can never remember to use it. I am starting to understand why John Frieda discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and it&#x27;s so easy to use....put it in, go to bed, your hair smells nice&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a win, win because in the morning your hair after washing is not as frizzy....</li>
