            <li>It is as good as any I have used and isn&#x27;t as greasy as some.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be good on this for a while</li>
            <li>Therefore, I ran out to the store in search of a good eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to think anything good about this foul substance!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue to buy it because the price is good, and the moisturzing, etc.</li>
            <li>so good luck to all...</li>
            <li>This is a great every-day lotion that smells nice and provides 24 hour moisture.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product.</li>
            <li>While it was a great moisturizer, I also found the smell to be a bit overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could give this a good review but to be honest I didn&#x27;t even use it.  </li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>but I personally love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Ordering more ASAP!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and my results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>the skin firming is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, this is a nice moisturizer with maybe some skin firming effects.</li>
            <li>This is a nice formulation of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it is nice for the skin.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, it seems like a nice lotion, but just be warned that it may be too strong!</li>
            <li>Love this light product and it smells great, but not too perfumy</li>
            <li>But I would say this is the best, and I mean THE BEST body lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a very light feel and glides on nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced this product helped me keep away stretch marks &amp; kept my skin in good condition while pregnant!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or \\&quot;girly\\&quot;, it smells kind of exotic.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, i love the way it feels, not a greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and feel which is good because I am in Texas in the summer.</li>
            <li>Good lotion; nothing particularly special about it.</li>
            <li>Its not expensive, so great value for what it does...</li>
            <li>Happy to say my legs are smooth and scale free and have been ever since I started using this after seeing a recommendation in some women&#x27;s magazine many moons ago.</li>
            <li>Happy to say my legs are smooth and scale free and have been ever since I started using this after seeing a recommendation in some women&#x27;s magazine many moons ago.</li>
            <li>The scent is great smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is easy to put on, no streaking it absorbs in nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always love Nivea products in general, and now really love having CoQ10 incorporated into their best lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I like the pump bottle better.</li>
            <li>There is more in it.</li>
            <li>But if you are dieting and want your skin to bounce back or need to rejuvenate your skin texture, its excellent.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I love the Nivea</li>
            <li>Now my favorite lotion has joined in, with [[ASIN:B001FB5IDW</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to say that this Nivea Q10 did not cause me issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li>(which is what most moisturizers do).     </li>
            <li>Does better after a shower or bath to me.</li>
            <li>UPDATE--2/24/10: The skin-firming qualities of the lotion are okay, but</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d get better results with any lotion from the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter line.</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>but I sure do like this lotion.</li>
            <li>and I do put around my eyes and it seems to be making the skin look a bit softer and wrinkles not as prominent.  </li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love nivea products, so I bought this and started using it all over immeidately.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use as it does make my skin look more radiant.</li>
            <li>but if People did more exercise, sleep and eat healthy than this would probably be a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so be sure to apply sparingly.  </li>
            <li>and I use it on my stomach on my stretch marks and it has helped the skin on my stomach look better.  </li>
            <li>glad you do</li>
            <li>It seemed to me to be more pronounced because the skin under my eyes was just drier.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li>As I am aging, I use it more and more, and love the results.</li>
            <li>I was glad I ate before, because the thought made me lose any appetite.</li>
            <li>surely this isn&#x27;t my imagination or hopeful thinking,  </li>
            <li>Interesting development</li>
            <li>For the price I love it.</li>
            <li>Those are the most features i like about it.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon:-)</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>and it leave my skin feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I use cocoa butter now which smells much better.</li>
            <li>However, the claim that it will make your skin firmer and \\&quot;more toned\\</li>
            <li>The lotion does a great job of moisturizing, almost too good because it left my skin feeling damp and greasy for about an hour.</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily and leaves your skin feeling very smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lotions, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it its creamy.</li>
            <li>but it would be much better without the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Excellent remedy for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I also want to mention, however, an important detail that might have made this lotion work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m way more comfortable in shorts and skirts.</li>
            <li>It works and that&#x27;s the most important thing.</li>
            <li>skin use to stretch and become itchy when I ran very quickly (sprints).  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin easily</li>
            <li>Id strongly advise not to use it on your face if you have oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe people thought there was a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It rubs on easily and feels light.</li>
            <li>It just adds the moisture that nothing else I tried has, and it LASTS, which in turn has softened the fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes dramatically; just from the moisture it gives.  </li>
            <li>I have less celluite and my skin is even toned and flawless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy like most and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and has a very light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and has a very light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty runny product and has a very strong floral scent</li>
            <li>I really did like how light-feeling it was, and it also adds a nice glean to your skin.</li>
            <li>When I use this lotion it makes all that feel smooth - you cant tell it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>Primarily it goes on my lower abs as I am losing weight</li>
            <li>This is a great cream for my skin, especially during winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and seals in moisture all day.</li>
            <li>Its a Great Product overall.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this lotion and would recommend it to a friend.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea lotion I recieved is on the light side.</li>
            <li>Light but not greasy</li>
            <li>&quot; \\&quot;smelled fantastic\\&quot; \\&quot;light</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s smooth and it feels fresher.</li>
            <li>it is smooth to apply , the smell is light  ,  I see and feel the moisture with out feeling greasy&lt;</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of the lotion and how soft it made my skin</li>
            <li>Better than many products at much lower cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just way too strong.  </li>
            <li>This bottle is also very easy to use with a large pump.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly, but gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t love the scent, &amp; the pump didn&#x27;t work - had to twist off the top &amp; just squeeze into my palm.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I exercise and eat well and never saw any significant wrinkles on my body and thought it is because I am just aging well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t make the connection to the lotion at first, so I put more lotion on in hopes to soothe the rash, but it just made the spots angrier, redder, and itchier.</li>
            <li>it smells like the original nivea</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been several weeks and nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li>Once I started using this lotion years ago I have continued to use it because it is light and absorbs into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>It smells like clean lotion, not at all musky, or perfumy.</li>
            <li>Works great on dry skin without that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this product for about 5 days and then developed a red, itchy bumpy rash on my chest and legs.  </li>
            <li>Overall, fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin sooooo soft all day &amp; I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Stopped using right away!</li>
            <li>but this lotion feels really good and even though it&#x27;s not instant firming, I do notice a difference.</li>
            <li>But my face (I use different regiment for the face) still looked good.</li>
            <li>but this lotion feels really good and even though it&#x27;s not instant firming, I do notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was recommended to me by my aunt.and since her legs looked a whole lot better</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and has a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>this lasts the full 8 hrs.  </li>
            <li>The smell at first is a bit strong but not unpleasant..</li>
            <li>Also love that it has a decent smell to it and not a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Perhaps others are really sensitive to scented products, and in that case, perhaps an unscented lotion would be better in those instances, but this scent, to me, is light and innocuous.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll be lucky ?</li>
            <li>I still felt super greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other lotions over the years and this one goes to the top of my list!</li>
            <li>It left a nice smooth finish to my skin with no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion which is mainly why I buy it.  </li>
            <li>However, I will be buying more and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But overall I would purchase again, as all Nivea lotions make our skin soft without a greasy feeling or overwhelming scent, making it great for the whole family!</li>
            <li>This body lotion has earned my loyalty, more than 4 years that I use it, not a complaint.</li>
            <li>I used to have such nice beautiful thighs up until I turned 26, and it went down the hill from there</li>
            <li>Not sure about the &#x27;firming&#x27; claims, but it&#x27;s a light, quick-absorming lotion with a pleasant light sent.</li>
            <li>This was my first chance to try it, and I love it, I really do ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit and my skin is starting to look pretty good</li>
            <li>I am in my mid forties, and before using this lotion, noticed that the skin on my neck and decolletage were becoming more crepe-papery in texture.  </li>
            <li>The first two days I loved it but by the third day I was itching all over, on the 4th day I broke out in hives from head to toe, my face started swelling</li>
            <li>all thanks to Nivea products!!</li>
            <li>month or so ago I started to see the first wrinkles on my body - everywhere, arms, breasts, legs, OMG!</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and smooth and isn&#x27;t dry anymore.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but works very well (better than more gloppy stuff) and sinks in quickly ...</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, has improved the overall look of my skin, and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>anti-oxidant and skin-firming properties, it&#x27;s grease-less and easily absorbed too.  </li>
            <li>If strong, musky odors don&#x27;t bother you, this is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li>so I know you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Then when I ran out of those nicely priced creams, I decided to try this, the Nivea Q10 body firming lotion I had purchased awhile back for my legs.  </li>
            <li>I found Nivea Q10 Skin Firming lotion to be both well absorbed and neutral in fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but after seeing others say they had a rash, I had to also comment.</li>
            <li>Looking at other reviews, i can see many have experienced similar problem.</li>
            <li>The smell dissipates pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>after a week, I noticed how much more hydrated and moisturized my face was particularly under my eyes, which I really concentrated on when applying...</li>
            <li>Nivea is a good company and I have used other products from them without any problems.</li>
            <li>I applied it on my legs right after shower</li>
            <li>Saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, it&#x27;s just right</li>
            <li>I ended up buying Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion, Daily Shade Formula, SPF 16, from Amazon after returning the Nivea lotion, and have been very pleased with that one.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and evenly, doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks, and smells pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li>As long as you use it daily you are good to go &amp; will get the results !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any kind of allergic reaction like this and am not usually sensitive to these kinds of things.</li>
            <li>My skin is visibly more supple, and healthier looking, not dry and flaky (I also have eczema that is under control through acupuncture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a mild scent, which I really like.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>than other lotions that I enjoy using more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any scent so that is a huge plus for my husband with an extremely sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>night I did an all over after a hot shower, from head to toe.</li>
            <li>I first heard about CoQ10 in the 1990s when it surfaced as a respected supplement.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I order it over and over again and definitely beats the price for 2 bottles than at the store.</li>
            <li>what I do know (and why I keep using it) is that it makes my skin extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re going to feel hot &amp; sticky...</li>
            <li>... am going to the doctors first thing as I just want to rip my skin off.</li>
            <li>, it used to take more lotion at the start to get the same feel.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the only one that has worked.  </li>
            <li>The scent is stronger when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Perhaps my lack of toning isn&#x27;t enough for me to have been able to tell a difference</li>
            <li>Not completely horrible, but a little too strong for my liking.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin  feeling soft and smooth, Certainly does help with wrinkles and skin appearance.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how much firming it does but it makes my skin nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use very much, but I thought maybe I still used too much.  </li>
            <li>After using this on my body for a week o r 2, I have seen a positive difference in the texture and firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really looking for skim firming but really noticed a difference in just a day!</li>
            <li>It did not have the fresh scent of other nivea products, but it smelled more musky...almost like a men&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>I noticed changes within 2 weeks of using this product, but I do recommend using a few other tools to get the best</li>
            <li>love that stuff have been using it for long time</li>
            <li>I really started to age pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Tried two different times to use this lotion, but it is way, way too strong.  </li>
            <li>Not really, but there is a great difference in the wrinkles appearance for sure due to the lasting hydrating effects!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have to keep using it a certain amount over a certain period of time, but I didn&#x27;t see any &#x27;skin firming&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li>This product is new to me, and I just recently purchased it, so I have to give it time to work its magic.</li>
            <li>It was barely visible at first, just mild irritation.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face and it really helps with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>And, yes, with that in mind, I&#x27;ve tried the regular Nivea, but really do think this is a far better formula ...</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I have combo skin, and using this on my face made it really oily.</li>
            <li>The skin is still wet and it seems to absorb better.</li>
            <li>nothing life-changing, and it really doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li>well I don&#x27;t see much result</li>
            <li>Really works and going on 10 days now using product and skin appears healthier and firmer.</li>
            <li>how well it&#x27;s really firming up my loose/crepe skin (I&#x27;ve lost 64lbs)</li>
            <li>but after one week of use my whole body was covered in rashes.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and feels tighter.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really NEED a firming lotion</li>
            <li>And my skin looked much dryer than before.</li>
            <li>I would have overlooked this, but after just 3 days of using this lotion, I started developing bumps all over my legs that were very itchy.  </li>
            <li>This could be just my chemistry with the cream, so I can&#x27;t really tell if this cream does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I must admit, this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>the stores here don&#x27;t much carry it anymore</li>
            <li>It has really helped.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any firming, but I do like it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care much about my cellulite, even the 5&#x27;9\\&quot; 76lbs anorexic chick that struggles to walk longer than 5 minutes</li>
            <li>she shouldn&#x27;t legally be allowed to do anything but eat donuts for a month....).</li>
            <li>It seemed like no matter how much I rubbed it in, it wouldn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
            <li>Been at it for three months and my skin is firmer and much softer.</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to return.</li>
            <li>and she was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really need anti aging products yet</li>
            <li>I really believe it is helping</li>
            <li>I like a whole lot and have been using it all the time.</li>
            <li>The effect it has on your skin lasts a whole day.</li>
            <li>and I have to say, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I guess I really don&#x27;t have much to say about this product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell STRONG,  but it did smell strange.</li>
            <li>Any other lotion doesn&#x27;t help but this one magically keeps the Eczema from flaring up</li>
            <li>My skin tends to get dry and sometimes even flaky and this Nivea has really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Again, first I thought it is time for me to get old.</li>
            <li>Today marked one week since first using it</li>
            <li>&quot; (back of the bottle) within two weeks, did not prove true for me.</li>
            <li>I tend to only use it at night though because it&#x27;s super moisturizing and if you put it on your legs and then throw on some jeans</li>
            <li>I can update after I lose more of my stomach fat to see if this really does help firm skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and good for you to keep your skin firm and looking younger!!</li>
            <li>It made my skin smooth and soft after only a week or two of use!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be a particular stand-out in the lotion department.</li>
            <li>whatever, I highly recommend this one, please do give it a try.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am also going to look for the Nivea under eye cream with Q10 and compare, but at least I know that this specific product, targeted as body firming lotion (Nivea Body Skin Firming Moisturizer with Advanced Q10 Complex) works for my EYES beautifully!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It works great on my decollete area (a lot better than the expensive lotion I was using previously).</li>
            <li>the scent could be a little better, but it&#x27;s no biggy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is because I&#x27;m so young and don&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li>I normally use Keri on my skin</li>
            <li>Long lasting moisture is more of a priority for me.</li>
            <li>I normally like lotions that are kind of thick so as soon as I pumped this into my hand</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice with it on but no better (or firmer!)</li>
            <li>I really wanted to keep using this product because it does firm and smooth skin</li>
            <li>While the Alba doesn&#x27;t have the skin-firming features, it contains SPF and has as very subtle scent, so I consider it a good trade-off.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong, but it is slightly noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Although a little greasy at first, but it absorbs into your skin quickly and it goes away.</li>
            <li>I do know my skin is very soft and my stretch marks are not noticeable or faded.</li>
            <li>Respected not the way so many fad supplements are suddenly flooded with dubious and too-anxious praise, but rather for its clinically proven antioxidant and statin-like benefits for the heart and other</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t associate the rash with the lotion because  I had been using it for several days with no problems.</li>
            <li>All those years of my thighs rubbing together like two sticks on a boy scouts over eager first attempt at starting fire has done quite the number to them, I assure you.</li>
            <li>, my skin felt more hydrated than usual and perhaps that lead to my feeling a bit firmer on my arms and chest.  </li>
            <li>Ever since my allergic hive last year on the Hawaiian Tropic silk hydration spf 30 sunscreen (first time ever had hives in my life), I&#x27;ve been super careful about spot testing products, even on lotions.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and this made new break out in a .  </li>
            <li>This lotion has made a huge improvement in the texture of my skin and stretch marks are much less visible.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and gentle, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Even after another 14lbs down this last 2 weeks, my skin has more than kept</li>
            <li>but everything I give a positive review for mysteriously raises in price.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using this lotion over 6 months ago, I wanted to try different lotions, and maybe try to save a couple dolllars, I am so happy to see it on amazon and be able to save, I was not sure if it helped with cellulite, but it does, now i see the difference, its also the only one that keeps my skin soft, I dont have to apply it everyday, and my skin feels soft, my legs and hips tend to get very dry in winter and itchy, this lotion keeps that from happening, I hope it never gets discontinued..</li>
            <li>Definitely makes my skin soft but didn&#x27;t do much fir the wrinkly skin on my stomach and legs.  </li>
            <li>I am now 61years young.</li>
            <li>Its now been 24hrs after application, and seriously WOW.</li>
            <li>Skin is glowing and moisturized completely by this.</li>
            <li>The lotion did make my skin feel soft</li>
            <li>As far as skin firming</li>
            <li>but my skin is sooo soft when using this.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old, have used tanning beds(you would think I would have leathery skin...</li>
            <li>The lotion firmed up those sensitive areas quite well.</li>
            <li>Surprised by the comments about a \\&quot;strong\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>I am now 39 years old and people routinely place my age at 27-29.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using Nivea Q10 for a week and my husband can really tell the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>AS far as firming I&#x27;m not convinced.</li>
            <li>My face and neck got slightly red and it was very itchy.  </li>
            <li>Almost instantly, I developed the rash AGAIN:</li>
            <li>All of my problem areas started looking considerably tighter within days of use.</li>
            <li>but I have developed a rash on my face neck and arms   </li>
            <li>I am over 4 decades old</li>
            <li>After about a week of using this product I developed a rash on my thighs &amp; belly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but beware.  </li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>even saw the reviews of people getting rashes from it but never thought I would because I do not have sensitive skin at all, well low and behold a week after product use everyday on mostly the thigh area and buttocks</li>
            <li>I stopped using the product completely and debated about calling the 800 number.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I suggest you try another product instead of this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and arms for weeks now and my skin is soft as can be.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it as a secondary way to tone skin with regular exercise and of course a good diet of fruits and vegetables.</li>
            <li>I just started using this lotion about a month ago and it has slowly but surely been working.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of dimples right below my butt towards the outer corners of them and also the skin on the inner thighs right above the knees became so loose, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li>I bought this at a local warehouse store a few days ago; however, I used it only twice and had to return it since the smell was so strong!</li>
            <li>and I really like it much better than other products I have used in the past</li>
            <li>I ran out and was using other lotion for the past week, and my skin is nowhere near as nice as it was while using this.  </li>
            <li>and my arms are  about in the same condition they were in high school when I participated in basketball and softball.  </li>
            <li>Upper arms, thighs and back were rough before and they are smooth now.</li>
            <li>The firming aspect of this lotion seems to work fine; however, I can hardly stand to use it because of the smell--it reminds me of Old Spice, which is hardly a fragrance I enjoy.</li>
            <li>This lotion is really working on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft, moisturized, and in the sensitive areas that I was concerned about, definitely firmer.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell a difference in my thighs and really don&#x27;t expect a lot.  </li>
            <li>If you are at all sensitive to smells, I definitely recommend smelling this before you purchase</li>
            <li>As for firming effects, I can&#x27;t say that it actually firms or does not firm.  </li>
            <li>On running out of this second product a month ago, I bought some Q10 from the supermarket but developed a rash after using it for just a day.</li>
            <li>After 3 days developed a red, raised, itchy rash on my arms and chest where I had applied product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only in my early 20s</li>
            <li>It instantly hydrates your skin and leaves it feeling so smoothe and soft.</li>
            <li>When I wake up the next morning my skin still feels soft from the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, at 48, my skin is too old and saggy to be firmed up by something as simple as a grocery store body lotion...</li>
            <li>Usually the scent of most lotions will also dissipate after the lotion sinks in, but this one lasted for about eight hours, and interfered with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad giving this a low review since I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to see if it really does firm the skin, but, in my mind, a product needs to excel in all areas to be a winner, and this one falls short because the smell is much too strong and noxious.  </li>
            <li>It smells the same as every other Nivea product, if not even less strong.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin firm and soft - highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But as I was already quite toned and firm and only used it on the body, I never really noticed too much of a difference other then keeping my skin smooth and supple looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hydrates my dry skin very well and lasts a long time without having to reapply.</li>
            <li>A couple of months ago when I needed to buy a new Nivea Q10  jar I didn&#x27;t see it at the store, so I bought a different product - same price, same promises, and I thought it would give me the same benefits.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>With the few changes I&#x27;ve made to my body, and using the above mentioned protocol, my skin has noticeably become more firm.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually one of the very few \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve stayed loyal to for this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in a week or so got back to my former skin condition, without major wrinkles and dryness.</li>
            <li>used to always have problems with dry, itchy skin from frequent leg shaving with a standard razor, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue since I started using the Nivea.</li>
            <li>, if you apply too much lotion, you could become a little sticky/sweaty...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure of the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; qualities of it, didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference from using my other Nivea lotions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually one of the very few \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve stayed loyal to for this long</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I&#x27;ll be good on this for a while</li>
            <li> Therefore, I ran out to the store in search of a good eye cream.  </li>

            <li> Good price.</li>

            <li> so good luck to all...</li>
            <li> This is a great every-day lotion that smells nice and provides 24 hour moisture.</li>

            <li> While it was a great moisturizer, I also found the smell to be a bit overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could give this a good review but to be honest I didn&#x27;t even use it.  </li>
            <li> but I love it!</li>
            <li> but I personally love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Ordering more ASAP!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and my results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> the skin firming is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, this is a nice moisturizer with maybe some skin firming effects.</li>
            <li> This is a nice formulation of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it is nice for the skin.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, it seems like a nice lotion, but just be warned that it may be too strong!</li>
            <li> Love this light product and it smells great, but not too perfumy</li>
            <li> But I would say this is the best, and I mean THE BEST body lotion.</li>
            <li> It has a very light feel and glides on nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this product helped me keep away stretch marks &amp; kept my skin in good condition while pregnant!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or \\&quot;girly\\&quot;, it smells kind of exotic.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, i love the way it feels, not a greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and feel which is good because I am in Texas in the summer.</li>
            <li> Good lotion; nothing particularly special about it.</li>
            <li> Its not expensive, so great value for what it does...</li>
            <li> Happy to say my legs are smooth and scale free and have been ever since I started using this after seeing a recommendation in some women&#x27;s magazine many moons ago.</li>
            <li> Happy to say my legs are smooth and scale free and have been ever since I started using this after seeing a recommendation in some women&#x27;s magazine many moons ago.</li>
            <li> The scent is great smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is easy to put on, no streaking it absorbs in nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love Nivea products in general, and now really love having CoQ10 incorporated into their best lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I like the pump bottle better.</li>
            <li> There is more in it.</li>
            <li> But if you are dieting and want your skin to bounce back or need to rejuvenate your skin texture, its excellent.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I love the Nivea</li>
            <li> Now my favorite lotion has joined in, with [[ASIN:B001FB5IDW</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to say that this Nivea Q10 did not cause me issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li> (which is what most moisturizers do).     </li>
            <li> Does better after a shower or bath to me.</li>
            <li> UPDATE--2/24/10: The skin-firming qualities of the lotion are okay, but</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d get better results with any lotion from the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter line.</li>
            <li> and I love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> but I sure do like this lotion.</li>
            <li> and I do put around my eyes and it seems to be making the skin look a bit softer and wrinkles not as prominent.  </li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love nivea products, so I bought this and started using it all over immeidately.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use as it does make my skin look more radiant.</li>
            <li> but if People did more exercise, sleep and eat healthy than this would probably be a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so be sure to apply sparingly.  </li>
            <li> and I use it on my stomach on my stretch marks and it has helped the skin on my stomach look better.  </li>
            <li> glad you do</li>
            <li> It seemed to me to be more pronounced because the skin under my eyes was just drier.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li> As I am aging, I use it more and more, and love the results.</li>
            <li> I was glad I ate before, because the thought made me lose any appetite.</li>
            <li> surely this isn&#x27;t my imagination or hopeful thinking,  </li>
            <li> Interesting development</li>
            <li> For the price I love it.</li>
            <li> Those are the most features i like about it.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon:-)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> and it leave my skin feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I use cocoa butter now which smells much better.</li>
            <li> However, the claim that it will make your skin firmer and \\&quot;more toned\\</li>
            <li> The lotion does a great job of moisturizing, almost too good because it left my skin feeling damp and greasy for about an hour.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and leaves your skin feeling very smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it its creamy.</li>
            <li> but it would be much better without the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent remedy for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also want to mention, however, an important detail that might have made this lotion work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m way more comfortable in shorts and skirts.</li>
            <li> It works and that&#x27;s the most important thing.</li>
            <li> skin use to stretch and become itchy when I ran very quickly (sprints).  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin easily</li>
            <li> Id strongly advise not to use it on your face if you have oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people thought there was a strong smell.</li>
            <li> It rubs on easily and feels light.</li>
            <li> It just adds the moisture that nothing else I tried has, and it LASTS, which in turn has softened the fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes dramatically; just from the moisture it gives.  </li>
            <li> I have less celluite and my skin is even toned and flawless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy like most and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has a very light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has a very light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty runny product and has a very strong floral scent</li>
            <li> I really did like how light-feeling it was, and it also adds a nice glean to your skin.</li>
            <li> When I use this lotion it makes all that feel smooth - you cant tell it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> Primarily it goes on my lower abs as I am losing weight</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for my skin, especially during winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and seals in moisture all day.</li>
            <li> Its a Great Product overall.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this lotion and would recommend it to a friend.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea lotion I recieved is on the light side.</li>
            <li> Light but not greasy</li>
            <li> &quot; \\&quot;smelled fantastic\\&quot; \\&quot;light</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s smooth and it feels fresher.</li>
            <li> it is smooth to apply , the smell is light  ,  I see and feel the moisture with out feeling greasy&lt;</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the lotion and how soft it made my skin</li>
            <li> Better than many products at much lower cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just way too strong.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is also very easy to use with a large pump.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly, but gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t love the scent, &amp; the pump didn&#x27;t work - had to twist off the top &amp; just squeeze into my palm.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I exercise and eat well and never saw any significant wrinkles on my body and thought it is because I am just aging well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t make the connection to the lotion at first, so I put more lotion on in hopes to soothe the rash, but it just made the spots angrier, redder, and itchier.</li>
            <li> it smells like the original nivea</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been several weeks and nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this lotion years ago I have continued to use it because it is light and absorbs into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> It smells like clean lotion, not at all musky, or perfumy.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry skin without that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product for about 5 days and then developed a red, itchy bumpy rash on my chest and legs.  </li>
            <li> Overall, fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin sooooo soft all day &amp; I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Stopped using right away!</li>
            <li> but this lotion feels really good and even though it&#x27;s not instant firming, I do notice a difference.</li>
            <li> But my face (I use different regiment for the face) still looked good.</li>
            <li> but this lotion feels really good and even though it&#x27;s not instant firming, I do notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was recommended to me by my aunt.and since her legs looked a whole lot better</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and has a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> this lasts the full 8 hrs.  </li>
            <li> The smell at first is a bit strong but not unpleasant..</li>
            <li> Also love that it has a decent smell to it and not a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Perhaps others are really sensitive to scented products, and in that case, perhaps an unscented lotion would be better in those instances, but this scent, to me, is light and innocuous.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll be lucky ?</li>
            <li> I still felt super greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other lotions over the years and this one goes to the top of my list!</li>
            <li> It left a nice smooth finish to my skin with no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion which is mainly why I buy it.  </li>
            <li> However, I will be buying more and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But overall I would purchase again, as all Nivea lotions make our skin soft without a greasy feeling or overwhelming scent, making it great for the whole family!</li>
            <li> This body lotion has earned my loyalty, more than 4 years that I use it, not a complaint.</li>
            <li> I used to have such nice beautiful thighs up until I turned 26, and it went down the hill from there</li>
            <li> Not sure about the &#x27;firming&#x27; claims, but it&#x27;s a light, quick-absorming lotion with a pleasant light sent.</li>
            <li> This was my first chance to try it, and I love it, I really do ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit and my skin is starting to look pretty good</li>
            <li> I am in my mid forties, and before using this lotion, noticed that the skin on my neck and decolletage were becoming more crepe-papery in texture.  </li>
            <li> The first two days I loved it but by the third day I was itching all over, on the 4th day I broke out in hives from head to toe, my face started swelling</li>
            <li> all thanks to Nivea products!!</li>
            <li> month or so ago I started to see the first wrinkles on my body - everywhere, arms, breasts, legs, OMG!</li>
            <li> My skin is nice and smooth and isn&#x27;t dry anymore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but works very well (better than more gloppy stuff) and sinks in quickly ...</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, has improved the overall look of my skin, and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> anti-oxidant and skin-firming properties, it&#x27;s grease-less and easily absorbed too.  </li>
            <li> If strong, musky odors don&#x27;t bother you, this is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li> so I know you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Then when I ran out of those nicely priced creams, I decided to try this, the Nivea Q10 body firming lotion I had purchased awhile back for my legs.  </li>
            <li> I found Nivea Q10 Skin Firming lotion to be both well absorbed and neutral in fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but after seeing others say they had a rash, I had to also comment.</li>
            <li> Looking at other reviews, i can see many have experienced similar problem.</li>
            <li> The smell dissipates pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> after a week, I noticed how much more hydrated and moisturized my face was particularly under my eyes, which I really concentrated on when applying...</li>
            <li> Nivea is a good company and I have used other products from them without any problems.</li>
            <li> I applied it on my legs right after shower</li>
            <li> Saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, it&#x27;s just right</li>
            <li> I ended up buying Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion, Daily Shade Formula, SPF 16, from Amazon after returning the Nivea lotion, and have been very pleased with that one.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and evenly, doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks, and smells pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li> As long as you use it daily you are good to go &amp; will get the results !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any kind of allergic reaction like this and am not usually sensitive to these kinds of things.</li>
            <li> My skin is visibly more supple, and healthier looking, not dry and flaky (I also have eczema that is under control through acupuncture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a mild scent, which I really like.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> than other lotions that I enjoy using more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any scent so that is a huge plus for my husband with an extremely sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> night I did an all over after a hot shower, from head to toe.</li>
            <li> I first heard about CoQ10 in the 1990s when it surfaced as a respected supplement.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I order it over and over again and definitely beats the price for 2 bottles than at the store.</li>
            <li> what I do know (and why I keep using it) is that it makes my skin extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going to feel hot &amp; sticky...</li>
            <li> ... am going to the doctors first thing as I just want to rip my skin off.</li>
            <li> , it used to take more lotion at the start to get the same feel.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the only one that has worked.  </li>
            <li> The scent is stronger when you first put it on</li>
            <li> Perhaps my lack of toning isn&#x27;t enough for me to have been able to tell a difference</li>
            <li> Not completely horrible, but a little too strong for my liking.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin  feeling soft and smooth, Certainly does help with wrinkles and skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much firming it does but it makes my skin nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use very much, but I thought maybe I still used too much.  </li>
            <li> After using this on my body for a week o r 2, I have seen a positive difference in the texture and firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really looking for skim firming but really noticed a difference in just a day!</li>
            <li> It did not have the fresh scent of other nivea products, but it smelled more musky...almost like a men&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li> I noticed changes within 2 weeks of using this product, but I do recommend using a few other tools to get the best</li>
            <li> love that stuff have been using it for long time</li>
            <li> I really started to age pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Tried two different times to use this lotion, but it is way, way too strong.  </li>
            <li> Not really, but there is a great difference in the wrinkles appearance for sure due to the lasting hydrating effects!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have to keep using it a certain amount over a certain period of time, but I didn&#x27;t see any &#x27;skin firming&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li> This product is new to me, and I just recently purchased it, so I have to give it time to work its magic.</li>
            <li> It was barely visible at first, just mild irritation.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face and it really helps with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> And, yes, with that in mind, I&#x27;ve tried the regular Nivea, but really do think this is a far better formula ...</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> I have combo skin, and using this on my face made it really oily.</li>
            <li> The skin is still wet and it seems to absorb better.</li>
            <li> nothing life-changing, and it really doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> well I don&#x27;t see much result</li>
            <li> Really works and going on 10 days now using product and skin appears healthier and firmer.</li>
            <li> how well it&#x27;s really firming up my loose/crepe skin (I&#x27;ve lost 64lbs)</li>
            <li> but after one week of use my whole body was covered in rashes.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and feels tighter.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really NEED a firming lotion</li>
            <li> And my skin looked much dryer than before.</li>
            <li> I would have overlooked this, but after just 3 days of using this lotion, I started developing bumps all over my legs that were very itchy.  </li>
            <li> This could be just my chemistry with the cream, so I can&#x27;t really tell if this cream does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> the stores here don&#x27;t much carry it anymore</li>
            <li> It has really helped.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any firming, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care much about my cellulite, even the 5&#x27;9\\&quot; 76lbs anorexic chick that struggles to walk longer than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> she shouldn&#x27;t legally be allowed to do anything but eat donuts for a month....).</li>
            <li> It seemed like no matter how much I rubbed it in, it wouldn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
            <li> Been at it for three months and my skin is firmer and much softer.</li>
            <li> Too much hassle to return.</li>
            <li> and she was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really need anti aging products yet</li>
            <li> I really believe it is helping</li>
            <li> I like a whole lot and have been using it all the time.</li>
            <li> The effect it has on your skin lasts a whole day.</li>
            <li> and I have to say, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I guess I really don&#x27;t have much to say about this product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell STRONG,  but it did smell strange.</li>
            <li> Any other lotion doesn&#x27;t help but this one magically keeps the Eczema from flaring up</li>
            <li> My skin tends to get dry and sometimes even flaky and this Nivea has really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Again, first I thought it is time for me to get old.</li>
            <li> Today marked one week since first using it</li>
            <li> &quot; (back of the bottle) within two weeks, did not prove true for me.</li>
            <li> I tend to only use it at night though because it&#x27;s super moisturizing and if you put it on your legs and then throw on some jeans</li>
            <li> I can update after I lose more of my stomach fat to see if this really does help firm skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and good for you to keep your skin firm and looking younger!!</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth and soft after only a week or two of use!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be a particular stand-out in the lotion department.</li>
            <li> whatever, I highly recommend this one, please do give it a try.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am also going to look for the Nivea under eye cream with Q10 and compare, but at least I know that this specific product, targeted as body firming lotion (Nivea Body Skin Firming Moisturizer with Advanced Q10 Complex) works for my EYES beautifully!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works great on my decollete area (a lot better than the expensive lotion I was using previously).</li>
            <li> the scent could be a little better, but it&#x27;s no biggy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because I&#x27;m so young and don&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li> I normally use Keri on my skin</li>
            <li> Long lasting moisture is more of a priority for me.</li>
            <li> I normally like lotions that are kind of thick so as soon as I pumped this into my hand</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice with it on but no better (or firmer!)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to keep using this product because it does firm and smooth skin</li>
            <li> While the Alba doesn&#x27;t have the skin-firming features, it contains SPF and has as very subtle scent, so I consider it a good trade-off.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t strong, but it is slightly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Although a little greasy at first, but it absorbs into your skin quickly and it goes away.</li>
            <li> I do know my skin is very soft and my stretch marks are not noticeable or faded.</li>
            <li> Respected not the way so many fad supplements are suddenly flooded with dubious and too-anxious praise, but rather for its clinically proven antioxidant and statin-like benefits for the heart and other</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t associate the rash with the lotion because  I had been using it for several days with no problems.</li>
            <li> All those years of my thighs rubbing together like two sticks on a boy scouts over eager first attempt at starting fire has done quite the number to them, I assure you.</li>
            <li> , my skin felt more hydrated than usual and perhaps that lead to my feeling a bit firmer on my arms and chest.  </li>
            <li> Ever since my allergic hive last year on the Hawaiian Tropic silk hydration spf 30 sunscreen (first time ever had hives in my life), I&#x27;ve been super careful about spot testing products, even on lotions.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and this made new break out in a .  </li>
            <li> This lotion has made a huge improvement in the texture of my skin and stretch marks are much less visible.  </li>
            <li> The smell is light and gentle, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Even after another 14lbs down this last 2 weeks, my skin has more than kept</li>
            <li> but everything I give a positive review for mysteriously raises in price.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using this lotion over 6 months ago, I wanted to try different lotions, and maybe try to save a couple dolllars, I am so happy to see it on amazon and be able to save, I was not sure if it helped with cellulite, but it does, now i see the difference, its also the only one that keeps my skin soft, I dont have to apply it everyday, and my skin feels soft, my legs and hips tend to get very dry in winter and itchy, this lotion keeps that from happening, I hope it never gets discontinued..</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my skin soft but didn&#x27;t do much fir the wrinkly skin on my stomach and legs.  </li>
            <li> I am now 61years young.</li>
            <li> Its now been 24hrs after application, and seriously WOW.</li>
            <li> Skin is glowing and moisturized completely by this.</li>
            <li> The lotion did make my skin feel soft</li>
            <li> As far as skin firming</li>
            <li> but my skin is sooo soft when using this.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old, have used tanning beds(you would think I would have leathery skin...</li>
            <li> The lotion firmed up those sensitive areas quite well.</li>
            <li> Surprised by the comments about a \\&quot;strong\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> I am now 39 years old and people routinely place my age at 27-29.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using Nivea Q10 for a week and my husband can really tell the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> AS far as firming I&#x27;m not convinced.</li>
            <li> My face and neck got slightly red and it was very itchy.  </li>
            <li> Almost instantly, I developed the rash AGAIN:</li>
            <li> All of my problem areas started looking considerably tighter within days of use.</li>
            <li> but I have developed a rash on my face neck and arms   </li>
            <li> I am over 4 decades old</li>
            <li> After about a week of using this product I developed a rash on my thighs &amp; belly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but beware.  </li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> even saw the reviews of people getting rashes from it but never thought I would because I do not have sensitive skin at all, well low and behold a week after product use everyday on mostly the thigh area and buttocks</li>
            <li> I stopped using the product completely and debated about calling the 800 number.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I suggest you try another product instead of this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and arms for weeks now and my skin is soft as can be.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it as a secondary way to tone skin with regular exercise and of course a good diet of fruits and vegetables.</li>
            <li> I just started using this lotion about a month ago and it has slowly but surely been working.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of dimples right below my butt towards the outer corners of them and also the skin on the inner thighs right above the knees became so loose, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local warehouse store a few days ago; however, I used it only twice and had to return it since the smell was so strong!</li>
            <li> and I really like it much better than other products I have used in the past</li>
            <li> I ran out and was using other lotion for the past week, and my skin is nowhere near as nice as it was while using this.  </li>
            <li> and my arms are  about in the same condition they were in high school when I participated in basketball and softball.  </li>
            <li> Upper arms, thighs and back were rough before and they are smooth now.</li>
            <li> The firming aspect of this lotion seems to work fine; however, I can hardly stand to use it because of the smell--it reminds me of Old Spice, which is hardly a fragrance I enjoy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really working on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft, moisturized, and in the sensitive areas that I was concerned about, definitely firmer.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell a difference in my thighs and really don&#x27;t expect a lot.  </li>
            <li> If you are at all sensitive to smells, I definitely recommend smelling this before you purchase</li>
            <li> As for firming effects, I can&#x27;t say that it actually firms or does not firm.  </li>
            <li> On running out of this second product a month ago, I bought some Q10 from the supermarket but developed a rash after using it for just a day.</li>
            <li> After 3 days developed a red, raised, itchy rash on my arms and chest where I had applied product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my early 20s</li>
            <li> It instantly hydrates your skin and leaves it feeling so smoothe and soft.</li>
            <li> When I wake up the next morning my skin still feels soft from the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, at 48, my skin is too old and saggy to be firmed up by something as simple as a grocery store body lotion...</li>
            <li> Usually the scent of most lotions will also dissipate after the lotion sinks in, but this one lasted for about eight hours, and interfered with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad giving this a low review since I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to see if it really does firm the skin, but, in my mind, a product needs to excel in all areas to be a winner, and this one falls short because the smell is much too strong and noxious.  </li>
            <li> It smells the same as every other Nivea product, if not even less strong.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin firm and soft - highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But as I was already quite toned and firm and only used it on the body, I never really noticed too much of a difference other then keeping my skin smooth and supple looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hydrates my dry skin very well and lasts a long time without having to reapply.</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago when I needed to buy a new Nivea Q10  jar I didn&#x27;t see it at the store, so I bought a different product - same price, same promises, and I thought it would give me the same benefits.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> With the few changes I&#x27;ve made to my body, and using the above mentioned protocol, my skin has noticeably become more firm.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually one of the very few \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve stayed loyal to for this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in a week or so got back to my former skin condition, without major wrinkles and dryness.</li>
            <li> used to always have problems with dry, itchy skin from frequent leg shaving with a standard razor, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue since I started using the Nivea.</li>
            <li> , if you apply too much lotion, you could become a little sticky/sweaty...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; qualities of it, didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference from using my other Nivea lotions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually one of the very few \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve stayed loyal to for this long</li>
            <li> I recently lost a considerable amount of weight and, as expected, I have loose skin under my upper arms, neck, abdomen, and thighs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin, so I was surprised that I got that</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough to test the firming quality.  </li>
            <li> I used the product for a few days on my arms and across my upper chest and developed a red bumpy rash on the areas I applied the Nivea Q10.  </li>
            <li> I have had previous reactions to mineral oil (that clear up within a day or two) and forgot to check the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> and my work spends big money to buy lotions that will keep a glide for an hour that dry out faster than this lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been two weeks, and as much as I still dread getting out of the shower knowing this lotion is waiting for me, I still get out and put it on, because,  unfortunately,  it works really well.</li>
            <li> Its not going to make you loose weight obviously!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks only on my thighs where I have visible loose skin.</li>
            <li> As far as firming goes, my skin may seem a little firmer but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> However, since I normally have not have adverse reactions to any skin products in the past, I did not connect the rash to this product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s going to take a long time before my skin shrinks.  </li>
            <li> I will use this for as long as I am trying to lose weight.</li>
            <li> but it definitely dissipates after a few minutes and is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> The only benefit of the other skin firming  lotions I have used is they had organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I see by several other reviews here that I was not alone in being hyper-sensitive to this product.  </li>
            <li> I can usually handle fairly strong smells, but this one was incredibly strong -- in a bad way!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it on my hands and arms for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any loose skin yet.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and went to the emergency room.</li>
            <li> Please test for at least a week in a small area first before using everywhere!</li>
            <li> I usually tend to like more expensive lines</li>
            <li> My story is little bit different.</li>
            <li> I wish Nivea would make this unscented or at least make an unscented version for those of us who are sensitive to perfume odors.</li>
            <li> No one in my household (including my kids with sensitive skin) had any negative reaction to using this lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since Ive last used it, Ive gained 15-20kgs... and not so firm</li>
            <li> Be careful what you put on your body.</li>
            <li> I recently lost a lot of weight and tried this to see if it would help firm up my sagging skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 50 + and have used this product for years, and never appreciated how it worked.</li>
            <li> but after a few days of use, I broke out in a red bumpy, itchy rash.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this product if you have ever had a reaction to mineral oil.  </li>
            <li> I got it because of recommendations of Q 10 to help with thin skin, but think that the blood under the surface that appears on back of my hands from slight abrasions may be going away from the action of putting on the lotion, not because of the lotion itself.</li>
            <li> and, though I&#x27;ve tried other products, I always return to the Nivea Skin Firming.</li>
            <li> I use other Nivea products including this one.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I use other firming stuff of nivea</li>
            <li> Be careful!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t eat junk food, but I do sit a lot due to my work.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep using this lotion and see what other results I get.</li>
            <li> I used this product on arms and legs without any problems a few years back but then changed to another product that also promised to firm my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 58, sensitive skin, very thin skinned, red haired.</li>
            <li> but they said if you have a customer complaint to call their 800 number which I finally did.</li>
            <li> still* had to wipe down with a towel before I got dressed.</li>
            <li> The package also contained a form for putting down my experiences with the product.  </li>
            <li> This product is not like other  lotions that are heavy and take forever to disappear after you have applied it to your arms, etc.</li>
            <li> It has been less than two weeks</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight difference in the skin texture in about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> so I decided I&#x27;ll just use less.  </li>
            <li> but when I went to apply the horror lotion to my arms, I noticed my bingo wings looked ever so slightly less flap-py.</li>
            <li> Now I use considerably less.</li>
            <li> After using this product, I received the most horrible rash of my life all over my body about 2 days later.</li>
            <li> out there searching for a little help in taking care of their skin and making the signs of aging less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> No more dry skin!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 2 days and have broken out in a red unbearably itchy rash all over... didn&#x27;t put it down to the cream but now reading the reviews I think it is</li>
            <li> Softer skin is not worth the rash!  </li>
            <li> I used this every day for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I usually try to mix it with some other lotion, just to tone done the scent.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred a little richer formula with stronger skin tightening properties.</li>
            <li> I became just a little terrified of this lotion....</li>
            <li> I have tried other  skin firming lotions, and they are not much better than this one</li>
            <li> About five days after I started using this product I developed a horrible red, itchy, bumpy, dry rash on my upper arms.  </li>
            <li> Little red spots almost looked like broken capillaries..warm to the touch and itchy.  </li>
            <li> But now I am having trouble finding the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Although I started my diet 3 days ago and have been drinking lots of green tea, I still know its the cream.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use I started to develope a rash on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> I apply this everyday after my shower &amp; the softness of my skin lasts all day, NO LIE, all day.</li>
            <li> Does not leave any film or feel greasy, but you do need to give it a few minutes to absorb.</li>
            <li> By accident, I used the Q10 again a few days ago when I ran out of the product I&#x27;d bought to use in its place.</li>
            <li> and I have used it a few times</li>
            <li> Instead of using heavy weights I began doing Pilates and ply metrics for a sleeker look.  </li>
            <li> Did it firm?  </li>
            <li> So I left the house feeling greasy,  and smelling worse that I did leaving the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a month and a few medrol packs to take it away.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nivea gel to firm my arms</li>
            <li> A secret with it is to use it everyday or twice a day morning and night and to massage deeply in the problem area.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days and tried it again and this time the rash was worse and my skin was really red.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I heeded the bottle&#x27;s advice and spread it liberally (I mean VERY liberally) all around my body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a littlle mix of the genetic factors that probably has led me to having less collagen in my skin or the fact that I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight over the past few years (</li>
            <li> I could not believe a body lotion would do this, but now after reading the other reviews, I see this is a common side effect.  </li>
            <li> Very very slight.</li>
            <li> I heaved a great sigh,  lifted my leg to the counter, and prepared for the worst part of my day... when I noticed, that something was wrong...</li>
            <li> This unfortunately does, so I simply disposed of it.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction to a skin care product in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I am assuming those who are not impressed with the skin-firming aspects are younger than 40 and, thus, don&#x27;t need skin firming.</li>
            <li> There is no magic cure for that</li>
            <li> There is no magic cure for that</li>
            <li> small pinhead sized raised lumps, clustered close together, in this instance on my forearms and shins.</li>
            <li> I would recommend you still buy this stuff and try it in a really small area of your body to see if you get the rash.</li>
            <li> And living in the Vegas desert, it keeps my skin well hydrated without turning my into a oil slick.</li>
            <li> Although I like the lotion for its moisturizing properties, if you are expecting this to make it look like you&#x27;ve put extra time in the gym or had some medical touch-ups, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> (another turn off for me, I usually lean towards the fruity smelling lotions).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because this product really did work for me--it just left me with a nasty side effect.     </li>
            <li> saggy, rhinoceros thick, scary looking inner thigh, indeed looked improved.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m 17 and grabbed this product because I was running late for an event and even at home I was out of my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Again, when I say this, I mean the difference is so small that I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it.</li>
            <li> I have very few wrinkles especially on my neck or chest even though I am no spring chicken.  </li>
            <li> So needless to say my skin was covered in stretch marks and just loose.  </li>
            <li> lotion seemed to work but its not worth the rash!!!  </li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> and yes I have been an exercise fanatic</li>
            <li> Not only that the palms of my hands were itching like crazy.  </li>
            <li> However, after almost 2 weeks of use I developed a terrible red rash all over my legs.</li>
            <li> at least not in one bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell is not over powering, it isnt thick on your skin.</li>
            <li> Discontinued use and slowly rash is disappearing.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever had a bad reaction to a skin product!</li>
            <li> I am so highly disappointed because I definitely saw some improvement in skin texture but not worth the rash!</li>
            <li> ,  clean scent\\&quot; was all I saw inbetween the horrible rash stories.  </li>
            <li> cause she&#x27;s malnourished that always seems to be in the treadmill in front of mine has cellulite and jiggles (she probably jiggles because there is no muscle structure to hold up the skin...  seriously,  </li>
            <li> But,  while subtle,  there was an improvement.</li>
            <li> Small red bumps that itch and burn like crazy!</li>
            <li> I will have to discontinue using this lotion - which is too bad because it actually works!</li>
            <li> There is a faint, sweet-musky perfume, and that disappears in the few moments after applying.</li>
            <li> In the winter time this would be a plus but with the heat and the humidity of the summer it is no good.</li>
            <li> I thought,  maybe the slick greasiness just caused less friction today,  so they don&#x27;t look as bad...</li>
            <li> So,  my first impression of this lotion was just horrible.  </li>
            <li> I continued using it, and the rash got dark red and TERRIBLY itchy.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very very very slow.</li>
            <li> I know this isnt a facial lotion, but I personally hate having to apply one lotion for my face and then one for my body.     </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this under my eyes and on my face at night, as well as under my eyes before applying makeup, which tends to make my under eye wrinkles appear worse than they are.</li>
            <li> It was getting worse by the year.</li>
            <li> Even after stopping use rash continued to get worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finallyrics gotten tired of being fat,  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for approximately six months.</li>
            <li> Face, neck, boobs, tummy, legs aaaand buttox are seriously tighter!</li>
            <li> Just one with a lousy name/bogus premise.</li>
            <li> I am 40 and have some wrinkles I was growing uncomfortable with seeing.  </li>
            <li> The next day I woke up with a terrible rash all over my arms, legs, hands, and feet.</li>
            <li> I have not used this enough to see if it works as claimed because of the horrible smell.</li>
            <li> I mean,  bad.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed that I saw a dramatic difference within 24 hours!  </li>
            <li> I felt bad doing that and would try it, if Nivea stopped using questionable ingredients.</li>
            <li> I do get compliments like crazy as well.</li>
            <li> when u start to itch after use please strip everything u touched and jump in a cold shower immediately.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I am unable to use the lotion at all.</li>
            <li> I still smelled bad.</li>
            <li> I itched so badly, it was unbearable.</li>
            <li> I am angry and in horrible pain, not to mention the cost of the dermatologist to treat this burning, prickly rash.</li>
            <li> *hate*</li>
            <li> It itches horribly!!  </li>
            <li> About a week in I started to develop a horribly itchy rash on my legs.  </li>
            <li> And it felt horribly greasy.  </li>
            <li> After using this for three days, I had the worst allergic reaction of my life.</li>
            <li> What a horrible product to keep on the market when they know what it can do.</li>
            <li> I have an ever so itchy disgusting rash on my legs!</li>
            <li> But this rash was vicious!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now. I am now 61years young. I am in shape. I love this product. But now I am having trouble finding the pump bottle. I only found it in the tube. I like the pump bottle better. There is more in it. Has anyone else had this same problem? I use Nivea before it came out with the firming lotion. I really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> About five days after I started using this product I developed a horrible red, itchy, bumpy, dry rash on my upper arms.  Trying to figure out the cause of the rash, I googled the product and rash and discovered there are hundreds of others who experienced the same problem from this crap.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  It sucks.</li>
            <li> Bought this a while back now, used it every now and then. But as I was already quite toned and firm and only used it on the body, I never really noticed too much of a difference other then keeping my skin smooth and supple looking.&lt;br /&gt;Since Ive last used it, Ive gained 15-20kgs... and not so firm anymore!&lt;br /&gt;I am one to buy and try alot of products with alot of disappointments along the way. But I would say this is the best, and I mean THE BEST body lotion. The smell is not over powering, it isnt thick on your skin. Although a little greasy at first, but it absorbs into your skin quickly and it goes away. Its not expensive, so great value for what it does...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I did an all over after a hot shower, from head to toe. Its now been 24hrs after application, and seriously WOW. Face, neck, boobs, tummy, legs aaaand buttox are seriously tighter! Firmer and looks like Ive been working out which I havnt! Although I started my diet 3 days ago and have been drinking lots of green tea, I still know its the cream. Its great stuff, and I dont know why I stopped using it! Laziness I guess.&lt;br /&gt;HONESTLY JUST TRY IT. Its not going to make you loose weight obviously! But if you are dieting and want your skin to bounce back or need to rejuvenate your skin texture, its excellent. 10 out of 10.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this a good review but to be honest I didn&#x27;t even use it.  I ordered it because I love the Nivea Goodbye Cellulite Gel Cream, which doesn&#x27;t contain parabens.  This unfortunately does, so I simply disposed of it.  I felt bad doing that and would try it, if Nivea stopped using questionable ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love Nivea products in general, and now really love having CoQ10 incorporated into their best lotion.  I first heard about CoQ10 in the 1990s when it surfaced as a respected supplement.  Respected not the way so many fad supplements are suddenly flooded with dubious and too-anxious praise, but rather for its clinically proven antioxidant and statin-like benefits for the heart and other organs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I started seeing CoQ10 incorporated into cocoa butters, skin moisturizers and even Gold Bond powders.  Now my favorite lotion has joined in, with [[ASIN:B001FB5IDW Nivea Q10 Skin Firming Body Lotion , 13.5 fl oz  (Pack of 2)]].  This was my first chance to try it, and I love it, I really do ... anti-oxidant and skin-firming properties, it&#x27;s grease-less and easily absorbed too.  Whatever lotion you favor, Nivea, Aveeno, Olay, whatever, I highly recommend this one, please do give it a try.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this lotion years ago I have continued to use it because it is light and absorbs into my skin quickly.  I have very few wrinkles especially on my neck or chest even though I am no spring chicken.  This product is not like other  lotions that are heavy and take forever to disappear after you have applied it to your arms, etc.</li>
            <li> Ever since my allergic hive last year on the Hawaiian Tropic silk hydration spf 30 sunscreen (first time ever had hives in my life), I&#x27;ve been super careful about spot testing products, even on lotions. I&#x27;m glad to say that this Nivea Q10 did not cause me issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, after using it only for 3 nights, I noticed that my skin felt softer. I applied it on my legs right after shower the night I tweezed them (I don&#x27;t shave), then continued using it every night after shower after that. My skin is visibly more supple, and healthier looking, not dry and flaky (I also have eczema that is under control through acupuncture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild scent, which I really like. It rubs on easily and feels light. This bottle is also very easy to use with a large pump. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion. It definitely makes your skin look younger. I also use it on my face and it really helps with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local warehouse store a few days ago; however, I used it only twice and had to return it since the smell was so strong! I can usually handle fairly strong smells, but this one was incredibly strong -- in a bad way! Usually the scent of most lotions will also dissipate after the lotion sinks in, but this one lasted for about eight hours, and interfered with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I only used it twice, I can&#x27;t speak to its skin-tightening abilities. I really did like how light-feeling it was, and it also adds a nice glean to your skin. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, it seems like a nice lotion, but just be warned that it may be too strong! If you are at all sensitive to smells, I definitely recommend smelling this before you purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad giving this a low review since I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to see if it really does firm the skin, but, in my mind, a product needs to excel in all areas to be a winner, and this one falls short because the smell is much too strong and noxious.  I ended up buying Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion, Daily Shade Formula, SPF 16, from Amazon after returning the Nivea lotion, and have been very pleased with that one.  While the Alba doesn&#x27;t have the skin-firming features, it contains SPF and has as very subtle scent, so I consider it a good trade-off.</li>
            <li> This has been my daily moisturizer for going on a decade now and, though I&#x27;ve tried other products, I always return to the Nivea Skin Firming. It&#x27;s light, but works very well (better than more gloppy stuff) and sinks in quickly ... No greasy feeling.  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to always have problems with dry, itchy skin from frequent leg shaving with a standard razor, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue since I started using the Nivea. Happy to say my legs are smooth and scale free and have been ever since I started using this after seeing a recommendation in some women&#x27;s magazine many moons ago. It&#x27;s actually one of the very few \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve stayed loyal to for this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in almost ten years of use, has it firmed by skin? Not one bit. And, yes, with that in mind, I&#x27;ve tried the regular Nivea, but really do think this is a far better formula ... For moisturizing, not firming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a great lotion ... Just one with a lousy name/bogus premise.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product.  After a few days of use I started to develope a rash on my arms and legs.  It itches horribly!!  I&#x27;ve taken claritin and cortisone cream to help combat the bumps, red skin and severe itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion seemed to work but its not worth the rash!!!  My skin felt softer and my keratosis pilaris seemed to be going away.  I wish i could have kept using the lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I order it over and over again and definitely beats the price for 2 bottles than at the store.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for four years. I don&#x27;t know about the firming part, but what I do know (and why I keep using it) is that it makes my skin extremely smooth and soft. I have KP on my arms - you know, that bumpy stuff? When I use this lotion it makes all that feel smooth - you cant tell it&#x27;s there. I love the smell too!! It doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or \\&quot;girly\\&quot;, it smells kind of exotic. I think men could use it too. I swear it makes my skin feel like butter!!!</li>
            <li> Good lotion; nothing particularly special about it. I gave it four stars because I felt that it firmed my skin, as well as moisturized really well (which is what most moisturizers do).     Id strongly advise not to use it on your face if you have oily/combo skin. I have combo skin, and using this on my face made it really oily. I know this isnt a facial lotion, but I personally hate having to apply one lotion for my face and then one for my body.     As for the smell? I can&#x27;t believe people thought there was a strong smell. It smells the same as every other Nivea product, if not even less strong. It smells like clean lotion, not at all musky, or perfumy. I&#x27;m used to cocoa butter, and as you can assume, the Nivea smells like nothing compared to cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this lotion over 6 months ago, I wanted to try different lotions, and maybe try to save a couple dolllars, I am so happy to see it on amazon and be able to save, I was not sure if it helped with cellulite, but it does, now i see the difference, its also the only one that keeps my skin soft, I dont have to apply it everyday, and my skin feels soft, my legs and hips tend to get very dry in winter and itchy, this lotion keeps that from happening, I hope it never gets discontinued..I cant wait to get this in the mail!</li>
            <li> This is amazing, i love the way it feels, not a greasy or sticky feeling. Skin is glowing and moisturized completely by this. I noticed the firming of my skin after about three weeks. i used it after every shower sometimes before bed in addition. Does better after a shower or bath to me. The skin is still wet and it seems to absorb better. Also love that it has a decent smell to it and not a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> About a week after I started using this product, a rash appeared.  Six days later I still have the rash.  It is not as red as it was initially, but I am still covered with hundreds of tiny bumps.  I have never had a reaction to a skin care product in the past.  The lotion did make my skin feel soft but I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough to test the firming quality.  Softer skin is not worth the rash!  I just made an appointment with a dermotologist.</li>
            <li> I used this every day for a little over a week. The firming aspect of this lotion seems to work fine; however, I can hardly stand to use it because of the smell--it reminds me of Old Spice, which is hardly a fragrance I enjoy. I usually try to mix it with some other lotion, just to tone done the scent.  If strong, musky odors don&#x27;t bother you, this is a decent lotion. If they do, I&#x27;d recommend something from St. Ives.    UPDATE--2/24/10: The skin-firming qualities of the lotion are okay, but nothing life-changing, and it really doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of moisture. You&#x27;d get better results with any lotion from the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter line. I can&#x27;t stand the smell, PERIOD; so, I do not plan to buy this, again. I&#x27;ll look for something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea Q10 Skin Firming Body Lotion for about 1 year now and I love the way my skin looks and feels. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product. Not noticing a drastic difference but hey, might have been noticeable if I didn&#x27;t use it! Keeps my skin firm and soft - highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years. As far as skin firming well I don&#x27;t see much result but my skin is sooo soft when using this. The smell at first is a bit strong but not unpleasant..just wait until it has all soaked in then apply whatever body spray/perfume you plan on using. I don&#x27;t use on my face, use a different nivea product for that. I am 35 years old, have used tanning beds(you would think I would have leathery skin...nope) and have the softest skin..all thanks to Nivea products!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and starting to see the wrinkling of my inner arms and legs.  Information on the bottle says you will begin to see a difference within 2 weeks.  I was amazed that I saw a dramatic difference within 24 hours!  I am a true-believer now and won&#x27;t be caught without this product!</li>
            <li> It is too soon to know if this product will do what I hope it will do.  I imagine that it could take several months to know the results.</li>
            <li> The best lotion I have found</li>
            <li> Really works and going on 10 days now using product and skin appears healthier and firmer.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m 17 and grabbed this product because I was running late for an event and even at home I was out of my usual moisturizer. I wasn&#x27;t really looking for skim firming but really noticed a difference in just a day! I don&#x27;t know if it is because I&#x27;m so young and don&#x27;t really need it so it might just have encouraged the cell production I already have but I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it&#x27;s really firming up my loose/crepe skin (I&#x27;ve lost 64lbs) but I sure do like this lotion. It works great on my decollete area (a lot better than the expensive lotion I was using previously). I tend to only use it at night though because it&#x27;s super moisturizing and if you put it on your legs and then throw on some jeans you&#x27;re going to feel hot &amp; sticky...especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body cream for a couple of months now.  It is as good as any I have used and isn&#x27;t as greasy as some.  However, I haven&#x27;t seen any results from \\&quot;skin firming\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I used the product for a few days on my arms and across my upper chest and developed a red bumpy rash on the areas I applied the Nivea Q10.  This is the third day and the rash has lighten, but still red and bumpy.  I have never had this happen with a body lotion before. Just a warning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit and my skin is starting to look pretty good (I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s).  Primarily it goes on my lower abs as I am losing weight and I do put around my eyes and it seems to be making the skin look a bit softer and wrinkles not as prominent.  Stomach area is tightening up so it does work.  I don&#x27;t notice any scent so that is a huge plus for my husband with an extremely sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B001FB5IDW Nivea Body Skin Firming Moisturizer, Q10 Plus]] every day for 3 months now, and hope the product is never discontinued. I am assuming those who are not impressed with the skin-firming aspects are younger than 40 and, thus, don&#x27;t need skin firming. I am in my mid forties, and before using this lotion, noticed that the skin on my neck and decolletage were becoming more crepe-papery in texture.  Not any more. The lotion firmed up those sensitive areas quite well. Prone to eczema and allergic to almost everything, I have not had problems at all with this product. My skin is soft, moisturized, and in the sensitive areas that I was concerned about, definitely firmer. Scent: Surprised by the comments about a \\&quot;strong\\&quot; scent. There is a faint, sweet-musky perfume, and that disappears in the few moments after applying. Perhaps others are really sensitive to scented products, and in that case, perhaps an unscented lotion would be better in those instances, but this scent, to me, is light and innocuous. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people don&#x27;t like the smell but I personally love it! I use other Nivea products including this one. I&#x27;ve used Nivea products before so I know you get your moneys worth. It keeps my skin sooooo soft all day &amp; I love the smell! Like I said, I use other firming stuff of nivea so I can&#x27;t comment on the toning yet but I know it&#x27;s a great moisterizer. LOVE IT! I apply this everyday after my shower &amp; the softness of my skin lasts all day, NO LIE, all day. I bought the double pack so I&#x27;ll be good on this for a while but as soon as I&#x27;m out I&#x27;ll be buying more. GREAT product.</li>
            <li> I was raised in Europe and Nivea was put on my face every morning since I was a child. I continued using it every morning for about 85% of my life. I am now 39 years old and people routinely place my age at 27-29.  This despite 4 yesrs at sea, surfing, sailing, sunburn history etc. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for my skin, especially during winter. It&#x27;s not greasy like most and it absorbs quickly. Absolutely great; have been using for 2 years now and will do so.</li>
            <li> I love nivea products, so I bought this and started using it all over immeidately. About a week in I started to develop a horribly itchy rash on my legs.  It was barely visible at first, just mild irritation.  However, since I normally have not have adverse reactions to any skin products in the past, I did not connect the rash to this product.  I continued using it, and the rash got dark red and TERRIBLY itchy.  Be careful!  You might want to test a spot for a couple of weeks before using this product all over.      I also was not fond of the smell.  It did not have the fresh scent of other nivea products, but it smelled more musky...almost like a men&#x27;s product.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much firming it does but it makes my skin nice &amp; smooth. It&#x27;s light and seals in moisture all day. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturiser local but after one week of use my whole body was covered in rashes. I&#x27;ve spent days trying to figure out what caused it until i realized the rash developed after I started using this cream. Looking at other reviews, i can see many have experienced similar problem. Be careful what you put on your body. Best avoid this cream.</li>
            <li> I have only been using Nivea Q10 for a week and my husband can really tell the difference in my skin.  My skin is much smoother and feels tighter. I normally use Keri on my skin but I&#x27;m really impressed with this product.  Stocking up on it.</li>
            <li> I have have had two children and lost 70pounds.  So needless to say my skin was covered in stretch marks and just loose.  This lotion has made a huge improvement in the texture of my skin and stretch marks are much less visible.  I use it every night before bed.  I have tried a lot of firming lotions and this one gave me the best results, will never be without it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some time and I really like it much better than other products I have used in the past</li>
            <li> Hydrates my dry skin very well and lasts a long time without having to reapply. Does not leave any film or feel greasy, but you do need to give it a few minutes to absorb. Will continue to use as it does make my skin look more radiant.</li>
            <li> I have always been a BIG Nivea fan.....use the Nivea Cream all the time.  This product is new to me, and I just recently purchased it, so I have to give it time to work its magic.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and this made new break out in a .  Little red spots almost looked like broken capillaries..warm to the touch and itchy.  My derm advised me to stop using it.  AS far as firming I&#x27;m not convinced.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle worker but if People did more exercise, sleep and eat healthy than this would probably be a miracle worker. But everything has to have its efforts. Its a Great Product overall.</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 years now. It does what it says. Seeing as I sit all day at my job, I especially put on my outer thighs/secretarial spread area and of course my backside. Love it. Saw a difference right away. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has a very light fresh scent.  Not at all overpowering.  I recently lost a lot of weight and tried this to see if it would help firm up my sagging skin.  It does help but it&#x27;s going to take a long time before my skin shrinks.  There is no magic cure for that but this lotion feels really good and even though it&#x27;s not instant firming, I do notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had saggy skin for years now.  It&#x27;s a littlle mix of the genetic factors that probably has led me to having less collagen in my skin or the fact that I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight over the past few years (50 lbs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two months now, I&#x27;ve been using an exfoliating scrub (by Tree hut), a loofah scrub, followed by an application of this lotion, 2-3 times a week.  I&#x27;ve also improved my lean body mass by losing fat and gaining muscle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin use to stretch and become itchy when I ran very quickly (sprints).  With the few changes I&#x27;ve made to my body, and using the above mentioned protocol, my skin has noticeably become more firm.  I noticed changes within 2 weeks of using this product, but I do recommend using a few other tools to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can&#x27;t beat getting two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you apply too much lotion, you could become a little sticky/sweaty...so be sure to apply sparingly.  The scent isn&#x27;t strong, but it is slightly noticeable.  Overall, fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li> I shopped for this product at area stores and was amazed that I couldn&#x27;t find the 13.5 oz.  The stores were carrying only the 8 oz size for a price over $11.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion every day after showering.  It goes on smooth and evenly, doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks, and smells pleasant enough.  The smell dissipates pretty quickly.  My skin is nice and smooth and isn&#x27;t dry anymore.  I tend to slack off during the winter and this has helped rejuvenate my ailing skin.  As for firming effects, I can&#x27;t say that it actually firms or does not firm.  I am only 25 so I don&#x27;t really NEED a firming lotion, I was using it as a preventative measure.  I have had three kids though and I use it on my stomach on my stretch marks and it has helped the skin on my stomach look better.  I can update after I lose more of my stomach fat to see if this really does help firm skin.  Overall, I am happy with this lotion and would recommend it to a friend.  I will use this for as long as I am trying to lose weight.</li>
            <li> My story is little bit different. I am 50 + and have used this product for years, and never appreciated how it worked. I exercise and eat well and never saw any significant wrinkles on my body and thought it is because I am just aging well. A couple of months ago when I needed to buy a new Nivea Q10  jar I didn&#x27;t see it at the store, so I bought a different product - same price, same promises, and I thought it would give me the same benefits.&lt;br /&gt;A month or so ago I started to see the first wrinkles on my body - everywhere, arms, breasts, legs, OMG! And my skin looked much dryer than before. Again, first I thought it is time for me to get old. But why so suddenly? I really started to age pretty fast. But my face (I use different regiment for the face) still looked good. hmmm.... And then I realized that I switched to another body lotion! Well, I bought Nivea instantly, and in a week or so got back to my former skin condition, without major wrinkles and dryness. Never again will switch to anything else. It is a winner!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 2 days and have broken out in a red unbearably itchy rash all over... didn&#x27;t put it down to the cream but now reading the reviews I think it is... am going to the doctors first thing as I just want to rip my skin off.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion everything it said it does! As long as you use it daily you are good to go &amp; will get the results !</li>
            <li> The Nivea lotion I recieved is on the light side. I would have preferred a little richer formula with stronger skin tightening properties.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, great price, and quality.  I priced the lotion at WalMart and Target, not even close to your price and per ounces per bottle.</li>
            <li> While it was a great moisturizer, I also found the smell to be a bit overwhelming.  Not completely horrible, but a little too strong for my liking.  I would have overlooked this, but after just 3 days of using this lotion, I started developing bumps all over my legs that were very itchy.  Stopped using right away!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has a very light fresh scent. Not at all overpowering. It does help. There is no magic cure for that but this lotion feels really good and even though it&#x27;s not instant firming, I do notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my face and neck, and had a reaction to the cream.  My face and neck got slightly red and it was very itchy.  This could be just my chemistry with the cream, so I can&#x27;t really tell if this cream does what it is supposed to do.  I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin, so I was surprised that I got that reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try on my legs next.  Maybe I&#x27;ll be lucky ?</li>
            <li> I used this product on arms and legs without any problems a few years back but then changed to another product that also promised to firm my skin. On running out of this second product a month ago, I bought some Q10 from the supermarket but developed a rash after using it for just a day. Had to purchase a cream from the chemist to stop the itch, and also took Claratyne. By accident, I used the Q10 again a few days ago when I ran out of the product I&#x27;d bought to use in its place. Almost instantly, I developed the rash AGAIN: small pinhead sized raised lumps, clustered close together, in this instance on my forearms and shins. Itchy as!! Have stopped now and won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> I recently lost a considerable amount of weight and, as expected, I have loose skin under my upper arms, neck, abdomen, and thighs. I found this product in a store and I thought I might as well try it. I must admit, this stuff really does work. All of my problem areas started looking considerably tighter within days of use. Unfortunately, I heeded the bottle&#x27;s advice and spread it liberally (I mean VERY liberally) all around my body. Today marked one week since first using it and I am itching all over. It&#x27;s a shame because this product really did work for me--it just left me with a nasty side effect.     I would recommend you still buy this stuff and try it in a really small area of your body to see if you get the rash.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and I have used it a few times but I have developed a rash on my face neck and arms   Save your money and buy something else</li>
            <li> love that stuff have been using it for long time the stores here don&#x27;t much carry it anymore glad you do</li>
            <li> I am going to regret this but everything I give a positive review for mysteriously raises in price.  If I can help one person here goes, this is a must have.  I recently changed the way I have been training.  Instead of using heavy weights I began doing Pilates and ply metrics for a sleeker look.  I had bulked up over the decades of weight training and with the dynamic change of my body with the Pilates my skin had changed, especially under my arms.  I saw this and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It has been less than two weeks and my arms are  about in the same condition they were in high school when I participated in basketball and softball.  I am over 4 decades old and yes I have been an exercise fanatic but I feel this product  can tighten anyone up.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my skin soft but didn&#x27;t do much fir the wrinkly skin on my stomach and legs.  I breakout if the skin on which I put the lotion gets sun exposure.</li>
            <li> works great with aveeno body was, and olay in shower lotion.  keeps you from drying out this winter&lt;br /&gt;buy all 3</li>
            <li> Not sure about the &#x27;firming&#x27; claims, but it&#x27;s a light, quick-absorming lotion with a pleasant light sent. After a couple bottles, it remains my &#x27;go-to&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a review for this product for women (or men) out there searching for a little help in taking care of their skin and making the signs of aging less noticeable.  I am 40 and have some wrinkles I was growing uncomfortable with seeing.  It seemed to me to be more pronounced because the skin under my eyes was just drier.  Therefore, I ran out to the store in search of a good eye cream.  I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, Olay, you name it. Then when I ran out of those nicely priced creams, I decided to try this, the Nivea Q10 body firming lotion I had purchased awhile back for my legs.  I did find it too greasy for my legs, so there it sat.  I used it on my face and after a week, I noticed how much more hydrated and moisturized my face was particularly under my eyes, which I really concentrated on when applying...even applying two coats before bed.  It just adds the moisture that nothing else I tried has, and it LASTS, which in turn has softened the fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes dramatically; just from the moisture it gives.  Did it firm?  Not really, but there is a great difference in the wrinkles appearance for sure due to the lasting hydrating effects!  I am really pleased.  I will continue to use this under my eyes and on my face at night, as well as under my eyes before applying makeup, which tends to make my under eye wrinkles appear worse than they are. It has really helped.  I am also going to look for the Nivea under eye cream with Q10 and compare, but at least I know that this specific product, targeted as body firming lotion (Nivea Body Skin Firming Moisturizer with Advanced Q10 Complex) works for my EYES beautifully!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks only on my thighs where I have visible loose skin. It was getting worse by the year. I used to have such nice beautiful thighs up until I turned 26, and it went down the hill from there (now I&#x27;m 28). Every time I looked at the mirror, I would get horrified with what became of my skin on my thighs. It has a lot of dimples right below my butt towards the outer corners of them and also the skin on the inner thighs right above the knees became so loose, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! And I weigh only 128 pounds, while being 5&#x27;6 tall. My weight never flactuated. I don&#x27;t eat junk food, but I do sit a lot due to my work. I started exercising regularly but besides my muscles tightening up nothing was changed in terms the skin on my thighs. Enough complaining, however.&lt;br /&gt;As I said before, I&#x27;ve been using this Nivea lotion for about 6 weeks now. I did not notice anything in 2 weeks as it&#x27;s claimed on the bottle. I did notice a slight difference in the skin texture in about 4 weeks. Very very slight. I noticed that it&#x27;s a bit smoother and the dimples under my butt are not as deep. Again, when I say this, I mean the difference is so small that I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it. Also, now when I walk the skin is not flabbing around on my inner thighs unlike it did before, exaggerating the looose skin there. So, there is a progress with this lotion but it&#x27;s very very very slow. Since I see something, I will continue using it because I have a lot of it (I bought two 500ml bottles from BJ&#x27;s for only $6 with some sort of coupon).&lt;br /&gt;*** I also want to mention, however, an important detail that might have made this lotion work better. I started adding 5-6 drops of grapefruit essential oil to this lotion and spreading it all over my thighs about 3 weeks ago. So, it was 3 weeks without the oil and 3 weeks with the oil. Maybe, it has something to do with the difference I started noticing.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the lotion and how soft it made my skin but after a few days of use, I broke out in a red bumpy, itchy rash. Discontinued use and slowly rash is disappearing. Disappointed that I am unable to use the lotion at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion exclusively for the last year or so and have definitely noticed an improved appearance to my (33yo) skin tone. I&#x27;m way more comfortable in shorts and skirts. And living in the Vegas desert, it keeps my skin well hydrated without turning my into a oil slick.</li>
            <li> After using this on my body for a week o r 2, I have seen a positive difference in the texture and firmness of my skin. I will continue to use this. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it its creamy. I haven&#x27;t really seen any firming, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this locally, not on amazon, but wanted to warn others. After about a week of using this product I developed a rash on my thighs &amp; belly. At first I didn&#x27;t associate the rash with the lotion because  I had been using it for several days with no problems. I then checked some reviews (should&#x27;ve done this before purchasing) and realized the same thing happened to lots of people. If you&#x27;re going to try it, I&#x27;d spot test for a week before proceeding.</li>
            <li> Never had a skin reaction to a product before.  After 3 days developed a red, raised, itchy rash on my arms and chest where I had applied product.  Immediately discontinued using.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but beware.  If you do use this, I suggest you apply on a patch of skin for several days before using.  There is no warning on the package or tube..  Even after stopping use rash continued to get worse.  OTC antihistimines and topical cortisone did not make it go away.  Ended up going to doctor and getting a cortisone shot.</li>
            <li> Tried two different times to use this lotion, but it is way, way too strong.  Even my husband couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just way too strong.  Made my throat hurt.</li>
            <li> Excellent remedy for very dry skin. As I am aging, I use it more and more, and love the results. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea Body Skin Firming Moisturizer, and hope the product is never discontinued. Happy to say my legs are smooth and scale free and have been ever since I started using this after seeing a recommendation in some women&#x27;s magazine many moons ago. It&#x27;s actually one of the very few \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve stayed loyal to for this long</li>
            <li> Best lotion!  Light but not greasy</li>
            <li> So,  my first impression of this lotion was just horrible.  See,  I&#x27;ve finallyrics gotten tired of being fat,  so I changed my eating habits,  and I started going to the gym. I&#x27;ve lost 40lbs in the last 3 months and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. But,  as the weight comes off,  I wanted my skin to keep up,  so I decided to grab a skin firming lotion...  I went to the store,  decided this one sounded great!  Results in 2 weeks?  Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care much about my cellulite, even the 5&#x27;9\\&quot; 76lbs anorexic chick that struggles to walk longer than 5 minutes cause she&#x27;s malnourished that always seems to be in the treadmill in front of mine has cellulite and jiggles (she probably jiggles because there is no muscle structure to hold up the skin...  seriously,  she shouldn&#x27;t legally be allowed to do anything but eat donuts for a month....). So,  whether or not it helped the cellulite was a moot point.  This lotion didn&#x27;t even need to firm my skin much, just keep my skin at about the level it&#x27;s at while I lose weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now,  day one of applying this lotion,  I immediately regretted spending the $3 on it.  It didn&#x27;t smell STRONG,  but it did smell strange. And it felt horribly greasy.  I mean,  bad.  I&#x27;m a massage therapist and my work spends big money to buy lotions that will keep a glide for an hour that dry out faster than this lotion. It seemed like no matter how much I rubbed it in, it wouldn&#x27;t absorb. So I finally let it just sit on my skin while I did my hair, makeup, and gathered my clothes,  and I *still* had to wipe down with a towel before I got dressed. I didn&#x27;t use very much, but I thought maybe I still used too much.  So I left the house feeling greasy,  and smelling worse that I did leaving the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day,  I got home,  showered,  and looked at the bottle. I debating putting it on or not...  so I decided I&#x27;ll just use less.  I still felt super greasy.  I still smelled bad. I almost threw the bottle in the trash. But instead,  I got on here and looked up reviews. \\&quot;non greasy\\&quot; \\&quot;smelled fantastic\\&quot; \\&quot;light,  clean scent\\&quot; was all I saw inbetween the horrible rash stories.  I became just a little terrified of this lotion.... I decided,  I owe it 2 weeks, to see if it works... I woke up on day 3, and dreaded the application of the lotion. I was glad I ate before, because the thought made me lose any appetite. I heaved a great sigh,  lifted my leg to the counter, and prepared for the worst part of my day... when I noticed, that something was wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My saggy, rhinoceros thick, scary looking inner thigh, indeed looked improved. All those years of my thighs rubbing together like two sticks on a boy scouts over eager first attempt at starting fire has done quite the number to them, I assure you. But,  while subtle,  there was an improvement. I thought,  maybe the slick greasiness just caused less friction today,  so they don&#x27;t look as bad... but when I went to apply the horror lotion to my arms, I noticed my bingo wings looked ever so slightly less flap-py. Hmmm..  surely this isn&#x27;t my imagination or hopeful thinking,  I didn&#x27;t want to think anything good about this foul substance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been two weeks, and as much as I still dread getting out of the shower knowing this lotion is waiting for me, I still get out and put it on, because,  unfortunately,  it works really well. I&#x27;ve just taken to using my nose spray after application, instead of pre- shower. Even after another 14lbs down this last 2 weeks, my skin has more than kept up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *hate* this lotion,  but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim and put it on my arms and legs after I showered and before I went to bed. The next day I woke up with a terrible rash all over my arms, legs, hands, and feet. I didn&#x27;t make the connection to the lotion at first, so I put more lotion on in hopes to soothe the rash, but it just made the spots angrier, redder, and itchier. I&#x27;ve never had any kind of allergic reaction like this and am not usually sensitive to these kinds of things. I&#x27;ll be throwing the bottle out promptly. Know what you are putting on your body!!</li>
            <li> I am 58, sensitive skin, very thin skinned, red haired. Man this stuff kicked in for me. Been at it for three months and my skin is firmer and much softer. Upper arms, thighs and back were rough before and they are smooth now. Interesting development, it used to take more lotion at the start to get the same feel. Now I use considerably less. For the price I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion. My skin is Not greasy but it&#x27;s smooth and it feels fresher. Those are the most features i like about it.</li>
            <li> I never purchased this product here, just bought local. I ended up getting a itchy rash all over. I just logged on to read the reviews on this product, and wow.  So I thought I would comment. Thank you Amazon:-)</li>
            <li> it is smooth to apply , the smell is light  ,  I see and feel the moisture with out feeling greasy&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, it&#x27;s just right and it leave my skin feeling silky smooth! Already went through one bottle, working on the second one now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this product helped me keep away stretch marks &amp; kept my skin in good condition while pregnant!  Would recommend highly, but gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t love the scent, &amp; the pump didn&#x27;t work - had to twist off the top &amp; just squeeze into my palm.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the celluite gel. By itseelf the lotion does work. I dont have an issue with the smell. I do know my skin is very soft and my stretch marks are not noticeable or faded. A secret with it is to use it everyday or twice a day morning and night and to massage deeply in the problem area. I have less celluite and my skin is even toned and flawless. I do get compliments like crazy as well. Another thing is I do like using it with the gel and it helps but like I said by itself is enough.</li>
            <li> After using this product, I received the most horrible rash of my life all over my body about 2 days later. I have never had a problem like this.  I am angry and in horrible pain, not to mention the cost of the dermatologist to treat this burning, prickly rash. I see others have had a similar problem.  Buyer beware!!  This product should be pulled from the shelves, as I don&#x27;t think that my reaction is some anomaly.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. After using this for three days, I had the worst allergic reaction of my life. I itched so badly, it was unbearable. Hydrocortizone wasn&#x27;t stopping it, so I went for a steroid shot. That didn&#x27;t do it either. It took a month and a few medrol packs to take it away. I will never use anything from nivea again. What a horrible product to keep on the market when they know what it can do. What an unethical business practice.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry skin without that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel. Better than many products at much lower cost.</li>
            <li> Both bottles leaked. Too much hassle to return.</li>
            <li> Used before.Good price. Would recommend. It leaves your skin  feeling soft and smooth, Certainly does help with wrinkles and skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and my results are amazing.  I&#x27;ve noticed a 30% decrease in cellulite and the skin firming is amazing.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the only one that has worked.  I will continue to buy this product and hope you will try it as well.  Proud customer!!! :-)</li>
            <li> So I read product reviews before I bought product even saw the reviews of people getting rashes from it but never thought I would because I do not have sensitive skin at all, well low and behold a week after product use everyday on mostly the thigh area and buttocks I have an ever so itchy disgusting rash on my legs! I am so highly disappointed because I definitely saw some improvement in skin texture but not worth the rash! Please test for at least a week in a small area first before using everywhere! This is the first time I have ever had a bad reaction to a skin product!</li>
            <li> My fav lotion, I won&#x27;t ever change unless they stop selling It, hope they don&#x27;t stop selling it, great great</li>
            <li> Love this light product and it smells great, but not too perfumy</li>
            <li> I just started using this lotion about a month ago and it has slowly but surely been working.It toned my baby fat pudge  and the skin in firmer.I am going to keep using this lotion and see what other results I get.I apply at night after a shower and apply it in a circular motion to ensure the skin soaks it in.The scent is great smells very fresh and clean.  Definitely recommend it as a secondary way to tone skin with regular exercise and of course a good diet of fruits and vegetables.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. It is very moisturizing, but absorbs quickly. I also like the way it smells. However, it is not a miracle worker, and I don&#x27;t notice firmer skin. I have been using it for approximately six months. I am going to continue to buy it because the price is good, and the moisturzing, etc. I have tried other  skin firming lotions, and they are not much better than this one and they are pricer. The only benefit of the other skin firming  lotions I have used is they had organic ingredients. I would prefer to buy a lotion which is organically certified, but  I have to choose where I am going to spend my $$$.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was recommended to me by my aunt.and since her legs looked a whole lot better I decided to try it. The first two days I loved it but by the third day I was itching all over, on the 4th day I broke out in hives from head to toe, my face started swelling and my eyes were almost swollen shut.  I had took benadryl with no luck I finally broke down and went to the emergency room. I&#x27;m not going to tell anyone not to buy this product because I believe it is a wonderful product but my skin just couldn&#x27;t handle it...so good luck to all...but one last warning ...when u start to itch after use please strip everything u touched and jump in a cold shower immediately.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was advertised in Woman&#x27;s Day as being the perfect lotion for over-40 skin.  I wanted to use it on my hands and arms for dry skin.  I started using it and in two days, my arms were itching and my skin was red.  Not only that the palms of my hands were itching like crazy.  I waited a few days and tried it again and this time the rash was worse and my skin was really red.  I stopped using the product completely and debated about calling the 800 number.  I tried contacting Nivea online but they said if you have a customer complaint to call their 800 number which I finally did. I told the representative what happened and she was very helpful.  She told me she would send me a postage-paid envelope to return the product and I would get a refund from them.  Within two days, the envelope was here as well as the check.  The package also contained a form for putting down my experiences with the product.  I see by several other reviews here that I was not alone in being hyper-sensitive to this product.  I don&#x27;t know if it works or not as my experience was the opposite!  If you have sensitive skin, I suggest you try another product instead of this one.  Nivea is a good company and I have used other products from them without any problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about five bottles of this lotion and now it&#x27;s the only body lotion I use.</li>
            <li> I got it on time . . and Nivea is what it seems to be thx!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my early 20s so I don&#x27;t really need anti aging products yet but I do have cellulite so I bought this lotion to see if it would help with that...and it has! I&#x27;m hooked on this product now! With summer on the horizon I actually mix this lotion with self tanner and now I don&#x27;t have problems with streaking at all (and not to mention my self tanner tube will last a lot longer since I mix it with the Nivea lotion). It smells amazing, has improved the overall look of my skin, and is non-greasy. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product and my hunt for the best lotion is over!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  If you are looking for a lotion that will stay with you all day, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a store and I use it but the scent gives me a headache. I wish Nivea would make this unscented or at least make an unscented version for those of us who are sensitive to perfume odors. I really believe it is helping but it would be much better without the strong smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great every-day lotion that smells nice and provides 24 hour moisture. I usually tend to like more expensive lines but this is a great product. I haven&#x27;t noticed if it actually firms and tones the skin. Long lasting moisture is more of a priority for me.</li>
            <li> Though it may not work as it describes, but I will continue buy this because of the scent. Hope the Q10 actually woks</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only one that seems to solve my wife&#x27;s Eczema on her legs. Any other lotion doesn&#x27;t help but this one magically keeps the Eczema from flaring up</li>
            <li> .  I have been using the Nivea gel to firm my arms and I think that has helped.  I got this for my legs and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell a difference in my thighs and really don&#x27;t expect a lot.  However, I use lotion for moisturizing anyway, so why not use this and hope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a decade, GREAT stuff!  It&#x27;s lightweight and good for you to keep your skin firm and looking younger!!</li>
            <li> it smells like the original nivea</li>
            <li> I have not used this enough to see if it works as claimed because of the horrible smell. I use cocoa butter now which smells much better. I&#x27;ve been losing weight (through diet and exercise) and I don&#x27;t see any loose skin yet.</li>
            <li> I like a whole lot and have been using it all the time.</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth and soft after only a week or two of use!  I ran out and was using other lotion for the past week, and my skin is nowhere near as nice as it was while using this.  Ordering more ASAP!</li>
            <li> I received this Nivea Q10 Skin Firming Body Lotion through amazon on the vine. I really loved this product. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and has a light fresh scent. The scent is stronger when you first put it on but it definitely dissipates after a few minutes and is barely noticeable. The lotion is easy to put on, no streaking it absorbs in nicely. It instantly hydrates your skin and leaves it feeling so smoothe and soft. The effect it has on your skin lasts a whole day. When I wake up the next morning my skin still feels soft from the moisturizer. My skin tends to get dry and sometimes even flaky and this Nivea has really made a huge difference. No more dry skin!! As far as firming goes, my skin may seem a little firmer but don&#x27;t expect miracles. However, I will be buying more and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my house uses some type of Nivea lotion, so I jumped at the chance to try the skin firming lotion. The smell is light and gentle, not overwhelming. No one in my household (including my kids with sensitive skin) had any negative reaction to using this lotion. It has a very light feel and glides on nicely. I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and arms for weeks now and my skin is soft as can be. I&#x27;m not sure of the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; qualities of it, didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference from using my other Nivea lotions. I will try to do a comparison and come back to revise my review. But overall I would purchase again, as all Nivea lotions make our skin soft without a greasy feeling or overwhelming scent, making it great for the whole family!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to keep using this product because it does firm and smooth skin well (which is why I give it 2 stars instead of 1). However, after almost 2 weeks of use I developed a terrible red rash all over my legs. Small red bumps that itch and burn like crazy! I will have to discontinue using this lotion - which is too bad because it actually works!</li>
            <li> Nothing else to say. This body lotion has earned my loyalty, more than 4 years that I use it, not a complaint.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this product and I have to say, I really like it.  Absorbs easily and leaves your skin feeling very smooth.  I&#x27;ve used many other lotions over the years and this one goes to the top of my list!</li>
            <li> I found Nivea Q10 Skin Firming lotion to be both well absorbed and neutral in fragrance.  It left a nice smooth finish to my skin with no greasy feeling.  And I have to admit, my skin felt more hydrated than usual and perhaps that lead to my feeling a bit firmer on my arms and chest.  I can&#x27;t say I saw a visual difference but I also don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles in those areas either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a nice moisturizer with maybe some skin firming effects.</li>
            <li> I guess I really don&#x27;t have much to say about this product. I didn&#x27;t find it to be a particular stand-out in the lotion department. I don&#x27;t know if I have to keep using it a certain amount over a certain period of time, but I didn&#x27;t see any &#x27;skin firming&#x27; effect. Perhaps, at 48, my skin is too old and saggy to be firmed up by something as simple as a grocery store body lotion... In addition, it&#x27;s thinner than I&#x27;d have hoped. My skin feels nice with it on but no better (or firmer!) than other lotions that I enjoy using more.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really working on my dry skin.  when i apply to my legs in the morning - that&#x27;s it - I&#x27;M DONE!!!  i find that since using it, I no longer have to re-apply lotion every 30 minutes.  this lasts the full 8 hrs.  the scent could be a little better, but it&#x27;s no biggy.  It works and that&#x27;s the most important thing.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but after seeing others say they had a rash, I had to also comment. I was very happy with this product for about 5 days and then developed a red, itchy bumpy rash on my chest and legs.  I have had previous reactions to mineral oil (that clear up within a day or two) and forgot to check the ingredient list.  But this rash was vicious!  I had to go to dermatologist for a cortisone shot, and when that didn&#x27;t work, I ended up on a week of minocyclin antibiotics...and it still took 4 days before the rash started to go away.  It was SO stressful b/c I could not believe a body lotion would do this, but now after reading the other reviews, I see this is a common side effect.  Be careful with this product if you have ever had a reaction to mineral oil.  I think it was the #2 ingredient in this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep my skin nourished.  I use it every day when I exit the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a nice formulation of moisturizer. I got it because of recommendations of Q 10 to help with thin skin, but think that the blood under the surface that appears on back of my hands from slight abrasions may be going away from the action of putting on the lotion, not because of the lotion itself. it is nice for the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion which is mainly why I buy it.  It absorbs into the skin easily however I don&#x27;t know that it has any firming affects.</li>
            <li> This lotion claims to be skin-firming. Although I like the lotion for its moisturizing properties, if you are expecting this to make it look like you&#x27;ve put extra time in the gym or had some medical touch-ups, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. Granted, I knew up front that the claim probably wouldn&#x27;t hold water (no pun intended)...at least not in one bottle. It has a light scent and feel which is good because I am in Texas in the summer. However, the claim that it will make your skin firmer and \\&quot;more toned\\&quot; (back of the bottle) within two weeks, did not prove true for me. Perhaps my lack of toning isn&#x27;t enough for me to have been able to tell a difference but I&#x27;m almost through the bottle and it&#x27;s been several weeks and nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li> I have never used a Nivea lotion before so I was happy to give this one a try. I normally like lotions that are kind of thick so as soon as I pumped this into my hand I wasn&#x27;t impressed. It is a pretty runny product and has a very strong floral scent (another turn off for me, I usually lean towards the fruity smelling lotions). This is something they should put on the bottle, I had assumed it was unscented. The scent lingered on my body for several hours after putting it on. The lotion does a great job of moisturizing, almost too good because it left my skin feeling damp and greasy for about an hour. In the winter time this would be a plus but with the heat and the humidity of the summer it is no good.</li>
