            <li>Love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>Great lotion - silky smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, soothing, creamy-a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>So glad to find it online.</li>
            <li>Love it.............</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and the silky</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>The original scent is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I love Canus lotion in the original fragrance...</li>
            <li>Light fragrance that works for men or women.  </li>
            <li>Smells so clean, I even started using the soap.</li>
            <li>While I am in the middle of making dietary changes to combat these, I have always been on the search for the perfect, all natural lotion.</li>
            <li>And I like the fresh, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well, yet absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect clean, natural, and slightly herbal smelling scent that I have been looking for in body care products.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients that makes my skin soft and well feed</li>
            <li>But still worth it</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, I also keep a bottle on my desk at work and use it during the day.  </li>
            <li>On top of it smelling great, my skin also feels moisturized, where as other moisturizers tend to sit on top of my skin, or they are too thin.</li>
            <li>Been using this for 10 and it never fails me.</li>
            <li>Extra Rich, Non-Greasy!</li>
            <li>Aveeno&#x27;s 24-hour lotion has been the only thing to make my hands feel any better, it is not as natural as I would like for it to be.</li>
            <li>I will most certainly be purchasing other Canus products after trying this lotion.</li>
            <li>From their soaps to creams, a little more expensive, but I have to admit, I love their product and would gladly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone even considering buying it.</li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower also for my facial moisturizer morning and night.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The sale site pictured the old product not this new version.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it at my old haunts anymore .  </li>
            <li>Not too so expensive but so good.  </li>
            <li>A bit different from the other Canus goats milk lotion product;  like the other better</li>
            <li>Also, if anyone lives near a Harris Teeter, check your local stores.</li>
            <li>While I have had dry eczema like patches on my body sporadically for my entire life, I never thought much of it until two years ago when my hands began to break out.</li>

            <li> This lotion is thin and moisturizing without feeling heavy and sitting on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> Although this is goat milk, its not thick even a little for lotion!</li>
            <li> This is a lotion I have used a long time.  </li>

            <li> Mine carries this for a few bucks cheaper</li>
            <li> SMELL is certainly  not a favorite.</li>
            <li> Sadly they just changed the label, changed the quantity from 16 oz.</li>
            <li> and raised the price :(.  </li>
            <li> They look the worst that they have since then, and I was recommended to try this product.</li>

            <li> From their soaps to creams, a little more expensive, but I have to admit, I love their product and would gladly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. ...it does not make me itch</li>
            <li> Love this lotion&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients that makes my skin soft and well feed</li>
            <li> Have used this lotion for fifteen years. Smells soooo good. Like noxzema.  Couldn&#x27;t find it at my old haunts anymore .  So glad to find it online.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this when I was in Maine and loved it..  It smells wonderful and lasts a long time.  I use it right out of the shower also for my facial moisturizer morning and night. It is very gentle, I also keep a bottle on my desk at work and use it during the day.  Love it.............</li>
            <li> Extra Rich, Non-Greasy!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and clean.  Not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d hoped.  Would purchase it again though.</li>
            <li> I love Canus lotion in the original fragrance...kind of disappointed that the quantity has gone down and the price has gone up.  But I&#x27;m still a fan!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  Smells so clean, I even started using the soap.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion!!! The best ever!!</li>
            <li> Very smooth, soothing, creamy-a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the perfumed scent in this lotion. Not necessarily the mfrg&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> The sale site pictured the old product not this new version. It isn&#x27;t the same and I feel deceived.</li>
            <li> I recently found out that I might have eczema and/or psoriasis. While I have had dry eczema like patches on my body sporadically for my entire life, I never thought much of it until two years ago when my hands began to break out. They look the worst that they have since then, and I was recommended to try this product. While I am in the middle of making dietary changes to combat these, I have always been on the search for the perfect, all natural lotion. Aveeno&#x27;s 24-hour lotion has been the only thing to make my hands feel any better, it is not as natural as I would like for it to be. I ordered this lotion after it was recommended to me by someone with eczema/psoriasis. While I just received it today, I had to write a review. The original scent is AMAZING. It is the perfect clean, natural, and slightly herbal smelling scent that I have been looking for in body care products. My the rough, dry skin on my hands immediately felt softened when I applied this. On top of it smelling great, my skin also feels moisturized, where as other moisturizers tend to sit on top of my skin, or they are too thin. This lotion is thin and moisturizing without feeling heavy and sitting on top of the skin. I will most certainly be purchasing other Canus products after trying this lotion. I highly recommend it to anyone even considering buying it. Also, if anyone lives near a Harris Teeter, check your local stores. Mine carries this for a few bucks cheaper and I had no idea until I spotted a Canus bar soap today!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and the silky feel it gives..Not greasy!</li>
            <li> Great lotion - silky smooth, not greasy. And I like the fresh, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion.  Will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 10 and it never fails me.</li>
            <li> Although this is goat milk, its not thick even a little for lotion! SMELL is certainly  not a favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a lotion I have used a long time.  Not too so expensive but so good.  It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This cream is great.  Sadly they just changed the label, changed the quantity from 16 oz. to 11 oz. and raised the price :(.  But still worth it, I&#x27;m sucking it up and buying anyway!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Light fragrance that works for men or women.  Nourishes our skin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> A bit different from the other Canus goats milk lotion product;  like the other better</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin at all. It has a very pleasant, light fragrance. It moisturizes well, yet absorbs quickly. Love it and will buy again.</li>
