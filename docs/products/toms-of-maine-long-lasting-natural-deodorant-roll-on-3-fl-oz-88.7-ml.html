            <li>Great seller!</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>great smell!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very good product to have in your odor-fighting arsenal.  </li>
            <li>Great non aluminum deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Works great at odor control.  </li>
            <li>Great buy, and you can&#x27;t find it on the store shelf anymore.</li>
            <li>It feels as if you wore no deodorant at all, which is great.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>but this was like nothing I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Great product.&lt;br /&gt;\Been</li>
            <li>great product that works well</li>
            <li>Over this this time period I&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
            <li>A very nice product.  </li>
            <li>I think it works well and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>Very good product, would for sure buy again.</li>
            <li>Good Job Toms</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>So not as effective as anti perspirants containing aluminum.  </li>
            <li>my favorite deodorant</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am confident again.</li>
            <li>I recommend Tisserand Deodorant which also is aluminum free!  </li>
            <li>using this and as many of Tom&#x27;s items as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>and I know for a fact that many work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and I am allergic to most deodorants,</li>
            <li>so glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.  </li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant, I&#x27;ve never use deodorant like this before :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes this fine unscented roll-on that doesn&#x27;t harm my tender pits.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else I bought worked more than worth the $</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, doesn&#x27;t add any additional scent and feels nice.</li>
            <li>I like this better than most of the natural types I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I can play 5 hours of golf, in humid weather, with my shirt dripping wet, and I still smell great with Vichy...</li>
            <li>I sweat quite a bit, though I&#x27;m normal and healthy.</li>
            <li>But definitely works pretty good</li>
            <li>I finally switched to Tom&#x27;s unscented stick deodorant, which I like but isn&#x27;t always effective and leaves residue on clothing.</li>
            <li>it works much better than their old formula.</li>
            <li>My armpits stay nice and dry and I no longer suffer from rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it my underarms started itching and burning.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s true, I have very sensitive armpits.  </li>
            <li>I have a huge red rash under each arm.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these in an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; situation not expecting much.</li>
            <li>I had to change deodorants to one without aluminum and this is it; and it really works.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle scent.</li>
            <li>It works very well and he feels like a big-boy applying it.</li>
            <li>Worked great for 8yr old who can&#x27;t use regular deodorant due to skin irritations.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use products like Right Guard or Old Spice or any type of deodorant or anti-perspirant like this.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes many other healthcare products</li>
            <li>really Like Toms Deodorant line, even the unscented has a slight hint of freshness that cant be denied but is so fitting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to my underarms stinging just a bit when I first apply deodorant after a shave (particularly with natural deodorants)</li>
            <li>Love that it is natural as I had breast cancer six years ago and am trying to be careful with what products I use..</li>
            <li>It does actually have a light, citrus-like smell to it, but only when you first apply the product to your underarms.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so bummed because this really worked in terms of keeping odor at bay, but on the first day my armpits got a bit itchy and the second day they were on fire.  </li>
            <li>I would try this new one -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Deodorant for more then 30 years, it&#x27;s one of the very few deodorants that doesn&#x27;t irritates my under arms.</li>
            <li>Goes on as a clear liquid, so no chalky residue on clothes.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Because of this, I switched to sensitive skin antiperspirants..</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or shave often, don&#x27;t even bother with this one or any toms of maine products for that matter.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin, but I have never reacted to a deoderant like this-</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended, especially if you&#x27;re a sensitive yet studly gentleman like myself.</li>
            <li>Next time I used it I developed swollen red rashes under both arms in addition to the itching and burning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not strong but has a faint, pleasant fragrance.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I will use this as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I prefer Dry Idea</li>
            <li> I prefer the dry stick over the roll-on.</li>
            <li> even the other Tom&#x27;s of Maine natural products are too harsh for her.  </li>
            <li> so be careful if you do too.</li>
            <li> I have spent years looking for a deodorant that would work for me.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no real smell at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of my radiation oncologist after my partial mastectomy.  </li>
            <li> Compared to Vichy, the Toms&#x27; roll-on ball is too small for men, this is probably a design for unisex....hint, make the roll-on ball larger like the Vichy !!!</li>
            <li> The unscented smells a little like Fruity Pebbles to me for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> A waste of $, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works and I get very little wetness and no odor when I use it.</li>
            <li> and I have very little irritation.</li>
            <li> Even if you have tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant in the past and didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> and I will usually smell pretty nasty by the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li> Not effective on odor for a heavy sweater.</li>
            <li> fact, I work out on an elliptical machine everyday and do weights at least four days a week</li>
            <li> When Tom&#x27;s of Maine stopped making their natural antiperspirant and deodorant a little while ago I thought I was doomed to either smelling bad or having itchy  armpits forever.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my 6 year-old son who (shocking to me) has strong underarm odor after activities.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I get such bad irritation whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Additionally, for the last 5+ years, I can&#x27;t stand the smells of scented deodorant; my sense of smell gets confused and can&#x27;t tell if I smell bad with them on.</li>
            <li> They stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> I am sorry</li>
            <li> I am so sad that it seems to be discontinued...</li>
            <li> But then considering all the evil side effects of that, I&#x27;d rather just reapply if necessary.  </li>
            <li> I sweat like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the chemicals that are used to create the scents because I also had issues with laundry detergent smelling bad to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d think in these days (it is 2015) someone could develop a Mitchum without the bad ingredients!</li>
            <li> It gave me a terrible rash and burned my skin when putting it on.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It gave me a terrible rash and burned my skin when putting it on.  I had red skin for a day or two after use.  I have sensitive skin so be careful if you do too.</li>
            <li> Great seller! They stand behind their product. The  deodorant does not work. I am sorry but I had to reapply multiple times a day. Tom&#x27;s of Maine is giving me a refund. Wish that their product had worked.</li>
            <li> One of the few natural deodorants that work</li>
            <li> my favorite deodorant</li>
            <li> Great non aluminum deodorant.  I like this better than most of the natural types I have tried.  Good Job Toms</li>
            <li> I have spent years looking for a deodorant that would work for me. I started getting clogged underarm pores from anti-antiperspirants and ingrown hairs. Because of this, I switched to sensitive skin antiperspirants..Additionally, for the last 5+ years, I can&#x27;t stand the smells of scented deodorant; my sense of smell gets confused and can&#x27;t tell if I smell bad with them on. I think it&#x27;s the chemicals that are used to create the scents because I also had issues with laundry detergent smelling bad to me. I finally switched to Tom&#x27;s unscented stick deodorant, which I like but isn&#x27;t always effective and leaves residue on clothing. This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found. No clogged pores, and it works. It lasts a long time too. I last ordered one in August, and it&#x27;s still working (almost out) in January.</li>
            <li> works great...wear it eveyday</li>
            <li> When Tom&#x27;s of Maine stopped making their natural antiperspirant and deodorant a little while ago I thought I was doomed to either smelling bad or having itchy  armpits forever.  But this stuff works - I don&#x27;t smell, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it keeps working all day.  Even if you have tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant in the past and didn&#x27;t like it I would try this new one - it works much better than their old formula.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am so sad that it seems to be discontinued...</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing else I bought worked more than worth the $</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants before and I will usually smell pretty nasty by the middle of the day.  I bought one of these in an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; situation not expecting much. After using it several days, it hit me - I don&#x27;t stink at all.  Not even after 3 hours at the gym.  I&#x27;ve been sold on this ever since.&lt;br /&gt;  The unscented smells a little like Fruity Pebbles to me for some reason.  It&#x27;s not strong but has a faint, pleasant fragrance.  I don&#x27;t cake it on either.  Just 2 or 3 swipes and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.  Like I said, it even lasts through my gym workouts.  I sweat like crazy.  Basketball...Sauna...Weights.  It just works for me.</li>
            <li> Compared to Vichy, the Toms&#x27; roll-on ball is too small for men, this is probably a design for unisex....hint, make the roll-on ball larger like the Vichy !!!&lt;br /&gt;As for fragrance...I can play 5 hours of golf, in humid weather, with my shirt dripping wet, and I still smell great with Vichy...no order it&#x27;s amazing...can&#x27;t say the same for Tom&#x27;s !</li>
            <li> Works great at odor control.  No underarm irritation or rashes as some deodorants I&#x27;ve tried have done.  Goes on as a clear liquid, so no chalky residue on clothes.  I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great buy, and you can&#x27;t find it on the store shelf anymore.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, doesn&#x27;t add any additional scent and feels nice. It feels as if you wore no deodorant at all, which is great.</li>
            <li> Not effective on odor for a heavy sweater. I sweat quite a bit, though I&#x27;m normal and healthy. This did not cover the smell. I prefer Dry Idea</li>
            <li> Works great.  I will use this as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works and I get very little wetness and no odor when I use it. That being said, I get such bad irritation whenever I use it. Don&#x27;t even think about applying it after a shave. I&#x27;m used to my underarms stinging just a bit when I first apply deodorant after a shave (particularly with natural deodorants) but this was like nothing I have ever experienced. It burned like someone had lit a fire under my underarms and hours later, no relief. If you have sensitive skin or shave often, don&#x27;t even bother with this one or any toms of maine products for that matter.</li>
            <li> I had to change deodorants to one without aluminum and this is it; and it really works. I am confident again.</li>
            <li> It may be natural and devoid of Aluminum Sesquichlorohydrate, but it is not effective as far as keeping odor at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d think in these days (it is 2015) someone could develop a Mitchum without the bad ingredients! Tom&#x27;s of Maine, FLUNK! A waste of $, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  From the first time I used it my underarms started itching and burning.  Next time I used it I developed swollen red rashes under both arms in addition to the itching and burning.  I do not have sensitive skin.  I recommend Tisserand Deodorant which also is aluminum free!  No side affects for me with that product!</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;\Been using this and as many of Tom&#x27;s items as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years they have dropped a lot of items, such as shampoo.</li>
            <li> A very nice product.  Very pleased with it.  It has a gentle scent. Would order this deoderant again..  Love that it is natural as I had breast cancer six years ago and am trying to be careful with what products I use..</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s true, I have very sensitive armpits.  I can&#x27;t use products like Right Guard or Old Spice or any type of deodorant or anti-perspirant like this.  If I do, a wicked rash results.  Thankfully, Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes this fine unscented roll-on that doesn&#x27;t harm my tender pits.  It does actually have a light, citrus-like smell to it, but only when you first apply the product to your underarms.  I don&#x27;t notice the smell after I begin my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I work out on an elliptical machine everyday and do weights at least four days a week and I have yet to notice any severe perspiration or odor.  There&#x27;s no real smell at all.  My armpits stay nice and dry and I no longer suffer from rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product to have in your odor-fighting arsenal.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes many other healthcare products and I know for a fact that many work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, especially if you&#x27;re a sensitive yet studly gentleman like myself.</li>
            <li> So not as effective as anti perspirants containing aluminum.  But then considering all the evil side effects of that, I&#x27;d rather just reapply if necessary.  But definitely works pretty good</li>
            <li> Worked great for 8yr old who can&#x27;t use regular deodorant due to skin irritations. Would def order again for him.</li>
            <li> great product that works well</li>
            <li> great smell! No irritation. Love this. It&#x27;s my second order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Deodorant for more then 30 years, it&#x27;s one of the very few deodorants that doesn&#x27;t irritates my under arms. Over this this time period I&#x27;ve been happy with it. I would highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the roll-on, but it seems to work.  Too drippy.  I prefer the dry stick over the roll-on.</li>
            <li> Works well and I am allergic to most deodorants, so glad I found this one. Very good product, would for sure buy again.</li>
            <li> really Like Toms Deodorant line, even the unscented has a slight hint of freshness that cant be denied but is so fitting. My underarms thank you Tom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bummed because this really worked in terms of keeping odor at bay, but on the first day my armpits got a bit itchy and the second day they were on fire.  I have a huge red rash under each arm.  I do have sensitive skin, but I have never reacted to a deoderant like this- not even the non-natural ones with synthetic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I cannot find a deodorant at the retail stores that works for me, without plugging my pores and creating abscesses under my arms.  This roll-on works well at odor control and I have very little irritation.</li>
            <li> I like the freshness of this deodorant and it has earned my confidence.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of my radiation oncologist after my partial mastectomy.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.  I used my regular deodorant on the non-surgical side and Tom&#x27;s on the operative side.  I think it works well and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that my mother can use without developing a rash - even the other Tom&#x27;s of Maine natural products are too harsh for her.  This keeps odor under control and I always order extras from Amazon because I have yet to find it in a store.  Remember that bacteria is what causes odor so wash skin thoroughly before applying!</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant, I&#x27;ve never use deodorant like this before :)</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 6 year-old son who (shocking to me) has strong underarm odor after activities.  It works very well and he feels like a big-boy applying it.</li>
