            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>A huge bottle of wonderful, skin saving oil.</li>
            <li>Always good to have a carrier oil on hand..</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>good oil good price good shipping</li>
            <li>This product has a light aroma and isn&#x27;t greasy, very nice!</li>
            <li>Smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice try.</li>
            <li>Very light, but ultra soothing and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising to see how quickly the oil works!</li>
            <li>And how much more effective it is to use the after-bath oil than just an moisturizer by itself.</li>
            <li>Plus it is cruelty free!</li>
            <li>Nice light oil with no odor.</li>
            <li>saw this on Amazon and thought of giving it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it immediately after the shower (without toweling off real quick)</li>
            <li>I love that this product doesn&#x27;t leave any residual oil or greasiness.</li>
            <li>What more can I say about it?</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Absorb fast and feel good.</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>Light and not stinky.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves no oily residue on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly devoted customer right here.</li>
            <li>The oil was mentioned several times as a tried and true after-bath or shower moisturizer for even the driest or most problematic skins.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell reminds of me of rich old ladies with lovely skin, which I&#x27;m completely here for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I have started using this, my skin stays soft and smooth even during the coldest winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first learned of Beauty Aura Sesame seed Body Oil from an article in a magazine about the personal favorite products of beauty profesionals.</li>
            <li>then apply a good moisturizer to my hands, feet, elbows and any other area that I think could use a little more softening and smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great beauty product to replace your expensive moisturizers full of chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It certainly wouldn&#x27;t interrupt any perfume or cologne you would put on.</li>
            <li>This bottle of Sesame Seed Body Oil sits on the ledge of my bath tub right next to my other very favorite bath/shower products.....</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li>Once dry, your skin is silky smooth but not oily.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a carrier oil for a few essential oils and blended balms, good quality.</li>
            <li>so I can quickly spritz my legs and back.  </li>
            <li>no heavy perfume, very light feel and helps my dry skin stay soft and moist l....</li>
            <li>So, that&#x27;s why I will quickly towel down first, then apply.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much - ordered for use at Masterpiece Medical Massage in Albuquerque, NM</li>
            <li>It rinsed out fine without making my hair weighed down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that when I used it immediately after showering it didn&#x27;t absorb completely.</li>
            <li>Sesame oil melts into your skin and leaves you soft and silky not oily.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it after a quickly towel down (but still had some water on my skin).</li>
            <li>I much prefer toweling off a bit first, then putting it on, then I let it dry for a moment while I dry my hair and wrap it up.</li>
            <li>The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin, almost nothing is left on the towel used to dry yourself.</li>
            <li>The fall/winter weather has me in aisles buying every lotion available to quench my ultra dry skin, nothing is working that doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy grease after feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is delicate and clean and not cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Thicker and less expensive than the store name brand. Plus it is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Always good to have a carrier oil on hand..</li>
            <li> Great beauty product to replace your expensive moisturizers full of chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce. I use this oil after cleansing my skin. I place a small amount in my hand and slather on my face. As a person with acne prone skin, I have drying treatments that can only be soothed with this oil. Can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li> good oil good price good shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this as a carrier oil for a few essential oils and blended balms, good quality.</li>
            <li> This product has a light aroma and isn&#x27;t greasy, very nice!</li>
            <li> love it thank you !!!!!</li>
            <li> Bottle was opened when arrived!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice. It makes my skin so soft and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much - ordered for use at Masterpiece Medical Massage in Albuquerque, NM</li>
            <li> No smell.  Absorbs easily.  I like mix a quarter sized amount with a few pumps of my regular lotion for my legs.  I have also done the same thing with conditioner in the shower.  It rinsed out fine without making my hair weighed down.</li>
            <li> Nice light oil with no odor. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am totally devoted to this product! This bottle of Sesame Seed Body Oil sits on the ledge of my bath tub right next to my other very favorite bath/shower products..... Since I have started using this, my skin stays soft and smooth even during the coldest winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first learned of Beauty Aura Sesame seed Body Oil from an article in a magazine about the personal favorite products of beauty profesionals.

It&#x27;s surprising to see how quickly the oil works! And how much more effective it is to use the after-bath oil than just an moisturizer by itself.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li> Da Bomb! I didn&#x27;t believe the hype, as I&#x27;m skeptical by nature, but this stuff is liquid gold! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of months and its made such an impact, I can never be without it! The fall/winter weather has me in aisles buying every lotion available to quench my ultra dry skin, nothing is working that doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy grease after feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this on Amazon and thought of giving it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it immediately after the shower (without toweling off real quick) and I&#x27;ve used it after a quickly towel down (but still had some water on my skin). I much prefer toweling off a bit first, then putting it on, then I let it dry for a moment while I dry my hair and wrap it up. After that, I will wrap my body towel around me and go about my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that when I used it immediately after showering it didn&#x27;t absorb completely. It got wiped off when I toweled off. So, that&#x27;s why I will quickly towel down first, then apply. I love that this product doesn&#x27;t leave any residual oil or greasiness. I&#x27;m so sick of the heavy after feel of the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; winter lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy the smell, and it just leaves a faint lasting scent, but nothing that I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily notice unless I smelled my arm or something. It certainly wouldn&#x27;t interrupt any perfume or cologne you would put on. The smell reminds of me of rich old ladies with lovely skin, which I&#x27;m completely here for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly devoted customer right here. Will be stocking up on Amazon, probably be purchasing some as stocking stuffers for my family members.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Light and not stinky.</li>
            <li> I use this as a body oil after my shower... no heavy perfume, very light feel and helps my dry skin stay soft and moist l....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice try. Absorb fast and feel good.</li>
            <li> A huge bottle of wonderful, skin saving oil. What more can I say about it? Sesame oil melts into your skin and leaves you soft and silky not oily. I actually use a few drops on the ends of my hair and it&#x27;s so soft now. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT for winter skin! I had been so itchy all over this winter - worse than ever before. My aunt suggested sesame oil, and it is heaven for my skin. I have used it on my face, too. It is not heavy like other oils. Very light, but ultra soothing and effective. Absorbs quickly and leaves no oily residue on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend I poured some of this oil into an empty spray bottle (cleaned from the previous product) so I can quickly spritz my legs and back.  Works great!</li>
