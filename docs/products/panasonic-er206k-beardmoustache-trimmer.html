    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The quality is very good -</li>
            <li>Also like the Norelco, the guide comb doesn&#x27;t change position just by putting pressure against it when trimming, a very good feature.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very good trimmer.  </li>
            <li>For years now it has been working great, and the battery still holds a very good charge.</li>
            <li>Even though its supposed to be a beard/moustache trimer, it works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;If needed can be run on A/C which is another great feature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great styling groomer in and of itself</li>
            <li>The battery holds a good charge for weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>I had a perfectly good Norelco beard trimmer which became unusable when its non-replaceable battery died -- even when plugged into a wall socket.</li>
            <li>, however, I am very pleased with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>(I used to use a comb and scissors and was amazed how much better one of these devices worked!).</li>
            <li>This hair trimmer is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a reliable device with good blades and an easy length adjustment.</li>
            <li>The top pops off for cleaning and the battery lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>Even though he&#x27;s so handsome</li>
            <li>Very light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>For more thorough cleaning the guard is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Great Trimmer so far.</li>
            <li>Cuts my beard more evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be a problem for most people, but if you, like me, like to travel light, this one doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>The acessories are cheaply made (scissors, comb, and cape), but that is really moot since everyone probably has a good set anyway.</li>
            <li>Easy cleaning  &lt;</li>
            <li>I primarily use it to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>really enjoy having this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Great trimmer, but only 110 volt</li>
            <li>Manufacturer, when informed, did not send correct charger but instead mailed a cheap adaptor.  </li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which makes it a rousing success in the light of so many substandard products out there.</li>
            <li>This is the last Panasonic model with good quality blades.</li>
            <li>Trimmer delivered to me in New York with a charger which would not work for U.S. electrical outlets (it would have been fine in France).  </li>
            <li>It is so quiet, light and smooth in comparison.  </li>
            <li>He liked it so much, we bought a second one to ship to his similarly-bearded friend in Napa.</li>
            <li>Compared to prior beard trimmers, Norelco, Remington MB50, this Panasonic is much better.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic is the brand i go for first.</li>
            <li>design and material used in fabricating the clipper is first rate.</li>
            <li>I had to replace it because I dropped my first one.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic cost half as much as the Norelco and does as good a job.</li>
            <li>I use 3 different trim settings, and it adjusts easily between them.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic, much to my delight, is exactly the opposite - well designed, comfortable both in my hand and on my face, plenty of power, and it just works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it set at #1, I get exactly the trim I want - a blend of bearded (to hide any imagined facial quirkiness) and clean cut to  maintain a somewhat softer, youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Hold a desent charge,dont need to charge it much.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works real well on my beard.  </li>
            <li>The wahl model I used was a real pain to try to switch out the batteries.  </li>
            <li>It just keeps on going and working very well.</li>
            <li>, so I won&#x27;t just need an adapter, but a much bulkier transformer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time, but very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>In short, the trimmer is worth the money.</li>
            <li>because the head is so much wider than the wahl model I used, it&#x27;s more difficult to do detailed trimming around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>So, when I needed a new trimmer for a business trip to Europe, I ordered this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Norelco line, this unit is a bit harder to clean.</li>
            <li>While the wide trimming head makes for a quick trim, if you wear a gotee or do detailed trimming it may be too wide for you.</li>
            <li>My last one (Remington I think) would only last a week charged sitting around, but this one lasted for more than a month, I used it, and it still has a charge.</li>
            <li>Super sharp blades  &lt;</li>
            <li>Super sharp blades</li>
            <li>I saw one reviewer say that he had actually cut his skin (that particular review no longer exists).  </li>
            <li>but if you shave, this will take hair length down to short enough for comfortable shaving.</li>
            <li>Also, it takes a little more effort to clean the blades of the Panasonic, and unfortunately it requires a couple of drops of oil after cleaning, which makes it a bit messier.</li>
            <li>usually trim every 3 or 4 days and its quick and even.  </li>
            <li>It is important to watch the video and to take it slowly the first few times</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this model is not sold in US anymore. Panasonic trimmer models that are currently sold in the US are terrible quality, the blades are blunt and &amp;#34;rip&amp;#34; your beard instead of trimming it. This is the last Panasonic model with good quality blades. The 3rd same model trimmer that I had over several years (battery lasts about 2-3 years and irreplaceable)</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t get easier.  Turn the dial for length, turn on or off.  The top pops off for cleaning and the battery lasts forever.  My last one (Remington I think) would only last a week charged sitting around, but this one lasted for more than a month, I used it, and it still has a charge.</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer so far.I use it alot to trim my beard and to keep my hair very short on my head.Hold a desent charge,dont need to charge it much.I like it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;We don&#x27;t need no stinkin vacuum\\&quot; to break down.  Keep it simple and less expensive too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic replaced my previous non-corded rechargeable Remington beard trimmer.  The Remington was a real piece of crap - slow, uncomfortable, ineffective and eventually the recharger just quit working.  I&#x27;ll never buy another Remington anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic, much to my delight, is exactly the opposite - well designed, comfortable both in my hand and on my face, plenty of power, and it just works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With it set at #1, I get exactly the trim I want - a blend of bearded (to hide any imagined facial quirkiness) and clean cut to  maintain a somewhat softer, youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Compared to prior beard trimmers, Norelco, Remington MB50, this Panasonic is much better.  Cuts my beard more evenly and smoothly.  It is so quiet, light and smooth in comparison.  You can hear and feel the quality.  The cutting head is wider by about half an inch, but I had no problems getting a nice beard trim and on my mustache.</li>
            <li> I have owned this panasonic trimmer for few years. I primarily use it to cut my hair. Even though its supposed to be a beard/moustache trimer, it works great on my hair. For years now it has been working great, and the battery still holds a very good charge. Panasonic is the brand i go for first. I have never been disappointed by their products.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was definitely what I was looking for to trim my &lt;br /&gt;beard and hair. I have been using the #3 setting for a close &lt;br /&gt;(near shaved) hair trim and #1 and #3 settings for beard and &lt;br /&gt;moustache trimming. Very light weight and easy to use. &lt;br /&gt;Long battery charge (using 2 weeks daily and still going)  &lt;br /&gt;If needed can be run on A/C which is another great feature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Works fine cutting the beard but hard to do mustache because the cutting head is too large... I sent mine back...</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer is easy to use and does a great job. It is important to watch the video and to take it slowly the first few times unitl you get use to it. The acessories are cheaply made (scissors, comb, and cape), but that is really moot since everyone probably has a good set anyway. In short, the trimmer is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works real well on my beard.  I use 3 different trim settings, and it adjusts easily between them.  Very easy to clean.  The battery holds a good charge for weeks of use.  The quality is very good - just what I expect of Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco that had a ni-cad battery and refused to take a charge any longer.  The Panasonic has a nickel-hydride battery, which typically lasts longer and avoids memory effects; it can also be used with a cord when the battery is low.  Like the Norelco, it has a wide range of trimming heights and cuts effectively--no pulling of beard hairs.  Also like the Norelco, the guide comb doesn&#x27;t change position just by putting pressure against it when trimming, a very good feature.  This model Panasonic is quieter, though the other brand wasn&#x27;t particuarly bad, and it has almost no vibration. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Norelco line, this unit is a bit harder to clean. The guide doesn&#x27;t come off quite as easily, and I am a little worried that a careless effort might crack it in time.  Also, it takes a little more effort to clean the blades of the Panasonic, and unfortunately it requires a couple of drops of oil after cleaning, which makes it a bit messier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, however, I am very pleased with the trimmer.  It does its job well (I used to use a comb and scissors and was amazed how much better one of these devices worked!). I would say it is a toss-up with the Norelco trimmers in terms of performance, though you must now get the latter with a noisy vacuum unit if you also want a cord/cordless model.  But the Norelco&#x27;s ni-cad battery only lasted 2-3 years, whereas I am expecting the Panasonic to last me longer, based on my experience with ni-hydride batteries in cordless phones.</li>
            <li> Not being a bearded lady, I can&#x27;t give a personal evaluation -- but HE likes it. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which makes it a rousing success in the light of so many substandard products out there. He liked it so much, we bought a second one to ship to his similarly-bearded friend in Napa. Just not getting any complaints on something I located and chose is enough to make ME ecstatic! Even though he&#x27;s so handsome it almost doesn&#x27;t matter, it does make him look neat and trim. Icing on the cake for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time, but very pleased so far. design and material used in fabricating the clipper is first rate.</li>
            <li> This is my second clipper. I had to replace it because I dropped my first one. Highly recommend . You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> PROS: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Rechargable - long charge life &lt;br /&gt;2. Very quiet &lt;br /&gt;3. Wide range in depth of cut &lt;br /&gt;4. Easy cleaning  &lt;br /&gt;5. Super sharp blades  &lt;br /&gt;6. Wide cutting head &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Super sharp blades &lt;br /&gt;2. Wide cutting head &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LAST TRIMMER: Wahl battery operated &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;REVIEW: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy having this trimmer.  I wear a gotee and use a #2 trim setting.  If you haven&#x27;t switched to rechargeable yet - do it.  I have used this model for about 4 months and the charge doesn&#x27;t show any sign of loss.  The wahl model I used was a real pain to try to switch out the batteries.  They were stacked in a pyramid and inevitably I had to grab a knife out of the utensil drawer to try to pry out the bottom two.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I usually trim every 3 or 4 days and its quick and even.  I don&#x27;t find cleaning particularly difficult as I just blow out the cuttings when I&#x27;m through.  For more thorough cleaning the guard is easy to remove. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only negatives I have to say about this trimmer is that  because the head is so much wider than the wahl model I used, it&#x27;s more difficult to do detailed trimming around my mouth.  Also the cutting blades do come in close contact with the skin when the guard is off.  I saw one reviewer say that he had actually cut his skin (that particular review no longer exists).  While I haven&#x27;t had any problems with cutting my skin, I do approach trimming with caution.  Without wanting to test this concern fully it seems to me that you would have to push prety hard to break the skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall a very good trimmer.  While the wide trimming head makes for a quick trim, if you wear a gotee or do detailed trimming it may be too wide for you. Also, don&#x27;t trim your beard in stop and go traffic or while using a jack-hammer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Even though not listed in decription - one of the accesories is blade oil. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I had a perfectly good Norelco beard trimmer which became unusable when its non-replaceable battery died -- even when plugged into a wall socket. The Panasonic cost half as much as the Norelco and does as good a job.</li>
            <li> I have used one of these for years to trim my chest, pit, arm and leg hair and yeah, down there too. It&#x27;s a reliable device with good blades and an easy length adjustment. It&#x27;s a great styling groomer in and of itself but if you shave, this will take hair length down to short enough for comfortable shaving. It just keeps on going and working very well.</li>
            <li> It was not designed for use in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to shavers of any type being 110-240 volt. So, when I needed a new trimmer for a business trip to Europe, I ordered this Panasonic. Great trimmer, but only 110 volt, so I won&#x27;t just need an adapter, but a much bulkier transformer. Won&#x27;t be a problem for most people, but if you, like me, like to travel light, this one doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> A bad experience.  Trimmer delivered to me in New York with a charger which would not work for U.S. electrical outlets (it would have been fine in France).  Manufacturer, when informed, did not send correct charger but instead mailed a cheap adaptor.  With it, the trimmer worked for one day and then ceased operating altogether.  This speaks for itself, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
