            <li>And to clean up the face after a line up.</li>
            <li>Screen gets ruined quickly</li>
            <li>My query,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shaver on a regular basis, and I was more than satisfied with its performance.</li>

            <li>of WAHL Professional Barber 5-Star Bump Free Shaver Hair Cordless 8061 Beard Shaper [ASIN:</li>
            <li>a WAHL Professional Barber 5-Star Bump Free Shaver Hair Cordless 8061</li>
            <li>For those who have extremely thick, course hair, I run over it with this shave and it makes every section nice and smooth</li>
            <li>Love this don&#x27;t know how I lived so long without</li>
            <li>The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li>I hear so much positive reviews on this machine, and it has live up to its hype, but during the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>My daddy didn&#x27;t like it and said that that blades were dull and didn&#x27;t give a good shave for his head or chin.</li>
            <li>Shaves as close as a blade for real.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a barber and after I do a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li>confirm, the item was brand new when I received it, and it was working fine until recently.</li>
            <li>I naturally assumed contacting the seller in the first instance about the problem I was experiencing was the correct thing to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>They are good but not great</li>
            <li>item that we sent you in september was a brand new item.</li>
            <li>My new barber uses it and suggested them to me.</li>
            <li>Very close shave .Clean up fast especially on the go .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for professional use.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Nice close shave for a curly tough beard.</li>
            <li>It misses so many hairs no matter how hard you press it won&#x27;t get them.</li>
            <li>The Wahl shaver has given me the closet shave that I like and so far no bumps</li>
            <li>This may work for someone with this and soft Beard</li>
            <li>I recomend it specially for coarse facial hair that is already short because the hair has to get inside the holes of the foil to be shaved</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I expected .</li>
            <li>came damaged ordered a new piece instead of sending it back ..</li>
            <li>must be really short, and grows back really fast.</li>
            <li>gave my husband a lot of bad bumps even though it claims to be bump free, he always has clear non sensitive skin, but did give a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the equipment does not shave properly, I believe it is not for home use but to be used professionally in salons.</li>
            <li>Does not even come close to giving you a shave, you&#x27;re lucky if you get a small trim.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge long enough to shave your whole head several times over.  </li>
            <li>Only issue that I have so far is the foil (which cost 12.00 to replace) seems to have a short life!!</li>
            <li>I live in London UK,  and was not aware that I had to contact Wahl if I had an issue with the product.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping n extra ordinary work that it gives u</li>
            <li> I am an 66 year old white male and this razor is for Black males.  </li>
            <li> the very least it would have been helpful if you could have advised me of the full postal address of Wahl in the US, thus enabling me to air my concerns.</li>
            <li> Very close shave with very little effort.</li>
            <li> When i use a razor it usually last like 2-3 days with minimal stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never purchase a different electrical razor other than this one.</li>
            <li> I purposely didn&#x27;t press hard at all with the new foil and it scratched my head</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone as I&#x27;m now out my money spent on the product with no use for it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I use 8th every other day.</li>
            <li> Gotten a few pimples, but I think it&#x27;s expected with any thing you use.</li>
            <li> I guess that is why it was $25 less than the previous one that I purchased.  </li>
            <li> also the foil tore slightly.</li>
            <li> it gets close enough to the skin the foil cover will wear out and brake if you push hard on the skin or leave it around wuthout the cover it works!</li>
            <li> Since attempting to re-charge the device, when switching on, the shaver does not power up unless you firmly press and hold the area where the power button is located.</li>
            <li> This razor foil fell apart after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited because i hate shaving my head and thought this would make it  easier For me it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> No more than once a week.</li>
            <li> Word of caution:  be careful that you do not dent the foil, it is as sturdy as it can be for as thin as it is, but can take a dent from dropping the unit.</li>
            <li> Now this one the blade seems dull.  </li>
            <li> Thinking it was because I may have pressed to hard</li>
            <li> I have always been afraid to use any type of shaver because of the bumps.</li>
            <li> I read bad reviews relating product with bumps on face.</li>
            <li> Severely disappointed with this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the quality of the razor and the price for it.</li>

            <li> Very close shave with very little effort. I expect to enjoy this product for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good...</li>
            <li> I recomend it specially for coarse facial hair that is already short because the hair has to get inside the holes of the foil to be shaved it gets close enough to the skin the foil cover will wear out and brake if you push hard on the skin or leave it around wuthout the cover it works!</li>
            <li> Best electrical shaver on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to everyone. I&#x27;ll never purchase a different electrical razor other than this one.</li>
            <li> I hear so much positive reviews on this machine, and it has live up to its hype, but during the first week of using it. The top golden piece (however you wanna call it) a piece of it broke off and expose the inner blades. Now you can say why not return it? I brought it from a seller and didnt want to go through the shipping process. but overall the machine works great!</li>
            <li> I like the shaver (design). Only issue that I have so far is the foil (which cost 12.00 to replace) seems to have a short life!! Gets ripped easily and that will scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I got it on time and It&#x27;s been a month and it&#x27;s still charge.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This razor foil fell apart after just a few uses.  I contacted the seller and they would not replace the foil head.  I ordered replacement foil heads from another vendor and they work so much better after use.  I will not buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Buy it is all I have to say, worth it. Been coming very handy for face shaves but mainly for that skin fade...</li>
            <li> power button in middle has a shortage in it and i have only had it for a month</li>
            <li> it works great! My boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Hair has to be really, really short for this to work but I do like it.</li>
            <li> Very close shave .Clean up fast especially on the go . Highly recommend . Price is also fair order one today</li>
            <li> I would recommend this 5-Star shaver.  I enjoy my shaver so much that I&#x27;m going to buy another one for my travel.</li>
            <li> It works great I use 8th every other day. I don&#x27;t receive the bumps I did with a traditional razor</li>
            <li> Not What I thought I ordered.  I am an 66 year old white male and this razor is for Black males.  It does not give me a close shave!</li>
            <li> Close shave without bumps, use it to finish up a shadow haircut and to clean up the neck line  after a cut. And to clean up the face after a line up. Highly recommend for professional use. Also cheaper than buying from suppliers.</li>
            <li> Severely disappointed with this razor. Does not even come close to giving you a shave, you&#x27;re lucky if you get a small trim. It misses so many hairs no matter how hard you press it won&#x27;t get them.</li>
            <li> Great close shave! Perfect for on the go!!</li>
            <li> Close comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the product it&#x27;s exactly what I expected . Could not have asked for anything better. From order to receiving the package ......awesome.would definitely do business again</li>
            <li> It worked for a month and now it&#x27;s not charging.&lt;br /&gt;I hope someone can help me with this problem.</li>
            <li> I just love this wahl shaver.</li>
            <li> I like this bump free shaver, lives up to it&#x27;s name. If I shave too close I will get bumps every time.&lt;br /&gt;But this shaver, cuts close but no bumps...</li>
            <li> equipment not shave properly.&lt;br /&gt;the equipment does not shave properly, I believe it is not for home use but to be used professionally in salons.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve never seen an electric get so close! I&#x27;m a barber and after I do a straight razor shave. For those who have extremely thick, course hair, I run over it with this shave and it makes every section nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I am not getting the close shave that I had at the barbershop.</li>
            <li> I have always been afraid to use any type of shaver because of the bumps. The Wahl shaver has given me the closet shave that I like and so far no bumps</li>
            <li> As a barber and using the product daily, it works perfect. Great for balding fades.</li>
            <li> one of the best shaver ive ever own, needs lots of cleaning after every use.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing shaver.  It holds a charge long enough to shave your whole head several times over.  The foil is so thin that it truly makes your skin smooth. Word of caution:  be careful that you do not dent the foil, it is as sturdy as it can be for as thin as it is, but can take a dent from dropping the unit.</li>
            <li> came damaged ordered a new piece instead of sending it back .. that was also damaged now sending both back</li>
            <li> Go to any barber shop located in the piedmont area of North Carolina and this is the box shaver there using.  Use this and a good electric shave splash for a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My daddy didn&#x27;t like it and said that that blades were dull and didn&#x27;t give a good shave for his head or chin.</li>
            <li> I am Returning this shaver it did not work for me.  I have very coarse Beard and it could not shave it.  This may work for someone with this and soft Beard</li>
            <li> They are good but not great</li>
            <li> I got this product because one of my buddies recommended it to me. I was really excited because i hate shaving my head and thought this would make it  easier For me it doesn&#x27;t, It barley cut the hairs and the hair must be really short, and grows back really fast. When i use a razor it usually last like 2-3 days with minimal stubble.</li>
            <li> Good shave, holds the charge.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave for a curly tough beard. I wish it had a pop up trimmer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me. I had to use another razor afterwards</li>
            <li> Got the job done With NO BUMPS!</li>
            <li> This product is as good as advertised. My new barber uses it and suggested them to me.</li>
            <li> Best shaver i ever bought</li>
            <li> Nice close shave......</li>
            <li> great product I i will recommend it</li>
            <li> i got razor bumps from using mine. I used it after a trimmer at the barbour shop and i still get razor bumps. It does not shave as close as i expect it too. If one day pass and i do not shave the machine cannot shave me close . maybe i got a defective one.</li>
            <li> Great item. Saves time and money.</li>
