            <li>This is a great cream ...</li>

            <li>great product</li>
            <li>Restless Legs Calming Creme had great reviews and since it said &amp;#34;helps stimulate circulation for increased comfort, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  </li>
            <li>If anyone else has recommendations, we welcome them.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li>and it is very effective for muscle aches and joint pain</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing !</li>
            <li>Ok this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Her own doctor can&#x27;t help her!</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my mother in law who has RLS, &amp; she loved it.</li>
            <li>All the reviews sounded so good</li>
            <li>Smells good.  </li>
            <li>Did not work as good as Magnalifes restless leg cream.</li>
            <li>Helps me get good night sleep</li>
            <li>The packaging wasn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li>It restores circulation to restless legs, and removes the tingling sensation almost immediately, to insure a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t feel Restless leg if it is because I had given myself a good massage while I put on this lotion or this lotion</li>
            <li>The lotion feels good.  </li>
            <li>Good product...</li>
            <li>Support hose felt good but wouldn&#x27;t want to sleep in them.  </li>
            <li>THE GOOD NEWS.</li>
            <li>Good tho,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>works well for a good night sleep</li>
            <li>good product good seller</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>using a Massager on my legs for restless legs &amp; soaking in warm water with lavender epson salts which helps more !!</li>
            <li>BTW ... THANK YOU Amazon for your exceptional handling of this matter!  :-)</li>
            <li>It smells really good and feels nice, though it leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this cream!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>i would say it was more kicking in his sleep !</li>
            <li>So much better!</li>
            <li>- can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to sleep all night again!</li>
            <li>However, it is important to say that my husband seemed happy with it.</li>
            <li>This creme is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what kind of *fragrance</li>
            <li>Nice lotion like cream..</li>
            <li>I rubbed the crème into my leg really good to make sure it would penetrate.</li>
            <li>I used it anyway because it was nice and creamy</li>
            <li>and I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>Effective, no negative side effects (that I&#x27;ve experienced) and a good price</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it massaged in quickly and had a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has a very light fragrance that is pleasing and restful.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>The jar is preferred for use, but it was no longer prime, so if you are a  prime member, the lack of mailing cost makes up for lack of product able to be used.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I can now sleep alot better.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to buy into this malarkey</li>
            <li>I will use it again and try to put on more liberally as others have suggested.</li>
            <li>(she has severe sleep issues and Autism; I don&#x27;t want to add much more to the mix and risk not having her sleep).  </li>
            <li>Of course the item has to be massaged on feet/legs wherever the problem is and that helps too I am sure.</li>
            <li>I use a menthol creme from Eucerin for itchy skin that works better.  </li>
            <li>Now I can sleep better</li>
            <li>It was with the try but still only baths work best.</li>
            <li>If you have restless leg syndrome thrn you know how many products we all buy to get any form of relief...</li>
            <li>The smell is OK...</li>
            <li>Much better than the alternative of doing nothing.</li>
            <li>glad that I purchased it and recommend it to others suffering from RLS.</li>
            <li>It seems to work somewhat better than lots of things she has tried.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a perfume-floral sort of smell that I would love to do without.</li>
            <li>I think if it were without scent that would be better for me, but a lot of people don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li>This is a good product which would be much more useful and useful if the packaging was good.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about a lotion being able to control jerking legs, it didn&#x27;t make sense to me.  </li>
            <li>I have this cream to thank for restful nights &amp; consequently more enjoyable days.</li>
            <li>She ensures it is on bottom and top of foot as well as on legs and knees.</li>
            <li>Mostly helped.</li>
            <li>This is a Big Plus - a wonderful night of sleep.  </li>
            <li>Have not found anything better to use.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this creme to be more than a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>When the pain is the greatest I may have to use several applications</li>
            <li>so I can apply many coats without a sticky buildup.</li>
            <li>It took awhile to locate them but I am glad I found them</li>
            <li>RESTLESS LEGS CALMING CREAM HAVE BEEN USING THIS CREAM FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>I have RLS mostly at night and this product does work.</li>
            <li>This product clams your feet and legs when you wake up at night, I love  RR and would not be with out it .Patricia</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I waited to post my review until I had no doubt and was completely sure of my findings.  </li>
            <li>My mom 76 has also had RLS most if her life on and off.</li>
            <li>And I was able to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>It seems the more</li>
            <li>I used it the better</li>
            <li>She thinks it&#x27;s the best restless leg external crème she has ever used.  </li>
            <li>Does not help with more severe rls maybe better for very mild rls</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product</li>
            <li>, it smells good, it is fast absorbing, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This was approved by our doctor as its more natural ingredients and IT WORKED AMAZINGLY THE FIRST NIGHT !!!!</li>
            <li>I even got my husband and 89 year old mother to use it, and they are both as happy with this product as I am.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is rather strong.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing and really works!</li>
            <li>The pump container is fine, but</li>
            <li>Used once and seems fine</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients and feel that it may be meant for people with mild to moderate nutrition deficiencies...which causes some forms of RLS &amp; this cream is great &amp; will help most people for that, so try it</li>
            <li>This wonderful creme and my little peddle exerciser.</li>
            <li>a Huge Bottle for your money,&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>This lotion works great all throughout the day, but especially at bedtime.</li>
            <li>She would often tell me, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t get comfortable because my legs won&#x27;t stop moving.&amp;#34;  I know RLS, and I knew she had it.  </li>
            <li>tried this for a couple of weeks,  it feels nice but does absolutely nothing to eliminate or alleviate RLS symptoms.</li>
            <li>This Miracle Calming Creme works fantastic on leg cramps as well.</li>
            <li>and it worked fantastic and relieved all the pain.  </li>
            <li>and I sleep soundly.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to discover this lotion really helps calm the leg jitters.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how good it works.</li>
            <li>&amp; I think it really works!!!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I would like more consistent relief.</li>
            <li>but I needed something to be more effective immediately and not hours later.  </li>
            <li>I now use the calming crème in a jar and find it easy to use and useful.</li>
            <li>glad to see my mom well rested, and not only was the product spectacular, but the company.</li>
            <li>all the wonderful natural ingredients in it, it is definitely a 5 Star product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The crème is easy to use and works right away.</li>
            <li>Other wise the cream is ok.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for a 90 year old in my home w/ restleg syndrom and it provided amazing relief.</li>
            <li>Too early to know how effective, but seems to be helping</li>
            <li>Does literally nothing for RLS and not even a good regular lotion</li>
            <li>and it has really helped her get a better nights sleep.</li>
            <li>This lotion is so cool and calming and that coolness lasts for an hour or so-</li>
            <li>Not to mention how much I loved the fact that the seller had handwritten a personal note on the invoice giving the 100% satisfaction guarantee on the product.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this product for the most part.</li>
            <li>I still purchase it because it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that has worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product for the most part.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my recent meds &amp; thought I&#x27;d try living without medications to see if my RLS had gone for good.</li>
            <li>product really works, wanted to wait a month to know for sure</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know for sure how to rate it.  </li>
            <li>If you have allergies, you&#x27;ll want to check the ingredients first to make sure you can use it all right.</li>
            <li>I read others comments on this and other products and decided on this one and it is great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d make their formula stronger with a better pump bottle and they might have a decent product.</li>
            <li>Didnt work for me, but my RLS is no longer mild, requiring mult.</li>
            <li>Another plus for me is the odor which is a mild lavender and chamomile.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>This works really well for me- much better than the calm pills.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sensitive to many lotions, but luckily no bad reaction to this.</li>
            <li>The first night I rubbed it on my legs and feet, and !</li>
            <li>It really does work!!</li>
            <li>This really does work!!</li>
            <li>So I applied it again about 15 minutes from my first application and voila!</li>
            <li>one helped calm the RLS and helped me sleep through the&lt;br /&gt;night</li>
            <li>I use it with the Leg Calm Wellness Oil.  </li>
            <li>but it &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; works to calm my peripheral neuropathy discomfort.</li>
            <li>I have MS and take medicine to calm the irritable knee feelings</li>
            <li>It takes about 10-15 minutes and then all is calm.</li>
            <li>It did not work, did not begin to do anything to calm the sensation.</li>
            <li>The price is worth the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>but this product really works and has allowed me to finally get a good night sleep by relieving my RLS symptoms.  </li>
            <li>Husband loves this cream and worth the money</li>
            <li>It has a lot of ingredients, most of them natural.</li>
            <li>did not do as good a job as expected</li>
            <li>it really is worth the try.</li>
            <li>and it works pretty well fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>My husband used some other cream and this one works just as good</li>
            <li>But its been used now 5 nights in a row, just on my right leg and some comment on not liking the smell..</li>
            <li>...had to use very large amount to get any relief</li>
            <li>If I can get RLS to go away  just a few hours without taking a medicine,so that I can get some quality sleep, even if it cost 10x more than this, I would gladly pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more economical to buy the larger size in a bottle instead of a jar if the bottle came with a screw lid instead of a pump.</li>
            <li>Works very fast,smelles good,absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>So far so good - I only use as needed</li>
            <li>&amp;  If your younger &amp; its mild, It may Work For you !!</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>The pump broke immediately the first day, so I&#x27;ve had to use it without</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this product  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it will take longer for creme to work, so I walk around the house and took a hot bath also.  </li>
            <li>It has worked really well for me!</li>
            <li>I have RLS and my feet are always hot when I go to bed</li>
            <li>and it really works!  </li>
            <li>medications for Parkinson&#x27;s &amp; most recently</li>
            <li>I put some on my legs at the first twinge.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very soothing on my legs at night!</li>
            <li>When applied liberally, it really does help!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had many things happen including nerve damage in my lower spine and back surgery etc.</li>
            <li>Instead, I just take my meds, sleep on tempur pedic,  and use epsom salt in my hot baths at night and that helps me relax.</li>
            <li>Really helps to calm my restless fidgety knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pretty severe RLS.</li>
            <li>To me this was nothing more than A regular lotion .  </li>
            <li>This night I decided to try the cream first.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had to apply it twice.</li>
            <li>you think its not working for you the first time.</li>
            <li>Even my first application I could tell a difference-some sort of relief.</li>
            <li>This works beautifully, but has an icky odor!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of difference, but I definitely plan to give it more time.  </li>
            <li>--when something bothers me I start searching for help, but through natural and alternative means, and thus far I have been able to avoid prescription medications.  </li>
            <li>This really works and my mom is not having to take as much of her medication as before!</li>
            <li>which is not a winning equation to good sleep.</li>
            <li>According to Dr. Mercola an ongoing magnesium deficiency can lead to more serious symptoms, including numbness and tingling, muscle contractions and cramps and more.</li>
            <li>Works very quickly and I can go back to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I fell back to sleep easily and for the remainder of the night.</li>
            <li>but it certainly helps and safer than requip or mirapex</li>
            <li>Made it so hard for her to get a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li>The seller even sent a note, it was very helpful.</li>
            <li>It would be so much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Did absolutely zero</li>
            <li>Very calming, not greasy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s in this</li>
            <li>I have used essential oils with great success to ease my symptoms and have been able to cut my required medication dosage in half, however I&#x27;m not comfortable using those particular oils on her</li>
            <li>She NEVER complains any more about her &amp;#34;legs always moving&amp;#34; when she tries to sleep.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think it helped as much as the rave reviews said.</li>
            <li>It really helps me.</li>
            <li>- I really should&#x27;ve listened to the reviews.  </li>
            <li>and it has really helped her restless leg issue.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to check out if this product would work.  </li>
            <li>It is also available in a larger pack for a reduced price at amazon.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this.  </li>
            <li>I like it,  very helpful</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know because I fall</li>
            <li>This product has been a real Godsend for me.  </li>
            <li>It really does seem to help and keeps my legs from &amp;#34;twitching&amp;#34;  all night.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be a reasonable solution to restless legs and no sleep.  </li>
            <li>The brain chemical glutamate is an important neurotransmitter that arouses both the brain and the central nervous system.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t seem to need as much.</li>
            <li>This is HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>For a dosage, the bottle says &amp;#34;sparingly&amp;#34;, so I have been messing around with how much to put on.</li>
            <li>This product really does work.</li>
            <li>Who wants to spend the whole night walking instead of sleeping.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell you it really gave her and myself relief.</li>
            <li>and now I fall asleep very fast&lt;</li>
            <li>works very well for calming restless legs.</li>
            <li>I use it every night on my lower legs and it really helps.</li>
            <li>It works fast</li>
            <li>Thanks a million.  </li>
            <li>It really  works</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my sister, she said it really works.</li>
            <li>I just went to use it again and the smell was absolutely foul on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I do not know how much it helps</li>
            <li>I have ordered 5 or6 bottles and the pumps do not always work very well.</li>
            <li>It really seemed to work.</li>
            <li>As a result, the product doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well for me since I for some reason react better to the latter (the reason I ordered this.).</li>
            <li>I know there are powerful drugs that can be prescribed for it, but I&#x27;m too leery of them to try them; plus, other more natural remedies that I&#x27;ve tried have helped to some degree.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it as I suffered for months not being able to sleep due to my RLS.  </li>
            <li>My doctor said it was okay because I will only use one patch once in a while, more may be a problem, but not sure.</li>
            <li>Because of high rating, I really had high hope for this</li>
            <li>It also seems she has had far fewer episodes and when she does their gone within a few minutes of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another amazing use.</li>
            <li>Recommended only if you fall asleep quickly.</li>
            <li>Originally bought this years ago, and couldn&#x27;t find it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>She highly recommends it and so do I.</li>
            <li>They discovered abnormally high levels of a brain chemical involved in stimulating arousal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend use of this crème.</li>
            <li>It works to some degree---I would like something to work with a little more strength, but cannot find anything else.</li>
            <li>If I need a little more by bedtime, I apply it.  </li>
            <li>Was not sure if it would work, seemed a little too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Works well enough to calm my legs giving me a chance to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>Crème of this helps with the leg pain, but only can do so much, takes time for it to go where its really needed, so I rub it after I apply the crème, to get it really rubbed in to the areal......</li>
            <li>so I use this cream when my medication is not working, especially at night to calm my legs</li>
            <li>Delivery was great but usefulness questionable.</li>
            <li>He uses this lotion prior to going to bed and the legs are calm.  </li>
            <li>No one really can understand exactly what is is like to have RLS unless you have same symptoms.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it I noticed a instant change, you need to really massage it in to the skin.</li>
            <li>This cream together with my medication has enabled me to resume a normal life and wake up rested.  </li>
            <li>and it took a few days for my skin to feel and look better.</li>
            <li>She has venous stasis, a disorder in which the normal flow of blood through a vein is slowed or halted and she has it in her lower legs, causing swelling and discoloration.</li>
            <li>I wish I had been able to se only essential oils on her to stop her RLS, but REAL RLS is no joke and required either prescribed medication or hefty essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I off course am a light sleeper, the wife on the other hand sleeps through an earthquake, or</li>
            <li>But I have to  live with some of side effects from taking Requip.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft as well.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I ordered this product and have to say that I do like it very much.</li>
            <li>I just happen to be very sensitive to aromas.</li>
            <li>I always look for a natural product for my medical problems and when I saw it on Amazon, I ordered it right</li>
            <li>Four stars for it working, but not sure if it was more of a placebo effect or not.</li>
            <li>but, a little strong for bedtime.  </li>
            <li>She rubs her legs at night before bedtime and has seen a huge difference in calming her legs down</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;m doing is warning the person who has a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>My husband really doesn&#x27;t think it has helped his legs as they still bother him, especially at night after going to bed.</li>
            <li>My four year old daughter had been complaining for sometime about her legs being &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I actually can sleep at night instead of trying to walk it off, which really doesn&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li>Also, if you are sensitive to Lidocaine or allergic, you&#x27;ll want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to try a natural bedtime remedy..didn&#x27;t change anything.</li>
            <li>but this is the only product that really works</li>
            <li>I have to write this review because I have been suffering with RLS for nearly 40 years.</li>
            <li>I would be careful applying this on freshly shaved legs as it caused me to break out</li>
            <li>Especially when there are so few options for RLS.&lt;br /&gt;Tip; take a warm sea salt bath before bedtime and apply this creme on your legs and your feet when you get out.(don&#x27;t forget to massage it also on the bottom of your feet  and on the back side of your leg-opposite of your knee cap.).</li>
            <li>It settles them down quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used the entire jar now and my words of advice, it does not work proactively, wait until the first twinges to apply, don&#x27;t over do it but be sure to do the bottom of your feet and behind you knees.</li>
            <li>I am sure that people with less complicated issues are enjoying relief with this product.  </li>
            <li>My legs would start to cramp up (especially after eating high salt) in the evenings and would continue into the night.  </li>
            <li>Once I put it on, it begins to calm my legs down and allows me to fall asleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can feel the calm from my rest less syndromes ...</li>
            <li>As you can imagine, swelling that much causes the skin to dry and tighten, causing discomfort and pain.  </li>
            <li>I really slept more like a drunk bc</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I apply it, keep myself busy with a book or watching a short video or something and let it do</li>
            <li>I developed hereditary RLS about the same time I became eligible for Medicare.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my restless legs are worse than most peoples.</li>
            <li>I have finally found something that helps calm down my Restless Legs.</li>
            <li>but it does calm the condition down enough to allow me to get some sleep at nite.</li>
            <li>A little more than a year ago, though, while rehabbing from a broken ankle, the crawling sensations just really seemed to ramp up in the uninjured leg; that&#x27;s when I started looking for something stronger.  </li>
            <li>and you get twice as much for less of a price.</li>
            <li>Gotta say, I was pretty excited to try this give that it&#x27;s far less expensive than another cream I use</li>
            <li>I use it for my legs as they get tight from sitting at work and in the evening it really relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money on other products that claim to help, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve used that actually does help.</li>

            <li> great product</li>
            <li> Restless Legs Calming Creme had great reviews and since it said &amp;#34;helps stimulate circulation for increased comfort, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  </li>
            <li> If anyone else has recommendations, we welcome them.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li> and it is very effective for muscle aches and joint pain</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing !</li>
            <li> Ok this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Her own doctor can&#x27;t help her!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother in law who has RLS, &amp; she loved it.</li>
            <li> All the reviews sounded so good</li>
            <li> Smells good.  </li>
            <li> Did not work as good as Magnalifes restless leg cream.</li>
            <li> Helps me get good night sleep</li>
            <li> The packaging wasn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li> It restores circulation to restless legs, and removes the tingling sensation almost immediately, to insure a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t feel Restless leg if it is because I had given myself a good massage while I put on this lotion or this lotion</li>
            <li> The lotion feels good.  </li>
            <li> Good product...</li>
            <li> Support hose felt good but wouldn&#x27;t want to sleep in them.  </li>

            <li> good product good seller</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> using a Massager on my legs for restless legs &amp; soaking in warm water with lavender epson salts which helps more !!</li>
            <li> BTW ... THANK YOU Amazon for your exceptional handling of this matter!  :-)</li>
            <li> It smells really good and feels nice, though it leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> i would say it was more kicking in his sleep !</li>
            <li> So much better!</li>
            <li> - can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!</li>
            <li> It is so nice to be able to sleep all night again!</li>
            <li> However, it is important to say that my husband seemed happy with it.</li>
            <li> This creme is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what kind of *fragrance</li>
            <li> Nice lotion like cream..</li>
            <li> I rubbed the crème into my leg really good to make sure it would penetrate.</li>
            <li> I used it anyway because it was nice and creamy</li>
            <li> and I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li> Effective, no negative side effects (that I&#x27;ve experienced) and a good price</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it massaged in quickly and had a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> It has a very light fragrance that is pleasing and restful.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> The jar is preferred for use, but it was no longer prime, so if you are a  prime member, the lack of mailing cost makes up for lack of product able to be used.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I can now sleep alot better.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to buy into this malarkey</li>
            <li> I will use it again and try to put on more liberally as others have suggested.</li>
            <li> (she has severe sleep issues and Autism; I don&#x27;t want to add much more to the mix and risk not having her sleep).  </li>
            <li> Of course the item has to be massaged on feet/legs wherever the problem is and that helps too I am sure.</li>
            <li> I use a menthol creme from Eucerin for itchy skin that works better.  </li>
            <li> Now I can sleep better</li>
            <li> It was with the try but still only baths work best.</li>
            <li> If you have restless leg syndrome thrn you know how many products we all buy to get any form of relief...</li>
            <li> The smell is OK...</li>
            <li> Much better than the alternative of doing nothing.</li>
            <li> glad that I purchased it and recommend it to others suffering from RLS.</li>
            <li> It seems to work somewhat better than lots of things she has tried.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a perfume-floral sort of smell that I would love to do without.</li>
            <li> I think if it were without scent that would be better for me, but a lot of people don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> This is a good product which would be much more useful and useful if the packaging was good.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about a lotion being able to control jerking legs, it didn&#x27;t make sense to me.  </li>
            <li> I have this cream to thank for restful nights &amp; consequently more enjoyable days.</li>
            <li> She ensures it is on bottom and top of foot as well as on legs and knees.</li>
            <li> Mostly helped.</li>
            <li> This is a Big Plus - a wonderful night of sleep.  </li>
            <li> Have not found anything better to use.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this creme to be more than a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> When the pain is the greatest I may have to use several applications</li>
            <li> so I can apply many coats without a sticky buildup.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to locate them but I am glad I found them</li>
            <li> RESTLESS LEGS CALMING CREAM HAVE BEEN USING THIS CREAM FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li> I have RLS mostly at night and this product does work.</li>
            <li> This product clams your feet and legs when you wake up at night, I love  RR and would not be with out it .Patricia</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I waited to post my review until I had no doubt and was completely sure of my findings.  </li>
            <li> My mom 76 has also had RLS most if her life on and off.</li>
            <li> And I was able to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> It seems the more</li>
            <li> I used it the better</li>
            <li> She thinks it&#x27;s the best restless leg external crème she has ever used.  </li>
            <li> Does not help with more severe rls maybe better for very mild rls</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product</li>
            <li> , it smells good, it is fast absorbing, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This was approved by our doctor as its more natural ingredients and IT WORKED AMAZINGLY THE FIRST NIGHT !!!!</li>
            <li> I even got my husband and 89 year old mother to use it, and they are both as happy with this product as I am.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is rather strong.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing and really works!</li>
            <li> The pump container is fine, but</li>
            <li> Used once and seems fine</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients and feel that it may be meant for people with mild to moderate nutrition deficiencies...which causes some forms of RLS &amp; this cream is great &amp; will help most people for that, so try it</li>
            <li> This wonderful creme and my little peddle exerciser.</li>
            <li> a Huge Bottle for your money,&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> This lotion works great all throughout the day, but especially at bedtime.</li>
            <li> She would often tell me, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t get comfortable because my legs won&#x27;t stop moving.&amp;#34;  I know RLS, and I knew she had it.  </li>
            <li> tried this for a couple of weeks,  it feels nice but does absolutely nothing to eliminate or alleviate RLS symptoms.</li>
            <li> This Miracle Calming Creme works fantastic on leg cramps as well.</li>
            <li> and it worked fantastic and relieved all the pain.  </li>
            <li> and I sleep soundly.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted to discover this lotion really helps calm the leg jitters.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how good it works.</li>
            <li> &amp; I think it really works!!!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I would like more consistent relief.</li>
            <li> but I needed something to be more effective immediately and not hours later.  </li>
            <li> I now use the calming crème in a jar and find it easy to use and useful.</li>
            <li> glad to see my mom well rested, and not only was the product spectacular, but the company.</li>
            <li> all the wonderful natural ingredients in it, it is definitely a 5 Star product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The crème is easy to use and works right away.</li>
            <li> Other wise the cream is ok.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a 90 year old in my home w/ restleg syndrom and it provided amazing relief.</li>
            <li> Too early to know how effective, but seems to be helping</li>
            <li> Does literally nothing for RLS and not even a good regular lotion</li>
            <li> and it has really helped her get a better nights sleep.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so cool and calming and that coolness lasts for an hour or so-</li>
            <li> Not to mention how much I loved the fact that the seller had handwritten a personal note on the invoice giving the 100% satisfaction guarantee on the product.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this product for the most part.</li>
            <li> I still purchase it because it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that has worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product for the most part.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my recent meds &amp; thought I&#x27;d try living without medications to see if my RLS had gone for good.</li>
            <li> product really works, wanted to wait a month to know for sure</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t know for sure how to rate it.  </li>
            <li> If you have allergies, you&#x27;ll want to check the ingredients first to make sure you can use it all right.</li>
            <li> I read others comments on this and other products and decided on this one and it is great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d make their formula stronger with a better pump bottle and they might have a decent product.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me, but my RLS is no longer mild, requiring mult.</li>
            <li> Another plus for me is the odor which is a mild lavender and chamomile.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me- much better than the calm pills.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sensitive to many lotions, but luckily no bad reaction to this.</li>
            <li> The first night I rubbed it on my legs and feet, and !</li>
            <li> It really does work!!</li>
            <li> This really does work!!</li>
            <li> So I applied it again about 15 minutes from my first application and voila!</li>
            <li> one helped calm the RLS and helped me sleep through the&lt;br /&gt;night</li>
            <li> I use it with the Leg Calm Wellness Oil.  </li>
            <li> but it &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; works to calm my peripheral neuropathy discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have MS and take medicine to calm the irritable knee feelings</li>
            <li> It takes about 10-15 minutes and then all is calm.</li>
            <li> It did not work, did not begin to do anything to calm the sensation.</li>
            <li> The price is worth the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> but this product really works and has allowed me to finally get a good night sleep by relieving my RLS symptoms.  </li>
            <li> Husband loves this cream and worth the money</li>
            <li> It has a lot of ingredients, most of them natural.</li>
            <li> did not do as good a job as expected</li>
            <li> it really is worth the try.</li>
            <li> and it works pretty well fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband used some other cream and this one works just as good</li>
            <li> But its been used now 5 nights in a row, just on my right leg and some comment on not liking the smell..</li>
            <li> ...had to use very large amount to get any relief</li>
            <li> If I can get RLS to go away  just a few hours without taking a medicine,so that I can get some quality sleep, even if it cost 10x more than this, I would gladly pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is more economical to buy the larger size in a bottle instead of a jar if the bottle came with a screw lid instead of a pump.</li>
            <li> Works very fast,smelles good,absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> So far so good - I only use as needed</li>
            <li> &amp;  If your younger &amp; its mild, It may Work For you !!</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> The pump broke immediately the first day, so I&#x27;ve had to use it without</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it will take longer for creme to work, so I walk around the house and took a hot bath also.  </li>
            <li> It has worked really well for me!</li>
            <li> I have RLS and my feet are always hot when I go to bed</li>
            <li> and it really works!  </li>
            <li> medications for Parkinson&#x27;s &amp; most recently</li>
            <li> I put some on my legs at the first twinge.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very soothing on my legs at night!</li>
            <li> When applied liberally, it really does help!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had many things happen including nerve damage in my lower spine and back surgery etc.</li>
            <li> Instead, I just take my meds, sleep on tempur pedic,  and use epsom salt in my hot baths at night and that helps me relax.</li>
            <li> Really helps to calm my restless fidgety knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe RLS.</li>
            <li> To me this was nothing more than A regular lotion .  </li>
            <li> This night I decided to try the cream first.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had to apply it twice.</li>
            <li> you think its not working for you the first time.</li>
            <li> Even my first application I could tell a difference-some sort of relief.</li>
            <li> This works beautifully, but has an icky odor!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of difference, but I definitely plan to give it more time.  </li>
            <li> --when something bothers me I start searching for help, but through natural and alternative means, and thus far I have been able to avoid prescription medications.  </li>
            <li> This really works and my mom is not having to take as much of her medication as before!</li>
            <li> which is not a winning equation to good sleep.</li>
            <li> According to Dr. Mercola an ongoing magnesium deficiency can lead to more serious symptoms, including numbness and tingling, muscle contractions and cramps and more.</li>
            <li> Works very quickly and I can go back to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I fell back to sleep easily and for the remainder of the night.</li>
            <li> but it certainly helps and safer than requip or mirapex</li>
            <li> Made it so hard for her to get a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li> The seller even sent a note, it was very helpful.</li>
            <li> It would be so much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> Did absolutely zero</li>
            <li> Very calming, not greasy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s in this</li>
            <li> I have used essential oils with great success to ease my symptoms and have been able to cut my required medication dosage in half, however I&#x27;m not comfortable using those particular oils on her</li>
            <li> She NEVER complains any more about her &amp;#34;legs always moving&amp;#34; when she tries to sleep.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it helped as much as the rave reviews said.</li>
            <li> It really helps me.</li>
            <li> - I really should&#x27;ve listened to the reviews.  </li>
            <li> and it has really helped her restless leg issue.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to check out if this product would work.  </li>
            <li> It is also available in a larger pack for a reduced price at amazon.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this.  </li>
            <li> I like it,  very helpful</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know because I fall</li>
            <li> This product has been a real Godsend for me.  </li>
            <li> It really does seem to help and keeps my legs from &amp;#34;twitching&amp;#34;  all night.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be a reasonable solution to restless legs and no sleep.  </li>
            <li> The brain chemical glutamate is an important neurotransmitter that arouses both the brain and the central nervous system.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to need as much.</li>
            <li> This is HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> For a dosage, the bottle says &amp;#34;sparingly&amp;#34;, so I have been messing around with how much to put on.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.</li>
            <li> Who wants to spend the whole night walking instead of sleeping.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell you it really gave her and myself relief.</li>
            <li> and now I fall asleep very fast&lt;</li>
            <li> works very well for calming restless legs.</li>
            <li> I use it every night on my lower legs and it really helps.</li>
            <li> It works fast</li>
            <li> Thanks a million.  </li>
            <li> It really  works</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister, she said it really works.</li>
            <li> I just went to use it again and the smell was absolutely foul on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I do not know how much it helps</li>
            <li> I have ordered 5 or6 bottles and the pumps do not always work very well.</li>
            <li> It really seemed to work.</li>
            <li> As a result, the product doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well for me since I for some reason react better to the latter (the reason I ordered this.).</li>
            <li> I know there are powerful drugs that can be prescribed for it, but I&#x27;m too leery of them to try them; plus, other more natural remedies that I&#x27;ve tried have helped to some degree.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it as I suffered for months not being able to sleep due to my RLS.  </li>
            <li> My doctor said it was okay because I will only use one patch once in a while, more may be a problem, but not sure.</li>
            <li> Because of high rating, I really had high hope for this</li>
            <li> It also seems she has had far fewer episodes and when she does their gone within a few minutes of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another amazing use.</li>
            <li> Recommended only if you fall asleep quickly.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this years ago, and couldn&#x27;t find it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> She highly recommends it and so do I.</li>
            <li> They discovered abnormally high levels of a brain chemical involved in stimulating arousal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend use of this crème.</li>
            <li> It works to some degree---I would like something to work with a little more strength, but cannot find anything else.</li>
            <li> If I need a little more by bedtime, I apply it.  </li>
            <li> Was not sure if it would work, seemed a little too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> Works well enough to calm my legs giving me a chance to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Crème of this helps with the leg pain, but only can do so much, takes time for it to go where its really needed, so I rub it after I apply the crème, to get it really rubbed in to the areal......</li>
            <li> so I use this cream when my medication is not working, especially at night to calm my legs</li>
            <li> Delivery was great but usefulness questionable.</li>
            <li> He uses this lotion prior to going to bed and the legs are calm.  </li>
            <li> No one really can understand exactly what is is like to have RLS unless you have same symptoms.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it I noticed a instant change, you need to really massage it in to the skin.</li>
            <li> This cream together with my medication has enabled me to resume a normal life and wake up rested.  </li>
            <li> and it took a few days for my skin to feel and look better.</li>
            <li> She has venous stasis, a disorder in which the normal flow of blood through a vein is slowed or halted and she has it in her lower legs, causing swelling and discoloration.</li>
            <li> I wish I had been able to se only essential oils on her to stop her RLS, but REAL RLS is no joke and required either prescribed medication or hefty essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I off course am a light sleeper, the wife on the other hand sleeps through an earthquake, or</li>
            <li> But I have to  live with some of side effects from taking Requip.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft as well.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this product and have to say that I do like it very much.</li>
            <li> I just happen to be very sensitive to aromas.</li>
            <li> I always look for a natural product for my medical problems and when I saw it on Amazon, I ordered it right</li>
            <li> Four stars for it working, but not sure if it was more of a placebo effect or not.</li>
            <li> but, a little strong for bedtime.  </li>
            <li> She rubs her legs at night before bedtime and has seen a huge difference in calming her legs down</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;m doing is warning the person who has a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> My husband really doesn&#x27;t think it has helped his legs as they still bother him, especially at night after going to bed.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter had been complaining for sometime about her legs being &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I actually can sleep at night instead of trying to walk it off, which really doesn&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are sensitive to Lidocaine or allergic, you&#x27;ll want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to try a natural bedtime remedy..didn&#x27;t change anything.</li>
            <li> but this is the only product that really works</li>
            <li> I have to write this review because I have been suffering with RLS for nearly 40 years.</li>
            <li> I would be careful applying this on freshly shaved legs as it caused me to break out</li>
            <li> Especially when there are so few options for RLS.&lt;br /&gt;Tip; take a warm sea salt bath before bedtime and apply this creme on your legs and your feet when you get out.(don&#x27;t forget to massage it also on the bottom of your feet  and on the back side of your leg-opposite of your knee cap.).</li>
            <li> It settles them down quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used the entire jar now and my words of advice, it does not work proactively, wait until the first twinges to apply, don&#x27;t over do it but be sure to do the bottom of your feet and behind you knees.</li>
            <li> I am sure that people with less complicated issues are enjoying relief with this product.  </li>
            <li> My legs would start to cramp up (especially after eating high salt) in the evenings and would continue into the night.  </li>
            <li> Once I put it on, it begins to calm my legs down and allows me to fall asleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can feel the calm from my rest less syndromes ...</li>
            <li> As you can imagine, swelling that much causes the skin to dry and tighten, causing discomfort and pain.  </li>
            <li> I really slept more like a drunk bc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I apply it, keep myself busy with a book or watching a short video or something and let it do</li>
            <li> I developed hereditary RLS about the same time I became eligible for Medicare.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my restless legs are worse than most peoples.</li>
            <li> I have finally found something that helps calm down my Restless Legs.</li>
            <li> but it does calm the condition down enough to allow me to get some sleep at nite.</li>
            <li> A little more than a year ago, though, while rehabbing from a broken ankle, the crawling sensations just really seemed to ramp up in the uninjured leg; that&#x27;s when I started looking for something stronger.  </li>
            <li> and you get twice as much for less of a price.</li>
            <li> Gotta say, I was pretty excited to try this give that it&#x27;s far less expensive than another cream I use</li>
            <li> I use it for my legs as they get tight from sitting at work and in the evening it really relaxing.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on other products that claim to help, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve used that actually does help.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve had RLS just about all of my life, it&#x27;s only been a real problem for me, i.e. interfering with my quality of life, over the past five years or so.  </li>
            <li> If you have restless leg syndrome this product will offer you immediate and long lasting relief.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AFTER NUMEROUS TRIES TO OPEN THE PUMP</li>
            <li> I find myself running up and down the stairs several times in the middle if the night to simply exhaust myself.</li>
            <li> I had to write this review for other RLS sufferers who may be at the end of their rope &amp; think that just because they&#x27;ve tried everything else, including what the AMA suggests, something as simple as this cream can&#x27;t possibly work.</li>
            <li> Not to sound cheesy, but this product has been a miracle.</li>
            <li> But , cause me to sleep too long..</li>
            <li> So, I am a long time RLS sufferer.  </li>
            <li> However, living with RLS without Med is unthinkable.  </li>
            <li> asleep!I have been looking for something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> It does contain Lidocaine in it, which is not natural.</li>
            <li> I happened to stumble across this product while searching for something that will help.</li>
            <li> actually stumbled on this product when I was searching for other options to help RLS</li>
            <li> You can definitely smell flowery baby power with some other horrendously nauseating undertones of *something*.  </li>
            <li> I tried several other creams but&lt;br</li>
            <li> that does the trick, while other ingredients such as the aloe perhaps aid its absorption into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Have ordered numerous times in the last few months.</li>
            <li> total waste of money, will keep it for a regular lotion</li>
            <li> I laid back down and had a strange sensation that I wanted to move my legs</li>
            <li> We use it every single night on her legs and feet.  </li>
            <li> Works for restless legs but the pump is hard to open, to use it I have to open the entire bottle</li>
            <li> I fumbled around in the dark to open it and applied it to both legs.</li>
            <li> I applied about a tablespoon of this to my entire leg/ankle area and laid down.</li>
            <li> It was about 30 minutes later when I felt my leg had calmed down.</li>
            <li> It was definitely money down the drain.</li>
            <li> It has the same ingredients as the other cream!</li>
            <li> Usually I will get about 3 to 4 hours out of it, sometimes the entire night with only one application.</li>
            <li> Tried homeopathic pills, menthol rubs, and massage which only helped a little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for some, it might help, but I have RLS really bad and don&#x27;t want to take medication for it.</li>
            <li> The cream for me only works in conjunction with leg stretching exercises, daily magnesium, B12 methycobalamine and B vitamin complex.</li>
            <li> As I expected, ROPINIROLE  takse some time to work for RLS.  </li>
            <li> 10 yrs ago n has blood pressure issue so we are careful of products .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any efficacy from this product after 4 tries.</li>
            <li> Only negative, it does take a long time to rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t take the meds during the day due to drowsiness that interferes with mobility.</li>
            <li> Does not really help !</li>
            <li> If my legs are extremely jump</li>
            <li> it takes a couple of applications for it to begin working and sometimes even three applications, but if they are just starting up and getting restless, I usually can use just one application of this</li>
            <li> If it works for anyone, I suspects it is due to that.</li>
            <li> It worked well some nights, but not at all on other nights.</li>
            <li> I was also taking iron and other trace elements.</li>
            <li> This page lists the active ingredient as Benzocaine HCL, but the bottle reflects Lidocaine HCL.</li>
            <li> Package hard to open.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my back sometimes as well since I have backaches which makes it hard to lie down.  </li>
            <li> and this didn&#x27;t really do much for her unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My grandchild slept over last weekend, (age 7) and complained that her legs had been aching her at night.</li>
            <li> i was late for work the next morning.</li>
            <li> I  use this during the night when my legs won&#x27;t  settle down because of restless leg problems.  </li>
            <li> In 10 days pain in the foot calmed down.</li>
            <li> My mom has RLS to the extreme!</li>
            <li> They get tingly and have sharp little shooting pains.  </li>
            <li> Normally I have to stretch awkwardly in bed to keep my muscles tight to get any sort of relief but somehow this cream gave my leg relief enough that I could rest it</li>
            <li> Abnormal levels of glutamate may help explain why RLS patients continue to have trouble sleeping, even after other medications have quieted the disruptive sensations in their legs.</li>
            <li> When I found this product at Amazon for a lot less money I bought 2.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was typical Amazon 4 star delivery, which is to say it was delivered within the time I chose and on time to relieve her pain.</li>
            <li> I like this one as well as the previous review....</li>
            <li> (typically if I can get to bed alone,</li>
            <li> Sometimes one leg will swell half again the size of her leg.  </li>
            <li> I would like to rescind my previous review, considering these facts.</li>
            <li> so that is really not a true opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> My calves are tight at night sometimes</li>
            <li> I had to use twice as much as other brands that come in small jars.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no fun to be dead tired and have to walk the house over before getting back to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure healing is due to just the RLC cream or combined effect.</li>
            <li> My wife has crazy bad RLS, we have tried so many different things</li>
            <li> I have suffered from RLS for quite a few years now</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> what a waste.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 87 year old Mother &amp; my Mom was not happy with it!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and since I have a lot of trouble with RLS, decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;which can take a few minutes for the odor to dissipate.</li>
            <li> &amp; I could no longer feel them, having my boyfriend deeply massage my legs, giving in to RLS &amp; walking around WalMart or Kroger for hours until I was so exhausted</li>
            <li> I went home to pass out (which made me tired at work the next day &amp; jeopardized my job),</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my husbands feet everyday before putting his socks on.</li>
            <li> I feel relieved of the throbbing pain everyday.</li>
            <li> My legs don&#x27;t feel numb and they feel perfectly normal in the morning.</li>
            <li> Absolutely unbelievable product.</li>
            <li> not sure how this helps</li>
            <li> , however, the minute I opened the package I just could get past the horrendous smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works or not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s numbing agent which is a small amount of lidocaine and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I was trying out this creme, I didn&#x27;t take my med as usual time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it works and the smell is subpar.</li>
            <li> I have to use a small knife to cut around the seal so as to gain access to the cream.</li>
            <li> If I use at night I don&#x27;t have that heavy feeling in my legs!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I should try now....</li>
            <li> and I could not go back to sleep because of the uncomfortable sensation in my lower legs.</li>
            <li> Also, my health conditions are infamously difficult to treat so getting relief for restless legs is a BIG deal!!!  </li>
            <li> Not sure what else will happen with continued use, so we will update once we get to the bottom of this bottle.  </li>
            <li> I earlier rated this product very poor because it did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I touched it to my tongue and there seems to be a nervous system acting chemical in there because it caused my tongue to go a bit numb for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The one program is the pump is not very good sometimes.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, my mom has been experiencing terrible leg cramps (and crawlys) at night, and could hardly ever get a full nights rest.</li>
            <li> Only people have RLS will  know how awful it is to live with RLS.  </li>
            <li> Pump hard to pump.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for at least two years.</li>
            <li> The pump is ineffective because the cream is too thick.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes and the worst of the jerking settles down.  </li>
            <li> but when I have a bad case of restless legs, only a pain pill will work so I can sleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but it&#x27;s pretty bad!  </li>
            <li> menthol is so weak it does nothing.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I was out!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t waste my money on this product again!!!</li>
            <li> I have had RLS for approximately 13 years.</li>
            <li> before I&#x27;m over tired and do not use my iPad, I can get to sleep before it overcomes me.</li>
            <li> My leg started with the usual symptoms that meant I was headed for an unpleasant evening.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star only because the system wouldn&#x27;t accept my review without marking at least one star!!!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion just disappointed me and provided nothing but a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> MY legs were still going crazy, waste of money in my opinion, sorry!</li>
            <li> This product is just useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been extremely skeptical about buying products</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it had not.</li>
            <li> It was a blind study</li>
            <li> So when she sent me this cream I was immediately skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but use it every night and no leg cramps</li>
            <li> it is, but this lotion stinks so bad I could hardly stomach it.  </li>
            <li> Wear gloves when applying if you don&#x27;t want your hands to have a numb feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> The one product that works for RLS should be everywhere aspirin, cold medicine and pain killers are sold.  </li>
            <li> My mom is always looking and trying the crazy commercialized products she sees.</li>
            <li> No more leg twitching or pain or annoying discomfort!</li>
            <li> my wifes legs are so bad that it was so hard to sleep at night until we found this wonder cream!!!</li>
            <li> In addition it feels like it softens, and it is not stickey, or unpleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> His legs would shake so bad at night</li>
            <li> I was just about to ask my doctor for a medication for RLS it was getting so bad.</li>
            <li> BAD NEWS.</li>
            <li> My bf had restless legs so bad</li>
            <li> Too bad it is just talk, does not work.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> I hate sticky lotions.</li>
            <li> It has been absolutely horrible...</li>
            <li> I tried exercising and not exercising and walk at home dvds were one of the worst offenders.  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible problem with restless leg syndrome.</li>
            <li> I WAS DEVELOPING TERRIBLE HIVES ON MY LEGS WHICH CAUSED ME TO VISIT MY DOCTOR</li>
            <li> , I pray it will work on the plane as that is one of my worst places for flair ups.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely unbelievable product. I wish I would have known about this when my restless started 7 years ago! Buy it! It works!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother in law who has RLS, &amp; she loved it. The seller even sent a note, it was very helpful. If she ever runs out. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this out of desperation. I&#x27;ve dealt with RLS for the last couple of years and didn&#x27;t think there was much, outside of medication, that could help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually stumbled on this product when I was searching for other options to help RLS and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, not expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My RLS seems to flair up more during the evening, which makes going to sleep increasingly difficult. I applied about a tablespoon of this to my entire leg/ankle area and laid down. It was about 30 minutes later when I felt my leg had calmed down. Normally I have to stretch awkwardly in bed to keep my muscles tight to get any sort of relief but somehow this cream gave my leg relief enough that I could rest it casually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how this helps but I&#x27;m not going to question it because it does. While it doesn&#x27;t take it away, it helps make it bearable so I don&#x27;t focus on it.</li>
            <li> All the reviews sounded so good I thought I would try this, however, the minute I opened the package I just could get past the horrendous smell.  I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what kind of *fragrance* it is, but this lotion stinks so bad I could hardly stomach it.  You can definitely smell flowery baby power with some other horrendously nauseating undertones of *something*.  I&#x27;m sorry, but it&#x27;s pretty bad!  It&#x27;s a shame, I don&#x27;t even know if it actually works.  All I&#x27;m doing is warning the person who has a sensitive nose.  Concept Labs, would you please consider making a lotion that is fragrance-free also?  It would be so much appreciated.  BTW ... THANK YOU Amazon for your exceptional handling of this matter!  :-)</li>
            <li> It Works.  I love it.  I tried several other creams but&lt;br /&gt;this one helped calm the RLS and helped me sleep through the&lt;br /&gt;night</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend and it didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my restless legs I get at times.  I also use it on my back sometimes as well since I have backaches which makes it hard to lie down.  This product is great and I def recommend it if u have restless legs.</li>
            <li> My husband really doesn&#x27;t think it has helped his legs as they still bother him, especially at night after going to bed.</li>
            <li> Works well enough to calm my legs giving me a chance to fall asleep. Now that I am used to the fragrance it&#x27;s better. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Can I give it zero stars.  Did absolutely zero</li>
            <li> Wrote a  review for this product earlier, for the jar.  It works well. The pump container is fine, but as I suspected, at the end of it&lt;br /&gt;you miss out on some of the crème that will not pump out. The jar is preferred for use, but it was no longer prime, so if you are a  prime member, the lack of mailing cost makes up for lack of product able to be used.&lt;br /&gt;The crème itself stops my RLS a lot and enables me to sleep.</li>
            <li> This really works!  I use it with the Leg Calm Wellness Oil.  It makes my skin feel very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Ok this stuff is great! I sleep like a log  now! The first night I rubbed it on my legs and feet, and ! I mean, I was out! I love it! No more leg twitching or pain or annoying discomfort!</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Too early to know how effective, but seems to be helping</li>
            <li> I  use this during the night when my legs won&#x27;t  settle down because of restless leg problems.  It settles them down quickly.</li>
            <li> It really does work!! I have been looking for something for restless legs for quite a while and finally found it!! The price is worth the size of the bottle. It is so nice to be able to sleep all night again!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from RLS for quite a few years now and i gotta say this stuff does miracles! I can now sleep alot better. It is that great that i have given samples of this cream &amp; it has worked aswell &amp; my friends have asked for  details of this cream that i use.</li>
            <li> This product is just useless.  Anyone who thinks this is going to solve the restless leg problem will have a big surprise.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He said it worked for him. His legs would shake so bad at night it felt like I was putting a quarter in the bed to make it shake. He only used it one time. Four stars for it working, but not sure if it was more of a placebo effect or not. However, it is important to say that my husband seemed happy with it.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great all throughout the day, but especially at bedtime. Works as advertised. Very calming, not greasy and it smells great. Use this with Hyland&#x27;s Restful Legs dissolving tablets for restless legs relief. Works for me!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping with my husbands restless legs at all. I should have known better than to buy into this malarkey</li>
            <li> the only reason for the 2 star , is i just couldn&#x27;t get it to work for me , i have tried a couple brands , i have had RLS for Several Years. so i was hopeful this would work for me the meds i take , work But , cause me to sleep too long..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s in this but it &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; works to calm my peripheral neuropathy discomfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works or not.  I did use it one night and could not tell a difference in my restless leg symptoms.  I will use it again and try to put on more liberally as others have suggested.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from RLS my entire life.  I have severe RLS for my age (35) and am on a low-dose Parkinson&#x27;s medication to counteract my RLS symptoms.  My four year old daughter had been complaining for sometime about her legs being &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34;.  When she would start to fall asleep she would kick and thrash her legs about.  She would often tell me, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t get comfortable because my legs won&#x27;t stop moving.&amp;#34;  I know RLS, and I knew she had it.  I have used essential oils with great success to ease my symptoms and have been able to cut my required medication dosage in half, however I&#x27;m not comfortable using those particular oils on her (she has severe sleep issues and Autism; I don&#x27;t want to add much more to the mix and risk not having her sleep).  I purchased this lotion thinking ***MAYBE*** it would help my daughter.  Well, I COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER!!!  She NEVER complains any more about her &amp;#34;legs always moving&amp;#34; when she tries to sleep.  We use it every single night on her legs and feet.  I wish I had been able to se only essential oils on her to stop her RLS, but REAL RLS is no joke and required either prescribed medication or hefty essential oils.  I will continue to buy this for my daughter for the foreseeable future!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work as good as Magnalifes restless leg cream.</li>
            <li> This product works!!!</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY DOES CALM THAT CREEPY FEELING IN THE LEGS SO YOU CAN GET BACK TO SLEEP. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS WITH THE BOTTLE ITSELF. AFTER NUMEROUS TRIES TO OPEN THE PUMP MY HUSBAND FINALLY GOT OUT THE PLIERS AND USED THAT. NOW I CAN PUMP OUT WHAT I NEED.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 bottles of this hoping it would help my restless legs during the night. I&#x27;ve tried in twice and I didn&#x27;t think it helped as much as the rave reviews said. I wish I had ordered only one bottle. Maybe my restless legs are worse than most peoples.</li>
            <li> Very good for purpose.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this product and have to say that I do like it very much. It really helps me. Of course the item has to be massaged on feet/legs wherever the problem is and that helps too I am sure.</li>
            <li> Does as promised. Helps me get good night sleep</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have RLS but I get restless legs once in a while. The cream worked once but when I have a bad case of restless legs, only a pain pill will work so I can sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s numbing agent which is a small amount of lidocaine and menthol is so weak it does nothing.  I use a menthol creme from Eucerin for itchy skin that works better.  The pump broke immediately the first day, so I&#x27;ve had to use it without - I really should&#x27;ve listened to the reviews.  The packaging wasn&#x27;t good.  I&#x27;d make their formula stronger with a better pump bottle and they might have a decent product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product  and It has worked perfectly. Now I can sleep better and I also like that it is odorless and the calming effect is almost inmediately.</li>
            <li> Used once and seems fine it&#x27;s not sticky I hate sticky lotions. My calves are tight at night sometimes so I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Does literally nothing for RLS and not even a good regular lotion</li>
            <li> My wife has crazy bad RLS, we have tried so many different things and this didn&#x27;t really do much for her unfortunately. It was with the try but still only baths work best.</li>
            <li> My mom has RLS to the extreme! She takes medication for RLS but that doesn&#x27;t always work? I then went online to see if there was something else out there that works? That is when I found this miracle of a lotion!! This really works and my mom is not having to take as much of her medication as before! This really does work!! Thank GOD for this lotion!</li>
            <li> This works beautifully, but has an icky odor! It restores circulation to restless legs, and removes the tingling sensation almost immediately, to insure a good night&#x27;s sleep. Can&#x27;t give it 5 stars though because of the odor.</li>
            <li> tried this for a couple of weeks,  it feels nice but does absolutely nothing to eliminate or alleviate RLS symptoms.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for over a year now and it has really helped her restless leg issue. She rubs her legs at night before bedtime and has seen a huge difference in calming her legs down and it has really helped her get a better nights sleep. She highly recommends it and so do I.</li>
            <li> No one really can understand exactly what is is like to have RLS unless you have same symptoms.  Only people have RLS will  know how awful it is to live with RLS.  I have been diagnosis RLS 8 years ago and 5 years prior without knowing I had RLS. So, I am a long time RLS sufferer.  I have been on Requip /ROPINIROLE for 8 years now. But I have to  live with some of side effects from taking Requip.  However, living with RLS without Med is unthinkable.  If I could, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I see something advertised as RLS Calming creme that works so well,  there is no question that I  want to try it for myself.  Because of high rating, I really had high hope for this and  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get the product to give a try. If I can get RLS to go away  just a few hours without taking a medicine,so that I can get some quality sleep, even if it cost 10x more than this, I would gladly pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was trying out this creme, I didn&#x27;t take my med as usual time.  If I took a med, I wouldn&#x27;t know if this creme works or not. I really wanted to check out if this product would work.  I put lotion on my leg and massage into the skin.  It seem to ease the RLS symptoms. However, I didn&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t feel Restless leg if it is because I had given myself a good massage while I put on this lotion or this lotion actually worked. After 5-10 min, I can feel RLS starting to kick in.  I thought maybe it will take longer for creme to work, so I walk around the house and took a hot bath also.  After suffering about an hour, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  It was already after midnight, so I had to give in and took my medicine. As I expected, ROPINIROLE  takse some time to work for RLS.  Since I didn&#x27;t take the med at my regular time, I did suffer several hours before I can finally get to bed around 2am.  What a night!  If this works for you, it&#x27;s great!  But unluckily, it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> My husband used some other cream and this one works just as good and you get twice as much for less of a price. It has the same ingredients as the other cream! Very happy!!</li>
            <li> First time I used it I noticed a instant change, you need to really massage it in to the skin. But its been used now 5 nights in a row, just on my right leg and some comment on not liking the smell..I think its great</li>
            <li> If you suffer from RLS this is the product that works. No gimmicks just great relief. If you have tried similar products with no help do not discount this one as we have tried every thing for relief and came on to this and will never be without this product. It is also available in a larger pack for a reduced price at amazon. Have ordered numerous times in the last few months.</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  It has worked really well for me! I am so glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li> I actually really like this.  Rub it on my legs at night and seems to work.</li>
            <li> Crème of this helps with the leg pain, but only can do so much, takes time for it to go where its really needed, so I rub it after I apply the crème, to get it really rubbed in to the areal......</li>
            <li> Does not help with more severe rls maybe better for very mild rls</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of difference, but I definitely plan to give it more time.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far so that is really not a true opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing and really works!</li>
            <li> what a waste. should  of been zero starts</li>
            <li> It works to some degree---I would like something to work with a little more strength, but cannot find anything else.</li>
            <li> My legs stop the pain as soon I use the cream.  I recommended 100%</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well at all. Still had problems.</li>
            <li> Gotta say, I was pretty excited to try this give that it&#x27;s far less expensive than another cream I use HOWEVER. This page lists the active ingredient as Benzocaine HCL, but the bottle reflects Lidocaine HCL. As a result, the product doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well for me since I for some reason react better to the latter (the reason I ordered this.).</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I use this in combination woth Hyland restful legs tablets and find it to be effective. Great alternative to prescription gabapetin.</li>
            <li> This did not help my restless legs at all. If you have restless leg syndrome thrn you know how many products we all buy to get any form of relief... This lotion just disappointed me and provided nothing but a waste of money for me. A heating pad and elevated with pillow under knees have since been best remedy for my legs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I like it,  very helpful</li>
            <li> Originally bought this years ago, and couldn&#x27;t find it for a long time.  I was so happy to see it on Amazon.  It truly is a miracle cream.  When restless legs wake me up, I just rub it in and within minutes I&#x27;m asleep again.  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> This cream does help.  Wear gloves when applying if you don&#x27;t want your hands to have a numb feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have RLS and my feet are always hot when I go to bed which is not a winning equation to good sleep. This lotion is so cool and calming and that coolness lasts for an hour or so- I really don&#x27;t know because I fall asleep!I have been looking for something like this for a long time. I was just about to ask my doctor for a medication for RLS it was getting so bad. Now I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Lotion actually works and helps with leg, foot pain.</li>
            <li> This product has been a real Godsend for me.  I take medication for my RLS but it only works 75% of the time so I use this cream when my medication is not working, especially at night to calm my legs so I can sleep.  I&#x27;ve always been extremely skeptical about buying products/cures from the internet but this product really works and has allowed me to finally get a good night sleep by relieving my RLS symptoms.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it as I suffered for months not being able to sleep due to my RLS.  This cream together with my medication has enabled me to resume a normal life and wake up rested.  I&#x27;ve  used it for the last 9 months and would recommend it to anyone suffering from RLS.</li>
            <li> This product works great...for about ten minutes, and then I&#x27;m twitchy again. It&#x27;s sometimes enough time to let me fall asleep, but often I have to apply twice before that happens. It smells really good and feels nice, though it leaves a residue. I won&#x27;t buy it again but I&#x27;ll use what I have. Recommended only if you fall asleep quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotion feels good.  Doubt it calms restless legs.</li>
            <li> Wish it did, but it didn&#x27;t.  The smell is OK...but, a little strong for bedtime.  I&#x27;m sure for some, it might help, but I have RLS really bad and don&#x27;t want to take medication for it.</li>
            <li> My legs sometimes bother me at night.  They get tingly and have sharp little shooting pains.  I put this on and I go to sleep, period. Been using it for at least two years. I always keep a spare or 2 on hand.</li>
            <li> Delivery was great but usefulness questionable. May not work for everyone. Regular application not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 87 year old Mother &amp; my Mom was not happy with it!!! Please refund or replace with complementary order!!</li>
            <li> It really does seem to help and keeps my legs from &amp;#34;twitching&amp;#34;  all night.  Maybe it&#x27;s just all in my head??</li>
            <li> Not sure it works and the smell is subpar.</li>
            <li> It works.  I find it to be a reasonable solution to restless legs and no sleep.  Much better than the alternative of doing nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t help at all. Gave to my daughter to use as a mositurizing cream. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product does help my Restless Legs. Once I put it on, it begins to calm my legs down and allows me to fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I purchased it and recommend it to others suffering from RLS.</li>
            <li> The cream for me only works in conjunction with leg stretching exercises, daily magnesium, B12 methycobalamine and B vitamin complex. According to Dr. Mercola an ongoing magnesium deficiency can lead to more serious symptoms, including numbness and tingling, muscle contractions and cramps and more. Also it has been found that RLS sufferers often have iron (blood test should tell), Vtiamine B-12 and folate deficiency.  Recently researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine investigated the relationship between brain chemistry and sleep among patients with RLS. They discovered abnormally high levels of a brain chemical involved in stimulating arousal. The brain chemical glutamate is an important neurotransmitter that arouses both the brain and the central nervous system. Researchers found elevated levels of glutamate present in the brains of patients with RLS. Abnormal levels of glutamate may help explain why RLS patients continue to have trouble sleeping, even after other medications have quieted the disruptive sensations in their legs.</li>
            <li> Her own doctor can&#x27;t help her! This is a great cream ...my wifes legs are so bad that it was so hard to sleep at night until we found this wonder cream!!!</li>
            <li> If you have restless leg syndrome this product will offer you immediate and long lasting relief.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again if needed but I have used now for several weeks and I don&#x27;t seem to need as much.</li>
            <li> Smells great, seller was wonderful to do business with. I read the reviews and since I have a lot of trouble with RLS, decided to give this a try. I have MS and take medicine to calm the irritable knee feelings so I can sleep at night. However, I can&#x27;t take the meds during the day due to drowsiness that interferes with mobility. I was hoping this would work for the daytime RLS, but it didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t have pain at all with my RLS, just the aggravated sensations in my knees of needing to move them. I hope this product works for others.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I tried it the night it arrived and it seemed to work.  Again I tried it the day after and it worked.  I am hopeful that it continues to work for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! Finally something that Truly WORKS for Restless legs! Within a Minute I start feeling relief! I actually can sleep at night instead of trying to walk it off, which really doesn&#x27;t work all that well. This Miracle Calming Creme works fantastic on leg cramps as well. This is HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> I had to use twice as much as other brands that come in small jars.  So I am trying another.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a couple of days but it seems to be working great.  I have been dealing with restless legs for about a year.  I heard magnesium and cinnamon pills would help.  They did but I needed something to be more effective immediately and not hours later.  I have been using this creme since it got here and it works.  I highly recommend it.  Not to mention how much I loved the fact that the seller had handwritten a personal note on the invoice giving the 100% satisfaction guarantee on the product.  It would be great if everyone did that.</li>
            <li> Good product...the soon I put it in my legs I can feel the calm from my rest less syndromes ...thank u</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It actually works!</li>
            <li> Does not really help !</li>
            <li> Husband loves this cream and worth the money</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me, but my RLS is no longer mild, requiring mult. Meds to sleep.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I use to purchase it from Publishers Clearing House for a lot for money.  When I found this product at Amazon for a lot less money I bought 2.  This will last me for 3 months if I have to use it every night for my legs.  When I do use it I use 3 pumps per leg.  It works wonderful.</li>
            <li> This crème is so soothing on my legs and I use it on my neck and shoulders too. It has a very light fragrance that is pleasing and restful.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom. It seems to work somewhat better than lots of things she has tried.Only negative, it does take a long time to rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product for the most part. If my legs are extremely jump it takes a couple of applications for it to begin working and sometimes even three applications, but if they are just starting up and getting restless, I usually can use just one application of this and it works pretty well fairly quickly. Within about 10 minutes. I would be careful applying this on freshly shaved legs as it caused me to break out and it took a few days for my skin to feel and look better. Also, it has a perfume-floral sort of smell that I would love to do without. I think if it were without scent that would be better for me, but a lot of people don&#x27;t mind that. I just happen to be very sensitive to aromas. I still purchase it because it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that has worked fairly well. It does contain Lidocaine in it, which is not natural. It is a numbing agent. If you are already on Lidoderm patches, you&#x27;ll want to ask your doctor about using this before jumping in. My doctor said it was okay because I will only use one patch once in a while, more may be a problem, but not sure. Also, if you are sensitive to Lidocaine or allergic, you&#x27;ll want to avoid this product. It has a lot of ingredients, most of them natural. If you have allergies, you&#x27;ll want to check the ingredients first to make sure you can use it all right. I really do like this product for the most part. I apply it, keep myself busy with a book or watching a short video or something and let it do it&#x27;s thing. Then I can just roll over and go to sleep. Sometimes I will have to get up and reapply during the night if my legs start acting up again.Usually I will get about 3 to 4 hours out of it, sometimes the entire night with only one application. Again, it all depends on how restless my legs are being that night. It&#x27;s a pretty good product and I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change with this. MY legs were still going crazy, waste of money in my opinion, sorry!</li>
            <li> This product seems to reduce my Restless Legs symptoms. In my case, my legs get achy and crawly at night in bed where the feeling will eventually build up and my legs will jump or twitch... then it starts over. If I regularly move my legs, it resets, but me (and my wife) can&#x27;t get to sleep with the leg movements. For a dosage, the bottle says &amp;#34;sparingly&amp;#34;, so I have been messing around with how much to put on. At this point I put 3 pumps on each calf and 1 pump on each foot, rub it in, and it seems to stop the jumping for an hour or so allowing me to get to sleep. For me, each pump seems to correspond to around 20 minutes of relief. I don&#x27;t know which ingredient is the key, but I wonder if it is just the lidocaine (a local topical anesthetic). My legs don&#x27;t feel numb and they feel perfectly normal in the morning. The key is that this cream seems to relieve my Restless Legs symptoms for a bit.</li>
            <li> this is editing... I now use the calming crème in a jar and find it easy to use and useful. the manufacturers still haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of it yet. There is an aluminum foil seal over the cream which has no tab to pull back. I have to use a small knife to cut around the seal so as to gain access to the cream. Packing needs improvement. It is more economical to buy the larger size in a bottle instead of a jar if the bottle came with a screw lid instead of a pump. That way I could remove the cap and squeeze out the cream. The pump is ineffective because the cream is too thick. This is a good product which would be much more useful and useful if the packaging was good.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about a lotion being able to control jerking legs, it didn&#x27;t make sense to me.  But after reading the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and it really works!  It takes about 10-15 minutes and then all is calm.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She has been tormented by aching legs for years. Made it so hard for her to get a good nights sleep. She used this product and within 10 minutes the pain was gone. It also seems she has had far fewer episodes and when she does their gone within a few minutes of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another amazing use. My grandchild slept over last weekend, (age 7) and complained that her legs had been aching her at night. My wife put some of this creme on her legs and pain gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff! Carmen</li>
            <li> Excellent!....EXCELLENCE works!&lt;br /&gt;I keep it on hand, it&#x27;s GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;Great service!</li>
            <li> This product really does work. I have taken medications for restless leg syndrome. All they do is give me&lt;br /&gt;stomach upset. The crème is easy to use and works right away. No wait for a pill to kick in. I also don&#x27;t mind the smell&lt;br /&gt;which can take a few minutes for the odor to dissipate.</li>
            <li> I have had RLS for approximately 13 years. It has been absolutely horrible...it took about 3 years of suffering before I finally found a name for it. I&#x27;ve tried sleeping on the floor, sleeping with my legs elevated, sleeping with my legs doubled under me until they fell asleep &amp; I could no longer feel them, having my boyfriend deeply massage my legs, giving in to RLS &amp; walking around WalMart or Kroger for hours until I was so exhausted I went home to pass out (which made me tired at work the next day &amp; jeopardized my job), medications for Parkinson&#x27;s &amp; most recently, anti-anxiety medications that work on the same chemicals as what&#x27;s thought to cause RLS. I ran out of my recent meds &amp; thought I&#x27;d try living without medications to see if my RLS had gone for good. Unfortunately, it had not. My Mom gave me an 8oz bottle of this cream &amp; it sat on my nightstand for a couple months. I&#x27;ve researched RLS ad nauseum &amp; based on all manner of information, was convinced a topical cream would be ineffective. In a moment of desperation I tried the cream. I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WORKED. I thought it was perhaps a fluke &amp; simply a result of rubbing the cream into my legs. The next time RLS struck, I tried the cream again....with the same results. Now, everything I&#x27;ve read about RLS tells me this cream should not work. But it does. And I cannot extol its virtues enough! I have this cream to thank for restful nights &amp; consequently more enjoyable days. I had to write this review for other RLS sufferers who may be at the end of their rope &amp; think that just because they&#x27;ve tried everything else, including what the AMA suggests, something as simple as this cream can&#x27;t possibly work. Trust me it can. Not to sound cheesy, but this product has been a miracle.</li>
            <li> I developed hereditary RLS about the same time I became eligible for Medicare.  My mother suffered from this for years without complaining or trying to do anything about it.  No so with me--when something bothers me I start searching for help, but through natural and alternative means, and thus far I have been able to avoid prescription medications.  The advice to &amp;#34;just get up and move&amp;#34; that I have heard from the tv comics who think this is a non-issue is the most absurd solution I have ever heard.  Try getting 4 hours of sleep, almost falling off and then muscles jerking you awake, night after night.  Who wants to spend the whole night walking instead of sleeping.  I tried exercising and not exercising and walk at home dvds were one of the worst offenders.  Tried homeopathic pills, menthol rubs, and massage which only helped a little.  Support hose felt good but wouldn&#x27;t want to sleep in them.  Then THIS MIRACULOUS PRODUCT!  I put some on my legs at the first twinge.  If I need a little more by bedtime, I apply it.  I have NEVER been kept awake by jumpy legs since I received it.  The one product that works for RLS should be everywhere aspirin, cold medicine and pain killers are sold.  Another plus for me is the odor which is a mild lavender and chamomile.  Hope they never stop making this wonderful creme.</li>
            <li> Tried this for my wife for Christmas.  Was not sure if it would work, seemed a little too good to be true.  Wanted to give it a shot since she will actually kick me every 10 seconds when her legs are bothering her.  I off course am a light sleeper, the wife on the other hand sleeps through an earthquake, or so she say&#x27;s she is asleep.&lt;br /&gt;Well product really works, wanted to wait a month to know for sure and I can tell you it really gave her and myself relief.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, my mom has been experiencing terrible leg cramps (and crawlys) at night, and could hardly ever get a full nights rest. After using this product, however, she immediately felt relief, especially after using it the second night.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see my mom well rested, and not only was the product spectacular, but the company. I received a hand written letter from a generous employee, that ensured my money back, and had a personal e-mail attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll defiantly buy from this seller agin!</li>
            <li> The pump would not on either bottle.</li>
            <li> did not do as good a job as expected...had to use very large amount to get any relief</li>
            <li> This cream is very soothing on my legs at night!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I touched it to my tongue and there seems to be a nervous system acting chemical in there because it caused my tongue to go a bit numb for a few minutes.  If it works for anyone, I suspects it is due to that.</li>
            <li> When I need it , it works</li>
            <li> Mom loves it, works great...</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law has tried several kinds of medicines to relieve symptoms. This creme is amazing.  When applied liberally, it really does help! In fact this is our 4th &amp; 5th bottle ordered.  She ensures it is on bottom and top of foot as well as on legs and knees. Don&#x27;t be stingy with it.  Note that one of the ingredients is lidocane, which is why it works!</li>
            <li> smelled very good but didn&#x27;t help my legs</li>
            <li> This works great! If I use at night I don&#x27;t have that heavy feeling in my legs! If I have pains it helps remove them.</li>
            <li> I was totally bummed.  This just did not even begin to work for me.  I was so excited to try it.  Not sure what I should try now....</li>
            <li> does not work...total waste of money, will keep it for a regular lotion</li>
            <li> Nice lotion like cream..hasn&#x27;t worked for my RLS...but I&#x27;ve had many things happen including nerve damage in my lower spine and back surgery etc. Lots of rx&#x27;s like neurontin, requip, norco etc. Mostly helped. But I wanted to try a natural bedtime remedy..didn&#x27;t change anything. Instead, I just take my meds, sleep on tempur pedic,  and use epsom salt in my hot baths at night and that helps me relax. And weekly deep tissue massage just on my lpwer half/butt/legs.  But try the cream if you have RLS that&#x27;s not related to low back surgery etc. It&#x27;s not smelly and I&#x27;m sensitive to many lotions, but luckily no bad reaction to this. I read the ingredients and feel that it may be meant for people with mild to moderate nutrition deficiencies...which causes some forms of RLS &amp; this cream is great &amp; will help most people for that, so try it</li>
            <li> I had a terrible problem with restless leg syndrome. Every night it wakes me up and I could not go back to sleep because of the uncomfortable sensation in my lower legs. I always look for a natural product for my medical problems and when I saw it on Amazon, I ordered it right away.&lt;br /&gt;And guess what, it works. I still wake up sometimes, but immediately put the Restless Legs Calming Cr&amp;egrave;me on and now I fall asleep very fast&lt;br /&gt;again until the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;With all the wonderful natural ingredients in it, it is definitely a 5 Star product.&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Baker</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time buying this product and I will be buying it again.  I use it for my legs as they get tight from sitting at work and in the evening it really relaxing.  The best part is that my husband loves it to as he has &amp;#34;restless legs&amp;#34; it like he is riding a bike in bed. He uses this lotion prior to going to bed and the legs are calm.  This is a Big Plus - a wonderful night of sleep.  Definitely would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very good for use day or night.  Really helps to calm my restless fidgety knees.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a 90 year old in my home w/ restleg syndrom and it provided amazing relief. Delivery was typical Amazon 4 star delivery, which is to say it was delivered within the time I chose and on time to relieve her pain.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product to use before going to bed for restless legs.Works very fast,smelles good,absorbs quickly.Have not found anything better to use.</li>
            <li> This was a gift so I really don&#x27;t know for sure how to rate it.  I haven&#x27;t gotten any feedback from my friend.  So I don&#x27;t know how it works.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this creme to be more than a moisturizer.  Didn&#x27;t relieve my restless legs.  I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a product that my dad uses for neuropathy.  He says it provides relief for 5 or 6 hours.</li>
            <li> In my arsenal of remedies for RLS. I have finally found something that helps calm down my Restless Legs.It is not a cure but it does calm the condition down enough to allow me to get some sleep at nite. When the pain is the greatest I may have to use several applications It is a creme and not a gel so I can apply many coats without a sticky buildup. Now I have two item for relieving my RLS. This wonderful creme and my little peddle exerciser. It took awhile to locate them but I am glad I found them -now I can sleep.</li>
            <li> THE GOOD NEWS. IT WORKED FOR ME. I WENT A MONTH-AND-A-HALF WITHOUT EXPERIENCING RESTLESS LEGS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD NEWS. AS I CONTINUED TO USE THIS PRODUCT. I WAS DEVELOPING TERRIBLE HIVES ON MY LEGS WHICH CAUSED ME TO VISIT MY DOCTOR 3 TIMES PLUS 1 TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM ON A SUNDAY! THE PRODUCT WORKS. HOWEVER, FOR ME, IT CAUSED ME A LOT OF ISSUES</li>
            <li> works very well for calming restless legs.</li>
            <li> It worked well some nights, but not at all on other nights. I would like more consistent relief. On the plus side, it massaged in quickly and had a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> my wife has restless leg syndrome and she uses this product to relieve the symptoms and it works great and it is very effective for muscle aches and joint pain my wife swears by this product she has tried everything out there for RLS but this is the only product that really works</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe RLS. My husband sometimes sleeps on the couch because he claims I \\&quot;riverdance\\&quot; in my sleep - that&#x27;s when I can fall asleep. I won&#x27;t say that this product eliminated 100% of my RLS symptoms, but it calms my legs enough that I can actually fall asleep. I use it every night on my lower legs and it really helps. I have spent a lot of money on other products that claim to help, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve used that actually does help. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> RESTLESS LEGS CALMING CREAM HAVE BEEN USING THIS CREAM FOR MANY YEARS IT IS THE BOMB I SAY TELL EVERY BODY ABUT THIS CREAM THIS CREAM IS RESTLESS LEGS CALMING CREAM................</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my husbands feet everyday before putting his socks on. This is really great Creme. It helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my Mom- she loves it and uses it nightly</li>
            <li> I was delighted to discover this lotion really helps calm the leg jitters. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me- much better than the calm pills. Doesn&#x27;t take away all of the kicking but it certainly helps and safer than requip or mirapex</li>
            <li> This is the best creme to use for restless legs.  It works fast, it smells good, it is fast absorbing, and it works great.  I even got my husband and 89 year old mother to use it, and they are both as happy with this product as I am.</li>
            <li> I have RLS mostly at night and this product does work. I keep it aside of the bed. Takes about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work as suggested</li>
            <li> Its  Okay,&lt;br /&gt;I have Severe Restless legs tho &amp; im 61 Years old,&lt;br /&gt;It  feels Good tho,&lt;br /&gt;and a Huge Bottle for your money,&lt;br /&gt;Im using a Massager on my legs for restless legs &amp; soaking in warm water with lavender epson salts which helps more !!&lt;br /&gt;this is Quite Greasy,&lt;br /&gt;Wear socks over it so you don&#x27;t slip on floor.&lt;br /&gt;Again  Imm 61 &amp; SEVERE RLS  &amp;  If your younger &amp; its mild, It may Work For you !!</li>
            <li> Works for restless legs but the pump is hard to open, to use it I have to open the entire bottle</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like I hoped it would!</li>
            <li> This did not work to keep my RLS under control!  Disappointing!</li>
            <li> Package hard to open.  Pump hard to pump.  Other wise the cream is ok.</li>
            <li> I read others comments on this and other products and decided on this one and it is great.  I was pleasantly surprised how good it works.</li>
            <li> works well for a good night sleep</li>
            <li> I do not have Restless Legs, however I was experiencing some pain in both legs sort of like &amp;#34;growing pains&amp;#34; when I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;I order this product and it worked fantastic and relieved all the pain.  Would highly recommend use of this crème.</li>
            <li> good product good seller</li>
            <li> So far so good - I only use as needed but when I notice my legs getting &amp;#34;restless&amp;#34; I apply &amp; massage it into both legs &amp; I think it really works!!!  Also, my health conditions are infamously difficult to treat so getting relief for restless legs is a BIG deal!!!  I realize it may not actually work (it may be mind of matter), but heck, it doesn&#x27;t have medicdation in it &amp; I don&#x27;t get side effects (rash, itching, etc.) so I&#x27;m going to continue using it until it doesn&#x27;t work anymore - but it may continue to work, who knows?  Anyway, I&#x27;d recommend this creme!!!</li>
            <li> To me this was nothing more than A regular lotion .  It did not helped me with RLS at all</li>
            <li> This product clams your feet and legs when you wake up at night, I love  RR and would not be with out it .Patricia</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing ! My bf had restless legs so bad i would say it was more kicking in his sleep ! He had 5 bi pass surgery 10 yrs ago n has blood pressure issue so we are careful of products . This was approved by our doctor as its more natural ingredients and IT WORKED AMAZINGLY THE FIRST NIGHT !!!! thank you !!!!thank you !!!!thank you !!</li>
            <li> Thanks a million.  Using this cream when the legs get to jerking me around saves the night for me.  It only takes a few minutes and the worst of the jerking settles down.  Thank again.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It really  works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a clue why it works...I just know that it does.&lt;br /&gt;I read one of the reviews on this site where a lady was having the same difficulties I was having for years.  It&#x27;s no fun to be dead tired and have to walk the house over before getting back to sleep.  I waited to post my review until I had no doubt and was completely sure of my findings.  Just try it.  It may not work for everyone but what if it works for YOU??</li>
            <li> Best I have ever had and it works wonders</li>
            <li> In 10 days pain in the foot calmed down. I was also taking iron and other trace elements. Weather also changed. I am not sure healing is due to just the RLC cream or combined effect. But anyway served the purpose. I feel relieved of the throbbing pain everyday.</li>
            <li> The ad sounds great. A blessing for those of us that have Restless Leg Syndrome. Too bad it is just talk, does not work. My leg started with the usual symptoms that meant I was headed for an unpleasant evening. I rubbed the crème into my leg really good to make sure it would penetrate. I waited and waited and waited but nothing happened. It did not work, did not begin to do anything to calm the sensation. I won&#x27;t waste my money on this product again!!! I gave it one star only because the system wouldn&#x27;t accept my review without marking at least one star!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works very quickly and I can go back to sleep.  This is my third order</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister, she said it really works.</li>
            <li> they did just like their advertisement said.</li>
            <li> I did not find this lotion to work at all.  I used it anyway because it was nice and creamy and I liked the scent.  I just went to use it again and the smell was absolutely foul on my skin.  I had to rinse it off and scrub my hands with soap.  I don&#x27;t know if it spoiled or what.  It was definitely money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I like this one as well as the previous review....They both seem to work and I use it only&lt;br /&gt;when I take my medication for this later than I should.</li>
            <li> I do not know how much it helps but I am still looking for something.  The one program is the pump is not very good sometimes. I have ordered 5 or6 bottles and the pumps do not always work very well.</li>
            <li> I have to write this review because I have been suffering with RLS for nearly 40 years. I participated in The clinical study for Requip years ago. It was a blind study so I was never told if I had the placebo or the drug, either way it didn&#x27;t help. My mom 76 has also had RLS most if her life on and off. Mine has been almost every night in varying degrees since I turned 35 and routinely before that. (54) My mom is always looking and trying the crazy commercialized products she sees. So when she sent me this cream I was immediately skeptical. Bless her heart she will try anything to help herself and her 4 daughters with whatever ails us, from weight loss to wrinkle creams and energy boosters to orthotics.  So I was reluctant to try yet another MIRACLE (pun intended). Night one I fell asleep (typically if I can get to bed alone, before I&#x27;m over tired and do not use my iPad, I can get to sleep before it overcomes me. The problem is that I wake often and then cannot go back to sleep. It starts and never stops. I find myself running up and down the stairs several times in the middle if the night to simply exhaust myself. This night I decided to try the cream first. I fumbled around in the dark to open it and applied it to both legs. I laid back down and had a strange sensation that I wanted to move my legs but this time I didn&#x27;t have to. There was no build up of that sensation. It really seemed to work. I fell back to sleep easily and for the remainder of the night. I have used the entire jar now and my words of advice, it does not work proactively, wait until the first twinges to apply, don&#x27;t over do it but be sure to do the bottom of your feet and behind you knees. I never believed it would help. I am headed to Italy in May, I pray it will work on the plane as that is one of my worst places for flair ups. I hope it works for you too.</li>
            <li> My legs would start to cramp up (especially after eating high salt) in the evenings and would continue into the night.  I was skeptical about this product, but use it every night and no leg cramps and I sleep soundly.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I use this cream at night, which is when it seems to occur. It stops the problem almost as soon as it is applied, and lets me sleep with out any further problem. In addition it feels like it softens, and it is not stickey, or unpleasant smelling. I am so happy to have found it, because any one who has restless leg syndrome knows how annoying it is, Thank God for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M. Rooney</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any efficacy from this product after 4 tries. The fragrance is rather strong. Not greasy. But I don&#x27;t see it working for RLS.</li>
            <li> Great item, great price, great shipping from a great dealer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have RLS and it&#x27;s been bothering me for over a year now. I happened to stumble across this product while searching for something that will help. I am so happy that I tried this! The first time I used it I had to apply it twice. So whatever way works for you, try it.! Dont stop using it bc you think its not working for you the first time. Give it a chance. The directions say to apply \\&quot;generously\\&quot; and I was applying \\&quot;sparingly\\&quot;. So when you do apply it, do yourself a favor and follow the directions. Even my first application I could tell a difference-some sort of relief. So I applied it again about 15 minutes from my first application and voila! So much better! And I was able to fall asleep. It seems the more I used it the better my legs felt and now I don&#x27;t have to apply it every night anymore and I can finally sleep like a baby. If there&#x27;s anyone out there that&#x27;s thinking about trying this product it really is worth the try. Especially when there are so few options for RLS.&lt;br /&gt;Tip; take a warm sea salt bath before bedtime and apply this creme on your legs and your feet when you get out.(don&#x27;t forget to massage it also on the bottom of your feet  and on the back side of your leg-opposite of your knee cap.). Then sleep like a baby-------- I really slept more like a drunk bc i was late for work the next morning. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it all the time.  She thinks it&#x27;s the best restless leg external crème she has ever used.  She recommended it to her friend, and she loves it also.  It does the job for her.</li>
            <li> second time buying. will continue to purchase. works great for my husband. He uses it daily and loves it. great product</li>
            <li> It works for milder RLS</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve had RLS just about all of my life, it&#x27;s only been a real problem for me, i.e. interfering with my quality of life, over the past five years or so.  I know there are powerful drugs that can be prescribed for it, but I&#x27;m too leery of them to try them; plus, other more natural remedies that I&#x27;ve tried have helped to some degree.  A little more than a year ago, though, while rehabbing from a broken ankle, the crawling sensations just really seemed to ramp up in the uninjured leg; that&#x27;s when I started looking for something stronger.  Searched on Amazon and ordered the Miracle Plus Restless Legs Calming Creme.  It worked!  Best of all, I found that I didn&#x27;t need to use it every day - two or three times a week seemed to keep the restlessness to a minimum.  Now I only use it a couple of times a month.  I suspect it&#x27;s the Lidocaine that does the trick, while other ingredients such as the aloe perhaps aid its absorption into the skin.  Effective, no negative side effects (that I&#x27;ve experienced) and a good price - can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!</li>
            <li> I must have a severe case of RLS because I couldnt get this product to work for me at all. I have tried every prescription I physically can.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife.  She has venous stasis, a disorder in which the normal flow of blood through a vein is slowed or halted and she has it in her lower legs, causing swelling and discoloration. Sometimes one leg will swell half again the size of her leg.  As you can imagine, swelling that much causes the skin to dry and tighten, causing discomfort and pain.  I went in search of something she could use that might help or even improve her external discomfort.  Restless Legs Calming Creme had great reviews and since it said &amp;#34;helps stimulate circulation for increased comfort, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  She&#x27;s only used it twice but application shows immediate relief from the dryness.  Not sure what else will happen with continued use, so we will update once we get to the bottom of this bottle.  I also bought some Mary Kay Mint Bliss energizing lotion for feet and legs. I just want something that will give her some element of relief.  If anyone else has recommendations, we welcome them.  Nothing we can buy in a bottle will take away the condition, but relief from discomfort counts and this definitely does give relief, so we do give it 5 Stars and recommend it for others with similar conditions.</li>
            <li> I earlier rated this product very poor because it did not work for me.  I realize that all products will not work for everyone, depending on a lot of medical factors that might go along with their restless legs.  I am sure that people with less complicated issues are enjoying relief with this product.  I would like to rescind my previous review, considering these facts.</li>
            <li> My restless legs have led to leg cramps and Charliehorses.  For years I have tried everything from pills, heating pads to home remedies.  THIS IS THE ONLY THINK THAT WORKS.  THANK YOU CONCEPT LABORATORIES!</li>
