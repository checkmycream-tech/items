            <li>The product applies smoothly and looks natural on mature skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gone pretty fast and my face is left looking drab.</li>

            <li> No joke, once applied, the color is gone, WITHOUT a trace in 2 minutes or less!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to apply, and can look streaky if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> and I no longer will pick the wrong color at a makeup counter.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in the staying power of the product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the reason is because it is a silicone base and silicone \\&quot;pigments\\&quot; will not grab onto your skin.</li>
            <li> I think they need to redo this without a silicone base.</li>

            <li> i LOVE this blush!! it turns into a beautiful shade--and its SOOO convenient for touch-ups when you go out! lets face it--who wants to bring along a powdered blush and a brush when they go out at night? cos blush has always been the first thing to fade throughout the day/night when i go out. this stuff not only is easy to apply (just use your fingers!) but you can throw it in your purse and reapply in the bathroom/wherever when you need a little more blush! it really does turn the perfect shade of pink--and it looks SO natural! i am on my 3rd tube, and plan on purchasing it again when i run out. im going to try their lipgloss next! definitely check this product out!! :)</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of a product that works by vasodilation to create, naturally, your own unique perfect cheek color. Which this does--immediately--but only lasts for a few minutes, and then it&#x27;s gone. Better to just smudge a bit of whatever lipstick you&#x27;re using onto your cheeks &amp; rub it in. That&#x27;s a method that&#x27;s tried and true and can&#x27;t possibly last for less time than this sorry little product.</li>

It&#x27;s also difficult to apply, and can look streaky if you&#x27;re not careful. Blending is also difficult - it slips around easily on your face and disappears completely if blended to thinly. The color is so so - bright pink for me. I&#x27;ll stick to powder blushes.</li>
            <li> I do not know why this product has any more than 1 star. Are you girls that are giving this 5 stars checking yourself in a mirror after applying? No joke, once applied, the color is gone, WITHOUT a trace in 2 minutes or less! Perhaps the reason is because it is a silicone base and silicone \\&quot;pigments\\&quot; will not grab onto your skin. I think they need to redo this without a silicone base. I regret spending a penny on this product.</li>
            <li> This is a gel great product use a very small amount/practice a little when you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll love natural looking lasts all day for me</li>
            <li> The very perfect natural cheek color for ALL skin types and shades. No guessing on picking out the right shade of blush . It magically matches the tone of your skin. Looks like your blushing ...naturally :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product, gives a natural look of a small amount of color, a little goes along way.  Start with a small bit, if you want more color, layer it on rather than starting with a glob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller had the best price I have seen for it, way to go!</li>
            <li> SMASHBOX OGLOW is a pretty pink that changes color with skin temp. Very natural looking and the texture&#x27;s velvety soft and luxurious&lt;br /&gt;... somewhat like Wexler MMPI serum. I used a tube that expired 2 yrs ago but the color was still good!!! Minus 0.5 stars because&lt;br /&gt;it contains toxic chemicals. I now use &amp;#34;100% Pure&amp;#34; blush but miss the gel&#x27;s more youthful glow</li>
            <li> I used this product over Smashbox&#x27;s Photofinish Primer. It gave my cheeks a natural glow that I love and I no longer will pick the wrong color at a makeup counter. It does work over bare moisutrized skin but will not last as long.</li>
            <li> This product gives a very light, just a hint of color.</li>
            <li> I tried this product out of curiosity at a beauty store. Because it was initially a clear gel so I just slapped it on my cheeks, which, with in seconds, turned into a brilliant rosy pink! Nonetheless, I was impressed by just how smoothly it went on and that it also added highlight in addition to color. I now use just a tiny bit of it in the morning. It makes me look healthy and pretty in a subtle and natural way. I think this tube is going to last me for at least a year. I love Smashbox products!</li>
            <li> This is a natural looking flush that comes in gel form. It reacts to your body heat and creates a color completely natural looking, like you&#x27;ve got a healthy blush in your cheeks. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice coloring.  Have to be careful so it doesn&#x27;t streak but once you get the hang of it - its great!</li>
            <li> Simply the best gel blush out there.  It leaves a very natural glow on the skin.  Satisfaction is guaranteed !!!</li>
            <li> Very light, easily adjustable produce.  Good with or without other makeup on face.</li>
            <li> O-glow gives a natural glow when you don&#x27;t want to do full make up or a little extra color even if you do.  So fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product when I don&#x27;t want to do my whole make up routine</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s just right for just a hint of color.  I&#x27;m not using anything else.  I need another one : )</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this blush. Its so natural can use without foundation for more natural look. very light.</li>
            <li> I love the glow this product gives my cheeks.  The fact that the product adjusts to your skin color makes it perfect for my fair skin, I get enough color without the clown effect.  The product applies smoothly and looks natural on mature skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product - saved me a trip to the store! Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> Gives an extremely natural flush on the cheeks.  However, use a tiny bit or you&#x27;ll end up looking like a clown at the circus.</li>
            <li> Love the product because you need only half a dime&#x27;s worth or less on the tip of a finger, blend it with corresponding finger on other hand and lightly blend into cheek.  It feels like baby powder and leaves a warm glow, not matte.</li>
