            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>ðŸ˜Š love the company name!</li>
            <li>Again great product, strong, and works.</li>
            <li>and she liked them</li>
            <li>But that doesn&#x27;t change the quality of the nice wood and the sandpaper.</li>
            <li>This did the job nicely.</li>
            <li>With that said I received this item in exchange for giving my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>kind.</li>
            <li>The handwritten thank you note was a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li>Cleans off nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This also comes packaged nicely with a note from the company that makes it.</li>
            <li>I received this file at a discounted price for my honest review, which is what you are reading.</li>
            <li>This is really easy to use and feels so good.</li>
            <li>On 4/11/15, I was pleasantly surprised when I received a replacement foot file the company sent me with an explanation it was best not to use it in the shower going forward</li>
            <li>My heels look fabulous and loved the hand written note they sent with it.</li>
            <li>Easy Peasy!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>Works great, but wear shows on callus remover after first use.</li>
            <li>The wood has a nice weight to it and makes it easily to reach without any body stress.  </li>
            <li>I love it when things work as you expect them (granted this</li>
            <li>but I do a appreciate predictability:-)</li>
            <li>So much better than those metal ones.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more when this one wears out.</li>
            <li>but I needed something more.</li>
            <li>I sure will be recommending this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li>and I should get better results.  </li>
            <li>My feet have never been smoother :)</li>
            <li>I love this callus remover.  </li>
            <li>My husband even said your feet feel smooth!  </li>
            <li>There are similar one for sale but take my word these are the best you will ever find!Try</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Plan to buy more to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li>Most of the others are so flemsy  </li>
            <li>They work better than anything else I have ever</li>
            <li>love this company I ordered from, as they took the time to send me a wonderful&lt;br /&gt;appreciation card which also included using the foot file.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you could find a knock off of this design somewhere for a cheaper price</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>The wood is thicker and more sturdy and the sand paper is rougher which is better.</li>
            <li>I also love to support family owned business and that&#x27;s what this product is.</li>
            <li>It was really cute.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely sturdy two-sided callous remover.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love love love this file.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Well made product,very pleased&amp; works great making my feet soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>The coarse and fine grit boards do an excellent job exfoliating and smoothing my soles.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for this all my life and thanks to all the great Amazon reviews I purchased this and wow!&lt;br /&gt;I would have paid 4 times the price for this fantastic foot file.  </li>
            <li>It is large, feels comfortable in my hand and was very effective.</li>
            <li>To clean, just use some warm water and light soap.</li>
            <li>very sturdy with good width and grip.</li>
            <li>Perfect for cleaning off the rough edges on my feet and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other than that- PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy to grip so that makes it easier to hold and control.</li>
            <li>The handle makes the file easy to use and easy to reach my feet.</li>
            <li>This product arrived exactly as advertised and with a nice handwritten note from the seller.</li>
            <li>They also sent me another foot file that should work fine in the shower.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>It has both course and fine sides to it to tailor your sanding operation.  </li>
            <li>The customer service was great and they took back the item.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>Not like the cheap plastic ones that break.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a genuine hand made item, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li>High quality nice piece</li>
            <li>Great callus remover with a long handle.</li>
            <li>was also very impressed at the handwritten note on the package THANKING me for buying from them, a small</li>
            <li>And the handwritten thank you note was also sweet.</li>
            <li>I really like it better that the one my daughter took.</li>
            <li>I say without any bias, I would buy this file again at full price.</li>
            <li>I am bare feet all summer and rarely take good care of my feet.</li>
            <li>Works well and would make a great gift to put with other foot care products.</li>
            <li>Works super well with a callous remover.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and just a wonderful all round purchase.</li>
            <li>but I see it wearing out quickly.</li>
            <li>This was a very good product and worked quite well for the first few days.</li>
            <li>My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big and the grit paper is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the gesture - thank you!!</li>
            <li>I love it so far!</li>
            <li>Big and sturdy~  works magic on your feet in minutes!  </li>
            <li>I love the large size of the whole thing.</li>
            <li>Just used it on my very callused heels, and they never looked or felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the discounted price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, as the wooden handle is very sturdy and feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li>Worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>THIS product is way better than the old one.</li>
            <li>Works great with little effort!</li>
            <li>Solidly made, easy to hold and does the job well!</li>
            <li>Ordered one last week and wife liked it so much I had to order one for myself.</li>
            <li>I also bought the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp at the same time to see which one I would like better</li>
            <li>That area I have never been able to smooth due to the sensitivity of the toe underside.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you soak you feet in some warm water prior to using this product.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>My feet are soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel this is worth the $14.00 the seller is charging for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid walker</li>
            <li>at first, but it started falling apart after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Plus, who takes the time to enclose a hand-written note of thanks in the package!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I have used many, but this is definitely the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My feet were incredibly soft and smooth with one use.</li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t find it to be better than the cheaper one Diane Foot File European Beech Wood.</li>
            <li>Considering that there is 8 feet of snow outside, it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.</li>
            <li>We just make sure it&#x27;s dried off good afterwards and stored in a dry location.</li>
            <li>After one use, my feet feel better than they have in a very long time.</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use, it works on dry feet and makes them smooth and look like you got your feet professionally done.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure with continued use, they will remain flip flop ready all summer long.</li>
            <li>The file is easy to use, the size is perfect for contouring those hard to reach areas like the big toe area where rough calluses exist.  </li>
            <li>Hints are very helpful.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly!</li>
            <li>Nothing I used for my calluses ever really worked before this</li>
            <li>Well, with this foot file, it only took minutes to easily smooth my heels and foot/toe undersides.  </li>
            <li>This foot file and callus remover really should have been made using a sturdy plastic.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but in this case there really isn&#x27;t anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and it really has made a difference-</li>
            <li>Owners seem to really appreciate the business which is a real treat.</li>
            <li>The handle is very sturdy and can take a lot of pressure.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is thicker therefore there is no fear of it snapping into two pieces should you use too much pressure on your heel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with real wood.</li>
            <li>I do not store this in my shower, as it is real wood</li>
            <li>It works so fast</li>
            <li>This is a really good and thick callus remover.</li>
            <li>I use that first, wash and dry my feet, THEN use this file, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more in the future for gifts!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Even from the beauty supply store, you will not find a file as high quality.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time, then put lotion on my feet and they are SO soft!!</li>
            <li>He just used it and it helped him to smooth out the rough edges of his heel</li>
            <li>I bought this a few weeks ago and my feet have never been this smooth!</li>
            <li>Once cleaned up it still looks new.</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft!</li>
            <li>Really liked that it was rough on one side then the polisher on the other.</li>
            <li>I hardly ever write reviews but this product, which I just opened and used in the last hour, is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Thick wood~ amazing on on feet in a very short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Have used the file once so far and it worked like wonder for my feet.</li>
            <li>I had it for 10 years and it was just getting old.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not harsh.</li>
            <li>I  had another other wooden foot callus remover but the wood was very thin and the sand paper wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>love buying from small companies and will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend purchasing this item especially if you are a runner.</li>
            <li>As an avid exerciser, runner, and tennis player, I have been plagued for years with continually rough and callused feet.  </li>
            <li>This does such a good job on my callouses and dry skin that I have been able to care for my feet at home cutting down trips to the podiatrist.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it for my husband because his heels get rough and snag the sheets (eew) and really needed it.</li>
            <li>On a par with the old La Crosse brand, for which, until now, I&#x27;ve not found an equal.</li>
            <li>This callus remover worked pretty well on my feet while I was in the shower, but the black dye running from it was disconcerting.</li>
            <li>The other products may work but require effort, patience or too much money.  </li>
            <li>Well-made (i.e. solid, two different intensities of smoothers, can be used wet or dry, wide enough that it&#x27;s easily held and used).</li>
            <li>At first I had difficulty distinguishing between the black side and the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; side in poor light.</li>
            <li>When I received it in the mail I could tell that the wood part was very durable but was skeptical about the file part because ones like that haven&#x27;t worked for me in the past but this one worked amazingly.</li>

            <li> Again great product, strong, and works.</li>
            <li> and she liked them</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t change the quality of the nice wood and the sandpaper.</li>
            <li> This did the job nicely.</li>
            <li> With that said I received this item in exchange for giving my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> kind.</li>
            <li> The handwritten thank you note was a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li> Cleans off nicely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This also comes packaged nicely with a note from the company that makes it.</li>
            <li> I received this file at a discounted price for my honest review, which is what you are reading.</li>
            <li> This is really easy to use and feels so good.</li>
            <li> On 4/11/15, I was pleasantly surprised when I received a replacement foot file the company sent me with an explanation it was best not to use it in the shower going forward</li>
            <li> My heels look fabulous and loved the hand written note they sent with it.</li>
            <li> Easy Peasy!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> Works great, but wear shows on callus remover after first use.</li>
            <li> The wood has a nice weight to it and makes it easily to reach without any body stress.  </li>
            <li> I love it when things work as you expect them (granted this</li>
            <li> but I do a appreciate predictability:-)</li>
            <li> So much better than those metal ones.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> but I needed something more.</li>
            <li> I sure will be recommending this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> and I should get better results.  </li>
            <li> My feet have never been smoother :)</li>
            <li> I love this callus remover.  </li>
            <li> My husband even said your feet feel smooth!  </li>
            <li> There are similar one for sale but take my word these are the best you will ever find!Try</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Plan to buy more to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li> Most of the others are so flemsy  </li>
            <li> They work better than anything else I have ever</li>
            <li> love this company I ordered from, as they took the time to send me a wonderful&lt;br /&gt;appreciation card which also included using the foot file.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you could find a knock off of this design somewhere for a cheaper price</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> The wood is thicker and more sturdy and the sand paper is rougher which is better.</li>
            <li> I also love to support family owned business and that&#x27;s what this product is.</li>
            <li> It was really cute.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely sturdy two-sided callous remover.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love love love this file.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Well made product,very pleased&amp; works great making my feet soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> The coarse and fine grit boards do an excellent job exfoliating and smoothing my soles.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this all my life and thanks to all the great Amazon reviews I purchased this and wow!&lt;br /&gt;I would have paid 4 times the price for this fantastic foot file.  </li>
            <li> It is large, feels comfortable in my hand and was very effective.</li>
            <li> To clean, just use some warm water and light soap.</li>
            <li> very sturdy with good width and grip.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleaning off the rough edges on my feet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that- PERFECT.  </li>
            <li> The handle is easy to grip so that makes it easier to hold and control.</li>
            <li> The handle makes the file easy to use and easy to reach my feet.</li>
            <li> This product arrived exactly as advertised and with a nice handwritten note from the seller.</li>
            <li> They also sent me another foot file that should work fine in the shower.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> It has both course and fine sides to it to tailor your sanding operation.  </li>
            <li> The customer service was great and they took back the item.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> Not like the cheap plastic ones that break.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a genuine hand made item, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> High quality nice piece</li>
            <li> Great callus remover with a long handle.</li>
            <li> was also very impressed at the handwritten note on the package THANKING me for buying from them, a small</li>
            <li> And the handwritten thank you note was also sweet.</li>
            <li> I really like it better that the one my daughter took.</li>
            <li> I say without any bias, I would buy this file again at full price.</li>
            <li> I am bare feet all summer and rarely take good care of my feet.</li>
            <li> Works well and would make a great gift to put with other foot care products.</li>
            <li> Works super well with a callous remover.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and just a wonderful all round purchase.</li>
            <li> but I see it wearing out quickly.</li>
            <li> This was a very good product and worked quite well for the first few days.</li>
            <li> My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and the grit paper is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the gesture - thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love it so far!</li>
            <li> Big and sturdy~  works magic on your feet in minutes!  </li>
            <li> I love the large size of the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Just used it on my very callused heels, and they never looked or felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the discounted price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, as the wooden handle is very sturdy and feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li> Worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> THIS product is way better than the old one.</li>
            <li> Works great with little effort!</li>
            <li> Solidly made, easy to hold and does the job well!</li>
            <li> Ordered one last week and wife liked it so much I had to order one for myself.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp at the same time to see which one I would like better</li>
            <li> That area I have never been able to smooth due to the sensitivity of the toe underside.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you soak you feet in some warm water prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> My feet are soft and smooth...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t feel this is worth the $14.00 the seller is charging for it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid walker</li>
            <li> at first, but it started falling apart after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Plus, who takes the time to enclose a hand-written note of thanks in the package!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have used many, but this is definitely the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My feet were incredibly soft and smooth with one use.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t find it to be better than the cheaper one Diane Foot File European Beech Wood.</li>
            <li> Considering that there is 8 feet of snow outside, it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.</li>
            <li> We just make sure it&#x27;s dried off good afterwards and stored in a dry location.</li>
            <li> After one use, my feet feel better than they have in a very long time.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use, it works on dry feet and makes them smooth and look like you got your feet professionally done.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure with continued use, they will remain flip flop ready all summer long.</li>
            <li> The file is easy to use, the size is perfect for contouring those hard to reach areas like the big toe area where rough calluses exist.  </li>
            <li> Hints are very helpful.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Nothing I used for my calluses ever really worked before this</li>
            <li> Well, with this foot file, it only took minutes to easily smooth my heels and foot/toe undersides.  </li>
            <li> This foot file and callus remover really should have been made using a sturdy plastic.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but in this case there really isn&#x27;t anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and it really has made a difference-</li>
            <li> Owners seem to really appreciate the business which is a real treat.</li>
            <li> The handle is very sturdy and can take a lot of pressure.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is thicker therefore there is no fear of it snapping into two pieces should you use too much pressure on your heel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with real wood.</li>
            <li> I do not store this in my shower, as it is real wood</li>
            <li> It works so fast</li>
            <li> This is a really good and thick callus remover.</li>
            <li> I use that first, wash and dry my feet, THEN use this file, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more in the future for gifts!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Even from the beauty supply store, you will not find a file as high quality.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, then put lotion on my feet and they are SO soft!!</li>
            <li> He just used it and it helped him to smooth out the rough edges of his heel</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and my feet have never been this smooth!</li>
            <li> Once cleaned up it still looks new.</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> Really liked that it was rough on one side then the polisher on the other.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews but this product, which I just opened and used in the last hour, is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Thick wood~ amazing on on feet in a very short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Have used the file once so far and it worked like wonder for my feet.</li>
            <li> I had it for 10 years and it was just getting old.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not harsh.</li>
            <li> I  had another other wooden foot callus remover but the wood was very thin and the sand paper wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> love buying from small companies and will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend purchasing this item especially if you are a runner.</li>
            <li> As an avid exerciser, runner, and tennis player, I have been plagued for years with continually rough and callused feet.  </li>
            <li> This does such a good job on my callouses and dry skin that I have been able to care for my feet at home cutting down trips to the podiatrist.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it for my husband because his heels get rough and snag the sheets (eew) and really needed it.</li>
            <li> On a par with the old La Crosse brand, for which, until now, I&#x27;ve not found an equal.</li>
            <li> This callus remover worked pretty well on my feet while I was in the shower, but the black dye running from it was disconcerting.</li>
            <li> The other products may work but require effort, patience or too much money.  </li>
            <li> Well-made (i.e. solid, two different intensities of smoothers, can be used wet or dry, wide enough that it&#x27;s easily held and used).</li>
            <li> At first I had difficulty distinguishing between the black side and the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; side in poor light.</li>
            <li> When I received it in the mail I could tell that the wood part was very durable but was skeptical about the file part because ones like that haven&#x27;t worked for me in the past but this one worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> It does the job without having to rub hard and it takes less than half the time to accomplish my goal of soft lovely looking feet.</li>
            <li> So I have become extremely self conscious of my heels which is why I decided to try out this product.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have only used the rough side on dry skin so far...</li>
            <li> A larger grained side to use on dry feet and a smaller grained side to use when your feet are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not your average file- far from it.</li>
            <li> We followed the directions and kept it dry between uses, but it still did not last.  </li>
            <li> I used it once a week in the shower and would let it air dry in a dry place outside my shower.</li>
            <li> When my husband used it on his hand, he said it felt too rough, like coarse sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I have used various foot files, foot shavers, creams to slough feet, and pumice stones with minimal results.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take long and didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually larger than I expected and has two sides to it.</li>
            <li> I have rough feet, and I purchased this to replace another similar product that had worn out.  </li>
            <li> I really had to scrub hard to get the rough skin off my feet.</li>
            <li> I used the side for dry feet then soaked in my foot spa and used the side for dry feet.</li>
            <li> I used it as soon as I received it on my dry feet</li>
            <li> I used this file on dry feet after I showered, and it didn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> Hang to dry.</li>
            <li> , I hang out it dry overnight and keep it in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally arrived on my doorstep today after middle Tennessee thawing out from a week of ice and snow and disabled delivery services.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a dark brownish red.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foot file in January 2015 and less than two months later it is falling apart.</li>
            <li> But, my feet are worst than most, so I need the callous remover gel first.</li>
            <li> I have spent countless hours and $&#x27;s the past few years trying to find an easy way to remove my tough calluses.  </li>
            <li> My heels get very dry and cracked in the summer months.</li>
            <li> One side is for dry use and the other for wet.  </li>
            <li> Old person with old tired feet and old tough calluses?  </li>
            <li> I have rough skin on my feet (who doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li> The sandpaper is too rough, however.</li>
            <li> and it does what it is expected to do.  </li>
            <li> So I was surprised that the red file part, which seems to be like a thin piece of sandpaper glued to the wood, is shredding already.  </li>
            <li> Got rid of pesky hereditary dead skin under my big toe extremely well.</li>
            <li> The black side is starting to peel and drips black liquid when it gets wet.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s wet it separates apart!</li>
            <li> I still have the other side, the smoothing side, so I will use that for now</li>
            <li> Not so small that I am constantly loosing it like others I have bought.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my dad as I don&#x27;t trust him using other types of callus removers.</li>
            <li> so I oly have to go to the foot doctor every other month.</li>
            <li> I soaked my sad feet in the hot tub for about 20 minutes and then used this Agony of Defeet foot file.</li>
            <li> I just used this file for merely minutes after exiting the shower and actually now have baby soft feet.  </li>
            <li> Too me not worth $13.95.</li>
            <li> However after a few uses the rough surface that is held together by adhesive began to get water underneath and tore off.</li>
            <li> My feet were very calloused and rough, in desperate need of some tlc.</li>
            <li> so my review may change in the next few months based on how well that part holds up.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AGONY OF Dfeet!!!</li>
            <li> I have added a photo showing how it peeled away, revealing a green under backing (just explaining what you&#x27;re looking at).</li>
            <li> Ordered it and had it in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> thin enough</li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t noticeably remove much dead skin).</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> these calluses will be gone in a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; side is the side to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> My feet get pretty bad and its hard to find a product that can remove all the dry callused skin.</li>
            <li> I can hang it in the bathroom on the rack behind my toilet</li>
            <li> A quick sand with this paddle and gone are those annoying calluses.  </li>
            <li> but I just did in 15 minutes what usually takes hours and/or lots of effort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s made by a small family owned company.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a thick rope lanyard so you can hand it up in your bathroom when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll be sorry.  </li>
            <li> have thrown out that useless pumice stone.</li>
            <li> AND I find myself noticing the UGLY heels of others.</li>
            <li> I hate knarly looking feet</li>
            <li> Bad quality!</li>
            <li> and my feet are terrible!</li>
            <li> My heels are horribly callused, so I need to also use a chemical callous remover gel.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a very good product and worked quite well for the first few days. However after a few uses the rough surface that is held together by adhesive began to get water underneath and tore off. The customer service was great and they took back the item. This may be an item if you plan to use on your feet once in a while and not once every two or three days.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Gave Mom a pedi and she liked them</li>
            <li> Great file for the money.</li>
            <li> Callous remover still performing well.  Use it every day.  No sign of surface wear.  Hints are very helpful.</li>
            <li> Works great with little effort!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  One side is for dry use and the other for wet.  I love it when things work as you expect them (granted this was one of the simplest product to buy) but I do a appreciate predictability:-)</li>
            <li> Nice...wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I used the side for dry feet then soaked in my foot spa and used the side for dry feet. My feet are so soft! So much better than those metal ones. I will be buying more when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> This callus remover worked pretty well on my feet while I was in the shower, but the black dye running from it was disconcerting. When my husband used it on his hand, he said it felt too rough, like coarse sandpaper.</li>
            <li> This is a great Callous remover.  Would recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Bad quality! When it&#x27;s wet it separates apart!</li>
            <li> Good file but note i said only 1 file. The photo makes it look like you get 2 files.If you don&#x27;t scan over the photo and just read the add you won&#x27;t see that it says front and back. I just think the add should say 1 file or don&#x27;t show 2 files side by side.</li>
            <li> Got rid of pesky hereditary dead skin under my big toe extremely well. If you leave it in the shower area and it gets steamy, the glue will start to part the sandpaper part from the wood. So I just used some Gorilla glue to fix it. But that doesn&#x27;t change the quality of the nice wood and the sandpaper. Nothing I used for my calluses ever really worked before this so I still recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this all my life and thanks to all the great Amazon reviews I purchased this and wow!&lt;br /&gt;I would have paid 4 times the price for this fantastic foot file.  As an avid exerciser, runner, and tennis player, I have been plagued for years with continually rough and callused feet.  I have used various foot files, foot shavers, creams to slough feet, and pumice stones with minimal results.  I just used this file for merely minutes after exiting the shower and actually now have baby soft feet.  The file is easy to use, the size is perfect for contouring those hard to reach areas like the big toe area where rough calluses exist.  That area I have never been able to smooth due to the sensitivity of the toe underside.  Well, with this foot file, it only took minutes to easily smooth my heels and foot/toe undersides.  I am purchasing another!!  Thank you Agony of Dfeet!!</li>
            <li> Works great, but wear shows on callus remover after first use.</li>
            <li> Great but I wish I had just bought one at target for $3.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I am not the girly girl who goes to mani/pedi&#x27;s. Never have actually. I am bare feet all summer and rarely take good care of my feet. However, this year I&#x27;m making changes and one of those changes are with my feet. I bought this a few weeks ago and my feet have never been this smooth! Love it, love it!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! My heels get very dry and cracked in the summer months. Creams help but I needed something more. I don&#x27;t pay for pedicures and would rather take care of my feet at home. After reading the reviews I thought I would give this a try. As soon as the mailman delivered it, I gave it a whirl. It was just the pampering my heels needed! I am looking forward to getting into bed tonight and FINALLY not having to worry about my heels snagging on my bedding. My feet are soft and smooth...and I&#x27;m sure with continued use, they will remain flip flop ready all summer long. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product! I used it as soon as I received it on my dry feet and it worked amazingly! I sure will be recommending this product to family and friends. Glad to find this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great callus remover.  Works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foot file in January 2015 and less than two months later it is falling apart. At first it was the best foot file I ever used. It is large, feels comfortable in my hand and was very effective. I used it once a week in the shower and would let it air dry in a dry place outside my shower. So I was surprised that the red file part, which seems to be like a thin piece of sandpaper glued to the wood, is shredding already.  I still have the other side, the smoothing side, so I will use that for now but I&#x27;m thinking it will probably shred soon too. I have added a photo showing how it peeled away, revealing a green under backing (just explaining what you&#x27;re looking at). ****** On 4/11/15, I was pleasantly surprised when I received a replacement foot file the company sent me with an explanation it was best not to use it in the shower going forward and I should get better results.  They also sent me another foot file that should work fine in the shower. I really appreciate the gesture - thank you!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!  High quality nice piece</li>
            <li> This was bigger then I thought it was going to be. Really liked that it was rough on one side then the polisher on the other. Definitely worth the discounted price.</li>
            <li> This did the job nicely. Didn&#x27;t take long and didn&#x27;t hurt. Once cleaned up it still looks new.</li>
            <li> This foot file and callus remover really should have been made using a sturdy plastic.  The instructions tell you &amp;#34;Not recommended to use in shower&amp;#34;, which I didn&#x27;t.  However, while I was cleaning it, a part of the callus remover came off.  I really don&#x27;t feel this is worth the $14.00 the seller is charging for it.  I&#x27;ll continue to use my $2,25 foot file, which is made out of sturdy plastic.</li>
            <li> Work like a charm, just as promised! My feet have never been smoother :)</li>
            <li> I love this callus remover.  It works so well.  I use it all the time.  I&#x27;m an avid walker plus I do zumba and yoga.  Keeps my feet baby smooth.  I also like the size.  I can hang it in the bathroom on the rack behind my toilet and it&#x27;s always there.  Not so small that I am constantly loosing it like others I have bought.  Ordered it and had it in just a few days.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> Have used the file once so far and it worked like wonder for my feet. They already feel softer. Would recommend this product. And the handwritten thank you note was also sweet. Thanks</li>
            <li> My feet look great!  My husband even said your feet feel smooth!  Highly recommend purchasing this item especially if you are a runner.</li>
            <li> Size is great for foot coverage. The coarse and fine grit boards do an excellent job exfoliating and smoothing my soles.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad as I don&#x27;t trust him using other types of callus removers. It&#x27;s big and the grit paper is pretty good too. He just used it and it helped him to smooth out the rough edges of his heel so he&#x27;s a happy camper. The handle is easy to grip so that makes it easier to hold and control. Good foot file and I will be recommending to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt; Note: I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest/unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Works well and would make a great gift to put with other foot care products.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  She used it once a week and after 2 months, the red side was peeling off.  The black side is starting to peel and drips black liquid when it gets wet.  We followed the directions and kept it dry between uses, but it still did not last.  It&#x27;s a shame, as the wooden handle is very sturdy and feels good in the hand.  Would not recommend this product because of the peeling issue.</li>
            <li> This product arrived exactly as advertised and with a nice handwritten note from the seller. I ordered it for my husband because his heels get rough and snag the sheets (eew) and really needed it. It&#x27;s actually larger than I expected and has two sides to it. A larger grained side to use on dry feet and a smaller grained side to use when your feet are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a solid design and feel and is made out of wood. It&#x27;s not recommended for use in the shower though he&#x27;s used it in the shower and it&#x27;s been fine. We just make sure it&#x27;s dried off good afterwards and stored in a dry location. There&#x27;s also a thick rope lanyard so you can hand it up in your bathroom when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair review I like to try to find SOMETHING I&#x27;d change about it but in this case there really isn&#x27;t anything. It&#x27;s just a good foot buffer!</li>
            <li> I have to say I Love it! With that said I received this item in exchange for giving my honest and unbiased opinion. When I received it in the mail I could tell that the wood part was very durable but was skeptical about the file part because ones like that haven&#x27;t worked for me in the past but this one worked amazingly. My feet get pretty bad and its hard to find a product that can remove all the dry callused skin. This product was easy to use, it works on dry feet and makes them smooth and look like you got your feet professionally done.</li>
            <li> I am no expert of calluses but it works. I keep this in the shower and sand-paaper my calluses.&lt;br /&gt;It works. Best of all it endures. Not like the cheap plastic ones that break.</li>
            <li> I have rough skin on my feet (who doesn&#x27;t?) and this double-sided file is helpful. At first I had difficulty distinguishing between the black side and the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; side in poor light. It&#x27;s actually a dark brownish red. The handle makes the file easy to use and easy to reach my feet.</li>
            <li> I just bought another one for our Condo.  Well-made and keeps the callus on the ball of my foot thin enough so I oly have to go to the foot doctor every other month.</li>
            <li> This foot file is great! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and it really has made a difference- and my feet are terrible! Just note DO NOT USE THIS IN THE SHOWER. After one use in the shower the paper started to peel. I contacted the company asap, and they were nothing but kind. They didn&#x27;t even hesitated to compensate for what had happened. They also said that you aren&#x27;t supposed to use the file in the shower- I asked them to include this on their instructions, and they agreed that they were unclear about that.</li>
            <li> Works super well with a callous remover. My heels are horribly callused, so I need to also use a chemical callous remover gel. I use that first, wash and dry my feet, THEN use this file, and it&#x27;s fantastic. I used this file on dry feet after I showered, and it didn&#x27;t work as well (didn&#x27;t noticeably remove much dead skin). But, my feet are worst than most, so I need the callous remover gel first. Once I use that too, this file works awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a must have item for all those ladies out there. This is really easy to use and feels so good. The build quality is outstanding and the build quality is great. Super fast shipping and just a wonderful all round purchase.</li>
            <li> I have rough feet, and I purchased this to replace another similar product that had worn out.  I&#x27;m very happy with the job it does smoothing my tootsies.</li>
            <li> A piece of sanding paper on a wooden handle?  Waste of money.  Oh, and the instructions say &amp;#34;not recommended for use in shower&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Old person with old tired feet and old tough calluses?  This is the ticket for you.  I&#x27;m a diabetic and have perpetual calluses bothering me all the time.  A quick sand with this paddle and gone are those annoying calluses.  It has both course and fine sides to it to tailor your sanding operation.  You&#x27;ll wonder how you got along without one of these.  Kevin.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a genuine hand made item, which I like a lot.  The sandpaper is too rough, however.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love the large size of the whole thing. Perfect for cleaning off the rough edges on my feet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It worked great...at first, but it started falling apart after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a quality file - sturdy, well made.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this! My feet were very calloused and rough, in desperate need of some tlc. After one use, my feet feel better than they have in a very long time. Well made, quality product. The handwritten thank you note was a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li> Great callus remover with a long handle. Well made !</li>
            <li> I love them! Great job! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Well-made (i.e. solid, two different intensities of smoothers, can be used wet or dry, wide enough that it&#x27;s easily held and used). On a par with the old La Crosse brand, for which, until now, I&#x27;ve not found an equal. A mom-and-pop business, which I appreciate. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ordered one last week and wife liked it so much I had to order one for myself.There are similar one for sale but take my word these are the best you will ever find!Try it and you won&#x27;t ever look for another callous remover.Owners seem to really appreciate the business which is a real treat.</li>
            <li> Finally arrived on my doorstep today after middle Tennessee thawing out from a week of ice and snow and disabled delivery services.  Worth the wait.  Love it.  Best foot file I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Just used it on my very callused heels, and they never looked or felt so smooth.  Plan to buy more to give as gifts.  Plus, who takes the time to enclose a hand-written note of thanks in the package!  Very nice touch.</li>
            <li> The folks that make these take a real personal touch with you by including a &amp;#34;Thank You&amp;#34; note with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Great Quality and works wonderfully! Thank you :0) I will definitely order more in the future for gifts!</li>
            <li> This works so well!  The handle is very sturdy and can take a lot of pressure.  Cleans off nicely.  Great pedicure tool!</li>
            <li> This is a really good and thick callus remover. I really like it. Most of the others are so flemsy  (sp?) And this is verh well made. Very happy with my purchase! I use it all the time, then put lotion on my feet and they are SO soft!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Helpful usage and maintenance tips provided in follow up emails from the seller (Agony of Dfeet).</li>
            <li> I love these foot files!  They work better than anything else I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I love this company I ordered from, as they took the time to send me a wonderful&lt;br /&gt;appreciation card which also included using the foot file.  I will definitely use this&lt;br /&gt;company again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This product looks pricey for something so simple but I just did in 15 minutes what usually takes hours and/or lots of effort.  This product uses quality materials, making it a steal compared to mechanical devices.  I have spent countless hours and $&#x27;s the past few years trying to find an easy way to remove my tough calluses.  The other products may work but require effort, patience or too much money.  I&#x27;m sure you could find a knock off of this design somewhere for a cheaper price but you&#x27;ll be sorry.  I am so happy I gave this a try before buying another mechanical file (one was in the cart!).  I hardly ever write reviews but this product, which I just opened and used in the last hour, is amazing.  In addition, I have only used the rough side on dry skin so far...these calluses will be gone in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;CAVEAT: The product does use a sandpaper layer so my review may change in the next few months based on how well that part holds up.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AGONY OF Dfeet!!!</li>
            <li> I asked a question before I bought this callus remover. That question was &amp;#34;Is this just a piece of wood with some sand paper glued on&amp;#34;? Some people said yeah but it&#x27;s like water proof or yeah but it works great that sort of thing. Well what the hell I bought one. Guess what, it&#x27;s a piece of wood with some sand paper glued on. Too me not worth $13.95. It works okay but I see it wearing out quickly. I also bought the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp at the same time to see which one I would like better and I can say without a doubt I like the Microplane much better.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00756HQNQ/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> This works great -- much better than the ones I&#x27;ve bought in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I was also very impressed at the handwritten note on the package THANKING me for buying from them, a small company.&lt;br /&gt;I love buying from small companies and will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I  had another other wooden foot callus remover but the wood was very thin and the sand paper wasn&#x27;t the best. I had it for 10 years and it was just getting old.  I really had to scrub hard to get the rough skin off my feet. I hate knarly looking feet and I use it all the time. THIS product is way better than the old one. The wood is thicker and more sturdy and the sand paper is rougher which is better. It does the job without having to rub hard and it takes less than half the time to accomplish my goal of soft lovely looking feet. I LOVE it! DO NOT use this IN the shower! Any product with wood and paper shouldn&#x27;t be used in the shower. I use it BEFORE I take a shower, then wash my feet and use lotion. I also love to support family owned business and that&#x27;s what this product is. I would give it 10 starts if I could!</li>
            <li> Does a good job on heels</li>
            <li> I was asked to write a review for this product! I had a product like this before, however, my daughter took it from me. During the &amp;#34;flip flop&amp;#34; season, I struggle with cracked heels. AND I find myself noticing the UGLY heels of others. So I have become extremely self conscious of my heels which is why I decided to try out this product. I really like it better that the one my daughter took. This one is thicker therefore there is no fear of it snapping into two pieces should you use too much pressure on your heel. The &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; side is the side to remove the dead skin. I highly recommend you soak you feet in some warm water prior to using this product. It will make the dead skin come off much easier. The &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; side is used for buffing or smoothing the skin on your heels. You can also use it around your toes if you have callouses there too. HIDE this product because if you have daughters, it will definitely disappear! To clean, just use some warm water and light soap. Hang to dry. Easy Peasy! A+</li>
            <li> Reduced my trips to the local nail pedicure shop!</li>
            <li> this is absolutely great! does an excellent job! have thrown out that useless pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I love it so far! and its a family owned business, they sent me a hand written thank you note. It was really cute.</li>
            <li> Excellent callous remover....</li>
            <li> Well made product,very pleased&amp; works great making my feet soft and smooth! ðŸ˜Š love the company name!</li>
            <li> The product works great and the thank you note from the owner of the business was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely sturdy two-sided callous remover. It&#x27;s made with real wood. It&#x27;s an excellent and sturdy foot tool. I have used many, but this is definitely the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made by a small family owned company. Really good quality.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery and it worked like a wonder. My heels look fabulous and loved the hand written note they sent with it.</li>
            <li> Great product. I also purchased an electric filer bbecause I didn&#x27;t think this would get the job done but it works amazing! Electric filer is going back unopened. Again great product, strong, and works.</li>
            <li> Big and sturdy~  works magic on your feet in minutes!  I could not believe how well made this was for a foot file. Thick wood~ amazing on on feet in a very short amount of time.  I soaked my sad feet in the hot tub for about 20 minutes and then used this Agony of Defeet foot file. My feet were incredibly soft and smooth with one use. This was before cream!  I will definitely save some loot on pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not your average file- far from it. Even from the beauty supply store, you will not find a file as high quality. The wood has a nice weight to it and makes it easily to reach without any body stress.  The only thing I would change it about this tool is to make it refillable, that you could buy extra blank file paper cutouts to stick on once the file paper is worn. Other than that- PERFECT.  I do not store this in my shower, as it is real wood, I hang out it dry overnight and keep it in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also comes packaged nicely with a note from the company that makes it. I see a lot of &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; touch in this product and that they take pride in their file, made in America, too.  I received this file at a discounted price for my honest review, which is what you are reading. I say without any bias, I would buy this file again at full price.</li>
            <li> very sturdy with good width and grip. Doesnt recommend for in the shower, but thats where i prefer to use mine and its been working great for about a month now.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and it does what it is expected to do.  However I don&#x27;t find it to be better than the cheaper one Diane Foot File European Beech Wood.</li>
            <li> I love love love this file. Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used a lot of others. It works so fast but it&#x27;s not harsh. My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good for a very long time. Only thing I will be using from now on.</li>
            <li> Solidly made, easy to hold and does the job well!</li>
            <li> This does such a good job on my callouses and dry skin that I have been able to care for my feet at home cutting down trips to the podiatrist.  Considering that there is 8 feet of snow outside, it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.</li>
