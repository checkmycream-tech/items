            <li>They feel soooo soft and feel soooo comfortable!</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I was able to purchase my size online after searching in different stores.</li>

            <li>Bras especially never seem to fit right.</li>
            <li>then you think you need, because I wear a size Large in shirts, but in the Genie Bra I needed a 1X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; I find comfortable at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It may be comfy for just laying around the house, but don&#x27;t get up and do much.</li>

            <li>The Genie bra is not sexy, but it is comfortable when other bras are not.</li>
            <li>The bra was way too small and also flattens your breast, so you look kind of ridiculous.</li>

            <li> I threw away my underwire bras, some of which were from Victoria Secret and bought another box.</li>

            <li> I wear a 48DD. I must admit, I was very skeptical about this bra, but my desire for relief from those awful underwires drove me to a purchase. For this product, I am a size 1X. The bra provides enough support to hold up my breasts (seriously, no sagging!) and enough coverage on the sides and back to smooth out the skin. I threw away my underwire bras, some of which were from Victoria Secret and bought another box. The bras are comfortable and perform exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  I went by their directions for ordering the right size but it did not work.  The bra was way too small and also flattens your breast, so you look kind of ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product becs i am pregnant and my breast continue to grow.  Victorias secret had my bra on back order for 2 months so i had to find something to wear.  I tried on the L in the store and my chest was popping out the top.  I ordered an XL from amazon and i find it too big, unsupportive, and the straps keep falling off my shoulders.  I wear the XL around the house and the L in public.  I find that the 2 bras in the L box are very different.  The tan one is much smaller and my breasts fall out the bottom.  I also bought the lace style in a L and it is looser then the XL in the chest.  The one L that does fit has been heaven!!!  I step into the bra since i hate pulling things over my head.  Take out the pads when washing becs they get folded and leave a crease on your breast.  I plan on wearing these during the remainder of my pregnancy and in nursing since i cant risk buying a $44 VS bra every few months and risking them not being available (they dont have DD in the stores :(  ).  The Genie bra is not sexy, but it is comfortable when other bras are not.</li>
            <li> Its all I buy now....comfortable</li>
            <li> I brought these bras for a comfortable alternative to the Under wire during my pregnancy. im in my third trimester and my breasts are usually tender and bothersome so I was not expecting a miracle, just some relief from the bondage of under wire. The bras fit ok but offer little support (im a 36DD). The pads on the nude bra are placed oddly and shows through my shirt. These bras are ok in the house but i wouldn&#x27;t wear them outside due to the uni-boob effect.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I was so excited that I was able to purchase my size online after searching in different stores. The fit was perfect.</li>
            <li> Super comfortable and affordable. Make your cloths looks great with no lines or wires pinching you. Love the colors too.</li>
            <li> A comfortable bra. Easier to get through the day with it in than those uncomfortable ones with bones. The band at the bottom was a bit tight though. Generally though, I like!</li>
            <li> first of all the size is wrong. it is not XL/1X. Seems that it is not original genie bra and made in china.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it. smashed my boobs</li>
            <li> I love these bras!! I&#x27;m so excited and happy about how wonderful they are! After I ordered I read some very poor reviews and I doubted my purchase. These bras are freaking amazing! They feel soooo soft and feel soooo comfortable! I can move so freely and comfortably with plenty of support. Do not be swayed by the negative comments some have made. You would be missing out big time if you did! If your not satisfied with these bras I can only guess you ordered the wrong size. I ordered an xl and my Bra size is 38 dd. They are supper soft and don&#x27;t roll up under the band. I love love love them!!! Everyone should buy these!! They are so. worth it!!</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and I cannot stand anything putting pressure on my sternum, like underwire bras or even traditional bras without underwire. I tried the Genie Bra on and I felt like my breasts were getting a nice soft hug with no pain or irritation!!  Even better, is that it looks great under clothing, with cleavage and a nice silhouette. I want to buy these for every woman I know!</li>
            <li> I love love love this bra. I actually purchased these at Target after trying them on and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it on cause I found I needed a bigger size than I thought. I&#x27;m 38dd and tried a large but found the xl/1x fit me much better. I actually took out the padded inserts cause I felt like they were too small. This bra takes away the appearance of back fat, underwire and shoulder strap issues. I will be buying another box.</li>
            <li> This bra might be O.K. for ladies with breast augmentation or have small breasts.  I am naturally, full breasted and this bra flattened me like a dinner plate.  I purchased the right size according to company but you would never no it.  Does not live up to hype!!</li>
            <li> The bra was OK - I did not like the fact that the pads move and do not stay where you put them.  It&#x27;s a great bra to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I am a full breasted (44 DD naturally) woman who wanted a comfortable bra that wouldn&#x27;t cut into me.  I LOVE this bra.  When I need a little more support, I just slip in the \\&quot;lifts\\&quot; into the little pocket.  It doesn&#x27;t give the same support as an underwire bra, but it doesn&#x27;t cut into your skin like an underwire does either.  I liked these bras so much I went out &amp; bought another pack of them. I had tried the Ahh Bra before &amp; didn&#x27;t like them, (rolled &amp; material was thin &amp; non supporting) so was hesitant to buy the Genie Bra.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It&#x27;s finally nice to find a bra that supports me &amp; I find comfortable at the same time.  For those considering this bra, it is imperative to buy your actual size &amp; not the size you \\&quot;think\\&quot; you are.  For years, I wore a much smaller size &amp; was surprised at my actual bra size ... so buying the correct size does make a difference.</li>
            <li> Okay ladies, if you need an xl or bigger, this will not hold the ladies in:) It may be comfy for just laying around the house, but don&#x27;t get up and do much. It just doesn&#x27;t have really any support. It&#x27;s comfy fabric, but has already started to fray on mine. I wash with delicates, but still kind of falling apart. Probably works for smaller ladies, but for larger....it just doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews of products very often, but I had to write something about this. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bra! Having just had and breastfed my third child, I HATE how my body looks right now. I have so much baby weight on me and I feel like I look horrible. I am so much heavier now then I used to be, and I am not used to dressing for my new body type. Bras especially never seem to fit right. I am always feeling sloppy and I feel like my boobs just flop out the top of my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the genie bra, it smoothes everything down, without flattening it. Now, I have the toned chest look that you get when you workout a lot. My bust is still large but it does not have that sloppy look to it, but is so much more toned. I would recommend getting a bigger size then you think you need, because I wear a size Large in shirts, but in the Genie Bra I needed a 1X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great if you are large busted and have that saggy look to your chest and you want to look more toned and better pulled together.</li>
