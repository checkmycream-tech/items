            <li>How they can say this is the best nail cutter is beyond me.</li>
            <li>Great cuticle clippers for the price!  </li>
            <li>best cuticle nippers ever</li>
            <li>Remarkable Experience !</li>
            <li>However, good nipper for the price.</li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It came promptly, looks good and well made.</li>
            <li>Be assured that I did not receive a free pair for my review (although that would have been awesome : )</li>
            <li>Quite nice.  </li>

            <li>I received this product through a promotion for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>This clipper trims just as effectively as clippers that sell for much more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>I use them when giving myself pedicures they clip the toe nails better the nail clippers do.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and works great.</li>
            <li>the Revlon ones at cvs are better.</li>
            <li>Seem to be strong, sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>Comfortable size and shape and well-sharpened for easy use.  </li>
            <li>The two metal pieces that fit together like a clasp were warped upon arrival.</li>
            <li>A nice, basic tool.</li>
            <li>Cuticle Nipper is sharp enough to make a clean cut, has  great spring, comfortable handles.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product but not the most lasting.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described &amp; just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This product was to replace a similar cuticle nipper made by Revlon after the spring steel snapped after many years.</li>
            <li>Overall they are ok nippers.</li>
            <li>Good clippers for dead skin and cuticles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to use and the quality is not that good.</li>
            <li>This clipper is extremely sharp, cuts cleanly, are made of durable stainless steel, and have blades that are precision aligned for clean, smooth-feeling cuts.</li>
            <li>They do the job and feel very sturdy</li>
            <li>The Veluxio Naturals nipper is more sturdily constructed of higher quality stainless metals than the typical &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34</li>
            <li>These are ok for the price, but they don&#x27;t cut as cleanly as other brands I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find cuticle clippers in my local drugstore that worked well, so I ordered this pair on Amazon and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>However, when I saw this cuticle clipper for half the price and with good reviews, I decided to try it although I was a bit skeptical because most of the reviews were from people who received a free cuticle cutter for their unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>The clipper has well-angled handle (different from traditional nail clippers) that gives ample leverage for quick, precise cuts without using a lot of force.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for purchase.</li>
            <li>So that part is good, but they don&#x27;t cut cleanly, sometimes you have to tear a bit to get the cuticle your cutting.</li>
            <li>The edges are very sharp, allowing for a clean cut of the cuticles.  </li>
            <li>Professional?</li>
            <li>When it came, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Sorry to say these nippers didn&#x27;t do a good job.  </li>
            <li>After using this for a month, I have not gone back to my old clippers.</li>
            <li>Just not very sharp.</li>
            <li>However the point at the end of the cutters is not very sharp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>Steel is not well polished and after just a few months of light use, not as sharp.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp, and bigger than I thought.  </li>

            <li> Remarkable Experience !</li>
            <li> Handle dirty, like it was rubbed with graphite. Handle nicked, poorly produced.&lt;br /&gt;Blade roughly sharpened. Not smooth finish edge.&lt;br /&gt;Spring recoil rubbed when nipper operates causing an uncomfortable and unnecessary &amp;#34;halt&amp;#34; in the motion toward closure.&lt;br /&gt;Returned product immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Nipper not of the quality I should expect for this sort of tool.</li>
            <li> Steel is not well polished and after just a few months of light use, not as sharp. Not a bad product but not the most lasting. I&#x27;ve had cheaper ones that did the job well for a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Quite nice.  Difficult for me to use with left hand however.</li>
            <li> Good clippers for dead skin and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Professional? I&#x27;m not so sure. The blades on these arrived fairly dull, and will need sharpening. Though maybe that&#x27;s the norm with pro products, I just expect something like this to work well out of the box. While the metal is hefty in the hand, I judge cuticle clippers by the blades, and these just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> A nice, basic tool. Exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li> These are ok for the price, but they don&#x27;t cut as cleanly as other brands I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s almost like you have to snip and tug to get the skin to come off--not what I like to do to delicate cuticle skin, but they work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sharp enough. However, good nipper for the price.</li>
            <li> Seem to be strong, sturdy and well made. I use them when giving myself pedicures they clip the toe nails better the nail clippers do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that I was unable to place the nipper in a close position, it stays as it appears in picture otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described &amp; just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> After struggling for years trimming tough toe nails, I&#x27;m amazed how easily this little tool does the job. My wife likes them also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the pair I got, but these get stuck closed every snip... I have to manually open them up, instead of them resetting themselves to the open position.  A bit tedious and frustrating.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say these nippers didn&#x27;t do a good job.  Pulling and to difficult to cut cuticles.</li>
            <li> The Veluxio Naturals nipper is more sturdily constructed of higher quality stainless metals than the typical &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; brands that I have used in the past.  Comfortable size and shape and well-sharpened for easy use.  Highly recommended for purchase.</li>
            <li> This product was to replace a similar cuticle nipper made by Revlon after the spring steel snapped after many years. I purchased the more expensive &amp;#34;Gold&amp;#34; model at Walgreens locally, but it cut poorly, so I returned it. I then purchased the Veluxio Naturals nipper, which had all five-star reviews. It came promptly, looks good and well made. Unfortunately, it scarcely cuts cuticle at all and tears at the tissue instead of cleanly nipping it off - same problem as with the Gold Revlon. I am returning it. It makes me skeptical about the glowingly positive reviews and whether they are ghost written by the seller.</li>

            <li> Piece of s***. Do not buy. Bad quality. Hard to use. Not sharpen.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find cuticle clippers in my local drugstore that worked well, so I ordered this pair on Amazon and was not disappointed.  It is very sturdy and works great.</li>
            <li> Very hard to used with and nonfunctional.</li>
            <li> The two metal pieces that fit together like a clasp were warped upon arrival. It was not in a usable state. I had to bend them into a shape so the clippers could properly close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are usable, but it&#x27;s obviously not ideal.</li>
            <li> I received this product through a promotion for my honest and unbiased review. They do the job and feel very sturdy and I think they will be with for a long time. Cuticle Nipper is sharp enough to make a clean cut, has  great spring, comfortable handles. If it looses its sharpness, I always can use it for my crafts.</li>
            <li> I bought these nippers to cut off hang nails. My old one started slipping together , there was only one inside brace. This one has 2 connected inside. So that part is good, but they don&#x27;t cut cleanly, sometimes you have to tear a bit to get the cuticle your cutting. Overall they are ok nippers. Just not very sharp.</li>
            <li> After decades of buying useless cuticle cutters and/or paying for time consuming manicures, FINALLY, a product that works!  Thank you! thank you!</li>
            <li> They arrived broken, and having to return these for the cost is really annoying.</li>
            <li> sharp cutters would buy again</li>

            <li> Not very sharp, and bigger than I thought.  Kinda gnaws at the cuticle instead of cutting.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them</li>
            <li> THE worst nail cutter.</li>
            <li> Not much better than can be bought at CVS.</li>
            <li> Great cuticle clippers for the price!  I usually buy the tweezerman brand as their products are consistently well-made.  However, when I saw this cuticle clipper for half the price and with good reviews, I decided to try it although I was a bit skeptical because most of the reviews were from people who received a free cuticle cutter for their unbiased review.  When it came, I was pleasantly surprised.  The cuticle cutters spring open and close as they should.  The edges are very sharp, allowing for a clean cut of the cuticles.  However the point at the end of the cutters is not very sharp.  I actually like this feature as I found the pointed end of the tweezerman cuticle cutters a little too sharp and unnecessarily dangerous.  I definitely recommend this pair of cuticle cutters.  Be assured that I did not receive a free pair for my review (although that would have been awesome : )</li>
            <li> Not A Good One... the Revlon ones at cvs are better. This one stays open all the time and the hinges in between scrape the sides when you press it together. Makes it hard to be accurate when cutting cuticles.</li>
            <li> best cuticle nippers ever</li>
