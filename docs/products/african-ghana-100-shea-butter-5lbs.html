            <li>The best shea butter I have found, it is so soft &amp; it makes your skin shiny, moisturized and soft as well.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>but overall it was a great product</li>

            <li>Arrived on time, smells unrefined, melts upon application, goes on smooth.</li>

            <li>Peaceful Greetings, Thank you for this butter and the price.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to strain it as it was fairly clean, I put it in an old shea butter container that I paid $5 for for 16 oz</li>
            <li>The shea butter is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I love this product I cut it  into sections and place them in containers,when I rub some into my hands  it softens so nicely ,next time I will order a larger amount.</li>
            <li>I have already made all type of she mixes, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>All natural!</li>
            <li>Thank you ,Kathleen Wild</li>
            <li>Box was completely demolished by the time it got to me.  </li>
            <li>The order came in the timeframe as expected and the shipping price wasn&#x27;t as much as the product.</li>
