            <li>Makes your beard noticeably softer and the smell is pleasant.</li>

            <li>I love the smell and it is nice wig my fly aways!!</li>
            <li>i bought the bay rum beard oil a couple months ago and loved the scent, so i decided to try the balm to go with it.  </li>
            <li>It makes his beard softer and it smells good (to both him and I).</li>
            <li>However it does smell really good</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>If you want a good beard balm, look for one with argan oil and jojoba in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good...</li>
            <li>Does a good job taming the mane.</li>
            <li>They both smell great, but the balm controls my beard better.</li>
            <li>My husband is very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It keeps my beard in tip top shape, softens it, &amp; the wife is happy with how it makes my beard look, feel, &amp; smell.  </li>
            <li>Kind of smells like a spice cabinet (in a good way).</li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m really enjoying it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Everyone who has encountered it loves the smell, and I love how it keeps my beard!</li>
            <li>My favorite balm yet!</li>
            <li>Pleasant and better than oil in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; isn&#x27;t too strong of a scent.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>A win win all-around.</li>
            <li>Product smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I love the bay rum scent (so does the girlfriend ) but more inportantly the hold is great.</li>
            <li>I could honestly detect the scent after 12 hours.</li>
            <li>really wanted this to be awesome</li>
            <li>It has a nice manly smell to it that starts out</li>
            <li>The smell is great, the wife says it smells like a clean aftershave.  </li>
            <li>This balm helped me transition from a cropped beard to a full beard and greatly increased the manageability of it.</li>
            <li>Answers all emails and questions very easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>Really nice product, smells great and works really nice, exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I ordered this after having used Honest Amish products for over a year.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but isn&#x27;t overly powerful like I felt the Amish products could be.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it makes both your hair AND your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Came in very quickly!</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome, the consistency of the balm is great, controls very well and my beard feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks it worked great and the smell is amazing</li>
            <li>but this was cheaper and u get way more and honestly works better</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Great purchase, thanks!.</li>

            <li>I plan to buy more</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Very much enjoyed this product and really enjoyed the scent of it.</li>
            <li>Glad they made a bay rum balm.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My wife and kids love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>Your wife will love you more for using GBS products.</li>
            <li>And the ladies seem to love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Already ordered more stuff .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grave Before Shave is A LOT better.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>The sent is just okay.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the shine</li>
            <li>Just a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent from GBS.</li>
            <li>the scent is awakened once more.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents ever, it reminds me of trips to the barber shop when I was a child after the neck shave and the towel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a better beard than most of the world and Grave</li>
            <li>Always sends stickers which my kids love.</li>
            <li>Bought this after using GBS beard oil and falling in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It assists your beard more than it directs it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I treat my beard with the balm for a better &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>The balm had a pleasant smell at first, but became sort of nauseating after a while.</li>
            <li>At first, I LOVED the smell.</li>
            <li>Smells great and helps my beard stay soft and tamed!</li>
            <li>It has a great masculine smell that will make your partner want to keep her face in your beard.</li>
            <li>He loved it so much he order another one today.</li>
            <li>Beard is much more tameable and has a unique sshine.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Combs through easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but but mellows out nicely and leave the beard nice and soft</li>
            <li>I tried Honest Amish, which is arguably the most widely bought and highly rated product here on Amazon, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>First, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best smelling beard ba on market.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a beard balm after many, many years using nothing, just conditioner.</li>
            <li>Works best when the hair is slightly damp</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant aroma that so far has held up.</li>
            <li>Smells good and keeps the wayward hairs of his early stage beard under control.</li>
            <li>Helps tame those pesky hairs on my beard and smells great!</li>
            <li>Nice scent keeps my beard soft all day a bit oily at first but settles in nicely</li>
            <li>was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed with a grave before shave product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would help make my beard look more crisp and keep the strays under control</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t place that familiar smell...</li>
            <li>It smells great and really helps keep a wild beard under control!</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong at first, and kind of interferes with my coffee in the morning, but it dissipates and is much lighter throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>so it looks clean.</li>
            <li>In summary, it&#x27;s quite fragrant, maybe even too feminine for some noses; it softens, holds, isn&#x27;t greasy, and fades into a clean somewhat powdery smell.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells clean and fades after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find any other bay rum that smells as good as grave before shaves, my wife can&#x27;t stop touching and smelling my beard.</li>
            <li>Now I am hunting for one that has that special scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, for the weekend night outs or special occasions</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this so much.</li>
            <li>Great product for keeping your beard manageable and looking sharp.</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite beard balm.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and makes the beard feel softer and lay a little closer.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, but the scent only lasts an hour.</li>
            <li>The scent is by far my favorite out of all the beard bombs.</li>
            <li>Great smelling, which is really all I expected, but it made my beard noticeably filler and tamer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely a 5 star on this one,  I really liked the badass beard stuff</li>
            <li>I love the hold and how it leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>Pretty sweet</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in the tin solid, but easily melts with the slightest finger pressure to rub easily into a beard.</li>
            <li>So far so good, the wife says it tames my beard pretty well--havent been using long enough to know how much more it&#x27;ll continue to get better.</li>
            <li>this is the final application it smells like a rum and is absolutely wonderful and keeping all the flyaway of strays down</li>
            <li>Nice smell and decent initial hold, but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>Product was fine but not any better than other waxes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t seem to interested in trying to make the purchase right and were probably aware of the issue.</li>
            <li>I want to like the product, the balm itself does a decent job, however, the tin creates some kind of vacuum seal every time I close it.</li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I will be getting more in the future, thx.</li>
            <li>I actually like this balm much more that the oil.</li>
            <li>This was the first balm I even bought.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a smell that women seem to love.  </li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve had this problem with balm in these tins.</li>
            <li>It also increased my terminal length by more than two inches before I finally shaved it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of an oil guy than balm dude (their oil with the same smell is exquisite!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that it&#x27;s really easy to apply and isn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s got grape seed oil in it, which is super cheap and has a short shelf life.</li>
            <li>rubs in easily and leaves my beard with a nice, conditioned shine while smoothing down wild hairs.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft, full and keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li>The one that is most familiar to me and reminiscent of my younger days when I used Mr. Zoggs Sex wax and that glorious beach and candle like pirate smell.  </li>
            <li>GBS Bay Rum is an awesome balm, great smelling and long lasting without that waxy feel and as long as you don&#x27;t apply too much it does not leave behind a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, does have a strong smell at first, becomes more subtle over time.</li>
            <li>Really tames those unruly hairs without making your beard feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It really softened my beard and the scent lingers for hours.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much for the quality is excellence in a can, that fits your palm.</li>
            <li>However I rate it low because personally it is far to potent in its fragrance.</li>
            <li>Especially in the second - fourth month of growth,  it gives a pretty good hold.</li>
            <li>Only thing that should be addressed is the top is too loose and falls off super easily-- just turning the can upside down causes it to fall right off.</li>
            <li>The consistency is just right and melts down in your hand very quickly and and uniform.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong herbal or black licorice smell that people notice right away.</li>
            <li>good hold that lasts a solid 4ish hours before I have to brush the beard down again.</li>
            <li>but I really like the balm, and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Definitely a more mild scent than the original scent ( not that the original is bad) .....</li>
            <li>It games those wild hairs pretty well.</li>
            <li>All in all a decent product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helping it grow faster and better back to its former glory.</li>
            <li>Objectively this product is fantastic as far beard conditioning and control goes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Seems to condition and give me a little more control.  </li>
            <li>This is my new beard wax.</li>
            <li>At first, I  thought it had a powdery smell, and my wife says it smells a lot like Red Cologne by Giorgio Beverly Hills, a cologne from the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>a little strong</li>
            <li>A little strong at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>Given that it is an oily product and has made the tin mildly greasy it is currently to the point that I will likely have to break the tin if I want to get at the product...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft product.</li>
            <li>My beard is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I used the oil to keep it soft and as it grew longer the hair got curly and scraggly.</li>
            <li>Leaves your beard soft and luxurious, without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Made my freedom beard soft and manageable, and my neckline where I shave is no longer irritated.</li>
            <li>and this tin lasted me a pretty long time.  </li>
            <li>This tames your beard and keeps it soft, not greasy, and gives it sufficient hold.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that it is more of a conditioner than a hold for full-bearded folks.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s other balms that give a little more hold, which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li>I would definitely be interested in trying one of the other balms from this company though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Little pricey, but worth it, will buy again.</li>
            <li>The only thing I want now is to continue trying the rest of the products GBS offers.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that the awkward looks vanish the moment they catch a scent of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very herby smell (Other ratings had similar complaints).</li>

            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> If you want a good beard balm, look for one with argan oil and jojoba in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good...</li>
            <li> Does a good job taming the mane.</li>
            <li> They both smell great, but the balm controls my beard better.</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It keeps my beard in tip top shape, softens it, &amp; the wife is happy with how it makes my beard look, feel, &amp; smell.  </li>
            <li> Kind of smells like a spice cabinet (in a good way).</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m really enjoying it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Everyone who has encountered it loves the smell, and I love how it keeps my beard!</li>
            <li> My favorite balm yet!</li>
            <li> Pleasant and better than oil in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; isn&#x27;t too strong of a scent.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and in great condition.  </li>
            <li> A win win all-around.</li>
            <li> Product smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I love the bay rum scent (so does the girlfriend ) but more inportantly the hold is great.</li>
            <li> I could honestly detect the scent after 12 hours.</li>
            <li> really wanted this to be awesome</li>
            <li> It has a nice manly smell to it that starts out</li>
            <li> The smell is great, the wife says it smells like a clean aftershave.  </li>
            <li> This balm helped me transition from a cropped beard to a full beard and greatly increased the manageability of it.</li>
            <li> Answers all emails and questions very easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> Really nice product, smells great and works really nice, exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I ordered this after having used Honest Amish products for over a year.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but isn&#x27;t overly powerful like I felt the Amish products could be.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, it makes both your hair AND your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Came in very quickly!</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome, the consistency of the balm is great, controls very well and my beard feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks it worked great and the smell is amazing</li>
            <li> but this was cheaper and u get way more and honestly works better</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great purchase, thanks!.</li>
            <li> one smelled the best by far, it also did a pretty good job of managing his beard.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Very much enjoyed this product and really enjoyed the scent of it.</li>
            <li> Glad they made a bay rum balm.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> Your wife will love you more for using GBS products.</li>
            <li> And the ladies seem to love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Already ordered more stuff .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grave Before Shave is A LOT better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> The sent is just okay.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the shine</li>
            <li> Just a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent from GBS.</li>
            <li> the scent is awakened once more.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents ever, it reminds me of trips to the barber shop when I was a child after the neck shave and the towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a better beard than most of the world and Grave</li>
            <li> Always sends stickers which my kids love.</li>
            <li> Bought this after using GBS beard oil and falling in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It assists your beard more than it directs it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I treat my beard with the balm for a better &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> The balm had a pleasant smell at first, but became sort of nauseating after a while.</li>
            <li> At first, I LOVED the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great and helps my beard stay soft and tamed!</li>
            <li> It has a great masculine smell that will make your partner want to keep her face in your beard.</li>
            <li> He loved it so much he order another one today.</li>
            <li> Beard is much more tameable and has a unique sshine.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Combs through easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> but but mellows out nicely and leave the beard nice and soft</li>
            <li> I tried Honest Amish, which is arguably the most widely bought and highly rated product here on Amazon, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> First, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best smelling beard ba on market.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a beard balm after many, many years using nothing, just conditioner.</li>
            <li> Works best when the hair is slightly damp</li>
            <li> It is a pleasant aroma that so far has held up.</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps the wayward hairs of his early stage beard under control.</li>
            <li> Helps tame those pesky hairs on my beard and smells great!</li>
            <li> Nice scent keeps my beard soft all day a bit oily at first but settles in nicely</li>
            <li> was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with a grave before shave product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would help make my beard look more crisp and keep the strays under control</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t place that familiar smell...</li>
            <li> It smells great and really helps keep a wild beard under control!</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong at first, and kind of interferes with my coffee in the morning, but it dissipates and is much lighter throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> so it looks clean.</li>
            <li> In summary, it&#x27;s quite fragrant, maybe even too feminine for some noses; it softens, holds, isn&#x27;t greasy, and fades into a clean somewhat powdery smell.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells clean and fades after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find any other bay rum that smells as good as grave before shaves, my wife can&#x27;t stop touching and smelling my beard.</li>
            <li> Now I am hunting for one that has that special scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, for the weekend night outs or special occasions</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this so much.</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping your beard manageable and looking sharp.</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite beard balm.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and makes the beard feel softer and lay a little closer.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but the scent only lasts an hour.</li>
            <li> The scent is by far my favorite out of all the beard bombs.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, which is really all I expected, but it made my beard noticeably filler and tamer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a 5 star on this one,  I really liked the badass beard stuff</li>
            <li> I love the hold and how it leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> Pretty sweet</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in the tin solid, but easily melts with the slightest finger pressure to rub easily into a beard.</li>
            <li> So far so good, the wife says it tames my beard pretty well--havent been using long enough to know how much more it&#x27;ll continue to get better.</li>
            <li> this is the final application it smells like a rum and is absolutely wonderful and keeping all the flyaway of strays down</li>
            <li> Nice smell and decent initial hold, but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> Product was fine but not any better than other waxes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t seem to interested in trying to make the purchase right and were probably aware of the issue.</li>
            <li> I want to like the product, the balm itself does a decent job, however, the tin creates some kind of vacuum seal every time I close it.</li>
            <li> fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I will be getting more in the future, thx.</li>
            <li> I actually like this balm much more that the oil.</li>
            <li> This was the first balm I even bought.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a smell that women seem to love.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve had this problem with balm in these tins.</li>
            <li> It also increased my terminal length by more than two inches before I finally shaved it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of an oil guy than balm dude (their oil with the same smell is exquisite!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that it&#x27;s really easy to apply and isn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s got grape seed oil in it, which is super cheap and has a short shelf life.</li>
            <li> rubs in easily and leaves my beard with a nice, conditioned shine while smoothing down wild hairs.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft, full and keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> The one that is most familiar to me and reminiscent of my younger days when I used Mr. Zoggs Sex wax and that glorious beach and candle like pirate smell.  </li>
            <li> GBS Bay Rum is an awesome balm, great smelling and long lasting without that waxy feel and as long as you don&#x27;t apply too much it does not leave behind a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, does have a strong smell at first, becomes more subtle over time.</li>
            <li> Really tames those unruly hairs without making your beard feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It really softened my beard and the scent lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much for the quality is excellence in a can, that fits your palm.</li>
            <li> However I rate it low because personally it is far to potent in its fragrance.</li>
            <li> Especially in the second - fourth month of growth,  it gives a pretty good hold.</li>
            <li> Only thing that should be addressed is the top is too loose and falls off super easily-- just turning the can upside down causes it to fall right off.</li>
            <li> The consistency is just right and melts down in your hand very quickly and and uniform.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong herbal or black licorice smell that people notice right away.</li>
            <li> good hold that lasts a solid 4ish hours before I have to brush the beard down again.</li>
            <li> but I really like the balm, and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Definitely a more mild scent than the original scent ( not that the original is bad) .....</li>
            <li> It games those wild hairs pretty well.</li>
            <li> All in all a decent product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping it grow faster and better back to its former glory.</li>
            <li> Objectively this product is fantastic as far beard conditioning and control goes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Seems to condition and give me a little more control.  </li>
            <li> This is my new beard wax.</li>
            <li> At first, I  thought it had a powdery smell, and my wife says it smells a lot like Red Cologne by Giorgio Beverly Hills, a cologne from the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> a little strong</li>
            <li> A little strong at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Given that it is an oily product and has made the tin mildly greasy it is currently to the point that I will likely have to break the tin if I want to get at the product...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft product.</li>
            <li> My beard is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I used the oil to keep it soft and as it grew longer the hair got curly and scraggly.</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard soft and luxurious, without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Made my freedom beard soft and manageable, and my neckline where I shave is no longer irritated.</li>
            <li> and this tin lasted me a pretty long time.  </li>
            <li> This tames your beard and keeps it soft, not greasy, and gives it sufficient hold.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it is more of a conditioner than a hold for full-bearded folks.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s other balms that give a little more hold, which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li> I would definitely be interested in trying one of the other balms from this company though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little pricey, but worth it, will buy again.</li>
            <li> The only thing I want now is to continue trying the rest of the products GBS offers.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that the awkward looks vanish the moment they catch a scent of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very herby smell (Other ratings had similar complaints).</li>
            <li> I needed something to keep the wild curly hairs at bay until they are long enough to hold themselves down.</li>
            <li> It did give me a slight rash over the first few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased it from a local tobacco shop, which still is selling it along with other products.  </li>
            <li> It is a little soft</li>
            <li> , it keeps it soft, and makes it a little shiny</li>
            <li> Also, it left a very, very greasy residue in my beard that not only made it feel uncomfortable but also left an unnatural gleam to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone with a long out of control beard</li>
            <li> even using the smallest amount, would make my beard feel greasy for long periods of time</li>
            <li> good hold without feeling like you have crap in your beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve currently got about a 3 month beard and have tried quite a few different balms over the years.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this tin should last a while.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a strange organic funky smell like some of the other beard balms on the market.  </li>
            <li> I was curious about the &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hold is medium to tight depending on how much you use, scent is subtle but you know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> but if you starting out and your below half an inch use the oil i recommend the O.G sent and Bay Rum!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My major complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> After a month+ of use my beard is definitely softer and there&#x27;s no more beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other beard waxes I&#x27;ve bought, this one is my favourite.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every other day and it helps.</li>
            <li> I will try other balms from this company however.</li>
            <li> but I would say some of the other reviews had it correct about a candle</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find yourself the center of attention by ladies everywhere trying to kiss you as they sneak a sniff from your gloriously scented bay rum womb blankey!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it even though my beard is less than half an inch long.</li>
            <li> As usual its tough to get the first application out of the can.  </li>
            <li> scent, as reviewers seemed to like it overall and compared it to the nostalgic aroma of old barber shops.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use this product if I&#x27;m desperate, and my recommendation to you if you decide to buy this is simple; use it fast, otherwise it turns sour.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t switch to other brands anytime soon!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, along with a few other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to try a few other brands...</li>
            <li> Was a little worried with a name Bay Rum that it would smell like coconut.</li>
            <li> Subtle and manly, but remains around for as long as it&#x27;s in your beard.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any of my bearded brothers, hands down!</li>
            <li> It controls my beard, but isn&#x27;t oily or too heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the small size, stuff lasts forever...</li>
            <li> After about a month I noticed that the smell turned ridiculously musky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The neat little tin that it comes in isn&#x27;t a bad bonus either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell bothered me and the wax was difficult to apply compared to others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously &amp;#34;The Bomb&amp;#34;!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this stuff is great.  rubs in easily and leaves my beard with a nice, conditioned shine while smoothing down wild hairs.  i bought the bay rum beard oil a couple months ago and loved the scent, so i decided to try the balm to go with it.  was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice scent keeps my beard soft all day a bit oily at first but settles in nicely I plan to buy more</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but the scent only lasts an hour. Easy to apply. It&#x27;s a soft product. Combs through easily. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> When smelling like the Carribean is a necessity. Beard is much more tameable and has a unique sshine. The scent is by far my favorite out of all the beard bombs.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Not too greasy. Beard feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Also great if you have a smelly co-worker. Have yet to find someone over-power the smell barrier it creates.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with a grave before shave product. Works just like it should. My beard is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this. However I rate it low because personally it is far to potent in its fragrance. Smells like a Yankee doodle candle shop.</li>
            <li> Definitely a more mild scent than the original scent ( not that the original is bad) ..... good hold that lasts a solid 4ish hours before I have to brush the beard down again. After a month+ of use my beard is definitely softer and there&#x27;s no more beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> I love Grave Before Shave!!!! When my beard was shorter I used the oil to keep it soft and as it grew longer the hair got curly and scraggly. This tamed my mane. It smells just like the Bay Rum beard oil. I recommend this to anyone with a long out of control beard but if you starting out and your below half an inch use the oil i recommend the O.G sent and Bay Rum!</li>
            <li> Very much enjoyed this product and really enjoyed the scent of it. Not to overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Great product.Keeps my beard soft, full and keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, does have a strong smell at first, becomes more subtle over time.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars however since this is the 1st heard balm I&#x27;ve ever used, I have nothing to compare it to. Great product and fast shipping! GRAVE BEFORE SHAVE!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Glad they made a bay rum balm.</li>
            <li> Best beard stuff I got. Pleasant and better than oil in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My wife and kids love the smell. I like to take with me  when I go on trips instead of oil. No worries of a spill in my bag.</li>
            <li> Product was fine but not any better than other waxes I&#x27;ve used. I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about on their scent but it didn&#x27;t smell like bay rum.  It has a very herby smell (Other ratings had similar complaints). I emailed the company and they appologized but left it at that. They didn&#x27;t seem to interested in trying to make the purchase right and were probably aware of the issue. It will be the last product I purchase from them.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other beard waxes I&#x27;ve bought, this one is my favourite. It&#x27;s pliable on the fingernail, melts with just a few rubs on the palm, apply and you&#x27;re ready to go. Hold is medium to tight depending on how much you use, scent is subtle but you know it&#x27;s there. Makes the goat easier to manage. Great purchase, thanks!.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m all waxed up and have everything in place this is the final application it smells like a rum and is absolutely wonderful and keeping all the flyaway of strays down I&#x27;ll buy it again and</li>
            <li> Buy this, you won&#x27;t regret. Don&#x27;t be put off by the small size, stuff lasts forever... Little pricey, but worth it, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff. Not to over powering and keeps my beard under control. A little goes a long way so this tin should last a while.</li>
            <li> This was my second product I have a purchased from Grave Before Shave and I must say I&#x27;m really enjoying it! Helps tame those pesky hairs on my beard and smells great!</li>
            <li> He loved it so much he order another one today. It makes his beard softer and it smells good (to both him and I). It&#x27;s easier to him to manage his beard. A win win all-around.</li>
            <li> great product! fast shipping! smells of a traditional musky barber shop product... I like the smell and the product works great!</li>
            <li> Smells great and helps my beard stay soft and tamed!</li>
            <li> Product smells really nice. There&#x27;s other balms that give a little more hold, which is what I prefer. I doubt I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works well for a medium hold</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I ordered this after having used Honest Amish products for over a year. This is my new beard wax. It smells great, but isn&#x27;t overly powerful like I felt the Amish products could be. It controls my beard, but isn&#x27;t oily or too heavy. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is nice wig my fly aways!! It is a little soft so it doesn&#x27;t keep them all in check. But I&#x27;m ok with that. I like the softness that I get from it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It tames the fly away hairs, gives a nice sheen, and smells amazing! On top of that it&#x27;s really easy to apply and isn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
            <li> great product, tames the monster when needed, smells great,I have many G.B.S products can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Great performing products</li>
            <li> Hands down the best smelling beard ba on market. Leaves your beard soft and luxurious, without feeling greasy. Your wife will love you more for using GBS products.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a beard balm after many, many years using nothing, just conditioner. I love it! Keeps that &amp;#34;combed&amp;#34; neat look for hours. Now I am hunting for one that has that special scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this so much. I put this in my beard all the time, just for the smell. And it does help soften my beard. I have a new favorite beard balm. I will be getting more in the future, thx. And the ladies seem to love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> GBS Bay Rum is an awesome balm, great smelling and long lasting without that waxy feel and as long as you don&#x27;t apply too much it does not leave behind a greasy residue. I would recommend this to any of my bearded brothers, hands down!</li>
            <li> Came in very quickly! (3 days on standard shipping). Product smells great, but not overpowering. It has a great masculine smell that will make your partner want to keep her face in your beard. Made my freedom beard soft and manageable, and my neckline where I shave is no longer irritated. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would help make my beard look more crisp and keep the strays under control but it did no such thing. However it does smell really good, it keeps it soft, and makes it a little shiny so it looks clean. All in all a decent product.</li>
            <li> Not oily and great smell!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Smells great</li>
            <li> Thanks it worked great and the smell is amazing</li>
            <li> This balm helped me transition from a cropped beard to a full beard and greatly increased the manageability of it. It did give me a slight rash over the first few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this stuff is up to par. Makes your beard noticeably softer and the smell is pleasant. Kind of smells like a spice cabinet (in a good way). My only complaint would be that it is more of a conditioner than a hold for full-bearded folks. This is simply preferential though. A+ stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and decent initial hold, but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, which is really all I expected, but it made my beard noticeably filler and tamer.</li>
            <li> This smells freaking awesome!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Smells great</li>
            <li> Everyone who has encountered it loves the smell, and I love how it keeps my beard! This stuff rocks, and you get STICKERS!!!!</li>
            <li> Has a great smell.  A little strong at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.  Seems to condition and give me a little more control.  My beard is around 6 inches and this tin lasted me a pretty long time.  Give it a try it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Well if this isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff ever. Spices, spices, spices.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in the tin solid, but easily melts with the slightest finger pressure to rub easily into a beard.</li>
            <li> I scoured the internet to find the best beard balm and I figured that I&#x27;d give this a try. At first, I LOVED the smell. That was a big selling point for me. I didn&#x27;t want to smell musky or like a pine tree. After about a month I noticed that the smell turned ridiculously musky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did some research...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got grape seed oil in it, which is super cheap and has a short shelf life. If you want a good beard balm, look for one with argan oil and jojoba in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use this product if I&#x27;m desperate, and my recommendation to you if you decide to buy this is simple; use it fast, otherwise it turns sour.</li>
            <li> This tames your beard and keeps it soft, not greasy, and gives it sufficient hold.  I was curious about the &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; scent, as reviewers seemed to like it overall and compared it to the nostalgic aroma of old barber shops.  At first, I  thought it had a powdery smell, and my wife says it smells a lot like Red Cologne by Giorgio Beverly Hills, a cologne from the 90&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve grown to like to this smell.  The smell is quite strong at first, and kind of interferes with my coffee in the morning, but it dissipates and is much lighter throughout the day.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a strange organic funky smell like some of the other beard balms on the market.  In summary, it&#x27;s quite fragrant, maybe even too feminine for some noses; it softens, holds, isn&#x27;t greasy, and fades into a clean somewhat powdery smell.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Definitely a 5 star on this one,  I really liked the badass beard stuff but this was cheaper and u get way more and honestly works better I love it and my wife does to</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping your beard manageable and looking sharp. Works best when the hair is slightly damp</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Easy to use. Love it. Already ordered more stuff . Next is the pine scent.</li>
            <li> So, I have been searching for quite some time to find the perfect beard balm/conditioner. I tried Honest Amish, which is arguably the most widely bought and highly rated product here on Amazon, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed. The balm had a pleasant smell at first, but became sort of nauseating after a while. Also, it left a very, very greasy residue in my beard that not only made it feel uncomfortable but also left an unnatural gleam to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grave Before Shave is A LOT better. First, the smell is amazing. Subtle and manly, but remains around for as long as it&#x27;s in your beard. It also isn&#x27;t overly greasy. What&#x27;s more, it makes both your hair AND your skin feel amazing. The neat little tin that it comes in isn&#x27;t a bad bonus either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who smells it loves it. I&#x27;ve sort of become the weirdo who tells anyone close enough to lean in and smell my beard. The good thing is that the awkward looks vanish the moment they catch a scent of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found my permanent beard balm! The only thing I want now is to continue trying the rest of the products GBS offers.</li>
            <li> The best! Love the smell. Works great too.</li>
            <li> I actually like this balm much more that the oil. They both smell great, but the balm controls my beard better. I imagine it depends on the beard. Also, this is the only balm I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very good like the smell.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works great! Really tames those unruly hairs without making your beard feel greasy. The smell is great and makes the beard feel softer and lay a little closer.</li>
            <li> This works well.  I have been using this every other day and it helps. The sent is just okay.</li>
            <li> Really nice product, smells great and works really nice, exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This beard balm is the balm. My husband is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was the first balm I even bought. I actually purchased it from a local tobacco shop, which still is selling it along with other products.  I love the bay rum scent (so does the girlfriend ) but more inportantly the hold is great. Especially in the second - fourth month of growth,  it gives a pretty good hold. I have the oil and mustache wax  but I really like the balm, and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great!</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great, love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite balm yet! I love the scent and the shine this stuff provides!</li>
            <li> Perfect to clip on to baby car seat and stroller.  Very happy with purchase and quality.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this product.  Smells good and keeps the wayward hairs of his early stage beard under control.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried with a name Bay Rum that it would smell like coconut. Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t. Just a nice light scent. So far so good, the wife says it tames my beard pretty well--havent been using long enough to know how much more it&#x27;ll continue to get better. Only thing that should be addressed is the top is too loose and falls off super easily-- just turning the can upside down causes it to fall right off. When you put it in your travel bag it always falls off. So you may have to address that yourself after you get the can.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, works well. My wife loves it. A+</li>
            <li> My favorite scent from GBS. Works great &amp; isn&#x27;t too strong of a scent.  It keeps my beard in tip top shape, softens it, &amp; the wife is happy with how it makes my beard look, feel, &amp; smell.  *Side note* Every order I&#x27;ve placed has come with GBS stickers that I have been putting on everything.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously &amp;#34;The Bomb&amp;#34;!!!!!! It really softened my beard and the scent lingers for hours. Every time I readjust my beard the scent is awakened once more. I could honestly detect the scent after 12 hours. One of my favorite scents ever, it reminds me of trips to the barber shop when I was a child after the neck shave and the towel. The barber splashed this on and it just made me feel &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; all day!</li>
            <li> I love the hold and how it leaves your hair soft. It games those wild hairs pretty well. My major complaint is the smell. It has a strong herbal or black licorice smell that people notice right away. You can&#x27;t wear cologne or anything else because it will clash. I will try other balms from this company however.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Wife loves the smell so we have a 5 star winner!  This reminds me of surf wax.  I can&#x27;t place that familiar smell... but I would say some of the other reviews had it correct about a candle shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally it reminds me of surfboard wax.  The one that is most familiar to me and reminiscent of my younger days when I used Mr. Zoggs Sex wax and that glorious beach and candle like pirate smell.  That&#x27;s the best I can describe it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a smell that women seem to love.  You&#x27;ll find yourself the center of attention by ladies everywhere trying to kiss you as they sneak a sniff from your gloriously scented bay rum womb blankey!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a better beard than most of the world and Grave Before Shave helps me manage the all  attention in luxury.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Owner is awesome. Always sends stickers which my kids love. Answers all emails and questions very easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> I want to like the product, the balm itself does a decent job, however, the tin creates some kind of vacuum seal every time I close it. Given that it is an oily product and has made the tin mildly greasy it is currently to the point that I will likely have to break the tin if I want to get at the product... First time I&#x27;ve had this problem with balm in these tins. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find any other bay rum that smells as good as grave before shaves, my wife can&#x27;t stop touching and smelling my beard. Pretty sweet</li>
            <li> Bought this after using GBS beard oil and falling in love with it. I needed something to keep the wild curly hairs at bay until they are long enough to hold themselves down. I love this stuff. Smells good... good hold without feeling like you have crap in your beard.</li>
            <li> even using the smallest amount, would make my beard feel greasy for long periods of time</li>
            <li> Smells great. Does a good job taming the mane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this wax. The smell bothered me and the wax was difficult to apply compared to others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to be awesome but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two weeks and it made a world of difference. The scent smells clean and fades after an hour or so. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have waited a tell the end of my tin before leaving this review. It has a nice manly smell to it that starts out a little strong but but mellows out nicely and leave the beard nice and soft</li>
            <li> Just received this yesterday, so my review will be short.  Product arrived very quickly and in great condition.  As usual its tough to get the first application out of the can.  The consistency is just right and melts down in your hand very quickly and and uniform.  The smell is great, the wife says it smells like a clean aftershave.  It is a pleasant aroma that so far has held up.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It smells amazing and it holds my style perfectly. It assists your beard more than it directs it. If you want to do fancy moustache curls look somewhere else. It also increased my terminal length by more than two inches before I finally shaved it off. I&#x27;m still using it even though my beard is less than half an inch long. It&#x27;s helping it grow faster and better back to its former glory.</li>
            <li> Item arrived today. The smell is awesome, the consistency of the balm is great, controls very well and my beard feels nice and soft. Will update the review as I get further into the tin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It smells great and really helps keep a wild beard under control!</li>
            <li> After trying out several beard products and especially GBS products. I came to the conclusion I&#x27;m more of an oil guy than balm dude (their oil with the same smell is exquisite!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for the weekend night outs or special occasions I treat my beard with the balm for a better &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is man! The feel is man! And the look is man! You don&#x27;t need much for the quality is excellence in a can, that fits your palm. I won&#x27;t switch to other brands anytime soon!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, along with a few other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smelled the best by far, it also did a pretty good job of managing his beard.</li>
            <li> Best beard balm! I love the smell of it. I am going to try a few other brands...but I&#x27;ve been using GBS products for bout 2 years now. Beard on brothers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve currently got about a 3 month beard and have tried quite a few different balms over the years. Objectively this product is fantastic as far beard conditioning and control goes. The only reason I cannot fully endorse this balm is that I&#x27;m not fully sold on the scent and my girlfriend can&#x27;t stand the smell of it which is always the subjective risk in scented balms. I would definitely be interested in trying one of the other balms from this company though.&lt;br /&gt;Beard on.</li>
