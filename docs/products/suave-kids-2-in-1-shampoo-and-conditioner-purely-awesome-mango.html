            <li>great for kids</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re used to the bed time Johnson and Johnson, so nothing will ever match up that wonderful smell, but he seems to be okay with this.</li>
            <li>While I found the scent reasonably pleasant, I would prefer an unscented product.</li>
            <li>Good quality, good deal.</li>
            <li>The price from Amazon is a good one as well.</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner does a good job of cleansing and detangling my hair.  </li>
            <li>thought it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>and so do my wife and I. 2 in one is always a good thing.</li>
            <li>Keep it away from the eyes is always good advice</li>
            <li>My daughter loved the bottle and the smell.</li>
            <li>, he had nice squeaky clean hair and he smelled great!  </li>
            <li>Suave Kids is a nice line of products that produces a pleasant smell and a safe treatment for kids and adults alike.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent quite a bit, so no complaints there.</li>
            <li>but it still is an effective shampoo.</li>
            <li>Her hair feels silky and looks nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great clean smell and cleans the body well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But it does a good job, lathers well and rinses out about as easy as any.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for an almost 4 year old boy that doesn&#x27;t want to smell like &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; shampoo!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good value and a shampoo/conditioner combo that gets the job done, this shampoo &amp; conditioner will do just fine.  </li>
            <li>This smells great not fruity more \\&quot;clean and soapy\\</li>
            <li>It has a good lather and leaves the hair shiny and smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>so they go through a bottle of this size very quickly!</li>
            <li>We loved the shape of the bottle - easy to hold and easy to pour.</li>
            <li>The bottle is easy to grip, the solution is not too aqueous to run out the bottle but not too gel like to be a touch squeeze, it also lathers nicely and gets into the hair.</li>
            <li>My kids love the smell of this</li>
            <li>kids love it</li>
            <li>Better buy without having to fight Walmart crowds.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure this is the case, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>this is a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll go through these 6 bottles in no time.</li>
            <li>I love this for my toddler.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo with conditioner has a strong but pleasant fresh fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just a good, simple, safe shampoo that provides a good change of pace on occasion to my shower routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy for kids to squeeze the dickens out of it and end up with way more product than they&#x27;d need in a week.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is tear free and hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li>This easy to use shampoo and conditioner smells pretty good (but not overpowering) and gets your hair clean.</li>
            <li>It also washes out easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This one has a nice scent that smells clean and fresh without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>shampoo is okay in a pinch as it will get your kid&#x27;s hair clean, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the SLS, strong fragrance and dye and don&#x27;t feel great about having my kid use this 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner regularly.</li>
            <li>It lathered up  just fine, which was a plus.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works fine inasmuch as it cleans my kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Despite the scent, it does leave hair soft, rinses out reasonably easy, and works fairly well at helping to prevent tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottle claims to be tear free.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s truly tear free or not.</li>
            <li>But it does contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLS), which can be an eye and skin irritant and is basically a cheap detergent.</li>
            <li>Even with non-tear free shampoos, I&#x27;ve never felt that sort of burning.</li>
            <li>The scent is not offensive and the cleaning capabilities are very good with little discomfort to the kids.  </li>
            <li>shampoo is close to ideal for my everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling nicely conditioned, and it was easy to brush through.  </li>
            <li>We have not used it on the baby yet because we are sticking with fragrance free for right now.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is bold, but clean and fresh and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I could definitely go for something more refreshing and universal, but overall a good, reasonable price for a good product.</li>
            <li>As pretty as this made my hair, I would NEVER use this on a child!</li>
            <li>Currently we&#x27;ve been using the Honest all-in-one cleanser which smells like a creamsicle and is more natural.  </li>
            <li>This 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner is really nice as it removes the extra step of adding separate conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am going to assume that whatever is in this that just he is sensitive to because I see so many reviewers not mentioning it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner all-in-one product is one of those things a busy mom (or grandma) can love.  </li>
            <li>In our case, our granddaughter is still too young to wash her own hair, so it is not as much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those of us who use children&#x27;s products on our own hair and also wear glasses, I prefer easy to use pump containers that are also easy to see without corrective lenses, so while the color of the container is great, the lid is a pain with wet hands and poor vision.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the scent, which was kind of middle of the road in strength.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use and left me feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>The scent is sweet, and it lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>I like the Suave 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner - it has a pleasant smell, works well to clean my children&#x27;s fine hair and leave just enough moisture without loading it down.  </li>
            <li>I tried this out on our little one with the most challenging hair.  </li>
            <li>and my son is really big into smelling everything, so he&#x27;s constantly &amp;#34;sharing&amp;#34; that joy, and the beachy-perfumey scent just gets a bit.</li>
            <li>My son who is normally fine with shampoo and conditioner, started screaming that it was burning and his eyes were clearly irritated.  </li>
            <li>First of all they like the smell, since it is not &#x60;girly&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I like it and will be looking into it further for more shampoo and conditioner needs.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large but easy to handle by the supervising adult.  </li>
            <li>Both my kids&#x27; hair is clean and soft as well.</li>
            <li>The light blue tint makes it look fresh</li>
            <li>This is a good option that actually can be used by all ages at a pool shower, so it is a big hit in this household.  </li>
            <li>It’s very gentle, barely fragranced, and it leaves my hair clean.</li>
            <li>one works alright, pretty much on par with the others.  </li>
            <li>I have never met a shampoo that is tear free and this is no exception, in fact it is not as gentle as some other tear free shampoos we have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes a lot of lather, which the youngsters certainly seem to enjoy, and if it gets in their eyes, it is relatively non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for conditioning the hair there really seems to be no noticeable difference</li>
            <li>My kids really like this 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product made combing out afterward much easier.  </li>
            <li>I do think they could have improved the dispensing part because I can see kids using way too much (parents too),</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this shampoo, and having six bottles of it means that we don&#x27;t have to worry about having to get more any time in the near future.</li>
            <li>I prefer the products with more natural ingredients, especially for the children.  </li>
            <li>and it is easier to use as far as getting the right quantity of product.</li>
            <li>I would personally purchase as I would rather pay more for a more natural product for my developing child and just teach him to use less.</li>
            <li>This was our first &amp;#34;big boy&amp;#34; shampoo for our son, and he seems to like it so far.</li>
            <li>My wife did not use it as much as I did, but the few times she did, she said it was okay, but</li>
            <li>To make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, I used it the next day on myself, purposefully rinsed my hair from back to front and lo and behold, the burning in my eyes began.</li>
            <li>Nice, not really conditioning enough, but it works well, a lot bubble.</li>
            <li>For a child, it would be worse, and they are apt to end up with far more shampoo than is actually necessary.  </li>
            <li>I have a 10 year old son who wants tear-free shampoo but does not want to smell like a fruit or a baby.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice without being rude about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, not really identifiable as any one specific thing, and is less overwhelming than the watermelon smell in the other version we have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stands on its head just fine, but as with their other bottles I&#x27;ve had, the opening is a bit aggressive.  </li>
            <li>It has been several hours since I&#x27;ve rinsed the suds out of my eyes, and I&#x27;m sitting her, with my eyes still burning (and the sight out of my right eye is blurry).  </li>
            <li>Suave is a brand that even in their adult products pays particular attention to user friendliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and found myself opting to use it daily in place of other choices that I have.</li>
            <li>Although we do not have children at home, my wife and I are well familiar with products such as these, as with her sensitive skin and my liking to make a “clean break” from my usual shower products, we often buy shampoos and shower gels that are gentle enough to be targeted for kids.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d change is the smell - I remember much nicer scents like strawberry, watermelon, blueberry -</li>
            <li>I have alos used this for my 3 year old daughter and she likes the scent as well.</li>
            <li>Suave offers a variety of for kids, including some “funpacks” with assorted scents.</li>
            <li>It works well and leaves hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves it feeling soft, so thumbs up there.</li>
            <li>I personally would rather pay more for a brand with quality natural ingredients (such as Shampoozle by MILK) and teach my kid to use less to conserve on cost.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a decent product for both kids and adults.</li>
            <li>; some suds fall down into my eyes (the way a child who&#x27;s only excited about the bubbles in his/her hair might do).  </li>
            <li>I slightly prefer this scent and my 5 year old slightly prefers the more &#x27;tropical&amp;#34; smelling Suave 2-in-1</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>For average hair that is not very thick or tangled, this 2 in 1 option works very well.</li>
            <li>It really is tear free, didn&#x27;t bother his eyes when he tested that feature for me (after a hefty bribe of some extra video game time).  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s old enough that he hasn&#x27;t gotten it in his eyes, so</li>
            <li>she did like that it left her hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Given that Suave Kids is pretty typical of drugstore shampoos, I&#x27;m giving it three stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m baffled as to what makes a product &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; given that this one is yet it contains the typical low end ingredients, like SLS, cheap fragrance and dye, used in other drugstore shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I like the Suave 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner - it has a pleasant smell, works well to clean my children&#x27;s fine hair and leave just enough moisture without loading it down.  </li>
            <li> I tried this out on our little one with the most challenging hair.  </li>
            <li> and my son is really big into smelling everything, so he&#x27;s constantly &amp;#34;sharing&amp;#34; that joy, and the beachy-perfumey scent just gets a bit.</li>
            <li> My son who is normally fine with shampoo and conditioner, started screaming that it was burning and his eyes were clearly irritated.  </li>
            <li> First of all they like the smell, since it is not &#x60;girly&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I like it and will be looking into it further for more shampoo and conditioner needs.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large but easy to handle by the supervising adult.  </li>
            <li> Both my kids&#x27; hair is clean and soft as well.</li>
            <li> The light blue tint makes it look fresh</li>
            <li> This is a good option that actually can be used by all ages at a pool shower, so it is a big hit in this household.  </li>
            <li> It’s very gentle, barely fragranced, and it leaves my hair clean.</li>
            <li> one works alright, pretty much on par with the others.  </li>
            <li> I have never met a shampoo that is tear free and this is no exception, in fact it is not as gentle as some other tear free shampoos we have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes a lot of lather, which the youngsters certainly seem to enjoy, and if it gets in their eyes, it is relatively non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for conditioning the hair there really seems to be no noticeable difference</li>
            <li> My kids really like this 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product made combing out afterward much easier.  </li>
            <li> I do think they could have improved the dispensing part because I can see kids using way too much (parents too),</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this shampoo, and having six bottles of it means that we don&#x27;t have to worry about having to get more any time in the near future.</li>
            <li> I prefer the products with more natural ingredients, especially for the children.  </li>
            <li> and it is easier to use as far as getting the right quantity of product.</li>
            <li> I would personally purchase as I would rather pay more for a more natural product for my developing child and just teach him to use less.</li>
            <li> This was our first &amp;#34;big boy&amp;#34; shampoo for our son, and he seems to like it so far.</li>
            <li> My wife did not use it as much as I did, but the few times she did, she said it was okay, but</li>
            <li> To make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, I used it the next day on myself, purposefully rinsed my hair from back to front and lo and behold, the burning in my eyes began.</li>
            <li> Nice, not really conditioning enough, but it works well, a lot bubble.</li>
            <li> For a child, it would be worse, and they are apt to end up with far more shampoo than is actually necessary.  </li>
            <li> I have a 10 year old son who wants tear-free shampoo but does not want to smell like a fruit or a baby.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice without being rude about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, not really identifiable as any one specific thing, and is less overwhelming than the watermelon smell in the other version we have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stands on its head just fine, but as with their other bottles I&#x27;ve had, the opening is a bit aggressive.  </li>
            <li> It has been several hours since I&#x27;ve rinsed the suds out of my eyes, and I&#x27;m sitting her, with my eyes still burning (and the sight out of my right eye is blurry).  </li>
            <li> Suave is a brand that even in their adult products pays particular attention to user friendliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it and found myself opting to use it daily in place of other choices that I have.</li>
            <li> Although we do not have children at home, my wife and I are well familiar with products such as these, as with her sensitive skin and my liking to make a “clean break” from my usual shower products, we often buy shampoos and shower gels that are gentle enough to be targeted for kids.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d change is the smell - I remember much nicer scents like strawberry, watermelon, blueberry -</li>
            <li> I have alos used this for my 3 year old daughter and she likes the scent as well.</li>
            <li> Suave offers a variety of for kids, including some “funpacks” with assorted scents.</li>
            <li> It works well and leaves hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves it feeling soft, so thumbs up there.</li>
            <li> I personally would rather pay more for a brand with quality natural ingredients (such as Shampoozle by MILK) and teach my kid to use less to conserve on cost.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a decent product for both kids and adults.</li>
            <li> ; some suds fall down into my eyes (the way a child who&#x27;s only excited about the bubbles in his/her hair might do).  </li>
            <li> I slightly prefer this scent and my 5 year old slightly prefers the more &#x27;tropical&amp;#34; smelling Suave 2-in-1</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> For average hair that is not very thick or tangled, this 2 in 1 option works very well.</li>
            <li> It really is tear free, didn&#x27;t bother his eyes when he tested that feature for me (after a hefty bribe of some extra video game time).  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s old enough that he hasn&#x27;t gotten it in his eyes, so</li>
            <li> she did like that it left her hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Given that Suave Kids is pretty typical of drugstore shampoos, I&#x27;m giving it three stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled as to what makes a product &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; given that this one is yet it contains the typical low end ingredients, like SLS, cheap fragrance and dye, used in other drugstore shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I thought there seemed to be a slight residue, possibly from the built in conditioner, but the next few times I used it, I got a cleaner rinse.</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t condition like my expensive dedicated conditioner, but it is easy to use one product, especially with kids who don&#x27;t like spending a long time in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans well and helps prevent long hair from tangling.</li>
            <li> Suave Kids is also heavily fragranced (a perfume I personally dislike) and contains red and blue dye among other things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing outstanding, nothing bad, just solid four star performance.</li>
            <li> I do not know if we got a bad batch, but my child was screaming at the top of their lungs.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this shampoo works from our babies to the 6 year old.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Love these but hate all the added chemicals and coloring</li>
            <li> I signed this up for subscribe and save and at less than $1 per bottle</li>
            <li> But it does little as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> It says tear-free, but my son did say it bothered his eyes a little.</li>
            <li> She has a lion&#x27;s mane (lots of hair) and it is not easily manageable.  </li>
            <li> Usually, my eyes will sting and burn until the shampoo is rinsed out of my eyes, but not this.  </li>
            <li> that we&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> However, it is not &amp;#34;tear free&amp;#34;, at least in our house it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was our first &amp;#34;big boy&amp;#34; shampoo for our son, and he seems to like it so far. We&#x27;re used to the bed time Johnson and Johnson, so nothing will ever match up that wonderful smell, but he seems to be okay with this. It works well, and the 2-in-1 is great for boys so you know they are both cleaning and conditioning their hair. The only thing I&#x27;d change is the smell - I remember much nicer scents like strawberry, watermelon, blueberry - and my son is really big into smelling everything, so he&#x27;s constantly &amp;#34;sharing&amp;#34; that joy, and the beachy-perfumey scent just gets a bit. I could definitely go for something more refreshing and universal, but overall a good, reasonable price for a good product.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this shampoo, and having six bottles of it means that we don&#x27;t have to worry about having to get more any time in the near future. Good quality, good deal.</li>
            <li> I got this so we would not have to rinse my 2 year daughter&#x27;s hair twice. But it does little as a conditioner. I still have to use conditioner.</li>
            <li> What a great price for these. Ours came with the smurfs on them not like the picture shows, but my son doesn&#x27;t care and neither do I. This smells great not fruity more \\&quot;clean and soapy\\&quot; fragrance. It also washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I have a 10 year old son who wants tear-free shampoo but does not want to smell like a fruit or a baby.  This one has a nice scent that smells clean and fresh without being overpowering.  My son likes using this one and has had no problems with it hurting his eyes.  I have alos used this for my 3 year old daughter and she likes the scent as well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and does a wonderful job of washing and conditioning my child&#x27;s hair.The price from Amazon is a good one as well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner does a good job of cleansing and detangling my hair.  However, since it is touted as &amp;#34;tear-free&amp;#34; I decided to test it out.  I &amp;#34;let&amp;#34; some suds fall down into my eyes (the way a child who&#x27;s only excited about the bubbles in his/her hair might do).  I&#x27;ve accidentally got shampoo in my eyes before, but it has NEVER hurt as bad as this Suave Kids shampoo conditioner.  Usually, my eyes will sting and burn until the shampoo is rinsed out of my eyes, but not this.  It has been several hours since I&#x27;ve rinsed the suds out of my eyes, and I&#x27;m sitting her, with my eyes still burning (and the sight out of my right eye is blurry).  Suave should be ashamed of themselves, calling this a kids product!  As pretty as this made my hair, I would NEVER use this on a child!</li>
            <li> Both my children and I tried out this product, which had some pros and cons. The first thing I noticed was the scent, which was kind of middle of the road in strength. I liked the scent quite a bit, so no complaints there. One thing I did notice is that there are some chemicals in it. I prefer the products with more natural ingredients, especially for the children.  It lathered up  just fine, which was a plus. Suave does have a similar product that is also a body wash - this was just a the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it worked fairly well. Of course it doesn&#x27;t condition like my expensive dedicated conditioner, but it is easy to use one product, especially with kids who don&#x27;t like spending a long time in the shower. It is quick and easy to use and left me feeling clean.  It says tear-free, but my son did say it bothered his eyes a little. Overall, it is a decent product for both kids and adults.</li>
            <li> My kids love the smell of this and so do my wife and I. 2 in one is always a good thing. Saves money from having to buy both bottles at the store. On a marketing standpoint I like the colors and design of the bottle-it is an eye catcher especially if you are at the store trying to decide which one to buy this one stands out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids love it so we are happy!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is acceptable to my grandsons. First of all they like the smell, since it is not &#x60;girly&#x27;. They also like the bottle with the ribbed sides, making it easier to hold even if your hands are soapy and also the neat stingray on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle claims to be tear free. I have never met a shampoo that is tear free and this is no exception, in fact it is not as gentle as some other tear free shampoos we have used. Keep it away from the eyes is always good advice&lt;br /&gt;As for conditioning the hair there really seems to be no noticeable difference but it still is an effective shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like the Suave 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner - it has a pleasant smell, works well to clean my children&#x27;s fine hair and leave just enough moisture without loading it down.  For younger kids, an all-in-one product (including body wash) is a bit easier.  Currently we&#x27;ve been using the Honest all-in-one cleanser which smells like a creamsicle and is more natural.  However that product is significantly more expensive.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good value and a shampoo/conditioner combo that gets the job done, this shampoo &amp; conditioner will do just fine.  I slightly prefer this scent and my 5 year old slightly prefers the more &#x27;tropical&amp;#34; smelling Suave 2-in-1 that we&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> This 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner is really nice as it removes the extra step of adding separate conditioner.  The scent is sweet, and it lathers really well.  It left my hair feeling nicely conditioned, and it was easy to brush through.  This is a really good product, if you are looking for a combination cleaner!</li>
            <li> This is another trusted product in our family that we have used throughout the years. This combination product has a delicious smell for kids.  It has a good lather and leaves the hair shiny and smooth feeling.  I love the fact that it is tear free and hypoallergenic.  The bottle is an attractive turquoise color that will draw kids to it on the shelf.  The fragrance works for both boys and girls.  Suave offers a variety of for kids, including some “funpacks” with assorted scents.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works fine inasmuch as it cleans my kid&#x27;s hair. He&#x27;s old enough that he hasn&#x27;t gotten it in his eyes, so I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s truly tear free or not. But it does contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLS), which can be an eye and skin irritant and is basically a cheap detergent. Suave Kids is also heavily fragranced (a perfume I personally dislike) and contains red and blue dye among other things. I&#x27;m baffled as to what makes a product &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; given that this one is yet it contains the typical low end ingredients, like SLS, cheap fragrance and dye, used in other drugstore shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is okay in a pinch as it will get your kid&#x27;s hair clean, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the SLS, strong fragrance and dye and don&#x27;t feel great about having my kid use this 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner regularly. I personally would rather pay more for a brand with quality natural ingredients (such as Shampoozle by MILK) and teach my kid to use less to conserve on cost. Given that Suave Kids is pretty typical of drugstore shampoos, I&#x27;m giving it three stars. But it&#x27;s not a shampoo/conditioner I would personally purchase as I would rather pay more for a more natural product for my developing child and just teach him to use less.</li>
            <li> My kids really like this 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. It allows them to take quicker showers and it smells great. I just wish that it came in a bigger bottle; I have three kids so they go through a bottle of this size very quickly!</li>
            <li> Although we do not have children at home, my wife and I are well familiar with products such as these, as with her sensitive skin and my liking to make a “clean break” from my usual shower products, we often buy shampoos and shower gels that are gentle enough to be targeted for kids. Suave is a brand that even in their adult products pays particular attention to user friendliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is close to ideal for my everyday shampoo. It’s very gentle, barely fragranced, and it leaves my hair clean. The first time I used it, I thought there seemed to be a slight residue, possibly from the built in conditioner, but the next few times I used it, I got a cleaner rinse. It left my hair soft and natural looking. My wife did not use it as much as I did, but the few times she did, she said it was okay, but she did like that it left her hair feeling soft. The light blue tint makes it look fresh and it is easier to use as far as getting the right quantity of product. This is just a good, simple, safe shampoo that provides a good change of pace on occasion to my shower routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing outstanding, nothing bad, just solid four star performance.</li>
            <li> Better buy without having to fight Walmart crowds.  My 3 children have been using this shampoo for years.</li>
            <li> ...delivered to our door!  Seriously, this shampoo works from our babies to the 6 year old.  It smells nice but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Although Suave is a trusted brand in our house, the Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner missed the mark for us.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like it. It works well and leaves hair soft and manageable.  The fragrance is bold, but clean and fresh and not overpowering.  However, it is not &amp;#34;tear free&amp;#34;, at least in our house it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My son who is normally fine with shampoo and conditioner, started screaming that it was burning and his eyes were clearly irritated.  I am going to assume that whatever is in this that just he is sensitive to because I see so many reviewers not mentioning it.  No one else in the family had a problem either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Other than that, he had nice squeaky clean hair and he smelled great!  We loved the shape of the bottle - easy to hold and easy to pour.</li>
            <li> great for kids and they can use themselves.</li>
            <li> Used this and it burned my child&#x27;s eyes. (Surfs up scene) I do not know if we got a bad batch, but my child was screaming at the top of their lungs. To make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, I used it the next day on myself, purposefully rinsed my hair from back to front and lo and behold, the burning in my eyes began. Even with non-tear free shampoos, I&#x27;ve never felt that sort of burning. Will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I tried this out on our little one with the most challenging hair.  She has a lion&#x27;s mane (lots of hair) and it is not easily manageable.  This product made combing out afterward much easier.  I didn&#x27;t get any in her eyes so can&#x27;t attest to the &amp;#34;tear free&amp;#34; aspect of it but knowing Suave products, I&#x27;m sure this is the case, as advertised.  Her hair feels silky and looks nice.  Great product for kids!</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner all-in-one product is one of those things a busy mom (or grandma) can love.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to use.  While I found the scent reasonably pleasant, I would prefer an unscented product. Despite the scent, it does leave hair soft, rinses out reasonably easy, and works fairly well at helping to prevent tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer mentioned, the container isn&#x27;t the easiest to use to dispense the product. For those of us who use children&#x27;s products on our own hair and also wear glasses, I prefer easy to use pump containers that are also easy to see without corrective lenses, so while the color of the container is great, the lid is a pain with wet hands and poor vision.  For a child, it would be worse, and they are apt to end up with far more shampoo than is actually necessary.  In our case, our granddaughter is still too young to wash her own hair, so it is not as much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take away the scent and put it in an easier to dispense container and it would be a 5 star shampoo with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I signed this up for subscribe and save and at less than $1 per bottle this is a fantastic deal! I have two kids who bathe every night and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll go through these 6 bottles in no time. It&#x27;s got a great clean smell and cleans the body well. Both my kids&#x27; hair is clean and soft as well. No need for the detangling spray afterward.</li>
            <li> The scent is not offensive and the cleaning capabilities are very good with little discomfort to the kids.  We have not used it on the baby yet because we are sticking with fragrance free for right now.  The bottle is large but easy to handle by the supervising adult.  This is a good option that actually can be used by all ages at a pool shower, so it is a big hit in this household.  For average hair that is not very thick or tangled, this 2 in 1 option works very well.</li>
            <li> Nice, not really conditioning enough, but it works well, a lot bubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various Suave products for my son&#x27;s hair since he was a toddler.  He&#x27;s 11 now, but still likes the tear free products, so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a shot as he was tired of the &amp;#34;watermelon&amp;#34; smell of the last one he had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works alright, pretty much on par with the others.  It really is tear free, didn&#x27;t bother his eyes when he tested that feature for me (after a hefty bribe of some extra video game time).  The smell is pleasant, not really identifiable as any one specific thing, and is less overwhelming than the watermelon smell in the other version we have. It&#x27;s nice without being rude about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stands on its head just fine, but as with their other bottles I&#x27;ve had, the opening is a bit aggressive.  It&#x27;s too easy for kids to squeeze the dickens out of it and end up with way more product than they&#x27;d need in a week.  I would&#x27;ve preferred something that had a slower flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does a good job, lathers well and rinses out about as easy as any.  They just need to make the holes smaller.</li>
            <li> This shampoo with conditioner has a strong but pleasant fresh fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a lot of lather, which the youngsters certainly seem to enjoy, and if it gets in their eyes, it is relatively non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well and helps prevent long hair from tangling.</li>
            <li> I love this for my toddler. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Love these but hate all the added chemicals and coloring</li>
            <li> We can never keep enough around the house.</li>
            <li> Suave Kids is a nice line of products that produces a pleasant smell and a safe treatment for kids and adults alike. I love the smell of it and found myself opting to use it daily in place of other choices that I have. The bottle is easy to grip, the solution is not too aqueous to run out the bottle but not too gel like to be a touch squeeze, it also lathers nicely and gets into the hair. I found that it doesnt dry the hair out terribly after the shower and the smell lasts but is not too over powering to be distracting. I like it and will be looking into it further for more shampoo and conditioner needs.</li>
            <li> This easy to use shampoo and conditioner smells pretty good (but not overpowering) and gets your hair clean. The conditioner leaves it feeling soft, so thumbs up there. I do think they could have improved the dispensing part because I can see kids using way too much (parents too),</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great. My daughter loved the bottle and the smell. The shampoo lathers well and cleans the hair out without overdrying the hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product.  Perfect for an almost 4 year old boy that doesn&#x27;t want to smell like &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; shampoo!</li>
