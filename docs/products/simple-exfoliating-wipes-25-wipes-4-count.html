            <li>It does a great job of taking off unwanted makeup.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have tried this product because: 1) I no longer have mascara and eye shadow smudges on my pillow, 2)</li>
            <li>Great for travel.</li>
            <li>I have read that some people experienced crumbling when removing waterproof mascara, but I didn&#x27;t notice that at all.</li>
            <li>Its great, it does the job.</li>
            <li>Which, isn&#x27;t a great idea, but it works.</li>
            <li>I had a great experience with these make up remover pads.</li>
            <li>They DO NOT STING YOUR EYES which is great</li>
            <li>These are great &amp; got all of my mascara off.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It worked great, removed even my darkest make up with ease.</li>
            <li>My eye even felt better after that!!</li>
            <li>Very effective to remove eye make without causing dryness</li>
            <li>When I use these wipes, they do not cause any irritations or burns in my eyes which is very nice.</li>
            <li>Very effective and sturdy.</li>
            <li>These are amazing!  </li>
            <li>These eye makeup remover pads were OK but not the best I have used.</li>
            <li>- he got a nice arm punch for that!)</li>
            <li>The best part about this product is that it is infused with healthy antioxidants like pro vitamin B5 and vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>They work great and are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I think these are perfect to remove eye makeup that&#x27;s been on all day, it removes easily without having to scrub and doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li>my mother loved these makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li>The solution on the pad doesn&#x27;t sting  and over all it&#x27;s a good product but could be improved.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li>I loved them.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t good...</li>
            <li>The pads do a fairly good job at removing eye makeup and mascara.</li>
            <li>It is a good product though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The good bits: they do seem to take off eye-shadow without a hitch</li>
            <li>The price is good too.</li>
            <li>so a good make-up remover is always a must.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the size gets accustomed to me because they do get rid of the makeup fairly well.</li>
            <li>I received these for free and I was impressed.</li>
            <li>I loved this eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>I use these make up remover pads with the face lotion and it works so good.</li>
            <li>which also is good.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve been looking for a good alternative and</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do as good a job on waterproof mascara as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s always good to use a separate wipe for the eyes and the face</li>
            <li>The eye make-up remover pads and moisturizer also contain vitamins which are really good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>and I also LOVED this.</li>
            <li>I feel like they were lightly moist - which was perfect for removing the eye makeup.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for summer right around the corner.</li>
            <li>Favorite brand of make up remover!</li>
            <li>First off, I am impressed that these pads DO in fact remove waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>makeup remover was so much better for my skin!</li>
            <li>I love these pads!</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with them!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>:) 4/5!</li>
            <li>This product is okay!</li>
            <li>I got this for free from BzzAgent!!</li>
            <li>I can just pull out a cloth real quickly and wash my face without even having to go to the bathroom!</li>
            <li>but this is a great thing, it easy to tuck away for travel.</li>
            <li>so having a good makeup remover is very important to me.</li>
            <li>What I loved about it was the very light scent and the fact that my eyes did not sting at all after using the wipes.</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to try it!</li>
            <li>I got the chance to try them for free, and was really happy for the opportunity.</li>
            <li>They remove makeup well and are nice when traveling just to freshen up.</li>
            <li>find extremely effective at removing eye make up.</li>
            <li>I honestly would not pay almost 6 dollars for it.</li>
            <li>and I have used them for touch ups when applying makeup, when my eye pencil or mascara takes off on its own.  </li>
            <li>These did remove my eye makeup without burning my eyes or leaving a residue but it wasn&#x27;t as effortless as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>These pads weren&#x27;t as moist as I would have liked them to be</li>
            <li>and I found that I often needed to use one pad per eye to effectively remove all my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>This a review of my honest opinion on this product.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear waterproof makeup, so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is in that regard.</li>
            <li>These pads work really well and best of all</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use waterproof mascara, so I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be with that.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely the best eye-makeup remover pads that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is my own creation called the \\&quot;One Direction Rating Scale\\&quot; and it goes from Zayn to Niall.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have never used eye make up remover ever....</li>
            <li>very easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li>They work great, I have tried any other brands &amp; these work the best!</li>
            <li>These pads are fantastic and did a really good job, by removing my waterproof mascara from my eyes.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of these eye makeup remover wipes and was pretty impressed!  </li>
            <li>I got these from a campaign for BzzAgent, free, and I am pretty impressed with them.</li>
            <li>I just got this product to try for free the first time and it works great!</li>
            <li>These pads work wonderfully, they really do take your make-up so easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Removing eye make up was easy!</li>
            <li>I love love love these pads!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>Our wipes contain a perfect blend of our purest possible skin loving ingredients with an added vitamin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I imagine it would be nice to store these in the fridge, so they would be even more refreshing to use.</li>
            <li>Not having a strong scent has spared me from headaches as well : ) I really like that I do not have to distribute product onto a cotton ball etc, rather the product is already infused into the pad and it truly is the perfect amount of product per pad.  </li>
            <li>these are very nice and gentle while effective.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty happy them.  </li>
            <li>These make up remover wipes are pretty great.</li>
            <li>They have a very very light scent.</li>
            <li>I also have not had any problems with stinging in my eyes, which can happen easily when you are using any kind of soap around your eyes.</li>
            <li>If they were effective and easy, I wouldn&#x27;t think twice -</li>
            <li>I got these eye make- up remover pads as a free sample, I love them!</li>
            <li>I received this product for free as a part of a BzzAgent campaign, so I was very excited to try these out when I saw them on my doorstep!</li>
            <li>I do better with Ponds ...</li>
            <li>Love these for removing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Really impressed and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>I love these although I do not buy goods for the claims of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These eye make-up remover pads were just OK for me.</li>
            <li>Most of the makeup was gone but not everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great, and did not require too much scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product, and I would buy again!</li>
            <li>My wife does, however, and that&#x27;s how I became acquainted with these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wish they were more moist</li>
            <li>Works ok for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>Most products burn my eyes,  as well as my skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product, and I would buy when!</li>
            <li>This stuff was ok.</li>
            <li>But I love these and now have them on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>love these... do not burn your skin.  </li>
            <li>So at night it is ok to have grease there to catch bug dirt</li>
            <li>If you wear a lot, you&#x27;ll need to use more than one pad.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I love you.</li>
            <li>I am actually really glad I got picked to do this campaign because the products are great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>absolutely love the eye make-up remover pads.</li>
            <li>found myself wearing my mascara more because there was a way to remove it, without oily residue.</li>
            <li>It does a better job at moving eyeshadow than mascara.</li>
            <li>you for reading my review! :)</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I used the oil balancing wipes the most because I have oily and shiny skin</li>
            <li>It could be because I&#x27;m just cheap, though!</li>
            <li>It does take a while and take some folding of the pad and even usage of more than 2...</li>
            <li>I am fully impressed by the Simple Skincare line.</li>
            <li>Makes makeup remover a breeze! :)</li>
            <li>AND I got to try them FREE by being a Bzz agent!</li>

            <li>/&gt;-They need to be more moist!&lt;br /&gt;-I would love to see parabens eliminated from the ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I feel that those moisturize around my eyes a bit better.</li>
            <li>I will be heading out to buy some more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li>I have to use more than one wipe to remove mascara.</li>
            <li>I have to try using a non waterproof mascara and see ho many wipes I go though.</li>
            <li>I had to keep rubbing and rubbing to get my eye makeup off, mostly my mascara.</li>
            <li>I was so amazed how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>I used two mascaras most of the time and they aren&#x27;t pharmacy ones.</li>
            <li>(I apply to top and bottom lashes) and its waterproof</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would remove my eye makeup without causing my eyes to burn.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li>They are still better than the liquids.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving it I love the design itself.</li>
            <li>I got to try this product for free via BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s not greasy residue or overwhelming fragrance which I love.</li>
            <li>and I love that they had no oil.</li>
            <li>I received this product from BzzAgent to test for free!  </li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better ones then these.</li>
            <li>That way they are safe to stay moist longer.</li>

            <li>I like these because they&#x27;re easy to pack and to keep in my purse or gym bag.</li>
            <li>They easily take off eyeshadow and foundation.  </li>
            <li>These do a good job of removing your eye makeup (mascara), but they are a bit on the rough side - texture wise.</li>
            <li>The adhesive on the closure is still strong.  </li>
            <li>If you have allergies or don&#x27;t like strong scents</li>
            <li>there wasn&#x27;t a strong fragrance and that the removal pad didn&#x27;t burn my eyes</li>
            <li>Appropriately named, this is a simple but very effective product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are definitely as great: Not only do they contain Pro-vitamin B5 and Vitamin E, they do NOT contain alcohol, oils, dyes, skin irritants or (most importantly) perfume.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product from a bzzagent campaign and will continue to use Simple eye make-up remover pads, as they are effective and a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I first tried this after I received a free sample, and I am soo glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>great benefit to using these for that particular chore, is that if you happen to be someone who applies eye shadow or mascara to your anus these things will remove it for you right along with the fecal residue.</li>
            <li>If you plan on washing your face this is fine.  </li>
            <li>(day-to day like eye makeup for the office)&lt;br /&gt;These pads are fine</li>
            <li>and my eyes were fine.</li>
            <li>I found that they were super gentle which is perfect for the sensitive skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>, I was impressed with the size of the pads - one pad was large enough to take the make-up off of both of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Super sensitive and very effective.  </li>
            <li>The name \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; and the slogan \\&quot;skin loving ingredients\\&quot; sends me the message that this is a more natural product.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light</li>
            <li>The extensive wiping also did not feel that great on the skin around my eyes and in the end</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with these eye makeup remover pads.  </li>

            <li>Let me start by saying I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free to try.</li>
            <li>I did get the item for free as part of a sampling pack for a Bzz Campaign.</li>
            <li>I got to try these eye make-up remover pads free as a preview from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>*this product was sent to me to review from bzzagent, for free.</li>
            <li>I got these is my free sample kit from BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s my completely mathematically sound review system.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s still good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have heard many great things about the brand itself but have never really tried it before.</li>
            <li>They are super convenient and easy and do a great job of removing my eye makeup (Urban Decay shadow and liner and Benefit mascara).  </li>
            <li>I have used a lot of makeup remover &amp; this is my first attempt with a makeup remover pad!!</li>
            <li>The smooth side of the pad did almost nothing and remained rather clean</li>
            <li>I received these Eye Make-Up Remover Pads for Free through Bzz Agent to try for the First time and I Love these wipes for Removing eye makeup, eye liner and even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>My new favorite product!</li>
            <li>packaging is small, and fits perfectly in your make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price..</li>
            <li>(fur) babies, spouse, chef, housekeeper, woman of many hats!), actually washing my face at night is mostly optional as well.</li>
            <li>so a first timer I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect....</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have better luck with hand soap and hot water..</li>
            <li>I love the idea of using a very gentle and specially designed cleanser to remove stubborn eye make-up.  </li>
            <li>This product makes cleaning off any eye make up fast and easy!</li>
            <li>There was no greasy feeling or anything, no residue, just clean and fresh eyes!</li>
            <li>Love the concept of the Simple eye makeup remover pads, and they removed my eyeshadow nicely.  </li>
            <li>I wear contact lenses and have somewhat sensitive eyes, so I&#x27;m always happy when a product is gentle, as these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And they left a pleasant, clean smell.</li>
            <li>I ended up putting my L&#x27;Oreal Paris Clean Artiste Waterproof &amp;</li>
            <li>I loved receiving this Simple skincare product for free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>so I might just throw them in my purse for cleaning up makeup smudges or for helping to clean before redoing my makeup when I&#x27;m away from home.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t very moist and felt very scratchy on my eyes but surprisingly did not cause any redness.</li>
            <li>Smells like really clean spring water.</li>
            <li>The nice soft smell was an added bonus!</li>
            <li>I also wear contacts and I was able to scrub lightly enough not to push around the contacts and it was still super effective on removing everything.</li>
            <li>my special eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much faster or better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Bzzagent introduced me to such a lovely product with their free samples.</li>
            <li>Might take more than one or two pads to get everything off, but it gentle</li>
            <li>The pads are full of moisture</li>
            <li>If your looking for a gentle product that is not harsh to the sensitive area around your eyes this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li>It is not bad, but this can definitely improve (without compromising thickness which I loved)</li>
            <li>So easy to use and way better than my old method of using oily eye makeup remover and cotton pads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  Simple (.....) with nice colors and easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye</li>
            <li>I love these eye makeup remover pads much more than other brands I have tried which also cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li>These did not hurt my eyes and did the job pretty easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really enjoyed using these, and I thought they made it much easier to keep my eyes fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that these do a fine job removing make-up from the eyes, I wouldn&#x27;t know first hand, because I am a guy.  </li>
            <li>Just fresh, clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was no overbearing odor, just a fresh clean scent and feeling.</li>
            <li>And these are super to keep at work if you get caught in the rain or who knows what and</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work at all, super bummed.</li>
            <li>The pads are kind of rough, actually more so than the sheets.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was impressed with the quality of these affordable Simple skincare</li>
            <li>I feel that these do a better job than the last product I tried (some La Fresh wipes) at getting all my mascara off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, and this is also very important, but they don&#x27;t sting or cause my eyes to burn.  </li>
            <li>is also a drawback, because each pad could be a little more moist, enough to do both eyes would have been perfect.</li>
            <li>They not only cleanse, but have added vitamins like vitamin E and pro vitamin b5 as well as skin loving ingredients like mango extract and glycerin, all amazing for touchably soft skin.</li>
            <li>They are cool and soothing and I only wish there were more in the package!</li>
            <li>This product works great but one pad will just not cut it for my dark eye make-up.</li>
            <li>My least favorite part of wearing makeup is having to take it off, so I really enjoy finding good products that do it for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>With these simple pads I&#x27;m able to obtain a fresh face and keep my makeup looking great without remnants from the prior days application.</li>
            <li>I got this as well as other simple products to try for free in a campaign and it works great!</li>
            <li>As a new mom every free moment counts!</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to use and gentle.</li>
            <li>I felt it was easy to use and it worked for me really well.</li>
            <li>They are fast and easy even in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Quickly, easily and gently gets all of my eye makeup off.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li>But the simple pad works SO much better!  </li>
            <li>love the Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads, they are so easy to use before bed -</li>
            <li>I found they very smooth on the eyes and not harsh at all</li>
            <li>First, they are the right size!  </li>
            <li>These work very well on my eye makeup and are scent free, which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>These Simple eye makeup remover pads are amazing.</li>
            <li>I really like that this product is free of aritifical perfumes and dyes too.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and many of the liquid eye make up remover</li>
            <li>I dont wear a lot of eye makeup because my eyes are sensitive to most eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li>your look more natural?</li>
            <li>After joining a Simple SkinCare Campaign on the BzzAgent website I was able to receive a free sample of this eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li>They are safe for contact-lense wearers or those with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>My favorite product of the ones I received was by far the eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list proves otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;-Did</li>
            <li>but I was happy they didn&#x27;t leave behind an oily residue (which so many makeup removers seem to do).</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use any eye makeup removers for over a year because my eyes are extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Simple products are great products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These definitely are products that anyone can benefit from but that are truly great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if they were really worth the hype.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off I would like to say I received my product for free, here is my first impression of this product</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, however it isn&#x27;t my favorite product this company offers.</li>
            <li>I had to use one pad per eye, not cost effective in my book, and I still had remaining bits of eye make-up left over.  </li>
            <li>I received this for free to review and absolutely love the simple convenience of this product!</li>
            <li>I received the Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads for free via BzzAgent - and I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously though - after years of searching for an amazing eye make-up remover - I have found my new favorite!!</li>
            <li>The ingredients did not cause an allergic reaction on my eyelids, which is the one place I tend to get rashes when an ingredient does not work for me, so that was very positive</li>
            <li>My wife said these are very good but a little on the high side.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that these wipes, so simple, yet so effective, would work for me!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use eye makeup remover, I just take the easy way out and scrub at my eyes with water.</li>
            <li>She says as with her other Simple products, they work wonderfully well!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li>These were pretty good make up remover pads, and they were gentle enough for use around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>And the price is right, too.  </li>
            <li>I love that these don&#x27;t have any scent and are as gentle as water on my super sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very impressed to jump down to a low cost one.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the simpleness of using these either in the morning or before a shower without having to make a huge mess around the sink by splashing water on my face to wash it, so that was a huge plus for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I usually don&#x27;t use make up remover at all because it makes my eyes irritated but these worked great for me.</li>
            <li>I received my package of free samples of the Simple face products, I absolutely fell in love.</li>
            <li>They are soft and gentle, fragrance free, oil free and leave no residue whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I was given this product as a full size sample, and I was really exited to try this brand</li>
            <li>think a great improvement for this product would be to put them in a moisture locking small container almost like you see baby wipes in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were good for use in removing an average application of makeup, including makeup around the eyes.</li>
            <li>The pads would be much better if they were a little more moist.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s not oily and it&#x27;s super gentle on the peepers.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to get to try these for free from BZZagent.</li>
            <li>My skin felt great after using it and then following with the facial cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>I will use this product mostly for travel, but for everyday use, it is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>One single pad was able to clean all of my eye makeup off.  </li>
            <li>so I cannot speak to how effectively it removes that, but it did successfully remove eyeliner, eye shadow (powder and liquid), and mascara without irritating my eyes (and I have highly sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I cannot use cotton pads with any kind of fibers that my come loose because they get in my eyes and irritate them.  </li>
            <li>What I love the most is they don&#x27;t make a mess all over your face, like others do!</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed Simple&#x27;s eye makeup remover pads because they were not only gentle on my skin and eyes, but did an amazing job removing even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, however, they were suitably textured to remove my regular mascara and did not cause any eye sensitivity or skin dryness.</li>
            <li>However, they aren&#x27;t very moist and won&#x27;t really remove any significant application of make-up.</li>
            <li>I loved the formula this little wipes are infused with.</li>
            <li>Even after opening it several times, it still has a super strong seal.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try out a product for sensitive skin since I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As gentle as advertised!</li>
            <li>To work well, I think you need more product than these tiny pads provide.</li>
            <li>but they take off regular mascara and eyeliners off without many problems.  </li>
            <li>I  do find I have to use more than one pad per eye if I had on liner especially gel liner.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it takes more than one pad per eye.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the Simple Eye Make-Up remover pad.</li>
            <li>I first opened the pack</li>
            <li>(benefit they&#x27;re real!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re more like me, I&#x27;d go with something different.</li>
            <li>I received the simple skincare moisturizer, oil balancing wipes, radiance wipes and eye makeup remover wipes through a bzzagent campaign and I have to admit that I am in LOVE with all of them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup all too often because it&#x27;s always such a hassle to remove it and most products irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I recieved a free full sized sample of Simple Eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li>No weird or faux</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely use more of their products.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I am an avid fan of waterproof eyeliner and mascara</li>
            <li>and I was able to use just one eye makeup remover pad, front and back, to remove all of the eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Simple eye makeup remover pads were fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am in love with simple eye makeup remover pads!</li>
            <li>I will stick to my Nutragena makeup remover it too is gentle and takes everything off!</li>
            <li>My fault for not reading the ingredients first.</li>
            <li>At first im like this wouldnt remove waterproof mascara when it said it does.</li>
            <li>They also have \\&quot;skin loving\\&quot; ingredients such as zinc, glycerin, mango extract and more.  </li>
            <li>I have used the eye make-up remover pads several times and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>These are tiny pads and I feel their makeup remover wiped work much better than these pads.  </li>
            <li>so may try the face sheets again and maybe blot them first.  </li>
            <li>I use make up wipes all the time and have used many different brands but</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend and buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Most make up removers you have to buy the pads separate and put the actual remover liquid on the pad.</li>
            <li>sometimes because it doesn&#x27;t take all of the make-up off with the first one.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I will also be buying this after I finish my first packet.</li>
            <li>And for this first review I&#x27;m torn.  </li>
            <li>I find most cleansing cloths to be large and wasteful; these are smaller and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of these.  </li>
            <li>worked well to remove tough eye make up, smelled good &amp; was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the simple line of products and i was lucky enough to try them for free.</li>
            <li>I have fair, dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used other Simple products (lotion mostly) and really liked it</li>
            <li>The make up came right off without scrubbing or needing to much pressure.</li>
            <li>The pads are convenient, especially if you are in a hurry and need a quick job, but I prefer to use other products which use more moisture and are much better at removing mascara.</li>
            <li>The pads are pretty large and I only had to use one side to be able to remove all of my eye makeup (I attached a picture).</li>
            <li>I liked these, because they did not leave my face feeling oily like other brands that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>These are very thorough and appropriate for usage on the entire face (not just the eyes).</li>
            <li>I really do like them, BUT- I wish they were either bigger, or came with more.</li>
            <li>this Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pad is good enough but not quite what I was looking for in a replacement.</li>
            <li>Mostly came off, same amount as using a liquid remover, but much easier with just one pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One positive thing about this product is that it is not greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>It takes off mascara (waterproof and non) in just a few swipes, no fuss, no burning, quick and easy!</li>
            <li>Pretty moist straight out of the package but</li>
            <li>Additionally, they did not irritate my extremely sensitive skin and have a refreshingly cool sensation on the eyelid.  </li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t good to excessively rub your eye every time you want to remove your makeup.</li>
            <li>These definitely work better than most other eye makeup removing cloths.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive but this wipes did not bother my skin one bit.</li>
            <li>If I am wearing light make-up one pad is good enough, but if I wear heavy make-up I need a lot more than one pad, and  I have to scrub harder to get all the make up off.</li>
            <li>I am also happy about the fact that Simple didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin or dry out my face with</li>
            <li>They are hypo-allergenic and didn&#x27;t make my eyes break out...which is certainly a plus.</li>
            <li>The eye makup remover is easy to use, easy to take wherever I go and doesn&#x27;t cause I big mess or clean up after use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup at all, and what eye makeup I wear is very light, but it still wasn&#x27;t coming off effectively with simple cleanser... at least not with the amount of scrubbing-soap-around-my-eyes that I was willing to do.</li>
            <li>This product was inexpensive, gentle on my eyes, and was strong enough to remove my waterproof mascara and gel eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I use a lot of waterproof makeup, and these are pretty decent at getting it off.</li>
            <li>and I can give it a decent scrub to remove the tougher make up (eyeliners!).</li>
            <li>Do the job very well</li>
            <li>I like the so much, I&#x27;ve added it to my &amp;#34;Subscribe &amp; Save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well at all</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Intense.</li>
            <li>I just stopped for fear of real irritation from the repeated wiping.</li>
            <li>REALLY?  </li>
            <li>These work well enough and are cheap and affordable, for that</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I really like these eye make up remover</li>
            <li>Absolutely does not work to remove waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I got these for free as part of a BzzAgent Campaign, and I must say, I would definitely use these again.</li>
            <li>I did receive a free trial of this product to review, but I will be purchasing it in the future!</li>
            <li>I received simple eye make up remover for free thro bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They use NO ALCOHOL, NO ARTIFICIAL PERFUMES, NO OIL, NO DYES, NON DRYING, NO GREASY residue and NO HARSH IRRITANTS to upset skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it was a real struggle to get all the eyeliner and mascara off.  </li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>My eyes were left with no make up and also no redness which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>I received Simple Eye Make-Up Remover pads for free about a week ago from BZZ Agent as part of their campaign.</li>
            <li>These work really well with getting even waterproof mascara off</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to people like me who aren&#x27;t as diligent about removing eye makeup!</li>
            <li>it is gentle on my eyes and does not irritate my contacts and 3)</li>
            <li>Instead my eyes are now free of mascara remnants and actually appear brighter as well.  </li>
            <li>So much nicer than the \\&quot;oily\\&quot; makeup remover</li>
            <li>Its gentle and gets all the color off with one pad.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I paid so much for these</li>
            <li>It takes the make up off really well</li>
            <li>I gently remove my waterproof mascara and it comes off like nothing.</li>
            <li>I received a package of Simple Eye Make Up Remover Pads free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>The eye-make-up remover pads are gentle to the eyes and remove makeup thoroughly.</li>
            <li>These work really well too.  </li>
            <li>They work very well and are well priced as well.</li>
            <li>I even hold them on my lashes to let the product work on the mascara, but it really doesn&#x27;t want to take it off.  </li>
            <li>I did receive this for free, however I am definitely going to repurchase these make up remover pads!</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t wear much make-up</li>
            <li>Highly recommend any of these products!</li>
            <li>It was gentle on my skin and soothing.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>and there is no scrubbing involved, which is much healthier for my eyes.</li>
            <li>I received Simple eye make up remover as a free sample to test</li>
            <li>I received the Simple Eye Make-Up remover pads for free using Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li>Although these pads DID remove eye makeup, they didn&#x27;t do it very well.</li>
            <li>than that, I like these pads and would recommend them to anyone, no matter how much eye make-up you wear.</li>
            <li>I received my Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads for free to review from Bzz.</li>
            <li>(It seems to me that this particular pouch-like package uses less material than a screw-top jar would, so that&#x27;s also nice.)  </li>
            <li>I just tried the complete Simple skincare range -- which includes their Radiance cleansing wipes, Oil Balancing cleansing wipes, eye makeup remover pads &amp; their Protecting light moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I have used half of the pack and feel that most of the time, a pad does not remove as much as it should (and it is kind of rough on the eye area, which is very sensitive!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The facial cleansing wipes were fantastic, and left my face feeling clean and</li>
            <li>I am developing sensitive skin as I get older and many beauty products can irritate my face and neck but simple skincare products don&#x27;t contain alcohols or dyes</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product because it&#x27;s difficult to find a good eye product that will not sting or burn your eyes.</li>
            <li>Simple is VERY gentle on the most fragile skin there is.</li>
            <li>Two, they are the pleasantly moist; not so wet that they drip everywhere, but not so dry that you have to scrub.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to scrub to get my makeup off, nor did they make my eyes water like many of the other eye makeup removers.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to find a potential alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited about trying the simple eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li>They removed my mascara better than some other leading brands I have used.</li>
            <li>Overall I really did enjoy this product and it will be my new go-to.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t have an imposing oder and left my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Which means that I clean my face day and night now as well as add moisturizer every morning before applying my makeup or going outside.  </li>
            <li>and I would have to use several pads to thoroughly clean my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Even rubbing your eyes they seem very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>So many products claim to be for sensitive skin, but end up causing a breakout or cause your skin to dry out.</li>
            <li>but you are still able to use one pad for both eyes even if your makeup is a dark smokey look.</li>
            <li>The line is Simple skincare and it included 4 products, full size I might add, not some sample size</li>
            <li>These make it simple enough to just remove your makeup while watching Netflix or reading--no need to get out of bed (perfect for lazy ol&#x27; me!).</li>
            <li>There are vitamins which are perfect for my eyes because they have been itching lately and a little irritated.</li>
            <li>Less is more in this case.</li>
            <li>I would possibly purchase these in the future since they are so much more enjoyable to use than the typical removers.</li>
            <li>feel I need two pads to remove my eyes (well 1.5 pads, I end up using the 2nd pad when I&#x27;m done with my eyes on quickly removing my foundation before I use a cleaser).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on my second purchase and will buy even more in the future.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive I really can&#x27;t use much things on my face.</li>
            <li>I usually only wear mascara, but sometimes I add shadow and liner, so I like a remover pad to be able to handle either scenario equally well.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love the [[ASIN:B005TI7LHS Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes, 25 Count (Pack of 2)]], and hoped that these wipes would be just as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but these particular pads did the job nicely...without any problems.  </li>
            <li>The scentless pads are very soft and gently exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for people with very sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li>They are very moist and soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest avoiding the purchase of these pads unless you are seeking to damage your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Very small wipes, but the most powerful ones I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li>Much better than any other makeup remover I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>The makeup remover was was not as effective as some other brands I have tried such as Olay and CVS/Walgreens generics.</li>
            <li>When trying to take waterproof makeup off it does take a little more effort</li>
            <li>I love these little wipes.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little more effort when trying to remove waterproof mascara</li>
            <li>They are easily twice the size of any other eye makeup circular pads.  </li>
            <li>They are great for touch-ups and removing eyeshadow and liners, but useless against mascara.  </li>
            <li>I thought the cotton was soft and gentle which is a necessity for the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Five, it is gentle on my ever increasingly sensitive skin - no redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li>&quot; mascara I occasionally use, though even then they&#x27;re pretty gentle.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an economical option but after this just decided to go back to using the Neutrogena wipes!</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that it did take a bit of elbow grease to get waterproof mascara off, I have a different make-up remover that is much easier to use, so I will not be using the Simple pads when I wear waterproof make-up, but otherwise they work great!  </li>
            <li>It also helps knowing that it has simple ingredients with no artificial perfume or dies.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye makeup remover products and have found some to be oily-leaving a film on my eyes, and others to be too harsh or drying.  </li>
            <li>like I normally would.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed by how thick the small pads were.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this product, and it will be worth the try.</li>
            <li>Small and easy to carry around!</li>
            <li>These eye makeup remover pads have not caused me any adverse effects, only positive ones!  </li>
            <li>As eye makeup removers they&#x27;re fine, just not big enough.</li>
            <li>It took off every last bit of my dark waterproof eye makeup and it was very easy.</li>
            <li>I honestly was a little leery of trying a new facial product.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t wear super heavy eye makeup (light eyeliner, non waterproof mascara, and a light shimmer eye shadow)</li>
            <li>These will be my new go-to makeup remover from now on.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, they&#x27;re a pretty good addition to a facial regimen, but you can probably achieve the same results with witch hazel pads or simple facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>They have a slight sort of cucumbery smell that is very mild and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all -- and I am BOTHERED by perfume.</li>
            <li>Simple eye makeup remover wipes easily removed a night outs worth of makeup in a few swipes while making my eyes feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no irritation - will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>I had always had trouble getting my eye makeup off with the regular makeup remover pads out on the marker, but after joining a campaign through BzzAgent and receiving some of the Simple products for free, I completely fell in love with this line.</li>
            <li>Directions are clear as day and  ingredients are very visible for those who are sensitive, like I am.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Simple products-I used to buy them in England before they were available in the US-because they&#x27;re practical.</li>
            <li>They are well-moistened, soft to the touch and do a great job removing eye make-up without having to scrub and potentially damage the delicate skin that surrounds the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>The pads are very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>One pad cleaned both of my eyes and it was very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I always try to find something positive to say about a product even if it&#x27;s not my personal favorite, but these are just plain</li>
            <li>The small packaging is really convenient and easy to store.</li>
            <li>The cleaning face wipes left my skin moisturized, clean, and most importantly free of red patches and bumps, which has been the result of other face cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>it is small and cutely packaged.</li>
            <li>Usually not even around my anus.</li>
            <li>One of the first things I look for is, do they actually remove eye makeup?  </li>
            <li>The pads are a generously sized oval shape, which makes much more sense for eyes than a round shape!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you have sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t burn and it removes eye-makeup!</li>
            <li>Plus you can&#x27;t beat no harsh irritants!</li>
            <li>No rash from my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t be moist enough to remove all of the makeup</li>
            <li>I usually do not wear waterproof mascara, but when I did these wipes took it off without leaving marks or residue on my eyes.</li>
            <li>They also smell very clean but different than the other products.</li>
            <li>I genuinely like these as they work very well at removing eye makeup with just a small pad.</li>
            <li>The lack of moisture also makes them less comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as effective as Ponds, pads are small and not damp enough.</li>
            <li>The disks themselves are quite small, but they are so effective who needs them to be bigger?  </li>
            <li>Super gentle, takes makeup off fairly easily, a little work sometime required.</li>
            <li>I then used the pads to lightly rub those areas of my face where the eye makeup was smeared to try and remove it, and I woke up the next morning with very enlarged, darkly pigmented pores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most skin care products dry out my skin or leave it red and blotchy, but these Simple eye make-up removing pads didn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether they were trying to go light on the dissolving agent to make them more skin friendly, but something went wrong somewhere.  </li>
            <li>I am throughly please with Simple&#x27;s new skincare range and cannot wait to make it my new skincare regime for the summer!</li>
            <li>But honestly - that would make me more likely to give it a bad review if it did&#x27;t work -</li>
            <li>I steer clear from products that do the job because I have contact lenses and the skin under my eyes</li>
            <li>When I woke up, my skin felt clean and not grimy from the previous day.</li>
            <li>and I really like the Simple sensitive skin line.</li>
            <li>Work well and are sensitive for skin.</li>
            <li>Not harsh, not drying.</li>
            <li>not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Works well on my sensitive skin ...removes my waterproof mascara almost as well as &amp;#34;full strength&amp;#34; formulas.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this and buy it myself in the future!</li>
            <li>Still I wouldn&#x27;t suggest sticking them directly into your eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks Simple!</li>
            <li>They are non-irritating for my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive oily skin and these products have worked wonders.</li>
            <li>I also Removes all my makeup with some rubbing and doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to get the regular face make-up remover (not exfoliating) sheets and they really take off the eye make-up well.  </li>
            <li>I do not want to feel I have to rub to remove eye makeup, this has to be a gentle process, and between the scratchy pad and low moisture of the product, I would pass on these!</li>
            <li>These Simple Eye makeup remover wipes really worked well for me.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this eye makeup remover works.  </li>
            <li>I need to use one pad for each eye, but it completely removes mascara without having to scrub my eyes.  </li>
            <li>When I wear make up I only wear it on my eyes and because most removers make me break out in hives I avoid washing my face at night, one to avoid the reaction my skin has and two I really do not want to have to wash my entire face just to wash my eyes.</li>
            <li>I ended up using 3 pads to remove the make-up completely</li>
            <li>The pads are gentle and do not irritate my eyes, which is a definite plus!!  </li>
            <li>#1) No harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>2)They are so soft.</li>
            <li>And it didnt burn like some removers do by the sensitive skin around my eye.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to be used around eyes without hurting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wearing much eye makeup (especially waterproof), expect to use 2-4 pads to remove everything.</li>
            <li>They are gentle enough to use over the eyes without causing irritation.  </li>
            <li>opening the package, I had a few coats of waterproof mascara on, and one wipe was more than enough for taking off the makeup on both of my eyes.</li>
            <li>do like the Simple line of products; they are just right for my, eh hem, aging skin, and the SIMPLE EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER PADS are no exception.  </li>
            <li>They barely took any makeup off and dried out so easily even though I ensured closing them.</li>
            <li>small and easy to throw in make up bag for overnight trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other reviewers said they weren&#x27;t moist enough, but I found them to be great, I&#x27;ve used other pads that were too wet and the cleanser dripped into my eyes and burned, but these don&#x27;t drip at all.  </li>
            <li>I am an owner of super sensitive skin and many products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, even for sensitive skin, have left me with red, dry, bumpy skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these pads really help reduce that oily look after a long day.</li>
            <li>You have to use too many pads each time you need to remove make up (1) because they&#x27;re too small, and (2) because they don&#x27;t have enough product on the pad.  </li>
            <li>Most products claim to get the product off but it usually takes multiple applications and then after I wash my face</li>
            <li>I know that these pads got all of the traces of eye makeup off because after I took a shower there was no black lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Simple skin care product line!!</li>
            <li>but these DO in fact take off waterproof makeup like it says- very gently with minimal rubbing.</li>
            <li>pads are great with tough ups or when you mess up on the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This stuff was nice and gentle but sadly even after using two clothes on each side I still had makeup and mascara left.</li>
            <li>It takes way too long with way too much scrubbing to remove mascara and eyeliner, and there is always residue.</li>
            <li>So when I first open it, it got a scrubing side and a flat side.</li>
            <li>These little pads remove eye makeup quickly and efficiently, without any eye irritation.  </li>
            <li>Let me first start by saying how excited I was to get to try the eye makeup remover pads and a few other new products from the Simple Skincare line.  </li>
            <li>This product is gentle - a little too gentle as it doesn&#x27;t remove all of my waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>yes the glitter eyeliner came out easily but there were still some specs of glitter eyeliner which was hard to get it out.</li>
            <li>I just wish they were a little bit more wet.</li>
            <li>This is the only eye make up remover pad that I have found and they really get all the mascara and other products off the eyes gently.  </li>
            <li>My main problem with these is the ridges, it makes the wipes not as gentle and after rubbing it might cause slight irritation.</li>
            <li>Dried out quickly.</li>
            <li>The eye area is a very sensitive zone and therefore has to be treated with extra care as opposed to the rest of the face.</li>
            <li>These are two-sided and the sides are similar although not identical (one has more of a texture than the other), but you can use one side of the pad for one eye, then flip it and use the other side.  </li>
            <li>Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads were a bit of a disappointment after the great success I had with the other Simple brand products that I tried.</li>
            <li>- it has Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and a Super Peptide Complex, it has drastically reduced the fine lines, wrinkles and crows feet around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised this product was able to remove my eye make-up so easily considering the fact that I use oil base make-up.</li>
            <li>When used for my eyes, I generally have to use, wash my face, and then use again to get all of the makeup off.  </li>
            <li>- barely took off the maybeline tattoo cream shadow.</li>
            <li>It completely removed the eyeshadow (naked 2), but it did a so-so job at removing the mascara</li>
            <li>However these are almost completely ineffective in removing makeup ESPECIALLY mascara</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with Simple skin cares eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Simple Eye Make-up Remover pads are perfect--removing make-up completely, yet leaving no residue or dryness.  </li>
            <li>My 17 year old loves the Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads!</li>
            <li>I always had a difficult time finding a product that is gentle and that wont irritate my eyes, but this product in my opinion was great for my delicate eyes and does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used these a few times but so far they are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the eye-makeup remover pads which get my thick eyeliner off in a snap without making my eyelids oily.</li>
            <li>The light moisturizer isn&#x27;t thick or greasy and protects from UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 15.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn and doesn&#x27;t leave behind raccoon eyes, so I am confident it take all the make up away.</li>
            <li>Smell is ok but not great.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend that you check out the new Simple Skincare products.  </li>
            <li>I found that the pads dried out quickly, and rather than actually remove the makeup,</li>
            <li>These get the spot right under my eyes that I always seem to have trouble getting to</li>
            <li>I know it says its for eye makeup but used it for my entire face and had no odd reactions to my skin.</li>
            <li>They get a little hung up on waterproof mascara and require a little more rubbing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super small</li>
            <li>The price is fair, but the package is very small and fits in the palm of my hand; which, mind you, I have small hands to begin</li>
            <li>Other eye makeup removers have irritated my eyes and these pads are really gentle.</li>
            <li>While they did remove my eye makeup, it took a little too much effort and rubbing, and the area around my eyes is just too sensitive to use them.</li>
            <li>Each night, I use Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads to gently cleanse and remove any eye makeup, even waterproof and long lasting eye make-up products.</li>
            <li>The textured side of the pad gets the bulk of the eye make-up and the pads are thick enough that the make-up does not go through to the other side, so then you can use the smooth side of the pad to make sure there is no more remaining on your eye.</li>
            <li>At first they didn&#x27;t seem moist enough to do the job, but it takes just a few swipes to completely remove all make-up.</li>
            <li>So I would definitely recommend any and all simple skincare products if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think these pads wound up entrapping my eyeliner deep within my facial pores, so I looked as if I was wearing 7-day old makeup</li>
            <li>my eyes are extremely sensitive to EVERYTHING and get red, runny and gross.  </li>
            <li>however the only down fall is that after a while if you don&#x27;t use them consistently, they are drying out.</li>
            <li>I rate these highly only because they are better than other eye makeup removers I have used in the past... but they could use improvement in some areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I proceeded to remove a full eye look, complete with black mascara and black liquid liner.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my face really well, and best of all, doesn&#x27;t smell bad or leave behind any sort of residue.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t really work well with my waterproof mascara, however, it worked well with my dark eye shadow and liner.</li>
            <li>Before trying this product out, I didn&#x27;t know much about the Simple brand, other than it being another skincare line out on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- 1st time out the the package and the pads were not wet enough</li>
            <li>As someone who has tried a lot of various makeup wipes, I was pleasantly surprised with Simple&#x27;s approach to making wipes especially for the eye area.</li>
            <li>These are amazingly small, but powerful wipes.</li>
            <li>o received these and a few other Simple products free through bzzagent</li>
            <li>These pads also sport a slight texture that helps in gently wiping off makeup.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just slightly moist, making them useful for a very short time before they dry up.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and non irritating.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing worse than having remover pads dry out before you&#x27;ve been able to use them.  </li>
            <li>This pocket-sized pack has large, pre-moistened eye makeup remover pads (each a little smaller than your palm) that can remove makeup from BOTH eyes--</li>
            <li>I really like using these little pads to get stubborn eye makeup off at night.</li>
            <li>These little pads work very well for simple makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Good product, a little expensive for the size.</li>
            <li>I do recommend these pads for someone who has a sensitive or delicate eye area like myself that doesn&#x27;t like to do too much work to remove their eye make-up.</li>

            <li> I am so happy to have tried this product because: 1) I no longer have mascara and eye shadow smudges on my pillow, 2)</li>
            <li> Great for travel.</li>
            <li> I have read that some people experienced crumbling when removing waterproof mascara, but I didn&#x27;t notice that at all.</li>
            <li> Its great, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Which, isn&#x27;t a great idea, but it works.</li>
            <li> I had a great experience with these make up remover pads.</li>
            <li> They DO NOT STING YOUR EYES which is great</li>
            <li> These are great &amp; got all of my mascara off.</li>

            <li> My eye even felt better after that!!</li>
            <li> Very effective to remove eye make without causing dryness</li>
            <li> When I use these wipes, they do not cause any irritations or burns in my eyes which is very nice.</li>
            <li> Very effective and sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  </li>
            <li> These eye makeup remover pads were OK but not the best I have used.</li>
            <li> - he got a nice arm punch for that!)</li>
            <li> The best part about this product is that it is infused with healthy antioxidants like pro vitamin B5 and vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> They work great and are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I think these are perfect to remove eye makeup that&#x27;s been on all day, it removes easily without having to scrub and doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li> my mother loved these makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> The solution on the pad doesn&#x27;t sting  and over all it&#x27;s a good product but could be improved.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li> I loved them.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t good...</li>
            <li> The pads do a fairly good job at removing eye makeup and mascara.</li>
            <li> It is a good product though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The good bits: they do seem to take off eye-shadow without a hitch</li>
            <li> The price is good too.</li>
            <li> so a good make-up remover is always a must.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, the size gets accustomed to me because they do get rid of the makeup fairly well.</li>
            <li> I received these for free and I was impressed.</li>
            <li> I loved this eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> I use these make up remover pads with the face lotion and it works so good.</li>
            <li> which also is good.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve been looking for a good alternative and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as good a job on waterproof mascara as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s always good to use a separate wipe for the eyes and the face</li>
            <li> The eye make-up remover pads and moisturizer also contain vitamins which are really good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> and I also LOVED this.</li>
            <li> I feel like they were lightly moist - which was perfect for removing the eye makeup.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for summer right around the corner.</li>
            <li> Favorite brand of make up remover!</li>
            <li> First off, I am impressed that these pads DO in fact remove waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> makeup remover was so much better for my skin!</li>
            <li> I love these pads!</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with them!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> :) 4/5!</li>
            <li> This product is okay!</li>
            <li> I got this for free from BzzAgent!!</li>
            <li> I can just pull out a cloth real quickly and wash my face without even having to go to the bathroom!</li>
            <li> but this is a great thing, it easy to tuck away for travel.</li>
            <li> so having a good makeup remover is very important to me.</li>
            <li> What I loved about it was the very light scent and the fact that my eyes did not sting at all after using the wipes.</li>
            <li> and I was very excited to try it!</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try them for free, and was really happy for the opportunity.</li>
            <li> They remove makeup well and are nice when traveling just to freshen up.</li>
            <li> find extremely effective at removing eye make up.</li>
            <li> I honestly would not pay almost 6 dollars for it.</li>
            <li> and I have used them for touch ups when applying makeup, when my eye pencil or mascara takes off on its own.  </li>
            <li> These did remove my eye makeup without burning my eyes or leaving a residue but it wasn&#x27;t as effortless as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> These pads weren&#x27;t as moist as I would have liked them to be</li>
            <li> and I found that I often needed to use one pad per eye to effectively remove all my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This a review of my honest opinion on this product.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear waterproof makeup, so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is in that regard.</li>
            <li> These pads work really well and best of all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use waterproof mascara, so I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be with that.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best eye-makeup remover pads that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is my own creation called the \\&quot;One Direction Rating Scale\\&quot; and it goes from Zayn to Niall.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have never used eye make up remover ever....</li>
            <li> very easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li> They work great, I have tried any other brands &amp; these work the best!</li>
            <li> These pads are fantastic and did a really good job, by removing my waterproof mascara from my eyes.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of these eye makeup remover wipes and was pretty impressed!  </li>
            <li> I got these from a campaign for BzzAgent, free, and I am pretty impressed with them.</li>
            <li> I just got this product to try for free the first time and it works great!</li>
            <li> These pads work wonderfully, they really do take your make-up so easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Removing eye make up was easy!</li>
            <li> I love love love these pads!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> Our wipes contain a perfect blend of our purest possible skin loving ingredients with an added vitamin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be nice to store these in the fridge, so they would be even more refreshing to use.</li>
            <li> Not having a strong scent has spared me from headaches as well : ) I really like that I do not have to distribute product onto a cotton ball etc, rather the product is already infused into the pad and it truly is the perfect amount of product per pad.  </li>
            <li> these are very nice and gentle while effective.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty happy them.  </li>
            <li> These make up remover wipes are pretty great.</li>
            <li> They have a very very light scent.</li>
            <li> I also have not had any problems with stinging in my eyes, which can happen easily when you are using any kind of soap around your eyes.</li>
            <li> If they were effective and easy, I wouldn&#x27;t think twice -</li>
            <li> I got these eye make- up remover pads as a free sample, I love them!</li>
            <li> I received this product for free as a part of a BzzAgent campaign, so I was very excited to try these out when I saw them on my doorstep!</li>
            <li> I do better with Ponds ...</li>
            <li> Love these for removing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Really impressed and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I love these although I do not buy goods for the claims of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These eye make-up remover pads were just OK for me.</li>
            <li> Most of the makeup was gone but not everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great, and did not require too much scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product, and I would buy again!</li>
            <li> My wife does, however, and that&#x27;s how I became acquainted with these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wish they were more moist</li>
            <li> Works ok for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> Most products burn my eyes,  as well as my skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great product, and I would buy when!</li>
            <li> This stuff was ok.</li>
            <li> But I love these and now have them on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> love these... do not burn your skin.  </li>
            <li> So at night it is ok to have grease there to catch bug dirt</li>
            <li> If you wear a lot, you&#x27;ll need to use more than one pad.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I love you.</li>
            <li> I am actually really glad I got picked to do this campaign because the products are great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> absolutely love the eye make-up remover pads.</li>
            <li> found myself wearing my mascara more because there was a way to remove it, without oily residue.</li>
            <li> It does a better job at moving eyeshadow than mascara.</li>
            <li> you for reading my review! :)</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I used the oil balancing wipes the most because I have oily and shiny skin</li>
            <li> It could be because I&#x27;m just cheap, though!</li>
            <li> It does take a while and take some folding of the pad and even usage of more than 2...</li>
            <li> I am fully impressed by the Simple Skincare line.</li>
            <li> Makes makeup remover a breeze! :)</li>
            <li> AND I got to try them FREE by being a Bzz agent!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fragrant free!  </li>
            <li> I love these pads and it does what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li> really do love this product</li>
            <li> The eye makeup remover pads were fabulous!</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me these items for free to try and review!</li>
            <li> ,I cant say enough how awesome these pads are!</li>
            <li> I received this product for free as a bzz agent so that I could provide consumers honest feedback about the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-They need to be more moist!&lt;br /&gt;-I would love to see parabens eliminated from the ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I feel that those moisturize around my eyes a bit better.</li>
            <li> I will be heading out to buy some more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I have to use more than one wipe to remove mascara.</li>
            <li> I have to try using a non waterproof mascara and see ho many wipes I go though.</li>
            <li> I had to keep rubbing and rubbing to get my eye makeup off, mostly my mascara.</li>
            <li> I was so amazed how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> I used two mascaras most of the time and they aren&#x27;t pharmacy ones.</li>
            <li> (I apply to top and bottom lashes) and its waterproof</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would remove my eye makeup without causing my eyes to burn.  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> They are still better than the liquids.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving it I love the design itself.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free via BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not greasy residue or overwhelming fragrance which I love.</li>
            <li> and I love that they had no oil.</li>
            <li> I received this product from BzzAgent to test for free!  </li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better ones then these.</li>
            <li> That way they are safe to stay moist longer.</li>
            <li> So grateful that I received a free sample of these!  </li>
            <li> I received these wipes for free and I am sharing my HONEST opinion.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of these pads in my Bzz Kit and they are absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s famous for playing Marnie, on HBO&#x27;s Girls.</li>
            <li> SIMPLE EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER PADS are some of the best disposable face cloths that I have found.  </li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling and that the wipes are so effective.</li>
            <li> I was very excited upon opening these.  </li>
            <li> This is very quick, easy and does not smear make up all underneath my eyes!</li>
            <li> Now that they sent theses to me for free, it&#x27;s so easy and so much better for me!</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with these products they leave my face feeling nice and clean all day.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use, they have a light, pleasant, clean scent, they do what they are supposed to do, and they do it well.  </li>
            <li> Although i have used wipes that have removed make up more quickly &amp; more easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received my very first bzz campaign, got this stuff fo free!!</li>
            <li> They are well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> With these eye make up remover pads I am able to take them with me and easily wipe it off before I even get home if I want.</li>
            <li> These are great makeup remover pads, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Super useful and handy!</li>
            <li> After applying it to my face and neck, my face felt so clean!</li>
            <li> SO nice to have a GENTLE makeup removing pad that I don&#x27;t have to use like a scouring pad!!</li>
            <li> Very nice for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> Very nice for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> They are also great if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin and no perfumy nonsense going on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the Eye Make-up Remover Pads that I got for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely effective and I&#x27;ve had many compliments on how they keep my eyelashes pretty and intact</li>
            <li> They are great for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> The small package is great for travel or carrying in your purse for when your on the go as well, definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is arguably the most important category.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free to review and found that it was ok.</li>
            <li> they feel nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that they are good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> They take off all my eye make up very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> I loved the compact size of the packaging and that the actual removal pad was a great size it could be a little more moist but for the most part it is a great remover.</li>
            <li> received this product for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign and was very excited to try these.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve purchased a more familiar brand, but went for these since I was in a pinch</li>
            <li> Other than that they are awesome!</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m super excited guys!</li>
            <li> Not oily and easily removes makeup.</li>
            <li> and I thought the packaging was easy to grab and go.  </li>
            <li> pad easily cleaned mascara off both my eyes, but I prefer to use one for each eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Again, it came off easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I had the chance because I truly love all the Simple Skin Care Products!!!!!</li>
            <li> It easily removes waterproof mascara and liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> They got the mascara too, and easily so.  </li>
            <li> I like these because they&#x27;re easy to pack and to keep in my purse or gym bag.</li>
            <li> They easily take off eyeshadow and foundation.  </li>
            <li> These do a good job of removing your eye makeup (mascara), but they are a bit on the rough side - texture wise.</li>
            <li> The adhesive on the closure is still strong.  </li>
            <li> If you have allergies or don&#x27;t like strong scents</li>
            <li> there wasn&#x27;t a strong fragrance and that the removal pad didn&#x27;t burn my eyes</li>
            <li> Appropriately named, this is a simple but very effective product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are definitely as great: Not only do they contain Pro-vitamin B5 and Vitamin E, they do NOT contain alcohol, oils, dyes, skin irritants or (most importantly) perfume.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from a bzzagent campaign and will continue to use Simple eye make-up remover pads, as they are effective and a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I first tried this after I received a free sample, and I am soo glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> great benefit to using these for that particular chore, is that if you happen to be someone who applies eye shadow or mascara to your anus these things will remove it for you right along with the fecal residue.</li>
            <li> If you plan on washing your face this is fine.  </li>
            <li> (day-to day like eye makeup for the office)&lt;br /&gt;These pads are fine</li>
            <li> and my eyes were fine.</li>
            <li> I found that they were super gentle which is perfect for the sensitive skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> , I was impressed with the size of the pads - one pad was large enough to take the make-up off of both of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Super sensitive and very effective.  </li>
            <li> The name \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; and the slogan \\&quot;skin loving ingredients\\&quot; sends me the message that this is a more natural product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light</li>
            <li> The extensive wiping also did not feel that great on the skin around my eyes and in the end</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with these eye makeup remover pads.  </li>

            <li> *this product was sent to me to review from bzzagent, for free.</li>
            <li> I got these is my free sample kit from BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my completely mathematically sound review system.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s still good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have heard many great things about the brand itself but have never really tried it before.</li>
            <li> They are super convenient and easy and do a great job of removing my eye makeup (Urban Decay shadow and liner and Benefit mascara).  </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of makeup remover &amp; this is my first attempt with a makeup remover pad!!</li>
            <li> The smooth side of the pad did almost nothing and remained rather clean</li>
            <li> I received these Eye Make-Up Remover Pads for Free through Bzz Agent to try for the First time and I Love these wipes for Removing eye makeup, eye liner and even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product!</li>
            <li> packaging is small, and fits perfectly in your make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price..</li>
            <li> (fur) babies, spouse, chef, housekeeper, woman of many hats!), actually washing my face at night is mostly optional as well.</li>
            <li> so a first timer I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect....</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have better luck with hand soap and hot water..</li>
            <li> I love the idea of using a very gentle and specially designed cleanser to remove stubborn eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> This product makes cleaning off any eye make up fast and easy!</li>
            <li> There was no greasy feeling or anything, no residue, just clean and fresh eyes!</li>
            <li> Love the concept of the Simple eye makeup remover pads, and they removed my eyeshadow nicely.  </li>
            <li> I wear contact lenses and have somewhat sensitive eyes, so I&#x27;m always happy when a product is gentle, as these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they left a pleasant, clean smell.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting my L&#x27;Oreal Paris Clean Artiste Waterproof &amp;</li>
            <li> I loved receiving this Simple skincare product for free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> so I might just throw them in my purse for cleaning up makeup smudges or for helping to clean before redoing my makeup when I&#x27;m away from home.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t very moist and felt very scratchy on my eyes but surprisingly did not cause any redness.</li>
            <li> Smells like really clean spring water.</li>
            <li> The nice soft smell was an added bonus!</li>
            <li> I also wear contacts and I was able to scrub lightly enough not to push around the contacts and it was still super effective on removing everything.</li>
            <li> my special eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much faster or better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Bzzagent introduced me to such a lovely product with their free samples.</li>
            <li> Might take more than one or two pads to get everything off, but it gentle</li>
            <li> The pads are full of moisture</li>
            <li> If your looking for a gentle product that is not harsh to the sensitive area around your eyes this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li> It is not bad, but this can definitely improve (without compromising thickness which I loved)</li>
            <li> So easy to use and way better than my old method of using oily eye makeup remover and cotton pads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Simple (.....) with nice colors and easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye</li>
            <li> I love these eye makeup remover pads much more than other brands I have tried which also cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li> These did not hurt my eyes and did the job pretty easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really enjoyed using these, and I thought they made it much easier to keep my eyes fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that these do a fine job removing make-up from the eyes, I wouldn&#x27;t know first hand, because I am a guy.  </li>
            <li> Just fresh, clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was no overbearing odor, just a fresh clean scent and feeling.</li>
            <li> And these are super to keep at work if you get caught in the rain or who knows what and</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, super bummed.</li>
            <li> The pads are kind of rough, actually more so than the sheets.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was impressed with the quality of these affordable Simple skincare</li>
            <li> I feel that these do a better job than the last product I tried (some La Fresh wipes) at getting all my mascara off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, and this is also very important, but they don&#x27;t sting or cause my eyes to burn.  </li>
            <li> is also a drawback, because each pad could be a little more moist, enough to do both eyes would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> They not only cleanse, but have added vitamins like vitamin E and pro vitamin b5 as well as skin loving ingredients like mango extract and glycerin, all amazing for touchably soft skin.</li>
            <li> They are cool and soothing and I only wish there were more in the package!</li>
            <li> This product works great but one pad will just not cut it for my dark eye make-up.</li>
            <li> My least favorite part of wearing makeup is having to take it off, so I really enjoy finding good products that do it for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> With these simple pads I&#x27;m able to obtain a fresh face and keep my makeup looking great without remnants from the prior days application.</li>
            <li> I got this as well as other simple products to try for free in a campaign and it works great!</li>
            <li> As a new mom every free moment counts!</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use and gentle.</li>
            <li> I felt it was easy to use and it worked for me really well.</li>
            <li> They are fast and easy even in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Quickly, easily and gently gets all of my eye makeup off.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li> But the simple pad works SO much better!  </li>
            <li> love the Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads, they are so easy to use before bed -</li>
            <li> I found they very smooth on the eyes and not harsh at all</li>
            <li> First, they are the right size!  </li>
            <li> These work very well on my eye makeup and are scent free, which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li> These Simple eye makeup remover pads are amazing.</li>
            <li> I really like that this product is free of aritifical perfumes and dyes too.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and many of the liquid eye make up remover</li>
            <li> I dont wear a lot of eye makeup because my eyes are sensitive to most eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li> your look more natural?</li>
            <li> After joining a Simple SkinCare Campaign on the BzzAgent website I was able to receive a free sample of this eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li> They are safe for contact-lense wearers or those with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> My favorite product of the ones I received was by far the eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list proves otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;-Did</li>
            <li> but I was happy they didn&#x27;t leave behind an oily residue (which so many makeup removers seem to do).</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use any eye makeup removers for over a year because my eyes are extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Simple products are great products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These definitely are products that anyone can benefit from but that are truly great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if they were really worth the hype.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say I received my product for free, here is my first impression of this product</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, however it isn&#x27;t my favorite product this company offers.</li>
            <li> I had to use one pad per eye, not cost effective in my book, and I still had remaining bits of eye make-up left over.  </li>
            <li> I received this for free to review and absolutely love the simple convenience of this product!</li>
            <li> I received the Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads for free via BzzAgent - and I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously though - after years of searching for an amazing eye make-up remover - I have found my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> The ingredients did not cause an allergic reaction on my eyelids, which is the one place I tend to get rashes when an ingredient does not work for me, so that was very positive</li>
            <li> My wife said these are very good but a little on the high side.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that these wipes, so simple, yet so effective, would work for me!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use eye makeup remover, I just take the easy way out and scrub at my eyes with water.</li>
            <li> She says as with her other Simple products, they work wonderfully well!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li> These were pretty good make up remover pads, and they were gentle enough for use around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> And the price is right, too.  </li>
            <li> I love that these don&#x27;t have any scent and are as gentle as water on my super sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very impressed to jump down to a low cost one.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the simpleness of using these either in the morning or before a shower without having to make a huge mess around the sink by splashing water on my face to wash it, so that was a huge plus for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t use make up remover at all because it makes my eyes irritated but these worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I received my package of free samples of the Simple face products, I absolutely fell in love.</li>
            <li> They are soft and gentle, fragrance free, oil free and leave no residue whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was given this product as a full size sample, and I was really exited to try this brand</li>
            <li> think a great improvement for this product would be to put them in a moisture locking small container almost like you see baby wipes in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were good for use in removing an average application of makeup, including makeup around the eyes.</li>
            <li> The pads would be much better if they were a little more moist.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not oily and it&#x27;s super gentle on the peepers.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to get to try these for free from BZZagent.</li>
            <li> My skin felt great after using it and then following with the facial cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> I will use this product mostly for travel, but for everyday use, it is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> One single pad was able to clean all of my eye makeup off.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot speak to how effectively it removes that, but it did successfully remove eyeliner, eye shadow (powder and liquid), and mascara without irritating my eyes (and I have highly sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I cannot use cotton pads with any kind of fibers that my come loose because they get in my eyes and irritate them.  </li>
            <li> What I love the most is they don&#x27;t make a mess all over your face, like others do!</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed Simple&#x27;s eye makeup remover pads because they were not only gentle on my skin and eyes, but did an amazing job removing even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, however, they were suitably textured to remove my regular mascara and did not cause any eye sensitivity or skin dryness.</li>
            <li> However, they aren&#x27;t very moist and won&#x27;t really remove any significant application of make-up.</li>
            <li> I loved the formula this little wipes are infused with.</li>
            <li> Even after opening it several times, it still has a super strong seal.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out a product for sensitive skin since I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As gentle as advertised!</li>
            <li> To work well, I think you need more product than these tiny pads provide.</li>
            <li> but they take off regular mascara and eyeliners off without many problems.  </li>
            <li> I  do find I have to use more than one pad per eye if I had on liner especially gel liner.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it takes more than one pad per eye.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Simple Eye Make-Up remover pad.</li>
            <li> I first opened the pack</li>
            <li> (benefit they&#x27;re real!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re more like me, I&#x27;d go with something different.</li>
            <li> I received the simple skincare moisturizer, oil balancing wipes, radiance wipes and eye makeup remover wipes through a bzzagent campaign and I have to admit that I am in LOVE with all of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup all too often because it&#x27;s always such a hassle to remove it and most products irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I recieved a free full sized sample of Simple Eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li> No weird or faux</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely use more of their products.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I am an avid fan of waterproof eyeliner and mascara</li>
            <li> and I was able to use just one eye makeup remover pad, front and back, to remove all of the eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Simple eye makeup remover pads were fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am in love with simple eye makeup remover pads!</li>
            <li> I will stick to my Nutragena makeup remover it too is gentle and takes everything off!</li>
            <li> My fault for not reading the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> At first im like this wouldnt remove waterproof mascara when it said it does.</li>
            <li> They also have \\&quot;skin loving\\&quot; ingredients such as zinc, glycerin, mango extract and more.  </li>
            <li> I have used the eye make-up remover pads several times and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> These are tiny pads and I feel their makeup remover wiped work much better than these pads.  </li>
            <li> so may try the face sheets again and maybe blot them first.  </li>
            <li> I use make up wipes all the time and have used many different brands but</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend and buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Most make up removers you have to buy the pads separate and put the actual remover liquid on the pad.</li>
            <li> sometimes because it doesn&#x27;t take all of the make-up off with the first one.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I will also be buying this after I finish my first packet.</li>
            <li> And for this first review I&#x27;m torn.  </li>
            <li> I find most cleansing cloths to be large and wasteful; these are smaller and just the right size.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of these.  </li>
            <li> worked well to remove tough eye make up, smelled good &amp; was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love the simple line of products and i was lucky enough to try them for free.</li>
            <li> I have fair, dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Simple products (lotion mostly) and really liked it</li>
            <li> The make up came right off without scrubbing or needing to much pressure.</li>
            <li> The pads are convenient, especially if you are in a hurry and need a quick job, but I prefer to use other products which use more moisture and are much better at removing mascara.</li>
            <li> The pads are pretty large and I only had to use one side to be able to remove all of my eye makeup (I attached a picture).</li>
            <li> I liked these, because they did not leave my face feeling oily like other brands that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> These are very thorough and appropriate for usage on the entire face (not just the eyes).</li>
            <li> I really do like them, BUT- I wish they were either bigger, or came with more.</li>
            <li> this Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pad is good enough but not quite what I was looking for in a replacement.</li>
            <li> Mostly came off, same amount as using a liquid remover, but much easier with just one pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One positive thing about this product is that it is not greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> It takes off mascara (waterproof and non) in just a few swipes, no fuss, no burning, quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Pretty moist straight out of the package but</li>
            <li> Additionally, they did not irritate my extremely sensitive skin and have a refreshingly cool sensation on the eyelid.  </li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t good to excessively rub your eye every time you want to remove your makeup.</li>
            <li> These definitely work better than most other eye makeup removing cloths.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive but this wipes did not bother my skin one bit.</li>
            <li> If I am wearing light make-up one pad is good enough, but if I wear heavy make-up I need a lot more than one pad, and  I have to scrub harder to get all the make up off.</li>
            <li> I am also happy about the fact that Simple didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin or dry out my face with</li>
            <li> They are hypo-allergenic and didn&#x27;t make my eyes break out...which is certainly a plus.</li>
            <li> The eye makup remover is easy to use, easy to take wherever I go and doesn&#x27;t cause I big mess or clean up after use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup at all, and what eye makeup I wear is very light, but it still wasn&#x27;t coming off effectively with simple cleanser... at least not with the amount of scrubbing-soap-around-my-eyes that I was willing to do.</li>
            <li> This product was inexpensive, gentle on my eyes, and was strong enough to remove my waterproof mascara and gel eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of waterproof makeup, and these are pretty decent at getting it off.</li>
            <li> and I can give it a decent scrub to remove the tougher make up (eyeliners!).</li>
            <li> Do the job very well</li>
            <li> I like the so much, I&#x27;ve added it to my &amp;#34;Subscribe &amp; Save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well at all</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Intense.</li>
            <li> I just stopped for fear of real irritation from the repeated wiping.</li>
            <li> REALLY?  </li>
            <li> These work well enough and are cheap and affordable, for that</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I really like these eye make up remover</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not work to remove waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I got these for free as part of a BzzAgent Campaign, and I must say, I would definitely use these again.</li>
            <li> I did receive a free trial of this product to review, but I will be purchasing it in the future!</li>
            <li> I received simple eye make up remover for free thro bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They use NO ALCOHOL, NO ARTIFICIAL PERFUMES, NO OIL, NO DYES, NON DRYING, NO GREASY residue and NO HARSH IRRITANTS to upset skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it was a real struggle to get all the eyeliner and mascara off.  </li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> My eyes were left with no make up and also no redness which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> I received Simple Eye Make-Up Remover pads for free about a week ago from BZZ Agent as part of their campaign.</li>
            <li> These work really well with getting even waterproof mascara off</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to people like me who aren&#x27;t as diligent about removing eye makeup!</li>
            <li> it is gentle on my eyes and does not irritate my contacts and 3)</li>
            <li> Instead my eyes are now free of mascara remnants and actually appear brighter as well.  </li>
            <li> So much nicer than the \\&quot;oily\\&quot; makeup remover</li>
            <li> Its gentle and gets all the color off with one pad.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I paid so much for these</li>
            <li> It takes the make up off really well</li>
            <li> I gently remove my waterproof mascara and it comes off like nothing.</li>
            <li> I received a package of Simple Eye Make Up Remover Pads free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> The eye-make-up remover pads are gentle to the eyes and remove makeup thoroughly.</li>
            <li> These work really well too.  </li>
            <li> They work very well and are well priced as well.</li>
            <li> I even hold them on my lashes to let the product work on the mascara, but it really doesn&#x27;t want to take it off.  </li>
            <li> I did receive this for free, however I am definitely going to repurchase these make up remover pads!</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t wear much make-up</li>
            <li> Highly recommend any of these products!</li>
            <li> It was gentle on my skin and soothing.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> and there is no scrubbing involved, which is much healthier for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I received Simple eye make up remover as a free sample to test</li>
            <li> I received the Simple Eye Make-Up remover pads for free using Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> Although these pads DID remove eye makeup, they didn&#x27;t do it very well.</li>
            <li> than that, I like these pads and would recommend them to anyone, no matter how much eye make-up you wear.</li>
            <li> I received my Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads for free to review from Bzz.</li>
            <li> (It seems to me that this particular pouch-like package uses less material than a screw-top jar would, so that&#x27;s also nice.)  </li>
            <li> I just tried the complete Simple skincare range -- which includes their Radiance cleansing wipes, Oil Balancing cleansing wipes, eye makeup remover pads &amp; their Protecting light moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have used half of the pack and feel that most of the time, a pad does not remove as much as it should (and it is kind of rough on the eye area, which is very sensitive!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The facial cleansing wipes were fantastic, and left my face feeling clean and</li>
            <li> I am developing sensitive skin as I get older and many beauty products can irritate my face and neck but simple skincare products don&#x27;t contain alcohols or dyes</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product because it&#x27;s difficult to find a good eye product that will not sting or burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> Simple is VERY gentle on the most fragile skin there is.</li>
            <li> Two, they are the pleasantly moist; not so wet that they drip everywhere, but not so dry that you have to scrub.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to scrub to get my makeup off, nor did they make my eyes water like many of the other eye makeup removers.  </li>
            <li> so I was excited to find a potential alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying the simple eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li> They removed my mascara better than some other leading brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Overall I really did enjoy this product and it will be my new go-to.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have an imposing oder and left my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Which means that I clean my face day and night now as well as add moisturizer every morning before applying my makeup or going outside.  </li>
            <li> and I would have to use several pads to thoroughly clean my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Even rubbing your eyes they seem very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> So many products claim to be for sensitive skin, but end up causing a breakout or cause your skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> but you are still able to use one pad for both eyes even if your makeup is a dark smokey look.</li>
            <li> The line is Simple skincare and it included 4 products, full size I might add, not some sample size</li>
            <li> These make it simple enough to just remove your makeup while watching Netflix or reading--no need to get out of bed (perfect for lazy ol&#x27; me!).</li>
            <li> There are vitamins which are perfect for my eyes because they have been itching lately and a little irritated.</li>
            <li> Less is more in this case.</li>
            <li> I would possibly purchase these in the future since they are so much more enjoyable to use than the typical removers.</li>
            <li> feel I need two pads to remove my eyes (well 1.5 pads, I end up using the 2nd pad when I&#x27;m done with my eyes on quickly removing my foundation before I use a cleaser).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my second purchase and will buy even more in the future.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive I really can&#x27;t use much things on my face.</li>
            <li> I usually only wear mascara, but sometimes I add shadow and liner, so I like a remover pad to be able to handle either scenario equally well.  </li>
            <li> Also, I love the [[ASIN:B005TI7LHS Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes, 25 Count (Pack of 2)]], and hoped that these wipes would be just as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but these particular pads did the job nicely...without any problems.  </li>
            <li> The scentless pads are very soft and gently exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for people with very sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li> They are very moist and soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest avoiding the purchase of these pads unless you are seeking to damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very small wipes, but the most powerful ones I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> Much better than any other makeup remover I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> The makeup remover was was not as effective as some other brands I have tried such as Olay and CVS/Walgreens generics.</li>
            <li> When trying to take waterproof makeup off it does take a little more effort</li>
            <li> I love these little wipes.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little more effort when trying to remove waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> They are easily twice the size of any other eye makeup circular pads.  </li>
            <li> They are great for touch-ups and removing eyeshadow and liners, but useless against mascara.  </li>
            <li> I thought the cotton was soft and gentle which is a necessity for the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Five, it is gentle on my ever increasingly sensitive skin - no redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li> &quot; mascara I occasionally use, though even then they&#x27;re pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an economical option but after this just decided to go back to using the Neutrogena wipes!</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it did take a bit of elbow grease to get waterproof mascara off, I have a different make-up remover that is much easier to use, so I will not be using the Simple pads when I wear waterproof make-up, but otherwise they work great!  </li>
            <li> It also helps knowing that it has simple ingredients with no artificial perfume or dies.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye makeup remover products and have found some to be oily-leaving a film on my eyes, and others to be too harsh or drying.  </li>
            <li> like I normally would.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed by how thick the small pads were.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product, and it will be worth the try.</li>
            <li> Small and easy to carry around!</li>
            <li> These eye makeup remover pads have not caused me any adverse effects, only positive ones!  </li>
            <li> As eye makeup removers they&#x27;re fine, just not big enough.</li>
            <li> It took off every last bit of my dark waterproof eye makeup and it was very easy.</li>
            <li> I honestly was a little leery of trying a new facial product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear super heavy eye makeup (light eyeliner, non waterproof mascara, and a light shimmer eye shadow)</li>
            <li> These will be my new go-to makeup remover from now on.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, they&#x27;re a pretty good addition to a facial regimen, but you can probably achieve the same results with witch hazel pads or simple facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> They have a slight sort of cucumbery smell that is very mild and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all -- and I am BOTHERED by perfume.</li>
            <li> Simple eye makeup remover wipes easily removed a night outs worth of makeup in a few swipes while making my eyes feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation - will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> I had always had trouble getting my eye makeup off with the regular makeup remover pads out on the marker, but after joining a campaign through BzzAgent and receiving some of the Simple products for free, I completely fell in love with this line.</li>
            <li> Directions are clear as day and  ingredients are very visible for those who are sensitive, like I am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Simple products-I used to buy them in England before they were available in the US-because they&#x27;re practical.</li>
            <li> They are well-moistened, soft to the touch and do a great job removing eye make-up without having to scrub and potentially damage the delicate skin that surrounds the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> The pads are very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One pad cleaned both of my eyes and it was very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I always try to find something positive to say about a product even if it&#x27;s not my personal favorite, but these are just plain</li>
            <li> The small packaging is really convenient and easy to store.</li>
            <li> The cleaning face wipes left my skin moisturized, clean, and most importantly free of red patches and bumps, which has been the result of other face cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> it is small and cutely packaged.</li>
            <li> Usually not even around my anus.</li>
            <li> One of the first things I look for is, do they actually remove eye makeup?  </li>
            <li> The pads are a generously sized oval shape, which makes much more sense for eyes than a round shape!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you have sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t burn and it removes eye-makeup!</li>
            <li> Plus you can&#x27;t beat no harsh irritants!</li>
            <li> No rash from my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t be moist enough to remove all of the makeup</li>
            <li> I usually do not wear waterproof mascara, but when I did these wipes took it off without leaving marks or residue on my eyes.</li>
            <li> They also smell very clean but different than the other products.</li>
            <li> I genuinely like these as they work very well at removing eye makeup with just a small pad.</li>
            <li> The lack of moisture also makes them less comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as effective as Ponds, pads are small and not damp enough.</li>
            <li> The disks themselves are quite small, but they are so effective who needs them to be bigger?  </li>
            <li> Super gentle, takes makeup off fairly easily, a little work sometime required.</li>
            <li> I then used the pads to lightly rub those areas of my face where the eye makeup was smeared to try and remove it, and I woke up the next morning with very enlarged, darkly pigmented pores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most skin care products dry out my skin or leave it red and blotchy, but these Simple eye make-up removing pads didn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether they were trying to go light on the dissolving agent to make them more skin friendly, but something went wrong somewhere.  </li>
            <li> I am throughly please with Simple&#x27;s new skincare range and cannot wait to make it my new skincare regime for the summer!</li>
            <li> But honestly - that would make me more likely to give it a bad review if it did&#x27;t work -</li>
            <li> I steer clear from products that do the job because I have contact lenses and the skin under my eyes</li>
            <li> When I woke up, my skin felt clean and not grimy from the previous day.</li>
            <li> and I really like the Simple sensitive skin line.</li>
            <li> Work well and are sensitive for skin.</li>
            <li> Not harsh, not drying.</li>
            <li> not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Works well on my sensitive skin ...removes my waterproof mascara almost as well as &amp;#34;full strength&amp;#34; formulas.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this and buy it myself in the future!</li>
            <li> Still I wouldn&#x27;t suggest sticking them directly into your eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks Simple!</li>
            <li> They are non-irritating for my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive oily skin and these products have worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I also Removes all my makeup with some rubbing and doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to get the regular face make-up remover (not exfoliating) sheets and they really take off the eye make-up well.  </li>
            <li> I do not want to feel I have to rub to remove eye makeup, this has to be a gentle process, and between the scratchy pad and low moisture of the product, I would pass on these!</li>
            <li> These Simple Eye makeup remover wipes really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this eye makeup remover works.  </li>
            <li> I need to use one pad for each eye, but it completely removes mascara without having to scrub my eyes.  </li>
            <li> When I wear make up I only wear it on my eyes and because most removers make me break out in hives I avoid washing my face at night, one to avoid the reaction my skin has and two I really do not want to have to wash my entire face just to wash my eyes.</li>
            <li> I ended up using 3 pads to remove the make-up completely</li>
            <li> The pads are gentle and do not irritate my eyes, which is a definite plus!!  </li>
            <li> #1) No harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> 2)They are so soft.</li>
            <li> And it didnt burn like some removers do by the sensitive skin around my eye.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to be used around eyes without hurting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wearing much eye makeup (especially waterproof), expect to use 2-4 pads to remove everything.</li>
            <li> They are gentle enough to use over the eyes without causing irritation.  </li>
            <li> opening the package, I had a few coats of waterproof mascara on, and one wipe was more than enough for taking off the makeup on both of my eyes.</li>
            <li> do like the Simple line of products; they are just right for my, eh hem, aging skin, and the SIMPLE EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER PADS are no exception.  </li>
            <li> They barely took any makeup off and dried out so easily even though I ensured closing them.</li>
            <li> small and easy to throw in make up bag for overnight trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said they weren&#x27;t moist enough, but I found them to be great, I&#x27;ve used other pads that were too wet and the cleanser dripped into my eyes and burned, but these don&#x27;t drip at all.  </li>
            <li> I am an owner of super sensitive skin and many products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, even for sensitive skin, have left me with red, dry, bumpy skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these pads really help reduce that oily look after a long day.</li>
            <li> You have to use too many pads each time you need to remove make up (1) because they&#x27;re too small, and (2) because they don&#x27;t have enough product on the pad.  </li>
            <li> Most products claim to get the product off but it usually takes multiple applications and then after I wash my face</li>
            <li> I know that these pads got all of the traces of eye makeup off because after I took a shower there was no black lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Simple skin care product line!!</li>
            <li> but these DO in fact take off waterproof makeup like it says- very gently with minimal rubbing.</li>
            <li> pads are great with tough ups or when you mess up on the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This stuff was nice and gentle but sadly even after using two clothes on each side I still had makeup and mascara left.</li>
            <li> It takes way too long with way too much scrubbing to remove mascara and eyeliner, and there is always residue.</li>
            <li> So when I first open it, it got a scrubing side and a flat side.</li>
            <li> These little pads remove eye makeup quickly and efficiently, without any eye irritation.  </li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying how excited I was to get to try the eye makeup remover pads and a few other new products from the Simple Skincare line.  </li>
            <li> This product is gentle - a little too gentle as it doesn&#x27;t remove all of my waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> yes the glitter eyeliner came out easily but there were still some specs of glitter eyeliner which was hard to get it out.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little bit more wet.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye make up remover pad that I have found and they really get all the mascara and other products off the eyes gently.  </li>
            <li> My main problem with these is the ridges, it makes the wipes not as gentle and after rubbing it might cause slight irritation.</li>
            <li> Dried out quickly.</li>
            <li> The eye area is a very sensitive zone and therefore has to be treated with extra care as opposed to the rest of the face.</li>
            <li> These are two-sided and the sides are similar although not identical (one has more of a texture than the other), but you can use one side of the pad for one eye, then flip it and use the other side.  </li>
            <li> Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads were a bit of a disappointment after the great success I had with the other Simple brand products that I tried.</li>
            <li> - it has Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and a Super Peptide Complex, it has drastically reduced the fine lines, wrinkles and crows feet around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised this product was able to remove my eye make-up so easily considering the fact that I use oil base make-up.</li>
            <li> When used for my eyes, I generally have to use, wash my face, and then use again to get all of the makeup off.  </li>
            <li> - barely took off the maybeline tattoo cream shadow.</li>
            <li> It completely removed the eyeshadow (naked 2), but it did a so-so job at removing the mascara</li>
            <li> However these are almost completely ineffective in removing makeup ESPECIALLY mascara</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with Simple skin cares eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Simple Eye Make-up Remover pads are perfect--removing make-up completely, yet leaving no residue or dryness.  </li>
            <li> My 17 year old loves the Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads!</li>
            <li> I always had a difficult time finding a product that is gentle and that wont irritate my eyes, but this product in my opinion was great for my delicate eyes and does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these a few times but so far they are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the eye-makeup remover pads which get my thick eyeliner off in a snap without making my eyelids oily.</li>
            <li> The light moisturizer isn&#x27;t thick or greasy and protects from UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 15.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn and doesn&#x27;t leave behind raccoon eyes, so I am confident it take all the make up away.</li>
            <li> Smell is ok but not great.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend that you check out the new Simple Skincare products.  </li>
            <li> I found that the pads dried out quickly, and rather than actually remove the makeup,</li>
            <li> These get the spot right under my eyes that I always seem to have trouble getting to</li>
            <li> I know it says its for eye makeup but used it for my entire face and had no odd reactions to my skin.</li>
            <li> They get a little hung up on waterproof mascara and require a little more rubbing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super small</li>
            <li> The price is fair, but the package is very small and fits in the palm of my hand; which, mind you, I have small hands to begin</li>
            <li> Other eye makeup removers have irritated my eyes and these pads are really gentle.</li>
            <li> While they did remove my eye makeup, it took a little too much effort and rubbing, and the area around my eyes is just too sensitive to use them.</li>
            <li> Each night, I use Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads to gently cleanse and remove any eye makeup, even waterproof and long lasting eye make-up products.</li>
            <li> The textured side of the pad gets the bulk of the eye make-up and the pads are thick enough that the make-up does not go through to the other side, so then you can use the smooth side of the pad to make sure there is no more remaining on your eye.</li>
            <li> At first they didn&#x27;t seem moist enough to do the job, but it takes just a few swipes to completely remove all make-up.</li>
            <li> So I would definitely recommend any and all simple skincare products if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I think these pads wound up entrapping my eyeliner deep within my facial pores, so I looked as if I was wearing 7-day old makeup</li>
            <li> my eyes are extremely sensitive to EVERYTHING and get red, runny and gross.  </li>
            <li> however the only down fall is that after a while if you don&#x27;t use them consistently, they are drying out.</li>
            <li> I rate these highly only because they are better than other eye makeup removers I have used in the past... but they could use improvement in some areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I proceeded to remove a full eye look, complete with black mascara and black liquid liner.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my face really well, and best of all, doesn&#x27;t smell bad or leave behind any sort of residue.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t really work well with my waterproof mascara, however, it worked well with my dark eye shadow and liner.</li>
            <li> Before trying this product out, I didn&#x27;t know much about the Simple brand, other than it being another skincare line out on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- 1st time out the the package and the pads were not wet enough</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried a lot of various makeup wipes, I was pleasantly surprised with Simple&#x27;s approach to making wipes especially for the eye area.</li>
            <li> These are amazingly small, but powerful wipes.</li>
            <li> o received these and a few other Simple products free through bzzagent</li>
            <li> These pads also sport a slight texture that helps in gently wiping off makeup.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just slightly moist, making them useful for a very short time before they dry up.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and non irritating.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than having remover pads dry out before you&#x27;ve been able to use them.  </li>
            <li> This pocket-sized pack has large, pre-moistened eye makeup remover pads (each a little smaller than your palm) that can remove makeup from BOTH eyes--</li>
            <li> I really like using these little pads to get stubborn eye makeup off at night.</li>
            <li> These little pads work very well for simple makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> Good product, a little expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> I do recommend these pads for someone who has a sensitive or delicate eye area like myself that doesn&#x27;t like to do too much work to remove their eye make-up.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of swipes (no harsh scrubbing like with other makeup remover pads) and my makeup is gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think that these products are extremely beneficial for those who are living with sensitive skin, and if you don&#x27;t mind using a couple of the pads you should have no problem getting your make-up off.</li>
            <li> Should do okay with powder shadows but pretty worthless for waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> These work, but I noticed that I was having to scrub pretty hard to remove all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> I worry that stuffing the next pad back in will contaminate the package or dry them</li>
            <li> This is not my first complaint about this issue.  </li>
            <li> It did not take long for the makeup to come off, and it did not leave a greasy residue, as some similar products do.</li>
            <li> These are my new eye makeup removers hands down!</li>
            <li> product does not burn my eyes, or make the area red after use, like other more expensive pads</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin, and I try to buy \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; products, but it always seems like they don&#x27;t actually take the makeup off without scrubbing my face raw.</li>
            <li> I like the Simple Eye Make-Up Remover pads because they don&#x27;t leave my eyes or skin dry.</li>
            <li> morning, I found myself seated on the toilet, having just finished &#x27;busting a grumpy&#x27;...</li>
            <li> They are thick and moist which really helped get my make-up off after a long day and multiple re-applications.</li>
            <li> Generally I have to use an oil based remover that is a bit messy and leaves potential for getting a bit of film in the eyes</li>
            <li> Long Wearing Eye Makeup Remover on the pad to get my mascara off.</li>
            <li> not completely remove waterproof mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they remain moist a long time</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin or doesnt like harsh make up removers.</li>
            <li> Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex]]</li>
            <li> but so does every other makeup remover I&#x27;ve used in my entire life, if you stop to think about it.</li>
            <li> I found Target was selling other items in the Simple line, but the eye make-up remover pads were not there.  </li>
            <li> and ACTUALLY I had been having issues with this in other eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li> I know some other reviewers say they aren&#x27;t moist enough - but the thing is - if they were too moist, then it would get all in your eyes.</li>
            <li> The little pads don&#x27;t have any revolutionary compounds that would make them a necessary addition to any facial regimen.</li>
            <li> These were incredibly dry remover pads</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry them out either.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I&#x27;m tired and also don&#x27;t want to go through a big struggle to get ready for bed.</li>
            <li> Not only did the pad feel like it was far too scratchy for the delicate eye area</li>
            <li> The Simple® Eye Make-Up Remover Pads do not irritate my eyes and one single pad took off even my water proof mascara.</li>
            <li> Overall, they were just average</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small the packaging and wipes were</li>
            <li> I wear minimal makeup and my eyes were left extremely irritated from using these to remove my mascara.</li>
            <li> In addition, I feel the pad is too rough and could matter to skin integrity after long term use.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t loose any lashes and didn&#x27;t have to tug on eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They actually dripped onto my dresser when I was taking them out of the package, but not too moist that they dripped down my face during use.  </li>
            <li> I actually prefer that they aren&#x27;t so moist, you don&#x27;t have the liquid running down your face or getting into your eyes.</li>
            <li> It removes mascara better than any cleansing wipe I&#x27;ve ever tried, usually it leaves behind some traces of black under my eye but not this.</li>
            <li> no longer feels dry!</li>
            <li> Here are my comments, in no particular order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They seemed to dry out faster than most--even though I was careful to reseal the package after use.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t too wet, and they weren&#x27;t too dry</li>
            <li> These did not irritate eyes and they were small but big enough to take off eye make-up on both eyes.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t left with the next day racoon eyes, as I usually am.</li>
            <li> The pads are surprisingly dry, and the material seems a bit thicker than it needs to be, which makes it harder to get around the corners of your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is they do seem a little dry when you pull one out of the pack, but even though they feel that way</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being the sort of fellow who isn&#x27;t really a \\&quot;planner\\&quot; I had failed to take notice of the empty toilet paper roll prior to squatting.  </li>
            <li> You will always get a little bit of makeup remover in your eye, and generally your eyes prefer not to have foreign things put in them.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sting my eyes like other products, they are compact for traveling, and they stay moist as long as you wrap them up well.  </li>
            <li> , they remove my waterproof mascara with ease, allowing me to be gentle on my delicate eye area, but still getting rid of all the black.  </li>
            <li> I actually found that they irritated my eye area because they were a little rougher than some of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Fourth, they remove all my make-up with the one little pad, not just my eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, my eyes and the skin around my eyes do not feel dry or chapped as with some other eye make-up removers.  </li>
            <li> My husband actually asked me this morning what I was doing differently lately because he no longer felt as though he was waking up next to a raccoon every morning.</li>
            <li> be.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I would say is that they don&#x27;t seem to be moist enough.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no scent.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to participate in a campaign to try a few Simple products and the eye make-up remover is one of them.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these.</li>
            <li> You may need a few extra swipes to wash away mascara.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the minimal packaging of these eye make remover pads.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no scent and not greasy.</li>
            <li> 2 stars because after a few cloths its all gone but definitely did not do what I hoped.</li>
            <li> Makeup remover pads should remove make with minimal scrubbing and abrasion to the skin.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that they feel a little dry</li>
            <li> The only downside I found with them is they are a little bit small, but that is not too bad, and it&#x27;s kind of rough.</li>
            <li> I had expected them to remove mascara a little faster/easier than they did, but I also don&#x27;t have much experience with other eye make-up remover pads, and it&#x27;s not like it took a ridiculous amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I have various categories which you will see listed below, but my rating system might be a little different from the usual.  </li>
            <li> These little pads aren&#x27;t very expensive and they do their job for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that if you only wear a little bit of makeup every day, then these are for you!</li>
            <li> a little on the rough side for delicate eye area &amp; doesn&#x27;t take off waterproof completely - I still wake up with smudges under eyes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I think they could have been a little bit larger.</li>
            <li> and I never have any problems with my skin feeling oily afterwards, as with other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I can use one small wipe for my entire face!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find any other makeup cleanser pads like these ones.</li>
            <li> I only use this product for my eye makeup because the tissues are small.</li>
            <li> So are all the other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> With waterproof mascara, they miss the mark due to lack of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t in the box with the one other item on this order.</li>
            <li> I use the other side to swipe my face makeup off before cleansing too.</li>
            <li> Also the product did not bother my contacts like some other oil based products I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other wipes or pads do, I didn&#x27;t have to pull or tug a lot to remove the eye make-up</li>
            <li> It does get the other make-up off.  </li>
            <li> And I like that it is not too big or too small of a pad</li>
            <li> Fist of all, it says that it removes waterproof mascara, but these pads definitely were not able to remove all of my waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> like I have found other eye pads to</li>
            <li> I waited all day to try them because the other ones I used sucked.</li>
            <li> Since they were a little dry I also had to rub my eyes quite a bit to take off all my mascara</li>
            <li> These are little round pads similar in size to Tucks pads.  </li>
            <li> Given the description, I would have expected these to be a little softer.</li>
            <li> I do have to scrub a little bit but not much</li>
            <li> /&gt; A little rough for the eye area</li>
            <li> I find myself constantly PRESSING hard against my skin to get all the makeup out.</li>
            <li> When I saw that they weren&#x27;t supposed to irritate the eyes, I REALLY went in as if to try and prove them wrong, and they did not burn my eyes one bit.</li>
            <li> After using this remover in the evening and then moisturizing, I find that I wake up with dark circles from left-over mascara that has migrated overnight.  </li>
            <li> I like to use these wipes to remove all of the dark makeup circles that form under my eyes after sweating all day.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear much eye makeup to begin with, but these are so small and thin that I had to use 2-3 pads to &amp;#34;remove&amp;#34; the makeup from both eyes.</li>
            <li> And this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> So I gave her the average, which is basically Louis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin around our eyes is already thin and sensitive so having a product that delivers antioxidants is just an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> the simple wipes don&#x27;t irritate my eyes or face at all whereas the other products on the market have seriously hurt my face.</li>
            <li> I use about two a day to wipe down my face at work.</li>
            <li> I mean, isn&#x27;t washing my face enough?</li>
            <li> This then usually leads to dry and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The little package is slightly hard to open and had to be cut, which helps make the drying out process quicker.  </li>
            <li> The only somewhat negative thing I can say about these pads is that they are a little scratchy</li>
            <li> These took off my waterproof black mascara and eyeliner without leaving traces of makeup around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Previously I was using a liquid that I dab on a cotton ball</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not waking up with black around eyes.  </li>
            <li> And it costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> I have been using them and on a plus my eyes are a lot less sore, beings I would sleep with makeup on.</li>
            <li> I can still see traces of black eye makeup smeared under my eye.</li>
            <li> slightly irritates when done</li>
            <li> I usually have to scrub very hard but not with these soft pads that wiped my makeup away with ease!</li>
            <li> They were a little bit dry and too small for my needs</li>
            <li> greasy after rub mess.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s waterproof-it will not clean that off.</li>
            <li> Do they sting a little?</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife after reading about them; she likes them, but she feels they are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> with a little effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- required a little effort to fully remove it&lt;br /&gt;- did not have an offensive odor</li>
            <li> but these wipes took off my smoky eye with little effort.</li>
            <li> One little pad removes all my eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara...</li>
            <li> Usually my eyes burn and turn extremely blotchy, which is why I used to refrain from using eye make-up removing products in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep them in my car for days when my face starts to feel a little oily and keep a pack at home for removing makeup at night.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li> wear eye liner, shadow, and mascara, and the pads took off everything with little scrubbing.</li>
            <li> A little history -</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not soaking and I did have to work a little on my eyeliner</li>
            <li> One pad is sufficient for both eyes, so this little package lasts me a month.  </li>
            <li> It took a little bit longer with the waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> but it did take a little effort to get the make up off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble in the past with eye make-up remover irritating my eyes, but these pads are soft and haven&#x27;t caused any issues at all.  </li>
            <li> The problem I have is that the little sticker that &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; the package loses it stick after a few days and the pads dry out.  </li>
            <li> The Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads seem to be a little dry and do a mediocre job of removing eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> Package is small wipes are small and dry.</li>
            <li> I want off at the end of the day and am generally too tired or lazy to wash my face.</li>
            <li> It does take a few swipes to get it all, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and was skeptical about the remover.  </li>
            <li> too small not worth the price</li>
            <li> This is mite poo, dead mites, eggs, you name it.  </li>
            <li> you use a lot of heavily pigmented eyeshadow, eyeliner, with waterproof mascara?&lt;br /&gt;Skip</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, they&#x27;re not great at actually removing mascara.  </li>
            <li> It also did not feel drying or harsh on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using then for a few days now</li>
            <li> I recently went on vacation and when I returned to the hotel I was so exhausted, I took a wipe and took off all my makeup then went to bed.</li>
            <li> but they did work well enough just not great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but its really harsh on my skin still even though it says it is for senstive skin.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about a few things before trying these products.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want anything that is going to irritate it, or make my acne worse, these do neither!</li>
            <li> I wear heavy makeup on my eyes and this took it off effortlessly; However the wipes itself are a tad rougher than Simple´s radiance wipes (something I don&#x27;t understand as they are intended for the eye area)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and gets the makeup off without heavy scrubbing.</li>
            <li> this was made worse by the fact that the package did not stay sealed enough after opening it and closing it a few times.</li>
            <li> the pads are small which cuts down on waste.</li>
            <li> Disappointed - these were too dry to remove much of my makeup</li>
            <li> Takes less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> When all is said and done, I usually have to go to the soap and water to get what pads have left behind.</li>
            <li> The pad may seem thin or small but it really is enough for me.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I pulled out one pad and it as near dry to the touch.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, if a makeup remover doesn&#x27;t work at least as well as olive oil, it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed:(  This was touted in a magazine as excellent for removing even waterproof mascaras.  </li>
            <li> Small package.</li>
            <li> only thing wrong with these &amp;#34;pre moistened&amp;#34; eye pads is they leave a greasy residue on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually need 2 pads to remove all my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I just received this product in my BzzAgent kit and tried them out over the past week..</li>
            <li> For a small package like this-</li>
            <li> They work well, but it is a small package.</li>
            <li> Mascara and eyeliner makes my eyes look fantastic, but I&#x27;ve always hated trying to get all of the makeup off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> They are thin and rough, and if you want to get mascara off you have to sit there and scrub with them, which does your skin</li>
            <li> Not sure if that would affect the product at all; I&#x27;ll have to research that</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t remove my eye makeup before bed because it&#x27;s a hassle</li>
            <li> But its too small.</li>
            <li> I never used make up remover pads before, just usually liquid that had to be put on a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> small concern -</li>
            <li> it is difficult to only get one pad out of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> The pads are small and they feel a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup very heavily either</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re very small wipes with a somewhat harsh texture in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t feel the burning, stinging or irritating effects that you get from other cleansing products.</li>
            <li> but i find sometimes i have to rub too hard.</li>
            <li> So... there I sat, desperately needing a cleanup on Aisle 1... without the proper tools for the job.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I have to use at least two pads to get my eyeliner off, and that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m not wearing any mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simple® Eye Make-Up Remover Pads remove my eye makeup well without drying my skin or making it icky and greasy.  </li>
            <li> taking the Browns to the Superbowl.&lt;br /&gt;Alright, alright, for the slow kids.  </li>
            <li> One pad gets off all my liner, eyeshadow and thick layered mascara.</li>
            <li> Despite their thinness, the material is quite rigid and scratchy, which is very uncomfortable on such delicate skin as the eyes.</li>
            <li> Very small</li>
            <li> Usually make-up removing pads don&#x27;t do their job, leaving make-up behind.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually too tired to bother.</li>
            <li> use 2 together for cnntrol...but very small area</li>
            <li> This is a very small packet too.</li>
            <li> I suspect some serious waterproof stuff might need a stronger product.</li>
            <li> SUPER ANNOYING!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to everybody that is looking for an eyes makeup remover pads that remove the dramatic makeup!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as bad for the environment when I am throwing away this tiny disk.</li>
            <li> I often resist wearing eye make up because it is so difficult to remove without scrubbing or using a harsh cleaner.</li>
            <li> no good whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not good to removed waterproof makeup without scrubbing at my eyes and causing irritation.</li>
            <li> They are not good for removing eye make up.</li>
            <li> with the rough texture this made the experience unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> You have to work very hard to remove your mascara, and even when I just swiped them over my foundation</li>
            <li> and  leaves a lot of eye makeup behind.</li>
            <li> I like their practice behind their ingredients.</li>
            <li> I only hate it because I need it</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t broken out after</li>
            <li> but I did not have any issues with them irritating my eyes</li>
            <li> I want something delicate that will not require tugging on that area around my eyes, and worse, pulling out my eyelashes that I would like to keep!  </li>
            <li> I always have the issue with eye makeup removers irritating my eyes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job and removed my eye make-up without irritating my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Look here is the deal: these take off my glue like false eyelash like mascara, without smelling like a chemical factory.  </li>
            <li> Before I had these I was very lazy about removing my make up!</li>
            <li> I accidentally got some in my eye, and it burned a little, but was not too bad.</li>
            <li> so it does not give me zits down my cheeks, but day is bad, these are useless.</li>
            <li> All the water and soap mess is just annoying before bed.</li>
            <li> Small!!!</li>
            <li> Alot of times I use wipes I break out or have a weird reaction I do not experience any of this after using this product</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they failed to remove waterproof mascara as they promised even after allowing the pad to sit along my lash line for 30 seconds at a time.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t remove the residue I was wearing glitter eyeliner</li>
            <li> The amount of oil on my face decreased and stayed that way throughout the day!</li>
            <li> and I always have a difficult time finding a product that removes ALL of my makeup.</li>
            <li> It unfortunately did not deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that I do not recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> and I hate having to scrub so hard that my eyelashes get ripped out from the removers as well.</li>
            <li> They also leave out the artificial perfumes and dyes.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would make my skin  as well as cause a breakout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have artificial perfumes or dyes.  </li>
            <li> I can just swipe these over my eyes and they remove my eye makeup without having to rub like crazy.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my eyes had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I am shocked how well they work</li>
            <li> yet I have been trying to find something to remove it at nights because they are hard to take off!!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> In reality, I really do hate to complain</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve used about three PADS and am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible!  </li>
            <li> but I hate removing it!</li>
            <li> I am terrible about removing my eyemakeup at night!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Given the description, I would have expected these to be a little softer. I actually found that they irritated my eye area because they were a little rougher than some of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love the concept of the Simple eye makeup remover pads, and they removed my eyeshadow nicely.  However it only removed a bit of my waterproof mascara (Bobbi Brown&#x27;s No Smudge Mascara), so it&#x27;s back to my bottle of Lancome&#x27;s Bi-Facil.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like using these little pads to get stubborn eye makeup off at night. It does take a few swipes to get it all, but I don&#x27;t mind. The fragrance is light and I never have any problems with my skin feeling oily afterwards, as with other products I&#x27;ve used. I also have not had any problems with stinging in my eyes, which can happen easily when you are using any kind of soap around your eyes. If they were also flushable, then they&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
            <li> These were not quite what I thought I was ordering. As eye makeup removers they&#x27;re fine, just not big enough. Work well and are sensitive for skin.</li>
            <li> Very small wipes, but the most powerful ones I&#x27;ve used... Do the job very well and I wear watrproof mascara and I also use them for the rest of my face. I can use one small wipe for my entire face!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup that well.</li>
            <li> As gentle as advertised! Not oily and easily removes makeup. I like the so much, I&#x27;ve added it to my &amp;#34;Subscribe &amp; Save&amp;#34; service with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very small and it does not remove make up well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool&lt;br /&gt;but it smells horible&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s super small</li>
            <li> Not as effective as Ponds, pads are small and not damp enough. Not enough included in my opinion for the price. I do better with Ponds ...</li>
            <li> Love these for removing my eye makeup. So easy to use and way better than my old method of using oily eye makeup remover and cotton pads. These took off my waterproof black mascara and eyeliner without leaving traces of makeup around my eyes. Really impressed and will definitely order again.Also this was my 1st Simple brand purchase.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the liquid version.  To work well, I think you need more product than these tiny pads provide.</li>
            <li> removes my eye makeup but i find sometimes i have to rub too hard. at home i&#x27;ve gone back to liquid remover and a cotton pad. these are great for travel. no worries about the 3oz rule in my carry on.</li>
            <li> Small package. Much better than any other makeup remover I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation - will definitely be ordering more of these. Great product!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful and affordable. This is the only eye make up remover pad that I have found and they really get all the mascara and other products off the eyes gently.  Not harsh, not drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all the products in the \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; line, and was in a bit of a bind until I came across these. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup at all, and what eye makeup I wear is very light, but it still wasn&#x27;t coming off effectively with simple cleanser... at least not with the amount of scrubbing-soap-around-my-eyes that I was willing to do. So, I got these, and that problem is solved. They take off the bit of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara I occasionally use, though even then they&#x27;re pretty gentle. I suspect some serious waterproof stuff might need a stronger product.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t remove eye make-up (specifically eyeliner) as I had hoped. I mistakenly thought they were wipes and they&#x27;re very small wipes with a somewhat harsh texture in my opinion. I was looking for an economical option but after this just decided to go back to using the Neutrogena wipes! They were wonders compared to these.</li>
            <li> I love these although I do not buy goods for the claims of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34;. I genuinely like these as they work very well at removing eye makeup with just a small pad. It only takes a couple of swipes (no harsh scrubbing like with other makeup remover pads) and my makeup is gone. I buy these regularly now and would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are perfect. They don&#x27;t bother my eyes and get all my mascara off.</li>
            <li> Will not buy this product again.  Doesn&#x27;t work very well at all and  leaves a lot of eye makeup behind.</li>
            <li> it is small and cutely packaged. It works really well. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Got these makeup pads for my mother and let me tell you...my mother loved these makeup remover wipes. Couldn&#x27;t find any other makeup cleanser pads like these ones. She not only used them for her eyes, but as a makeup cleanser pad to remove her foundation. My mother had acne and these pads got rid of ALL the makeup. I totally recommend these wipes!</li>
            <li> Favorite brand of make up remover!</li>
            <li> these are very nice and gentle while effective.</li>
            <li> These eye make-up remover pads were just OK for me. Here are my comments, in no particular order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrance and dye-free&lt;br /&gt;- Lint-free&lt;br /&gt;- The ingredients did not cause an allergic reaction on my eyelids, which is the one place I tend to get rashes when an ingredient does not work for me, so that was very positive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- Irritated my eyes - they were quite red afterwards&lt;br /&gt;- Required a lot of wiping and dabbing along the lid line, especially with the textured side of the pad, to get rid of all of my eye makeup, specifically my Clinique Quickliner for Eyes Intense. It seems that the waxy consistency of that eyeliner was rather resistant to these pads. The smooth side of the pad did almost nothing and remained rather clean throughout.&lt;br /&gt;- The extensive wiping also did not feel that great on the skin around my eyes and in the end I just stopped for fear of real irritation from the repeated wiping. Most of the makeup was gone but not everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;Might buy this again for traveling because of the convenience but overall the product did not convince me all the way.</li>
            <li> not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I used these to get my waterproof mascara off.  It worked great, and did not require too much scrubbing. I will probably buy again.</li>
            <li> These little pads aren&#x27;t very expensive and they do their job for the most part.  I have yet to try them with waterproof mascara but they take off regular mascara and eyeliners off without many problems.  I  do find I have to use more than one pad per eye if I had on liner especially gel liner. The solution on the pad doesn&#x27;t sting  and over all it&#x27;s a good product but could be improved.</li>
            <li> Works well on my sensitive skin ...removes my waterproof mascara almost as well as &amp;#34;full strength&amp;#34; formulas.</li>
            <li> I do like these, and they get the 4 coats of mascara off of my eyes. My mistake was thinking these were face wipes....not just eye wipes. They are only big enough for your eyes.</li>
            <li> Terrible!  Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup well by any means.  Its also only for eyes, which I didn&#x27;t know when I purchased (my mistake).  When used for my eyes, I generally have to use, wash my face, and then use again to get all of the makeup off.  Wont be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I often resist wearing eye make up because it is so difficult to remove without scrubbing or using a harsh cleaner. I have sensitive skin and many of the liquid eye make up remover burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite happy with this product. I did not have to scrub my eyes and it cleaned off all the remaining make up. My only complaint is I think they could have been a little bit larger.</li>
            <li> These pads are about 40mm diameter. They remove makeup well and are nice when traveling just to freshen up. Great!</li>
            <li> Disappointed - these were too dry to remove much of my makeup - barely took off the maybeline tattoo cream shadow. Should do okay with powder shadows but pretty worthless for waterproof mascara.  Hoping they work for touch up so it isn&#x27;t a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> These do a good job of removing your eye makeup (mascara), but they are a bit on the rough side - texture wise.</li>
            <li> First off, I am impressed that these pads DO in fact remove waterproof mascara.  Very nice for sensitive skin!  Overall, great product, and I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that these do a fine job removing make-up from the eyes, I wouldn&#x27;t know first hand, because I am a guy.  A guy who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup on my eyes.  My wife does, however, and that&#x27;s how I became acquainted with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see, how can I share this here without using language that runs afoul of the Amazon censors?&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I found myself seated on the toilet, having just finished &#x27;busting a grumpy&#x27;... and...&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s that? You don&#x27;t understand?&lt;br /&gt;I was blowing mud.  Building a log cabin.  You know...dropping the kids off at the pool?&lt;br /&gt;A code brown.  I was freeing the turtles.  Expelling the hamster.  I gave birth to a state trooper.&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;mon REALLY?  Still lost?  I was launching a rocket.  Greasing the punch bowl...  taking the Browns to the Superbowl.&lt;br /&gt;Alright, alright, for the slow kids.  I went poop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the sort of fellow who isn&#x27;t really a \\&quot;planner\\&quot; I had failed to take notice of the empty toilet paper roll prior to squatting.  So... there I sat, desperately needing a cleanup on Aisle 1... without the proper tools for the job.&lt;br /&gt;What to do?&lt;br /&gt;I was in luck though because, within arms reach was a pack of these that my wife had left sitting on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;They made cleanup a breeze.  No burning or stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One great benefit to using these for that particular chore, is that if you happen to be someone who applies eye shadow or mascara to your anus these things will remove it for you right along with the fecal residue. That is just a theory on my part, because as I said I&#x27;m a dude, so I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup.  Usually not even around my anus.</li>
            <li> These work well enough and are cheap and affordable, for that Im happy but I wish they were more moist</li>
            <li> Very nice for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> a little on the rough side for delicate eye area &amp; doesn&#x27;t take off waterproof completely - I still wake up with smudges under eyes.</li>
            <li> Works ok for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and was skeptical about the remover.  Most products burn my eyes,  as well as my skin.  Not so with this.  The price is reasonable.  The only drawback is that it takes more than one pad per eye.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and convenient. I am using this all the time to remove my makeup. however the only down fall is that after a while if you don&#x27;t use them consistently, they are drying out.</li>
            <li> Super gentle, takes makeup off fairly easily, a little work sometime required. But, it&#x27;s not oily and it&#x27;s super gentle on the peepers.</li>
            <li> I like these wipes. Alot of times I use wipes I break out or have a weird reaction I do not experience any of this after using this product</li>
            <li> One of the greatest products</li>
            <li> I like these pads.  They are super convenient and easy and do a great job of removing my eye makeup (Urban Decay shadow and liner and Benefit mascara).  The problem I have is that the little sticker that &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; the package loses it stick after a few days and the pads dry out.  It needs a container that is airtight.</li>
            <li> I really like these eye make up remover pads.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not burn my eyes, or make the area red after use, like other more expensive pads have.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is small, and fits perfectly in your make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price..Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these pads really help reduce that oily look after a long day. I use about two a day to wipe down my face at work.</li>
            <li> This product was inexpensive, gentle on my eyes, and was strong enough to remove my waterproof mascara and gel eyeliner! I only use this product for my eye makeup because the tissues are small. Overall, great product, and I would buy when!</li>
            <li> This does not take make up off well at all!</li>
            <li> This stuff was ok. I had to use two pads, front and back, to remove eyeliner and mascara and no eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> These eye makeup remover pads were OK but not the best I have used. They seemed to dry out faster than most--even though I was careful to reseal the package after use. The makeup remover was was not as effective as some other brands I have tried such as Olay and CVS/Walgreens generics.</li>
            <li> Look here is the deal: these take off my glue like false eyelash like mascara, without smelling like a chemical factory.  They have a slight sort of cucumbery smell that is very mild and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all -- and I am BOTHERED by perfume. The disks themselves are quite small, but they are so effective who needs them to be bigger?  Do they sting a little? ummmm maybe sometimes, but so does every other makeup remover I&#x27;ve used in my entire life, if you stop to think about it. You will always get a little bit of makeup remover in your eye, and generally your eyes prefer not to have foreign things put in them.  But I love these and now have them on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with these eye makeup remover pads.  One of the first things I look for is, do they actually remove eye makeup?  I&#x27;m happy to report that they do -- even waterproof eyeliner and mascara.  I feel that these do a better job than the last product I tried (some La Fresh wipes) at getting all my mascara off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, and this is also very important, but they don&#x27;t sting or cause my eyes to burn.  I wear contact lenses and have somewhat sensitive eyes, so I&#x27;m always happy when a product is gentle, as these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the package open for a couple of weeks now and the pads are still plenty damp/wet and show no signs of drying out.  The adhesive on the closure is still strong.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d leave these for a month or two without using them, but for the short term, the package being open doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.  (It seems to me that this particular pouch-like package uses less material than a screw-top jar would, so that&#x27;s also nice.)  These are two-sided and the sides are similar although not identical (one has more of a texture than the other), but you can use one side of the pad for one eye, then flip it and use the other side.  They also remove lip stains and lipstick.</li>
            <li> These work very well on my eye makeup and are scent free, which I appreciate.  I just wish they were a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Very effective to remove eye make without causing dryness</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not work to remove waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> too small not worth the price</li>
            <li> love these... do not burn your skin.  great product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It cleans my face really well, and best of all, doesn&#x27;t smell bad or leave behind any sort of residue.</li>
            <li> only thing wrong with these &amp;#34;pre moistened&amp;#34; eye pads is they leave a greasy residue on your skin.  If you plan on washing your face this is fine.  But not all of us use these for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these to remove the dirt from Demodex Mites.  This is mite poo, dead mites, eggs, you name it.  So at night it is ok to have grease there to catch bug dirt so it does not give me zits down my cheeks, but day is bad, these are useless. So are all the other brands I have tried.  I just use baby shampoo on my fingers if I have a sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use these in the middle of the night to get an eyewash without waking up and turning on lights.</li>
            <li> Excellent product-excellent value-excellent skin after using it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely no scent. The small packaging is really convenient and easy to store. However, they aren&#x27;t very moist and won&#x27;t really remove any significant application of make-up. They are great for touch-ups and removing eyeshadow and liners, but useless against mascara.  Super-expensive, too. Buy yourself a bottle of Almay oil-free makeup remover and use with a Q-tip instead.</li>
            <li> I got these for free as part of a BzzAgent Campaign, and I must say, I would definitely use these again. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but these did the trick for me. If you wear a lot, you&#x27;ll need to use more than one pad. I liked these, because they did not leave my face feeling oily like other brands that I&#x27;ve used. They are also great if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most skin care products dry out my skin or leave it red and blotchy, but these Simple eye make-up removing pads didn&#x27;t!  Other reviewers said they weren&#x27;t moist enough, but I found them to be great, I&#x27;ve used other pads that were too wet and the cleanser dripped into my eyes and burned, but these don&#x27;t drip at all.  I thought the cotton was soft and gentle which is a necessity for the eye area.  My only complaint would be that it did take a bit of elbow grease to get waterproof mascara off, I have a different make-up remover that is much easier to use, so I will not be using the Simple pads when I wear waterproof make-up, but otherwise they work great!  I did receive a free trial of this product to review, but I will be purchasing it in the future!</li>
            <li> I received these free to try out from Bzzagent.com. I loved them. I dont wear a lot of eye makeup because my eyes are sensitive to most eye makeup removers. These did not hurt my eyes and did the job pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Simple Eye Make-Up remover pad. I was given this product as a free sample and hen I first opened the pack, I was impressed with the size of the pads - one pad was large enough to take the make-up off of both of my eyes.  Also, I use waterproof mascara and it came off wonderfully.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble in the past with eye make-up remover irritating my eyes, but these pads are soft and haven&#x27;t caused any issues at all.  I would absolutely recommend this and buy it myself in the future!</li>
            <li> Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads were a bit of a disappointment after the great success I had with the other Simple brand products that I tried. Unfortunately, they failed to remove waterproof mascara as they promised even after allowing the pad to sit along my lash line for 30 seconds at a time. On the positive side, however, they were suitably textured to remove my regular mascara and did not cause any eye sensitivity or skin dryness. Thank you, Simple! (I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.)</li>
            <li> I received simple eye make up remover for free thro bzzagent.com. I am that person that just rubs their eye makeup off at the end of the day with some Soap and water! This then usually leads to dry and irritated skin. Using the simple&lt;br /&gt;Skin makeup remover was so much better for my skin! Since using this product my skin has not been as irritated and no longer feels dry! FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I have to admit...I thought that taking the time to take off my mascara / eyeline / eye makeup was entirely too time consuming...I mean, isn&#x27;t washing my face enough? And if you are anything like me (a working, mom-of-4 (fur) babies, spouse, chef, housekeeper, woman of many hats!), actually washing my face at night is mostly optional as well. This isn&#x27;t good...considering I am predisposed to jaw line acne. I was chosen to participate in a campaign to try a few Simple products and the eye make-up remover is one of them. My husband actually asked me this morning what I was doing differently lately because he no longer felt as though he was waking up next to a raccoon every morning. (Yeah, no worries - he got a nice arm punch for that!) I love these pads! I now use the Radiance wipes to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my face at night and follow that up with the eye make-up remover pads and done! Takes less than 5 minutes! THANK YOU SIMPLE! I love you. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I received these as part of the BZZAGENT campaign. I honestly was a little leery of trying a new facial product. So many products claim to be for sensitive skin, but end up causing a breakout or cause your skin to dry out. The Simple skin care products do not!! I am actually really glad I got picked to do this campaign because the products are great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the eye make-up remover pads. They are thick and moist which really helped get my make-up off after a long day and multiple re-applications. They also work on waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Simple skin care product line!!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of these eye makeup remover wipes and was pretty impressed!  I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to scrub to get my makeup off, nor did they make my eyes water like many of the other eye makeup removers.  They didn&#x27;t have an imposing oder and left my skin feeling clean.  I was really pleased with them!</li>
            <li> I received these eye makeup remover pads for free as part of a bzzagent campaign. These pads work wonderfully, they really do take your make-up so easily. When trying to take waterproof makeup off it does take a little more effort but you are still able to use one pad for both eyes even if your makeup is a dark smokey look. The only thing is they do seem a little dry when you pull one out of the pack, but even though they feel that way they still get done job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> Simple says: Our Cleansing Facial Wipes refresh and nourish your skin plus remove waterproof mascara. Our wipes contain a perfect blend of our purest possible skin loving ingredients with an added vitamin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple is the name, it is simple to use, I got the change to use the simple product line through a BzzAgent campaign, and I will continue to use these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They use NO ALCOHOL, NO ARTIFICIAL PERFUMES, NO OIL, NO DYES, NON DRYING, NO GREASY residue and NO HARSH IRRITANTS to upset skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use waterproof mascara, but not that often because many products fail to remove my mascara, however, Simple has changed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself wearing my mascara more because there was a way to remove it, without oily residue. The remover pads were just moist enough to do one eye.&lt;br /&gt;With is also a drawback, because each pad could be a little more moist, enough to do both eyes would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> I have used other Simple products (lotion mostly) and really liked it so I decided to try the eye make up remover.  Previously I was using a liquid that I dab on a cotton ball and it was a real struggle to get all the eyeliner and mascara off.  But the simple pad works SO much better!  I can wipe all my make up off with no issues at all and I&#x27;m not waking up with black around eyes.  I&#x27;m very impressed and plan to continue using the product!</li>
            <li> The pads do a fairly good job at removing eye makeup and mascara. It does a better job at moving eyeshadow than mascara. I used Urban Decay Naked 2 and Benefit Mascara. It completely removed the eyeshadow (naked 2), but it did a so-so job at removing the mascara (benefit they&#x27;re real! mascara)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel I need two pads to remove my eyes (well 1.5 pads, I end up using the 2nd pad when I&#x27;m done with my eyes on quickly removing my foundation before I use a cleaser). I find myself constantly PRESSING hard against my skin to get all the makeup out. The reason for that is because the pads are not moist enough. the reasealable seal often opens so it lets air in and it dries the pads even further :\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pads are great with tough ups or when you mess up on the eyeshadow. With waterproof mascara, they miss the mark due to lack of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend this? Only for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Do you use a lot of heavily pigmented eyeshadow, eyeliner, with waterproof mascara?&lt;br /&gt;Skip it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is your look more natural? (day-to day like eye makeup for the office)&lt;br /&gt;These pads are fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you for reading my review! :)</li>
            <li> Usually make-up removing pads don&#x27;t do their job, leaving make-up behind. When all is said and done, I usually have to go to the soap and water to get what pads have left behind. These are very thorough and appropriate for usage on the entire face (not just the eyes). They are cool and soothing and I only wish there were more in the package! Great for sensitive skin and no perfumy nonsense going on. Love them.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife after reading about them; she likes them, but she feels they are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bzzagent and I got this for free. I really like these but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t remove the residue I was wearing glitter eyeliner and I used the eye make up remover pads yes the glitter eyeliner came out easily but there were still some specs of glitter eyeliner which was hard to get it out. they feel nice and fresh. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> These eye makeup remover pads were part of a free sample kit that I received as part of being a BzzAgent.  I was very excited upon opening these.  They are easily twice the size of any other eye makeup circular pads.  I usually need 2 pads to remove all my eye makeup.  One single pad was able to clean all of my eye makeup off.  These pads also sport a slight texture that helps in gently wiping off makeup.  I love these eye makeup remover pads much more than other brands I have tried which also cost a lot more.  One last thing to mention, is the resealable bag.  Even after opening it several times, it still has a super strong seal.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than having remover pads dry out before you&#x27;ve been able to use them.  I know this won&#x27;t be the case here!</li>
            <li> I received these wipes free to try out. These are amazingly small, but powerful wipes. This pocket-sized pack has large, pre-moistened eye makeup remover pads (each a little smaller than your palm) that can remove makeup from BOTH eyes-- using just one wipe! I love the clean feeling and that the wipes are so effective. It took just seconds to swish off my face grime, leaving a non-greasy feeling with no residue. It doesn&#x27;t get much faster or better than this. My new favorite product!</li>
            <li> I just received this product in my BzzAgent kit and tried them out over the past week..they work but I&#x27;m not blown away. I wear makeup every day so having a good makeup remover is very important to me. At the end of the day I&#x27;m tired and also don&#x27;t want to go through a big struggle to get ready for bed. These work, but I noticed that I was having to scrub pretty hard to remove all of my makeup. I&#x27;ve also been having to use two- one for each eye because of the amount of makeup I wear. I&#x27;d say that if you only wear a little bit of makeup every day, then these are for you! If you&#x27;re more like me, I&#x27;d go with something different.</li>
            <li> I was trilled when I received these as a sample to try because they claim to remove waterproof mascara. I am here to say that yes they do...with a little effort.&lt;br /&gt;So the plus points:&lt;br /&gt;- removed eye makeup up and waterproof mascara&lt;br /&gt;- required a little effort to fully remove it&lt;br /&gt;- did not have an offensive odor&lt;br /&gt;- did not sting or irritate my eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;minus points:&lt;br /&gt;- 1st time out the the package and the pads were not wet enough&lt;br /&gt;- this was made worse by the fact that the package did not stay sealed enough after opening it and closing it a few times.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these. I like their practice behind their ingredients. However these are almost completely ineffective in removing makeup ESPECIALLY mascara and I don&#x27;t even wear waterproof.</li>
            <li> Note: I received these for free as a bzz agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find extremely effective at removing eye make up. Now I don&#x27;t often wear mascara so I can&#x27;t comment on that but these wipes took off my smoky eye with little effort. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I received the simple skincare moisturizer, oil balancing wipes, radiance wipes and eye makeup remover wipes through a bzzagent campaign and I have to admit that I am in LOVE with all of them. I am developing sensitive skin as I get older and many beauty products can irritate my face and neck but simple skincare products don&#x27;t contain alcohols or dyes and they didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! I used the oil balancing wipes the most because I have oily and shiny skin and they worked like a charm. The amount of oil on my face decreased and stayed that way throughout the day! So I would definitely recommend any and all simple skincare products if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got to try these eye make-up remover pads for free through BzzAgent and I was pretty happy them.  They weren&#x27;t too wet, and they weren&#x27;t too dry and I thought the packaging was easy to grab and go.  I had expected them to remove mascara a little faster/easier than they did, but I also don&#x27;t have much experience with other eye make-up remover pads, and it&#x27;s not like it took a ridiculous amount of time.  I really enjoyed the simpleness of using these either in the morning or before a shower without having to make a huge mess around the sink by splashing water on my face to wash it, so that was a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really enjoyed using these, and I thought they made it much easier to keep my eyes fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> worked well to remove tough eye make up, smelled good &amp; was easy to use. o received these and a few other Simple products free through bzzagent and i plan to keep using</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to get to try these for free from BZZagent. I really do like them, BUT- I wish they were either bigger, or came with more. For a small package like this- I honestly would not pay almost 6 dollars for it. It could be because I&#x27;m just cheap, though! but these DO in fact take off waterproof makeup like it says- very gently with minimal rubbing. It does take a while and take some folding of the pad and even usage of more than 2... It is a good product though. When I saw that they weren&#x27;t supposed to irritate the eyes, I REALLY went in as if to try and prove them wrong, and they did not burn my eyes one bit. Still I wouldn&#x27;t suggest sticking them directly into your eyes. haha&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good product, a little expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> I am fully impressed by the Simple Skincare line. I enjoy the eye-makeup remover pads which get my thick eyeliner off in a snap without making my eyelids oily. One pad gets off all my liner, eyeshadow and thick layered mascara. Makes makeup remover a breeze! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the Eye Make-up Remover Pads that I got for free from BzzAgent.  One little pad removes all my eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara...and without leaving my skin red, irritated or oily.  That&#x27;s a big deal for me, as I&#x27;ve always had an issue with oily residue on makeup remover pads/wipes.  I&#x27;m 100% hooked on the Simple Skincare line.  Do yourself a favor and try it today!</li>
            <li> I got these free to sample and review from BzzAgent.. I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup all too often because it&#x27;s always such a hassle to remove it and most products irritate my eyes. I use a lot of waterproof makeup, and these are pretty decent at getting it off. I do have to scrub a little bit but not much so it&#x27;s still good for sensitive skin. These definitely work better than most other eye makeup removing cloths. I&#x27;ve only used these a few times but so far they are definitely worth it. These will be my new go-to makeup remover from now on.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and I recieved a free full sized sample of Simple Eye makeup remover pads. I wear a lot of mascara and eyeliner and I always have a difficult time finding a product that removes ALL of my makeup. I was pleasantly surprised with Simple skin cares eye makeup remover pads. It took off every last bit of my dark waterproof eye makeup and it was very easy. I usually have to scrub very hard but not with these soft pads that wiped my makeup away with ease!</li>
            <li> A perfect product! Super sensitive and very effective.  I was using a much more expensive product so I&#x27;m very impressed to jump down to a low cost one. Thanks Simple! Another awesome product. I&#x27;m so glad that Bzzagent introduced me to such a lovely product with their free samples.</li>
            <li> These Simple eye makeup remover pads are amazing. A-MAY-ZING! I have such sensitive skin, and I try to buy \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; products, but it always seems like they don&#x27;t actually take the makeup off without scrubbing my face raw. SO nice to have a GENTLE makeup removing pad that I don&#x27;t have to use like a scouring pad!! And they left a pleasant, clean smell. These are my new eye makeup removers hands down! AND I got to try them FREE by being a Bzz agent! (bzzagent.com)</li>
            <li> To whomever gets to read this. I never and still haven&#x27;t received the eye makeup remover pads.  This is not my first complaint about this issue.  It wasn&#x27;t in the box with the one other item on this order. I did receive. So could someone let me know why I have NOT gotten the eye makeup remover pads. I only hate it because I need it and I never have gotten it. Please check this out.</li>
            <li> Clinique&#x27;s two kinds of eye make-up reviewer felt greasy and sticky, but this product works well without any residue. And it costs a lot less. No eye irritation with this one. We&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle - a little too gentle as it doesn&#x27;t remove all of my waterproof mascara.  Generally I have to use an oil based remover that is a bit messy and leaves potential for getting a bit of film in the eyes so I was excited to find a potential alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, I will be going back to that oil based remover! After using this remover in the evening and then moisturizing, I find that I wake up with dark circles from left-over mascara that has migrated overnight.  Yuck!  These simply do not remove all of the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good bits: they do seem to take off eye-shadow without a hitch and I have used them for touch ups when applying makeup, when my eye pencil or mascara takes off on its own.  So, they are helpful for some things.  Additionally, they did not irritate my extremely sensitive skin and have a refreshingly cool sensation on the eyelid.  The pads are a generously sized oval shape, which makes much more sense for eyes than a round shape!</li>
            <li> This is a travel size item.</li>
            <li> I love these little wipes.  They don&#x27;t sting my eyes like other products, they are compact for traveling, and they stay moist as long as you wrap them up well.  I&#x27;m now on my second purchase and will buy even more in the future.</li>
            <li> My go to make up remover for the eyes. Might take more than one or two pads to get everything off, but it gentle and I can give it a decent scrub to remove the tougher make up (eyeliners!). Small and easy to carry around! I also have the bottle for home use.</li>
            <li> Simple Eye Make-Up remover pads have found their way into my bag of tricks. Gone are the days where I&#x27;d have red eyebrows from scrubbing away the spoils of the day. With these simple pads I&#x27;m able to obtain a fresh face and keep my makeup looking great without remnants from the prior days application. I&#x27;ve already begun to reccomend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  They work so well and do not burn your eyes like some make-up remover does.  The price is good too.</li>
            <li> They work well, but it is a small package. I thought it was going to be a bigger package. They work well though</li>
            <li> I got this product for free through bzzagent as a trial and I usually don&#x27;t use make up remover at all because it makes my eyes irritated but these worked great for me. Will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried a lot of various makeup wipes, I was pleasantly surprised with Simple&#x27;s approach to making wipes especially for the eye area. The eye area is a very sensitive zone and therefore has to be treated with extra care as opposed to the rest of the face. Simple eye makeup remover wipes easily removed a night outs worth of makeup in a few swipes while making my eyes feel refreshed. It also helps knowing that it has simple ingredients with no artificial perfume or dies. Less is more in this case. Disclaimer: I was provided this kit free of charge by BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m super excited guys! I just tried the complete Simple skincare range -- which includes their Radiance cleansing wipes, Oil Balancing cleansing wipes, eye makeup remover pads &amp; their Protecting light moisturizer! Wonderful bundle of vitamin enhanced skin care products! I am an owner of super sensitive skin and many products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, even for sensitive skin, have left me with red, dry, bumpy skin. Simple&#x27;s skincare is a welcoming difference. The cleaning face wipes left my skin moisturized, clean, and most importantly free of red patches and bumps, which has been the result of other face cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Simple is VERY gentle on the most fragile skin there is. I promise. They not only cleanse, but have added vitamins like vitamin E and pro vitamin b5 as well as skin loving ingredients like mango extract and glycerin, all amazing for touchably soft skin. I also enjoyed Simple&#x27;s eye makeup remover pads because they were not only gentle on my skin and eyes, but did an amazing job removing even waterproof mascara. The light moisturizer isn&#x27;t thick or greasy and protects from UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 15. Perfect for summer right around the corner. I am throughly please with Simple&#x27;s new skincare range and cannot wait to make it my new skincare regime for the summer! (I recieved free samples of this product)</li>
            <li> Best things about this eye make up remover pads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case small and easy to throw in make up bag for overnight trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrant free!  No weird or faux scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pad easily cleaned mascara off both my eyes, but I prefer to use one for each eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No greasy after rub mess. Just fresh, clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No eye irritation during  or after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t loose any lashes and didn&#x27;t have to tug on eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has vitamins for my eyes and face in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t broken out after it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use more of their products. This was a great introduction for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I use Origins mascara.  Again, it came off easily.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use and gentle.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed:(  This was touted in a magazine as excellent for removing even waterproof mascaras.  I ended up putting my L&#x27;Oreal Paris Clean Artiste Waterproof &amp; Long Wearing Eye Makeup Remover on the pad to get my mascara off.</li>
            <li> These pads are fantastic and did a really good job, by removing my waterproof mascara from my eyes. The pads are very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin. The pads are full of moisture so you only need one to remove the make up from your face. Overrall I love these pads and it does what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li> You have to use too many pads each time you need to remove make up (1) because they&#x27;re too small, and (2) because they don&#x27;t have enough product on the pad.  In addition, I feel the pad is too rough and could matter to skin integrity after long term use.  I found that it made my eyelids red.  It is not the product for me.</li>
            <li> These remove the toughest makeup! After I do my eyes I use the other side to swipe my face makeup off before cleansing too. They are non-irritating for my extremely sensitive skin. Love them!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does. The make up came right off without scrubbing or needing to much pressure. My eyes were left with no make up and also no redness which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am an avid fan of waterproof eyeliner and mascara so a good make-up remover is always a must. After joining a Simple SkinCare Campaign on the BzzAgent website I was able to receive a free sample of this eye make-up remover. What I loved about it was the very light scent and the fact that my eyes did not sting at all after using the wipes. Usually my eyes burn and turn extremely blotchy, which is why I used to refrain from using eye make-up removing products in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love this product but I am not a big fan on the size. This product works great but one pad will just not cut it for my dark eye make-up. I have to use at least two pads to get my eyeliner off, and that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m not wearing any mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think that these products are extremely beneficial for those who are living with sensitive skin, and if you don&#x27;t mind using a couple of the pads you should have no problem getting your make-up off.</li>
            <li> I got these from a campaign for BzzAgent, free, and I am pretty impressed with them. They got off all of my makeup, (and trust me, this is coming from a girl who rocks raccoon eyes! haha) The only downside I found with them is they are a little bit small, but that is not too bad, and it&#x27;s kind of rough. I have been using them and on a plus my eyes are a lot less sore, beings I would sleep with makeup on. Hopefully, the size gets accustomed to me because they do get rid of the makeup fairly well. :) 4/5!</li>
            <li> I loved receiving this Simple skincare product for free through BzzAgent. The eye makeup remover pads were fabulous! I found that they were super gentle which is perfect for the sensitive skin around the eyes. They removed all of my eye makeup in just one pad. I usually don&#x27;t wear super heavy eye makeup (light eyeliner, non waterproof mascara, and a light shimmer eye shadow) and I was able to use just one eye makeup remover pad, front and back, to remove all of the eye makeup. For a heavier eye, you may need two pads. They also didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like an astringent would, and left no residue. This product is a definite buy and keep!</li>
            <li> I received Simple Eye Make-Up Remover pads for free about a week ago from BZZ Agent as part of their campaign. They work perfectly with my skin. I have really sensitive oily skin and these products have worked wonders. They are perfect for my skin type. This product uses vitamins like Pro-Vitamin B5 and Vitamin E. This product is alcohol free and oil free so it won&#x27;t burn your eyes. They also leave out the artificial perfumes and dyes. This product has been Dermatologist Tested, Ophthalmologist tested, are Hypoallergenic and Non-comedogenic too! They are safe for contact-lense wearers or those with sensitive eyes. Before receiving this product I did not use eye makeup remover products ever, so I do not have an alternate product to compare these too. With that being said these pads work great. One pad removes all of the eye makeup from both of my eyes. I typically only use mascara on my eyes and it removes it. I like to use these wipes to remove all of the dark makeup circles that form under my eyes after sweating all day. When I use these wipes, they do not cause any irritations or burns in my eyes which is very nice. I would recommend this product if you have sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t burn and it removes eye-makeup!</li>
            <li> I received these for free and I was impressed. Although i have used wipes that have removed make up more quickly &amp; more easily the simple wipes don&#x27;t irritate my eyes or face at all whereas the other products on the market have seriously hurt my face. I will use these products again.</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me these items for free to try and review! I&#x27;m so happy I had the chance because I truly love all the Simple Skin Care Products!!!!! Simple Skin Care products does exactly what they say, I usually use a lot of eyeliner and water proof mascara (which is always a challenge to remove) This time while using the Eye Make Up Remover Pads, IT WAS EASY BREEZY!!! No irritation at all,I cant say enough how awesome these pads are! I truly fell in love with them!!!! Thank you BzzAgent Once Again!!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying the simple eye makeup remover pads. Mascara and eyeliner makes my eyes look fantastic, but I&#x27;ve always hated trying to get all of the makeup off at the end of the day. Most products claim to get the product off but it usually takes multiple applications and then after I wash my face I can still see traces of black eye makeup smeared under my eye. Simple eye makeup remover pads were fantastic! The pads are pretty large and I only had to use one side to be able to remove all of my eye makeup (I attached a picture). I know that these pads got all of the traces of eye makeup off because after I took a shower there was no black lines under my eyes.  The only somewhat negative thing I can say about these pads is that they are a little scratchy but I did not have any issues with them irritating my eyes and I wear contacts. I received this product for free as a bzz agent so that I could provide consumers honest feedback about the product.</li>
            <li> I was given this for free to try and review from BZZAGENT.  These did not irritate eyes and they were small but big enough to take off eye make-up on both eyes.  I did flip it but it&#x27;s very environmentally friendly.  I wear mascara and upper liquid liner and it took it all off.</li>
            <li> The Simple® Eye Make-Up Remover Pads do not irritate my eyes and one single pad took off even my water proof mascara. Also the product did not bother my contacts like some other oil based products I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Before trying this product out, I didn&#x27;t know much about the Simple brand, other than it being another skincare line out on the market. I had always had trouble getting my eye makeup off with the regular makeup remover pads out on the marker, but after joining a campaign through BzzAgent and receiving some of the Simple products for free, I completely fell in love with this line. My favorite product of the ones I received was by far the eye makeup remover pads. These work really well with getting even waterproof mascara off, they&#x27;re excellent!</li>
            <li> I am in love with simple eye makeup remover pads! Before I had these I was very lazy about removing my make up! Now that they sent theses to me for free, it&#x27;s so easy and so much better for me! I love love love these pads! They don&#x27;t hurt my eyes either! What I love the most is they don&#x27;t make a mess all over your face, like others do!</li>
            <li> When I received this pack of makeup removing pads, I was hoping for a plush, well moistened and comfortable product.  It unfortunately did not deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these are not well moistened.  They&#x27;re just slightly moist, making them useful for a very short time before they dry up.  The lack of moisture also makes them less comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, they are by no means plush.  They are thin and rough, and if you want to get mascara off you have to sit there and scrub with them, which does your skin no good whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, they&#x27;re not great at actually removing mascara.  I&#x27;m not sure whether they were trying to go light on the dissolving agent to make them more skin friendly, but something went wrong somewhere.  You have to work very hard to remove your mascara, and even when I just swiped them over my foundation the removal was spotty and I had to make several passes... with the rough texture this made the experience unpleasant.  Would not try again.</li>
            <li> I rate these highly only because they are better than other eye makeup removers I have used in the past... but they could use improvement in some areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They need to be more moist!&lt;br /&gt;-I would love to see parabens eliminated from the ingredients. The name \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; and the slogan \\&quot;skin loving ingredients\\&quot; sends me the message that this is a more natural product. The ingredient list proves otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;-Did not completely remove waterproof mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign and was very excited to try these. I like to wear waterproof mascara but I hate removing it! These did not entirely remove my waterproof mascara but I was happy they didn&#x27;t leave behind an oily residue (which so many makeup removers seem to do). It also did not feel drying or harsh on my eyes. I would possibly purchase these in the future since they are so much more enjoyable to use than the typical removers.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free as a part of a BzzAgent campaign, so I was very excited to try these out when I saw them on my doorstep! First impressions were that I liked the small size of the pouch, which will be perfect for keeping in my purse or gym bag, and for fixing any runs in my eyemakeup during the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package, I had a few coats of waterproof mascara on, and one wipe was more than enough for taking off the makeup on both of my eyes. No oily residue as I often get with liquid eye makeup removers. I do wear contacts and I felt no irritation whatsoever. In fact, my eyes were quite refreshed after using these wipes. I imagine it would be nice to store these in the fridge, so they would be even more refreshing to use. Not sure if that would affect the product at all; I&#x27;ll have to research that more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to like creams that remove eye makeup, just because I have drier skin and I feel that those moisturize around my eyes a bit better. However, as a go-to product that I will keep on my bedside table, these are wonderful. I am terrible about removing my eyemakeup at night! These make it simple enough to just remove your makeup while watching Netflix or reading--no need to get out of bed (perfect for lazy ol&#x27; me!). I highly recommend these to people like me who aren&#x27;t as diligent about removing eye makeup!</li>
            <li> I loved this eye make up remover. It made my skin feel great and refreshed. It does a great job of taking off unwanted makeup. I got this as well as other simple products to try for free in a campaign and it works great!</li>
            <li> I received these eye makeup remover pads for free through a BzzAgent campaign to try out. I usually don&#x27;t remove my eye makeup before bed because it&#x27;s a hassle and I&#x27;m usually too tired to bother. I steer clear from products that do the job because I have contact lenses and the skin under my eyes is very sensitive. I am so happy to have tried this product because: 1) I no longer have mascara and eye shadow smudges on my pillow, 2) it is gentle on my eyes and does not irritate my contacts and 3) the pads are small which cuts down on waste. I only need one pad for both eyes (I just use both sides). I don&#x27;t feel as bad for the environment when I am throwing away this tiny disk.</li>
            <li> I received my package of free samples of the Simple face products, I absolutely fell in love. I&#x27;ve been using then for a few days now and I already notice such a difference. I use these make up remover pads with the face lotion and it works so good. My skin is so sensitive I really can&#x27;t use much things on my face. I have had no problems with these products they leave my face feeling nice and clean all day.</li>
            <li> I tried the Simple eye make-up remover pads and they worked great.  I wear contacts and they did not irritate my eyes at all.  The textured side of the pad gets the bulk of the eye make-up and the pads are thick enough that the make-up does not go through to the other side, so then you can use the smooth side of the pad to make sure there is no more remaining on your eye. (I do not wear mascara, so it only took me 1 pad to get everything off.) Afterwards, my eyes and the skin around my eyes do not feel dry or chapped as with some other eye make-up removers.  The pads were moist also.  They actually dripped onto my dresser when I was taking them out of the package, but not too moist that they dripped down my face during use.  I received a free sample of this product from a bzzagent campaign and will continue to use Simple eye make-up remover pads, as they are effective and a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  I first tried this after I received a free sample, and I am soo glad that I did!  I have not been able to use any eye makeup removers for over a year because my eyes are extremely sensitive.  Everything that I tried either caused my eyes to burn and sting, turned the skin around my eyes puffy, or caused me to breakout.  These eye makeup remover pads have not caused me any adverse effects, only positive ones!  When I use these my eyes do not burn or sting at all, my skin does not break out and I do not wake up the next morning with puffy eyes.  Instead my eyes are now free of mascara remnants and actually appear brighter as well.  I really like that this product is free of aritifical perfumes and dyes too.  Not having a strong scent has spared me from headaches as well : ) I really like that I do not have to distribute product onto a cotton ball etc, rather the product is already infused into the pad and it truly is the perfect amount of product per pad.  The best part about this product is that it is infused with healthy antioxidants like pro vitamin B5 and vitamin E.  The skin around our eyes is already thin and sensitive so having a product that delivers antioxidants is just an added bonus.  I definitely recommend trying this product!  I will be heading out to buy some more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> This product is okay! I received it through bzzagent campaign.  I have to use more than one wipe to remove mascara. Water proof mascara..... I have to try using a non waterproof mascara and see ho many wipes I go though.</li>
            <li> I was sent these eye make-up remover pads to try for free and after using them for a while I wasn&#x27;t blown away with them. These did remove my eye makeup without burning my eyes or leaving a residue but it wasn&#x27;t as effortless as I would have liked. These pads weren&#x27;t as moist as I would have liked them to be and I found that I often needed to use one pad per eye to effectively remove all my eye makeup. Since they were a little dry I also had to rub my eyes quite a bit to take off all my mascara and it isn&#x27;t good to excessively rub your eye every time you want to remove your makeup. Overall, they were just average and I probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase these.</li>
            <li> I received these Eye Make-Up Remover Pads for Free through Bzz Agent to try for the First time and I Love these wipes for Removing eye makeup, eye liner and even waterproof mascara. It didn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other wipes or pads do, I didn&#x27;t have to pull or tug a lot to remove the eye make-up which also is good. I do recommend these pads for someone who has a sensitive or delicate eye area like myself that doesn&#x27;t like to do too much work to remove their eye make-up.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye makeup remover products and have found some to be oily-leaving a film on my eyes, and others to be too harsh or drying.  The \\&quot;Simple Eye Make-up Remover pads are perfect--removing make-up completely, yet leaving no residue or dryness.  A must have.</li>
            <li> These are great for travel and a just one wipe can take off an entire face of makeup. I was surprised at how small the packaging and wipes were but this is a great thing, it easy to tuck away for travel. I recently went on vacation and when I returned to the hotel I was so exhausted, I took a wipe and took off all my makeup then went to bed. When I woke up, my skin felt clean and not grimy from the previous day. It removes mascara better than any cleansing wipe I&#x27;ve ever tried, usually it leaves behind some traces of black under my eye but not this. The scentless pads are very soft and gently exfoliate the skin. I know it says its for eye makeup but used it for my entire face and had no odd reactions to my skin. My skin actually felt a bit refreshed after using these.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than the \\&quot;oily\\&quot; makeup remover I&#x27;ve been using.  Its gentle and gets all the color off with one pad.  You may need a few extra swipes to wash away mascara.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the Equate (Walmart) brand of make up remover cloths and recently they changed the cloth to a rougher design. Since then I&#x27;ve been looking for a good alternative and this Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pad is good enough but not quite what I was looking for in a replacement. They were a little bit dry and too small for my needs but they did work well enough just not great.</li>
            <li> This stuff was nice and gentle but sadly even after using two clothes on each side I still had makeup and mascara left. I will stick to my Nutragena makeup remover it too is gentle and takes everything off!</li>
            <li> Just like the title says, this does NOT work well at all. I had to keep rubbing and rubbing to get my eye makeup off, mostly my mascara. After awhile I decided to just give up because my eyes were so sore and red. Ouch! Going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Great for travel. Doesn&#x27;t do as good a job on waterproof mascara as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought these because my store was out of the Almay eye make up remover pads. My fault for not reading the ingredients first. Unless it has oil in it, it will NOT remove waterproof eye make up, even though this package says &#x27;removes waterproof mascara&#x27;. These did nothing. My eye make up was still there. I used two pads and all it succeeded in doing was pulling out my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not moist enough. If you wear eyeliner or mascara that&#x27;s waterproof-it will not clean that off. Had to use soap in addition.</li>
            <li> Small!!! Package is small wipes are small and dry. Very unhappy. Can&#x27;t believe I paid so much for these</li>
            <li> It takes the make up off really well but its really harsh on my skin still even though it says it is for senstive skin.</li>
            <li> I was so amazed how much I love this product. At first im like this wouldnt remove waterproof mascara when it said it does. So when I first open it, it got a scrubing side and a flat side. I gently remove my waterproof mascara and it comes off like nothing. I have never found anything that can remove my mascara without rubbing and pulling my eyes. I would definitely recommend this product to everybody that is looking for an eyes makeup remover pads that remove the dramatic makeup!!</li>
            <li> I received a package of Simple Eye Make Up Remover Pads free from BzzAgent. I was so excited to try this product because it&#x27;s difficult to find a good eye product that will not sting or burn your eyes. This product is great! It easily removes waterproof mascara and liquid eyeliner. Doesn&#x27;t burn and doesn&#x27;t leave behind raccoon eyes, so I am confident it take all the make up away. I have read that some people experienced crumbling when removing waterproof mascara, but I didn&#x27;t notice that at all. It may depend on the brand of mascara you use. I also wear contacts and I was able to scrub lightly enough not to push around the contacts and it was still super effective on removing everything. Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> I used two mascaras most of the time and they aren&#x27;t pharmacy ones. They are extremely effective and I&#x27;ve had many compliments on how they keep my eyelashes pretty and intact (I apply to top and bottom lashes) and its waterproof yet I have been trying to find something to remove it at nights because they are hard to take off!!!! and here it was.... These make up remover wipes for the eyes are perfect they get the gunk out and do not harm your eyes at all!! The only thing I wish would be that the wipes would be bigger because like I said I use a lot of mascara. And it&#x27;s always good to use a separate wipe for the eyes and the face that&#x27;s why I like these for the eyes.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free from bzzagent.com and I love it. Simple products are great products for sensitive skin. The eye-make-up remover pads are gentle to the eyes and remove makeup thoroughly. It removed all my makeup including concealer, mascara and eyeliner. I even used them with my contacts in and my eyes were fine. Other eye makeup removers have irritated my eyes and these pads are really gentle. These definitely are products that anyone can benefit from but that are truly great for people with sensitive skin. You won&#x27;t feel the burning, stinging or irritating effects that you get from other cleansing products. Their name says it all, they are simple!!</li>
            <li> I received these as a sample from Bzzagent and can&#x27;t tell if I have been spoiled by my current liquid eye remover or if these just aren&#x27;t that great. While they did remove my eye makeup, it took a little too much effort and rubbing, and the area around my eyes is just too sensitive to use them. I do like how convenient they are so I might just throw them in my purse for cleaning up makeup smudges or for helping to clean before redoing my makeup when I&#x27;m away from home.</li>
            <li> These wipes worked like a charm. I keep them in my car for days when my face starts to feel a little oily and keep a pack at home for removing makeup at night.  Super useful and handy!</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying how excited I was to get to try the eye makeup remover pads and a few other new products from the Simple Skincare line.  I hadn&#x27;t tried any of their products until I received these products for free in my campaign from BzzAgent.  I wanted to see if they were really worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;  In this campaign I received the Protecting Light Moisturizer, the Radiance Cleansing Wipes, Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes, and the Eye Make-up Remover Pads.  I was concerned about a few things before trying these products.  I have oily/combination skin so I didn&#x27;t know if the Oil Balancing Wipes would actually help with controlling the oil my skin produces.  I didn&#x27;t know how well the cleansing wipes would actually remove my makeup and cleanse my skin.  Also I had never used Eye Make-up Remover Pads so I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would remove my eye makeup without causing my eyes to burn.  Finally I was especially concerned about the moisturizer.  I was afraid it would make my skin  as well as cause a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;  I was really impressed with all of these products.  I really like the fact that they are good for my skin.  They don&#x27;t have artificial perfumes or dyes.  They also have \\&quot;skin loving\\&quot; ingredients such as zinc, glycerin, mango extract and more.  They don&#x27;t contain alcohol or oil which is another plus.  The eye make-up remover pads and moisturizer also contain vitamins which are really good for your skin.  I also appreciate the fact that Simple Skincare products contain no animal derived ingredients.  I have reviews of all of the products but for now here is my review of the eye makeup remover pads.&lt;br /&gt;  Eye Make-up Remover Pads-  These work really well too.  I use one pad for both eyes and it removes all of my eye makeup, even eyeliner and mascara.  It takes a little more effort when trying to remove waterproof mascara but I didn&#x27;t have to tug on my eye or lashes like I normally would.  These didn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all.  I even used them on my waterline to remove eyeliner.  I know they aren&#x27;t intended for that but they worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;  I would definitely recommend that you check out the new Simple Skincare products.  They have not only improved the condition of my skin but also my skincare routine.  Prior to trying them my routine was minimalistic.  I washed my face while in the shower or before bed and occasionally added a moisturizer to my skin at night and/or in the morning.  These products are so simple to use that you don&#x27;t need anything else.  No water, washcloth, towel.. nothing.  Which means that I clean my face day and night now as well as add moisturizer every morning before applying my makeup or going outside.  I use the makeup remover pads in the evening if I wear makeup so I&#x27;m not tugging on pulling on my eyes.  Again I recommend that you check these products out.  They work great and are good for your skin.  What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the minimal packaging of these eye make remover pads. They fit in my purse or cosmetic bag. Absolutely no scent and not greasy. And they are nice to do a waterless cleanse of my whole face. Very effective and sturdy. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> I have used the eye make-up remover pads several times and am pleased with the results. At first they didn&#x27;t seem moist enough to do the job, but it takes just a few swipes to completely remove all make-up. They are soft and gentle, fragrance free, oil free and leave no residue whatsoever. Appropriately named, this is a simple but very effective product. I have added this product to my Subscribe &amp; Save monthly delivery so that I&#x27;ll never run out.</li>
            <li> I used to use the liquid eye makeup remover but picked this up one month. I loved this product. It removed my mascara and eyeliner much easier than the liquid remover (the one you have to shake then apply, then rinse with warm water) I did find that sometimes I had to use two pads to remove all of the makeup. I defintely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These eye make-up removal pads are awesome.  They are perfect for travel as you can pack them in your carry-on.  They are hypo-allergenic and didn&#x27;t make my eyes break out...which is certainly a plus.</li>
            <li> And these are super to keep at work if you get caught in the rain or who knows what and your makeup needs re-doing.  I carry these with me all the time, especially on business trips.  They work very well and are well priced as well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, super bummed. Didn&#x27;t come close to removing even my light eye makeup. One night I decided to keep using these until my eye makeup can off (which was not a lot), and it took over 8 wipes! Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Not good to removed waterproof makeup without scrubbing at my eyes and causing irritation. 2 stars because after a few cloths its all gone but definitely did not do what I hoped.</li>
            <li> I wear minimal makeup and my eyes were left extremely irritated from using these to remove my mascara. These were incredibly dry remover pads and I would have to use several pads to thoroughly clean my eyelids. I highly suggest avoiding the purchase of these pads unless you are seeking to damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I love that these don&#x27;t have any scent and are as gentle as water on my super sensitive eyes.  I can just swipe these over my eyes and they remove my eye makeup without having to rub like crazy.</li>
            <li> The best drug store makeup wipes on the market.</li>
            <li> These are tiny pads and I feel their makeup remover wiped work much better than these pads.  I have used half of the pack and feel that most of the time, a pad does not remove as much as it should (and it is kind of rough on the eye area, which is very sensitive!)</li>
            <li> for the price I would rather use the liquid removers such as Neutrogena. The pads get stuck together and they do not remove the mascara as well as the Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Works perfect! But its too small.</li>
            <li> Its great, it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is o.k.  The price is fair, but the package is very small and fits in the palm of my hand; which, mind you, I have small hands to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t really work well with my waterproof mascara, however, it worked well with my dark eye shadow and liner.</li>
            <li> hey work....use 2 together for cnntrol...but very small area</li>
            <li> Easy to use and non irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually tried rubbing sandpaper over my eyelids before, but if I had to guess what it might feel like, this would be it. In reality, I really do hate to complain and I always try to find something positive to say about a product even if it&#x27;s not my personal favorite, but these are just plain bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear much eye makeup to begin with, but these are so small and thin that I had to use 2-3 pads to &amp;#34;remove&amp;#34; the makeup from both eyes. Despite their thinness, the material is quite rigid and scratchy, which is very uncomfortable on such delicate skin as the eyes. I found that the pads dried out quickly, and rather than actually remove the makeup, my eyeliner and mascara wound up sort of just smeared all over my face. I then used the pads to lightly rub those areas of my face where the eye makeup was smeared to try and remove it, and I woke up the next morning with very enlarged, darkly pigmented pores. I think these pads wound up entrapping my eyeliner deep within my facial pores, so I looked as if I was wearing 7-day old makeup and it took 2 days for my face to return to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used plenty of different eye makeup removers, and I&#x27;ve always had a favorable opinion of the brands I&#x27;ve used. I would&#x27;ve purchased a more familiar brand, but went for these since I was in a pinch and they were an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item. I&#x27;m sorry to say that I do not recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I also Removes all my makeup with some rubbing and doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes or sensitive skin. It does take some work to get everything though. I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup very heavily either</li>
            <li> They are not good for removing eye make up. For some reason, my eyes had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I got these eye make- up remover pads as a free sample, I love them! They work great, I have tried any other brands &amp; these work the best! They are well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> *i recieved this product for free, as part of a bzzagent campaign. This a review of my honest opinion on this product.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear a ton of make up, but what I do wear I want off at the end of the day and am generally too tired or lazy to wash my face. The Simple eye make-up remover pads remove my mascara with no problem! Plus they don&#x27;t leave my skin oily. I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want anything that is going to irritate it, or make my acne worse, these do neither! Plus you can&#x27;t beat no harsh irritants!</li>
            <li> I had seen this product mentioned somewhere as a must-have item, so started looking for it.  I found Target was selling other items in the Simple line, but the eye make-up remover pads were not there.  I decided to get the regular face make-up remover (not exfoliating) sheets and they really take off the eye make-up well.  They got the mascara too, and easily so.  Problem is, it left a residue that then got in my eyes and made the world blurry.  That is also my problem with any make-up remover I use on my eyes, whether cream or oil.  It drives me nuts!  I cannot use cotton pads with any kind of fibers that my come loose because they get in my eyes and irritate them.  So FINALLY I saw this in Target.  They had a \\&quot;buy four get a $5 gift card,\\&quot; so I bought four. I agree they remind me of the stridex pads (that, thankfully, I don&#x27;t need!).  Well, I&#x27;ve used about three PADS and am very disappointed.  I thought I would be seeing my mascara on them like on the sheets, but nooooo.  I even hold them on my lashes to let the product work on the mascara, but it really doesn&#x27;t want to take it off.  It does get the other make-up off.  The pads are kind of rough, actually more so than the sheets.  Maybe they should make the sheets for eyes?? I want something delicate that will not require tugging on that area around my eyes, and worse, pulling out my eyelashes that I would like to keep!  I guess I&#x27;ll be returning these to Target for a refund (and lose my gift card!).  I like the no fragrance of this item so may try the face sheets again and maybe blot them first.  They are still better than the liquids.</li>
            <li> I did receive this for free, however I am definitely going to repurchase these make up remover pads! I have heard many great things about the brand itself but have never really tried it before. Upon receiving it I love the design itself. Directions are clear as day and  ingredients are very visible for those who are sensitive, like I am. After applying it to my face and neck, my face felt so clean! There was no overbearing odor, just a fresh clean scent and feeling. I use make up wipes all the time and have used many different brands but Simple&#x27;s actually removes it in one wipe. And I like that it is not too big or too small of a pad, it&#x27;s just right. Wonderful products! No rash from my sensitive skin! Definitely a fan!</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say I received my product for free, here is my first impression of this product, I don&#x27;t wear much make-up but when I do it is eye makeup &amp; lip stick. I was surprised this product was able to remove my eye make-up so easily considering the fact that I use oil base make-up. My skin is super sensitive but this wipes did not bother my skin one bit. I would recommend this product, however it isn&#x27;t my favorite product this company offers.</li>
            <li> I just got this product to try for free the first time and it works great! One wipe removed all of my mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and foundation. My skin felt great after using it and then following with the facial cleansing wipes. Highly recommend any of these products!</li>
            <li> I got his product and others in the line to try for free and I really like the Simple sensitive skin line. The eye makup remover is easy to use, easy to take wherever I go and doesn&#x27;t cause I big mess or clean up after use. It was gentle on my skin and soothing.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I felt it was easy to use and it worked for me really well. I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reaction to it and I have very sensitive skin. I recommend this product to all my friends and family!!! I got to try this product for free through a website called bzzagent.com&lt;br /&gt;-Evelyn</li>
            <li> I was impressed by how thick the small pads were. At first I was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t be moist enough to remove all of the makeup but they got the job done in the end. I got to try this product for free via BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try for free and it met expectation. I do not use waterproof mascara so I cannot speak to how effectively it removes that, but it did successfully remove eyeliner, eye shadow (powder and liquid), and mascara without irritating my eyes (and I have highly sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of these to try out. They weren&#x27;t very moist and felt very scratchy on my eyes but surprisingly did not cause any redness. No residue left on my skin either! But it took a lot of effort to get my eyeliner off.</li>
            <li> Each night, I use Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads to gently cleanse and remove any eye makeup, even waterproof and long lasting eye make-up products. They also smell very clean but different than the other products. Smells like really clean spring water. These wipes are big enough that you only need 1 to get both of your eyes. I accidentally poked my eye one time and it did not sting or feel like make-up remover was ever in my eye. My eye even felt better after that!! These wipes also removed make-up on my face and eyebrows. I would recommend these for people with very sensitive eyes! I got this for free from BzzAgent!!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use eye makeup remover, I just take the easy way out and scrub at my eyes with water. Which, isn&#x27;t a great idea, but it works. Anyway, I got a sample of these to try through Bzz Agent and I might be a convert. It saves a lot of time and a lot of wear and tear to my eyes and there&#x27;s not greasy residue or overwhelming fragrance which I love. It takes off mascara (waterproof and non) in just a few swipes, no fuss, no burning, quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from BzzAgent and I was very excited to try it! My least favorite part of wearing makeup is having to take it off, so I really enjoy finding good products that do it for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear eye liner, shadow, and mascara, and the pads took off everything with little scrubbing. One pad cleaned both of my eyes and it was very soft. It did not take long for the makeup to come off, and it did not leave a greasy residue, as some similar products do. I don&#x27;t wear waterproof makeup, so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is in that regard. I accidentally got some in my eye, and it burned a little, but was not too bad. I would most definitely recommend and buy this product again.</li>
            <li> These wipes did what they said they would do! They removed my mascara better than some other leading brands I have used. They are great for my sensitive skin and I love that they had no oil. They are very moist and soft! Smell is ok but not great. I will be buying these in the future!I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I received this product from BzzAgent to test for free!  I was very excited to try out a product for sensitive skin since I have super sensitive skin.  In the end, I was very disappointed. I did not like the Eye Make-Up Remover Pads at all.  Fist of all, it says that it removes waterproof mascara, but these pads definitely were not able to remove all of my waterproof mascara.  It did remove the rest of my make-up.  My biggest issue with these pads is that the material is similar to a cotton ball.  It sort of comes apart like a cotton ball does when you pull at it.  This caused stringy/cotton pieces to get stuck on my eyelashes. SUPER ANNOYING!  One positive thing about this product is that it is not greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I have fair, dry and sensitive skin.  I was sent a sample to review and couldn&#x27;t wait to try these eye make-up remover pads.  I love the idea of using a very gentle and specially designed cleanser to remove stubborn eye make-up.  It&#x27;s important to me to protect and pamper my eye area.  I was shocked when I pulled out one pad and it as near dry to the touch.  I proceeded to remove a full eye look, complete with black mascara and black liquid liner.  Not only did the pad feel like it was far too scratchy for the delicate eye area but it wasn&#x27;t moist enough!  I had to use one pad per eye, not cost effective in my book, and I still had remaining bits of eye make-up left over.  I do not want to feel I have to rub to remove eye makeup, this has to be a gentle process, and between the scratchy pad and low moisture of the product, I would pass on these!</li>
            <li> I had a great experience with these make up remover pads. I received them for free. I never used make up remover pads before, just usually liquid that had to be put on a cotton ball. This is very quick, easy and does not smear make up all underneath my eyes! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Overall, I was impressed with the quality of these affordable Simple skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial cleansing wipes were fantastic, and left my face feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing eye make up was easy! Wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product to review. My opinions were not swayed.</li>
            <li> I wear mascara but sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s such a hassle because some wipes I&#x27;ve tried it&#x27;s like I have to scrub my eyes until I get wrinkles. Or say I just use a cleanser, there&#x27;s always some left. These get the spot right under my eyes that I always seem to have trouble getting to and there is no scrubbing involved, which is much healthier for my eyes. The pad may seem thin or small but it really is enough for me. There are vitamins which are perfect for my eyes because they have been itching lately and a little irritated. I received a sample of this product for free from Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> I was given this product as a full size sample, and I was really exited to try this brand.. gotta say...I loved the formula this little wipes are infused with. They DO NOT STING YOUR EYES which is great and ACTUALLY I had been having issues with this in other eye makeup removers. I wear heavy makeup on my eyes and this took it off effortlessly; However the wipes itself are a tad rougher than Simple´s radiance wipes (something I don&#x27;t understand as they are intended for the eye area) It is not bad, but this can definitely improve (without compromising thickness which I loved) they remain moist a long time and I also LOVED this.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old loves the Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads! She says as with her other Simple products, they work wonderfully well! These pads work really well and best of all, she says, they don&#x27;t sting at all! Fabulous!</li>
            <li> These Simple Eye makeup remover wipes really worked well for me. I usually do not wear waterproof mascara, but when I did these wipes took it off without leaving marks or residue on my eyes. They are really light, and don&#x27;t burn when trying to remove eye makeup. I got the chance to try them for free, and was really happy for the opportunity. I think these are perfect to remove eye makeup that&#x27;s been on all day, it removes easily without having to scrub and doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li> I received this free sample from Bzzagent and I love them. They take off all my eye make up very easily and quickly. They don&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin. They don&#x27;t dry them out either. I have very sensitive skin and most products I can&#x27;t use because of it but I didn&#x27;t have any problems with this one. I would recommend this product to anyone. They are fast and easy even in a hurry.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller then I&#x27;d thought they were,  slightly irritates when done</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this eye makeup remover works.  I need to use one pad for each eye, but it completely removes mascara without having to scrub my eyes.  I don&#x27;t use waterproof mascara, so I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be with that.</li>
            <li> The Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads seem to be a little dry and do a mediocre job of removing eye make-up.  The little package is slightly hard to open and had to be cut, which helps make the drying out process quicker.  The pads are convenient, especially if you are in a hurry and need a quick job, but I prefer to use other products which use more moisture and are much better at removing mascara.</li>
            <li> These are great makeup remover pads, I have very sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t make me break out or cause any irritations and they also work well at removing the makeup.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take all my eye make-up off.  I&#x27;ve used better ones then these.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup at all...</li>
            <li> When our local commissary began to carry these make-up remover wipes, I decided to give them a try.  I usually only wear mascara, but sometimes I add shadow and liner, so I like a remover pad to be able to handle either scenario equally well.  Also, I love the [[ASIN:B005TI7LHS Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes, 25 Count (Pack of 2)]], and hoped that these wipes would be just as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are definitely as great: Not only do they contain Pro-vitamin B5 and Vitamin E, they do NOT contain alcohol, oils, dyes, skin irritants or (most importantly) perfume.  They are well-moistened, soft to the touch and do a great job removing eye make-up without having to scrub and potentially damage the delicate skin that surrounds the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free to try. I have used a lot of makeup remover &amp; this is my first attempt with a makeup remover pad!! I am a convert! These are great &amp; got all of my mascara off. I wasn&#x27;t left with the next day racoon eyes, as I usually am. These were amazing!! I&#x27;m a big fan!! Will definitely buy these again!</li>
            <li> I received Simple eye make up remover as a free sample to test and I have to say that I am very pleased with it. When I wear make up I only wear it on my eyes and because most removers make me break out in hives I avoid washing my face at night, one to avoid the reaction my skin has and two I really do not want to have to wash my entire face just to wash my eyes. All the water and soap mess is just annoying before bed. With these eye make up remover pads I am able to take them with me and easily wipe it off before I even get home if I want. Most make up removers you have to buy the pads separate and put the actual remover liquid on the pad. I do not know about anyone else but I either never have enough or way too much.&lt;br /&gt;I think a great improvement for this product would be to put them in a moisture locking small container almost like you see baby wipes in. That way they are safe to stay moist longer.</li>
            <li> I received the Simple Eye Make-Up remover pads for free using Bzzagent.com and I must say the Eye make-up remover pads did remove a vast amount of my waterproof makeup but not entirely as well as I would have hoped. I ended up using 3 pads to remove the make-up completely but all in all it gets the job done. If your looking for a gentle product that is not harsh to the sensitive area around your eyes this is the perfect product. I have very sensitive skin and it did not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> Simple® Eye Make-Up Remover Pads remove my eye makeup well without drying my skin or making it icky and greasy.  The pads are gentle and do not irritate my eyes, which is a definite plus!!  A little history - my eyes are extremely sensitive to EVERYTHING and get red, runny and gross.  Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads remove my makeup (waterproof mascara!) well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small concern - it is difficult to only get one pad out of the packaging.  I worry that stuffing the next pad back in will contaminate the package or dry them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, AWESOME product!  So grateful that I received a free sample of these!  Will definitely add to my list of must-haves!!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best eye-makeup remover pads that I have ever used. Quickly, easily and gently gets all of my eye makeup off. Recently started using Skingenixx Eye Gel [[ASIN:B00VSBDR78 Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex]] - it has Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and a Super Peptide Complex, it has drastically reduced the fine lines, wrinkles and crows feet around my eyes.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Makeup remover pads should remove make with minimal scrubbing and abrasion to the skin. These do neither. It takes way too long with way too much scrubbing to remove mascara and eyeliner, and there is always residue. In my opinion, if a makeup remover doesn&#x27;t work at least as well as olive oil, it&#x27;s not worth the money. And this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My wife said these are very good but a little on the high side.</li>
            <li> I received this for free to review and absolutely love the simple convenience of this product! As a new mom every free moment counts! This product makes cleaning off any eye make up fast and easy! I can just pull out a cloth real quickly and wash my face without even having to go to the bathroom! I am also happy about the fact that Simple didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin or dry out my face with it&#x27;s simple ingredients! The nice soft smell was an added bonus!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVED  the Eye Make-up Remover Pads! I always have the issue with eye makeup removers irritating my eyes and I hate having to scrub so hard that my eyelashes get ripped out from the removers as well. This eye make-up remover though works like a DREAM! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and gets the makeup off without heavy scrubbing. I know some other reviewers say they aren&#x27;t moist enough - but the thing is - if they were too moist, then it would get all in your eyes. I feel like they were lightly moist - which was perfect for removing the eye makeup. I did get the item for free as part of a sampling pack for a Bzz Campaign. But honestly - that would make me more likely to give it a bad review if it did&#x27;t work - because what would I have to lose? lol. Seriously though - after years of searching for an amazing eye make-up remover - I have found my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> I received the Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads for free via BzzAgent - and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads, they are so easy to use before bed - just pop one out of the package, wipe your eye make-up off and you&#x27;re good to go! The Simple Eye Make-up Remover did it&#x27;s job and removed my eye make-up without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend Simple Eye Make-up Remover Pads to other sensitive skinned folks! Thank you Simple and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> These wipes were heaven sent...WHY? #1) No harsh ingredients. #2)They are so soft. #3) They actually remove the WATERPROOF mascara! I was very surprised that these wipes, so simple, yet so effective, would work for me! There was no greasy feeling or anything, no residue, just clean and fresh eyes! I will continue to use these Simple Eye Make-up Remover pads. I received these wipes for free and I am sharing my HONEST opinion.</li>
            <li> I love the simple line of products and i was lucky enough to try them for free. I would recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin or doesnt like harsh make up removers. It worked great, removed even my darkest make up with ease. And it didnt burn like some removers do by the sensitive skin around my eye. The small package is great for travel or carrying in your purse for when your on the go as well, definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> These were pretty good make up remover pads, and they were gentle enough for use around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Pretty moist straight out of the package but not overly wet.&lt;br /&gt;* Not scented.&lt;br /&gt;* Gentle enough to be used around eyes without hurting.&lt;br /&gt;* Had some difficulty removing all makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were good for use in removing an average application of makeup, including makeup around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Simple products-I used to buy them in England before they were available in the US-because they&#x27;re practical. I like these because they&#x27;re easy to pack and to keep in my purse or gym bag. Keep in mind that these are NOT face wipe size, they are just pads soaked with eye makeup remover. THese did not annoy my (contact wearing) eyes and did get everything off. They&#x27;re not soaking and I did have to work a little on my eyeliner but they do not irritate. I continue to buy these in different formulas, but I found that all work well and are inexpensive!</li>
            <li> These little pads remove eye makeup quickly and efficiently, without any eye irritation.  One pad is sufficient for both eyes, so this little package lasts me a month.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand these! They barely took any makeup off and dried out so easily even though I ensured closing them.</li>
            <li> Although these pads DID remove eye makeup, they didn&#x27;t do it very well. If you&#x27;re wearing much eye makeup (especially waterproof), expect to use 2-4 pads to remove everything. The pads are surprisingly dry, and the material seems a bit thicker than it needs to be, which makes it harder to get around the corners of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the cost and performance of these makeup remover pads, I definitely won&#x27;t be buying again. If they were effective and easy, I wouldn&#x27;t think twice - but it didn&#x27;t seem any easier than using q-tips or cotton balls with a bottle of makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I got to try these eye make-up remover pads free as a preview from BzzAgent.  I found they very smooth on the eyes and not harsh at all like I have found other eye pads to be.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I would say is that they don&#x27;t seem to be moist enough. I feel I sometimes have to use two pads instead of just one sometimes because it doesn&#x27;t take all of the make-up off with the first one.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I like these pads and would recommend them to anyone, no matter how much eye make-up you wear.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of these pads in my Bzz Kit and they are absolutely amazing. I wear a moderate amount of eye makeup (concealer, powder, eyeshadow, eyeliner and waterproof mascara.) I use them at night and in the morning there is no sign of leftover eye makeup. They are gentle enough to use over the eyes without causing irritation.  I love these things!!!</li>
            <li> I received this item in a kit that was sent to me by an {Online Community} that gave the honor on trying this item out. I always had a difficult time finding a product that is gentle and that wont irritate my eyes, but this product in my opinion was great for my delicate eyes and does the job. I totally recommend this product, and it will be worth the try. I will also be buying this after I finish my first packet.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly</li>
            <li> These make up remover wipes are pretty great. If you have allergies or don&#x27;t like strong scents these are awesome. They have a very very light scent. I actually prefer that they aren&#x27;t so moist, you don&#x27;t have the liquid running down your face or getting into your eyes. My main problem with these is the ridges, it makes the wipes not as gentle and after rubbing it might cause slight irritation. I suppose you should use them \\&quot;gently.\\&quot; I would definitely use this item again thouGh. **this product was sent to me to review from bzzagent, for free.</li>
            <li> I got these is my free sample kit from BzzAgent.com and so glad I did. I waited all day to try them because the other ones I used sucked. I am shocked how well they work it was like one swipe and done!  It took a little bit longer with the waterproof mascara but it took it off. The only down side is that they feel a little dry but it only took one pad to do both eyes. I just wish they were a little bit more wet. Other than that they are awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received my very first bzz campaign, got this stuff fo free!! Sign up y&#x27;all! The line is Simple skincare and it included 4 products, full size I might add, not some sample size bs. So that&#x27;s an A+ from the get-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However before I get into my actual review I want to set up my review process. I have various categories which you will see listed below, but my rating system might be a little different from the usual.  It is my own creation called the \\&quot;One Direction Rating Scale\\&quot; and it goes from Zayn to Niall. Zayn being a 1 and Niall being a 5, with Liam Louis and Harry as 2,3, and 4 respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great now that that&#x27;s sorted, let&#x27;s get to the review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Categories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Packaging -Harry&lt;br /&gt;  Simple (.....) with nice colors and easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Remover Pads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Effect- Harry&lt;br /&gt;  Mostly came off, same amount as using a liquid remover, but much easier with just one pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Smell - Niall&lt;br /&gt;  Nothing strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Texture- Louis&lt;br /&gt; A little rough for the eye area I thought, but again the make up has to come off somehow.  But...my special eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spokesperson Category:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spokesperson; Allison Williams- Louis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is arguably the most important category. And for this first review I&#x27;m torn.  Allison Williams who I heard give one radio interview (I&#x27;m writing her biography now) sounded adorbz and so I give her a Harry. HOWEVER! she&#x27;s famous for playing Marnie, on HBO&#x27;s Girls. who is a total Zayn. Can&#x27;t stand her.  So I gave her the average, which is basically Louis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my completely mathematically sound review system. Overall I really did enjoy this product and it will be my new go-to. Also has you can see in the picture, Jack approves. Which is endorsement enough.</li>
            <li> I received my Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads for free to review from Bzz. I like the Simple Eye Make-Up Remover pads because they don&#x27;t leave my eyes or skin dry. If I am wearing light make-up one pad is good enough, but if I wear heavy make-up I need a lot more than one pad, and  I have to scrub harder to get all the make up off. The pads would be much better if they were a little more moist. I do like the end results.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free to review and found that it was ok. I did like that there wasn&#x27;t a strong fragrance and that the removal pad didn&#x27;t burn my eyes but it did take a little effort to get the make up off.I loved the compact size of the packaging and that the actual removal pad was a great size it could be a little more moist but for the most part it is a great remover.</li>
            <li> I will use this product mostly for travel, but for everyday use, it is not my favorite. The pads are small and they feel a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> These are little round pads similar in size to Tucks pads.  I used one pad for both eyes and it seemed to remove all my eye makeup even the waterproof mascara.  I didn&#x27;t feel greasy afterward so I would recommend.  No problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Dried out quickly. Don&#x27;t compare to others, definitely won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> SIMPLE EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER PADS are some of the best disposable face cloths that I have found.  First, they are the right size!  I find most cleansing cloths to be large and wasteful; these are smaller and just the right size.  Two, they are the pleasantly moist; not so wet that they drip everywhere, but not so dry that you have to scrub.  C), they remove my waterproof mascara with ease, allowing me to be gentle on my delicate eye area, but still getting rid of all the black.  Fourth, they remove all my make-up with the one little pad, not just my eye make-up.  Five, it is gentle on my ever increasingly sensitive skin - no redness or breakouts. And F), package is resealable and compact, keeping them moist, and making them a breeze to pack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the Simple line of products; they are just right for my, eh hem, aging skin, and the SIMPLE EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER PADS are no exception.  Convenient and easy to use, they have a light, pleasant, clean scent, they do what they are supposed to do, and they do it well.  And the price is right, too.  I will definitely be ordering more of these.  RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have never used eye make up remover ever....so a first timer I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect....but these particular pads did the job nicely...without any problems.  Even rubbing your eyes they seem very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> These little pads work very well for simple makeup remover.  They easily take off eyeshadow and foundation.  They get a little hung up on waterproof mascara and require a little more rubbing.  Ultimately, they&#x27;re a pretty good addition to a facial regimen, but you can probably achieve the same results with witch hazel pads or simple facial cleanser.  The little pads don&#x27;t have any revolutionary compounds that would make them a necessary addition to any facial regimen.</li>
            <li> Simply does not do the job. This is a very small packet too. You&#x27;ll have better luck with hand soap and hot water..</li>
