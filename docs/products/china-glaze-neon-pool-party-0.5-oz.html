            <li>It looks great on fingers and toes.  </li>
            <li>This polish is a beautiful bright coral/pink color.  </li>
            <li>I used a shiny top coat over it, and the results are beautiful!</li>
            <li>I love this color, great for spring and summer!!</li>
            <li>I didnt like because its good quality of nail polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this will look amazing against your skin tone .</li>
            <li>If you like bright you&#x27;ll love this color, it does need sometimes 3 coats, I notice sometimes I can do 2 coats</li>
            <li>I own over 50 bottles of China Glaze</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this color and it will be perfect for the summer on my toes.  </li>
            <li>I love this fun, bright color!</li>
            <li>It is so bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li>However, beauty shine packaged and shipped the bottle very securely.</li>
            <li>I have gotten more compliments on this color than I ever have.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>Oh we&#x27;ll...live and learn :)</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments whenever I am wearing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unlike so many others that I have seen</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>After trying this color found out I was in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Get so many compliments on the color also.</li>
            <li>and it looks great on, particularly against tanned summer skin.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish is a great summery color, an orangey pink neon that is almost blindingly bright, brighter and more orange than any picture you will find of it online.</li>
            <li>perfect color, essie nail polish is top rated out of tons of other nailpolishes, I definately suggest you buy this.</li>
            <li>This nail polish wears well and it is such a good color for summer!  </li>
            <li>The color is an extremely bright color that comes off more red than fuchsia.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a color you want to wear with a great tan.</li>
            <li>It does dry matte, which I found odd, but glosses up beautifully with a good top coat.</li>
            <li>Pool Party is a great neon pink that gets you in the mood for summer.  </li>
            <li>but the first time I msged them they responded!</li>
            <li>Still, the awesomeness of the color makes it worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>Very neon and fun!  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it makes you look tan ;)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a cute summer color.</li>
            <li>It actually looks pinkish in the bottle but it is a super cool summer color.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, although I love the color and the seller delivered it with perfect promptness, I struggle a little to apply this polish evenly.</li>
            <li>Once it dries, it&#x27;s very ashy looking.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re absolutely smitten with the color and paint nails well, choose another color.</li>
            <li>Great color kinda looks hot pink which if you are dark skin like i am</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well either.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the seller as the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Love this neon pink color!</li>
            <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t quite do it justice and almost mutes how vibrant it is.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this nail polish for those who want a pop of color.</li>
            <li>Like so many other neons, it applies quite streaky and matte without a topcoat, and the chipping starts earlier than many other polishes.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is you need a good clear polish to apply after.</li>
            <li>But the clear fixes it.</li>
            <li>Unlike the others, it is thick yet applies with many streaks.</li>
            <li>I feel obligated to say this color is HOT PINK all the way.  </li>
            <li>Great price definitely less expensive than locally</li>

            <li> Great price definitely less expensive than locally</li>
            <li> and I had to apply several coats of not only the color but the additional gloss which took for ever to dry.</li>
            <li> This color looked different than what I expected, but I like the difference it stands when  I apply it to my toenails.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they keep sending me the same msg saying they are closed</li>
            <li> This is false advertising, this is supposed to be a shiny hot pink, the same brand they use at the nail salon</li>
            <li> Like the other neons from this collection, the finish is matte.</li>
            <li> Neon pink!!</li>
            <li> I think this is ridiculous all I asked for was my money back</li>
            <li> but instead I got a low quality, crappy orange color that looks so horrible and cheap on my nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure if I&#x27;m having troubles because the formula is bad or if the bottle is old.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t remember this brand being so dull.</li>
            <li> It took three coats to even out and now looks very thick.</li>
            <li> and this is definitely one of the few that I am very disappointed with.</li>
            <li> Little disappointed cause</li>

            <li> Awesome color, bright and really attractive. Strangers compliment me when I wear my pool party!. Great price definitely less expensive than locally</li>
            <li> Great color kinda looks hot pink which if you are dark skin like i am&lt;br /&gt;this will look amazing against your skin tone .</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, but goes on matte, not glossy. I used a shiny top coat over it, and the results are beautiful! Perfect color for summer...and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it makes you look tan ;)</li>
            <li> It actually looks pinkish in the bottle but it is a super cool summer color.  I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love the color BUT it takes 3+ coats to just get the color to so that you can&#x27;t see through it.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well either.  Little disappointed cause it&#x27;s such a cute summer color.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail polish 3 weeks ago, I never got it, they charged me for it and the tracking said it was delivered! I contacted the seller and they keep sending me the same msg saying they are closed but the first time I msged them they responded! I think this is ridiculous all I asked for was my money back cuz it&#x27;s obvious I&#x27;m not gonna get my stuff and they won&#x27;t answer me back! I&#x27;m so unsatisfied! This has happened to me b4 but they gave me my money back!</li>
            <li> This is so bright!! Neon pink!! If you like bright you&#x27;ll love this color, it does need sometimes 3 coats, I notice sometimes I can do 2 coats then maybe one or two fingers need 3, it&#x27;s nice and shiny!!

            <li> This is a perfect color for spring and summer on your toes.  The color matches with everything and this polish has staying power.</li>
            <li> I love this fun, bright color! I get so many compliments whenever I am wearing it. Must have summer polish!</li>
