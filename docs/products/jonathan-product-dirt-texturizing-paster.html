            <li>I saw someone at the mall with great hair, so I asked her what she used on it .  </li>
            <li>It gave my hair great body and control.</li>
            <li>I have never found a hair product that felt and smelled as great as this one does...</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Try Rusk Wired if you are looking for a great styling cream.</li>
            <li>Dirt provides the manageability, hold and look I&#x27;ve strived for and even smells great with its almond scent.  </li>
            <li>They did a great job at promotion, which I bought into.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because i wanted some texture/volume and that great hair you get the day after you get it cut.</li>
            <li>Great smell and great feel.</li>
            <li>I bought dirt on a reccomendation from a friend, and this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, too.  </li>
            <li>(Even if it hadn&#x27;t worked as great as it does, I think I would still purchase it just for the delicious scent)  :)  </li>
            <li>Plus, it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>It smells awesome and makes my hair look even better.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because it smelled so darn good</li>
            <li>What ever the case, I loved the product and I suggest people try it...</li>
            <li>Upon opening the jar, the smell is just OUTSTANDING!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Dirt has proven to be an amazing product...</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Dirt really is the best product for unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>He kind of liked the way Jonathan styled his hair</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m a NEED volume kind of girl.</li>
            <li>I must say that this is by far the best hair pomade or paste that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product achieves incredible texture and separation -- the hairs seem to automatically cluster together in ideal-sized pieces, which then seem to automatically splay out in a very natural-looking way.</li>
            <li>Smells good, offers incredible shine, strong hold.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, rinses out of hair easily.</li>
            <li>Bed Head by TIGI is a better product.</li>
            <li>This stuff also smells better than any hair care product I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li>Used properly, this product is great!</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m yet to try this product because I just finished placing my order.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can run my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li>I love Jonathan Dirt.</li>
            <li>I use to love Jonathan, but now I am soooo disapointed in his products..</li>
            <li>I love the almond scent as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products....</li>
            <li>I love this product, as does my sister and mother.</li>
            <li>and my sisters gets greasy looking after a day and both of us love this stuff</li>
            <li>and I love using this product.</li>
            <li>I find it important to rub Dirt between my palms to warm it up before applying.  </li>
            <li>you can always add more.</li>
            <li>I do however like his volumizing foam better for volume.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Most of us aren&#x27;t used to paying those Rodeo Drive prices, Jonathan.  </li>
            <li>$26 may not be a lot to you, but....  :) &lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, i thought the smell was just ok.</li>
            <li>And it leaves your hair feeling conditioned and healthy.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t imagine a product better suited to this application.    </li>
            <li>Aveda Control Paste (Pros: Smells luscious, washes out OK.</li>
            <li>i am absolutely in love with product.</li>
            <li>so I have tried every product there is, and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and also...I am NOT in love with Jonathan nor his TV show, I bought this product before I had even heard of him or his TV show...</li>
            <li>After using this product on him the bone straight hair is easily managable and it looks great.</li>
            <li>so she kind of emphasized DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH !!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of the show and it seemed like Jonathan was really pushing for a good product.  </li>
            <li>Even my husband, who was making fun of me for buying it, liked it.  </li>
            <li>So far, the best product I have found to give some volume and texture to my straight hair is by Tigi and its called Bed Head (its a spray wax).</li>
            <li>Struct Pliable Molding Creme (Pros: Flexible hold, rinses out of hair easily.</li>
            <li>, easy to find.</li>
            <li>, easy to find.</li>
            <li>Before this I used Crew Pomade, a good product but not quite as lasting and effective as I would like.</li>
            <li>(Pros: Strong hold.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and can practically feel each strand shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>But it does leave my hair softer and shiny which I enjoy.    </li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>Please Please Please Please save your money, or (and I am sure Jonathan would love this since he cares so much for the enviroment) dontate the money you want to spend on this product to some charity that will help save our Earth.</li>
            <li>I am a waiter in a busy restaurant and that is a really good test for any hair care product because I&#x27;m always on the move and my hair has to withstand steam and heat.</li>
            <li>All doubt were laid to rest, though, when, in a hurry, I worked it through damp (towel-dried) hair, ran out the door, and discovered later in the day that my hair looked its best in years -- just as if it had been professionally styled!     </li>
            <li>a little more product info would have been great.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice smell, but other the products smell nice too.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing special to this product.  </li>
            <li>While this product costs more you don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as a pomade or gel</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t do TOO much damage, but to go from totally healthy hair that didn&#x27;t fall out to hair that broke off in pieces</li>
            <li>&quot;, it is true with this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, with a well receded hair line I still tried to get what&#x27;s left to be manageable and look good -</li>
            <li>I hope that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something that would give me good hold and texture with low to medium shine, and Dirt did it.  </li>
            <li>Great Product.. don&#x27;t believe those other reviews..</li>
            <li>I tried it first then bought it on the spot!</li>
            <li>she absolutely loves it!!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li>If you use it properly then it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it is worth over $20.</li>
            <li>but well worth it</li>
            <li>It works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life.</li>
            <li>Best yet: this stuff rinses out almost completely with plain water (no shampoo).</li>
            <li>I can dry my hair and put a \\&quot;dab\\&quot;( not even pea size as directed) on mostly just the ends of damp or dry hair crunch and go and have great body.  </li>
            <li>After leave-in conditioner, I rub some dirt into my palms and pull my palms (not fingers) through my hair, kind of like I&#x27;m flat ironing with my palms.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Flyaways and unruly hair problems are solved right away.</li>
            <li>The scent is a light vanilla-almond when you first put it in and the scent dissipates after a while so unless someone gets REALLY close to you, no one will detect it.</li>
            <li>I have short, bodiless hair and this product gives me the full, separated look that I have tried many products for with dismal results.  </li>
            <li>best to do it while wet, but if i blow dry my hair after applying it i can&#x27;t even tell i used it so for my hair in my location</li>
            <li>I used a smudge and it really did give my stick straight, fine hair some body and movement.  </li>
            <li>Dirt is the first product I have used where I can&#x27;t feel that it is there.</li>
            <li>I must have stiffed it for 10 minutes before I put the top back on.  </li>
            <li>ALL hair types and Dirt did the job for the first day..</li>
            <li>I am alittle bummed that this happened since initially my hair looks fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I was just about to order here, when I realized that the shipping is free if you order directly from [...].  </li>
            <li>without Dirt, hot rollers don&#x27;t eliminate my frizz, so i can definitely see that the product with my usual anti-frizz, ionic rollers is what&#x27;s best for me.  </li>
            <li>every month because I could never find one that worked exactly how I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>But I first tried this a year ago and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used since.  </li>
            <li>When Jonathan first spoke of creating \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This was the first product I bought from his line.</li>
            <li>Always melt by rubbing hands together first.  </li>
            <li>he is able to manage his hair easily enough!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it make my hair really light and and soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair frizz free and mold able to do what I please with it, but about half way through the day</li>
            <li>Love this product for my fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s best on wet hair, air dried.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t figure out why the others have rated this product sooo incredibly low... perhaps a hair product involves too many subjective considerations...</li>
            <li>I use very little of it which, I think, is the mark of a good product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to run to Sephora and grab ALL of his products but at the hefty price, I opted to try Dirt first since he promoted it so much on his show.  </li>
            <li>I can do pretty much anything to my hair with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a texturizing paste, not super glue, you can&#x27;t expect amazing hold out of it.  </li>
            <li>I like Dirt Texturizing Paste so much that when I&#x27;m using one jar, I always have another, unopened one ready when the first jar runs out.</li>
            <li>Oh with his charisma and that certain Joie de vie that gives me a rush how could he.  </li>
            <li>I just had my fine, processed hair cut into a short layered wedge.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair and just want a little soft texture, hair wax might work better for you.</li>
            <li>but I really respected Jonathan&#x27;s commitment to quality as he demonstrated so forcefully on his show.  </li>
            <li>have a whole day planned out for it, now I just have doubt.</li>
            <li>With gel I always had to use so much to make it hold all day that I felt</li>
            <li>so it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>hair is straight and reaches my shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li>It gives my curly shoulder length hair so much body</li>
            <li>If used correctly and in moderation, it is very lightweight non-greasy.</li>
            <li>You just have to figure out how much to use for *</li>
            <li>My fiance has bone straight hair and he watchees the show with me.</li>
            <li>It really works without making your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it was MUCH cheaper there.</li>
            <li>Cons: Very oily.)  </li>
            <li>My hair is long straight and fine.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i actually didnt buy the item from amazon, i saw it at costco today and was excited that they would have it.</li>
            <li>First ordered from QVC until they quit carrying it then started getting it from Sephora directly and now Sephora through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Jonathan Dirt is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Start off with less and add more.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly, and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li>Start with a little and add more if you need to.  </li>
            <li>I tired Dirt this morning and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>when it got about to my shoulders i couldnt use my old pastes and polmades any more because they weighed down my hair..</li>
            <li>But having short hair and looking for a none gel that would allow me to mold and sculpt my hair this product was right up my ally.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy new gels, pommades, pastes, etc.</li>
            <li>I first tried it on dry hair, very frizz-prone hair, and it was a disaster.  </li>
            <li>So the next time I used it, I added alittle moisturizer first, then used it...same result.  </li>
            <li>This was the first and only purchase I have ever made off QVC</li>
            <li>I was so completely disapointed in this product!  </li>
            <li>Expensive, but more than worth it since it lasts forever because you don&#x27;t need to use that much to get the style you&#x27;ll want.  </li>
            <li>This works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I have used every type of hair product for my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>Just a little rubbed on my fingers and then \\&quot;pinched\\&quot; lightly throughout my (layered) hair, and my hair looks just the way I want it to look.</li>
            <li>(considering you only have to use a little, you&#x27;re sure to save $$$).  </li>
            <li>You only have to use a little bit of product and make sure you rub it in your hands before you apply it to your hair.  </li>
            <li>completely and my hair started breaking off.  </li>
            <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t really look any different with it, alone.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft and manageable, even at the end of the day, and without the sticky \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; feel.  </li>
            <li>As an old product used to use the slogan \\&quot;a</li>
            <li>so you can maintain soft spikes or a clumpier</li>
            <li>I then, pull on all the ends of my hair to add texture and barely touch the flyaways at my roots to smooth them down...</li>
            <li>American Crew Classic Wax (Pros: Inexpensive</li>
            <li>Sumotech are the only two products I will use, and I highly reccomend both.</li>
            <li>This product lasts a LONG time, though, so it&#x27;s a very frugal buy.</li>
            <li>&quot; look, I&#x27;ve spent the last several years trying just about every texturizing product available.</li>
            <li>i have to use hot rollers for just a few seconds and somehow that smooths it out and the curl falls to body with a slick, healthy sheen.  </li>
            <li>Not a single one of them comes close to offering the functionality and results that Dirt offers.     </li>
            <li>I use other Jonathan products and really like them all!</li>
            <li>I have huge curly Jew-fro hair, and this is the only product I have found that can really tame it.</li>
            <li>Whether I let it be natural, curl it more, or straighten it, I use Dirt to tame it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my old product.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s loaded down with product.</li>
            <li>less is like nothing and more is horribly heavy.</li>
            <li>it works with my longer hair to keep it textured, keeps it from frizzing, and helps me keep the straight peicey look and with an upside down appliation helps give my hair a healthy boost with out falling flat in 15 minutes like the other stuff on the market!!!!</li>
            <li>This product, for sure, could be horrible if used wrong, but if you know how to use it....is absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li>Use a little first...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying out and for all of those negative people who say it isn&#x27;t worth the money, perhaps you should have tried it in Sephora first before you spent your \\&quot;hard earned\\&quot; money.</li>
            <li>Jonathan Dirt has solved this long-term issue for me in just the first few days of use.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go all in less than 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have short, thin, wavy hair that I flat iron, and I just rub my fingers along the top of the paste to just get a thin layer on the tips of my fingers and apply it to my roots, it works amazing for volume, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it weighing my hair down or looking greasy!</li>

            <li> Dirt provides the manageability, hold and look I&#x27;ve strived for and even smells great with its almond scent.  </li>

            <li> Smells great, too.  </li>
            <li> (Even if it hadn&#x27;t worked as great as it does, I think I would still purchase it just for the delicious scent)  :)  </li>
            <li> Plus, it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> It smells awesome and makes my hair look even better.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because it smelled so darn good</li>
            <li> What ever the case, I loved the product and I suggest people try it...</li>
            <li> Upon opening the jar, the smell is just OUTSTANDING!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Dirt has proven to be an amazing product...</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Dirt really is the best product for unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> He kind of liked the way Jonathan styled his hair</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m a NEED volume kind of girl.</li>
            <li> I must say that this is by far the best hair pomade or paste that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product achieves incredible texture and separation -- the hairs seem to automatically cluster together in ideal-sized pieces, which then seem to automatically splay out in a very natural-looking way.</li>
            <li> Smells good, offers incredible shine, strong hold.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, rinses out of hair easily.</li>
            <li> Bed Head by TIGI is a better product.</li>
            <li> This stuff also smells better than any hair care product I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> Used properly, this product is great!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m yet to try this product because I just finished placing my order.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can run my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li> I love Jonathan Dirt.</li>
            <li> I use to love Jonathan, but now I am soooo disapointed in his products..</li>
            <li> I love the almond scent as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products....</li>
            <li> I love this product, as does my sister and mother.</li>
            <li> and my sisters gets greasy looking after a day and both of us love this stuff</li>
            <li> and I love using this product.</li>
            <li> I find it important to rub Dirt between my palms to warm it up before applying.  </li>
            <li> you can always add more.</li>
            <li> I do however like his volumizing foam better for volume.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Most of us aren&#x27;t used to paying those Rodeo Drive prices, Jonathan.  </li>
            <li> $26 may not be a lot to you, but....  :) &lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, i thought the smell was just ok.</li>
            <li> And it leaves your hair feeling conditioned and healthy.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t imagine a product better suited to this application.    </li>
            <li> Aveda Control Paste (Pros: Smells luscious, washes out OK.</li>
            <li> i am absolutely in love with product.</li>
            <li> so I have tried every product there is, and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and also...I am NOT in love with Jonathan nor his TV show, I bought this product before I had even heard of him or his TV show...</li>
            <li> After using this product on him the bone straight hair is easily managable and it looks great.</li>
            <li> so she kind of emphasized DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the show and it seemed like Jonathan was really pushing for a good product.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband, who was making fun of me for buying it, liked it.  </li>
            <li> So far, the best product I have found to give some volume and texture to my straight hair is by Tigi and its called Bed Head (its a spray wax).</li>
            <li> Struct Pliable Molding Creme (Pros: Flexible hold, rinses out of hair easily.</li>
            <li> , easy to find.</li>
            <li> , easy to find.</li>
            <li> Before this I used Crew Pomade, a good product but not quite as lasting and effective as I would like.</li>
            <li> (Pros: Strong hold.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and can practically feel each strand shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> But it does leave my hair softer and shiny which I enjoy.    </li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Please Please Please Please save your money, or (and I am sure Jonathan would love this since he cares so much for the enviroment) dontate the money you want to spend on this product to some charity that will help save our Earth.</li>
            <li> I am a waiter in a busy restaurant and that is a really good test for any hair care product because I&#x27;m always on the move and my hair has to withstand steam and heat.</li>
            <li> All doubt were laid to rest, though, when, in a hurry, I worked it through damp (towel-dried) hair, ran out the door, and discovered later in the day that my hair looked its best in years -- just as if it had been professionally styled!     </li>
            <li> a little more product info would have been great.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice smell, but other the products smell nice too.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing special to this product.  </li>
            <li> While this product costs more you don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as a pomade or gel</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t do TOO much damage, but to go from totally healthy hair that didn&#x27;t fall out to hair that broke off in pieces</li>
            <li> &quot;, it is true with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, with a well receded hair line I still tried to get what&#x27;s left to be manageable and look good -</li>
            <li> I hope that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something that would give me good hold and texture with low to medium shine, and Dirt did it.  </li>
            <li> Great Product.. don&#x27;t believe those other reviews..</li>
            <li> I tried it first then bought it on the spot!</li>
            <li> she absolutely loves it!!  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li> If you use it properly then it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think it is worth over $20.</li>
            <li> but well worth it</li>
            <li> It works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life.</li>
            <li> Best yet: this stuff rinses out almost completely with plain water (no shampoo).</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair and put a \\&quot;dab\\&quot;( not even pea size as directed) on mostly just the ends of damp or dry hair crunch and go and have great body.  </li>
            <li> After leave-in conditioner, I rub some dirt into my palms and pull my palms (not fingers) through my hair, kind of like I&#x27;m flat ironing with my palms.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> Flyaways and unruly hair problems are solved right away.</li>
            <li> The scent is a light vanilla-almond when you first put it in and the scent dissipates after a while so unless someone gets REALLY close to you, no one will detect it.</li>
            <li> I have short, bodiless hair and this product gives me the full, separated look that I have tried many products for with dismal results.  </li>
            <li> best to do it while wet, but if i blow dry my hair after applying it i can&#x27;t even tell i used it so for my hair in my location</li>
            <li> I used a smudge and it really did give my stick straight, fine hair some body and movement.  </li>
            <li> Dirt is the first product I have used where I can&#x27;t feel that it is there.</li>
            <li> I must have stiffed it for 10 minutes before I put the top back on.  </li>
            <li> ALL hair types and Dirt did the job for the first day..</li>
            <li> I am alittle bummed that this happened since initially my hair looks fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I was just about to order here, when I realized that the shipping is free if you order directly from [...].  </li>
            <li> without Dirt, hot rollers don&#x27;t eliminate my frizz, so i can definitely see that the product with my usual anti-frizz, ionic rollers is what&#x27;s best for me.  </li>
            <li> every month because I could never find one that worked exactly how I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> But I first tried this a year ago and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used since.  </li>
            <li> When Jonathan first spoke of creating \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This was the first product I bought from his line.</li>
            <li> Always melt by rubbing hands together first.  </li>
            <li> he is able to manage his hair easily enough!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it make my hair really light and and soft.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair frizz free and mold able to do what I please with it, but about half way through the day</li>
            <li> Love this product for my fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s best on wet hair, air dried.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t figure out why the others have rated this product sooo incredibly low... perhaps a hair product involves too many subjective considerations...</li>
            <li> I use very little of it which, I think, is the mark of a good product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to run to Sephora and grab ALL of his products but at the hefty price, I opted to try Dirt first since he promoted it so much on his show.  </li>
            <li> I can do pretty much anything to my hair with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a texturizing paste, not super glue, you can&#x27;t expect amazing hold out of it.  </li>
            <li> I like Dirt Texturizing Paste so much that when I&#x27;m using one jar, I always have another, unopened one ready when the first jar runs out.</li>
            <li> Oh with his charisma and that certain Joie de vie that gives me a rush how could he.  </li>
            <li> I just had my fine, processed hair cut into a short layered wedge.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair and just want a little soft texture, hair wax might work better for you.</li>
            <li> but I really respected Jonathan&#x27;s commitment to quality as he demonstrated so forcefully on his show.  </li>
            <li> have a whole day planned out for it, now I just have doubt.</li>
            <li> With gel I always had to use so much to make it hold all day that I felt</li>
            <li> so it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> hair is straight and reaches my shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li> It gives my curly shoulder length hair so much body</li>
            <li> If used correctly and in moderation, it is very lightweight non-greasy.</li>
            <li> You just have to figure out how much to use for *</li>
            <li> My fiance has bone straight hair and he watchees the show with me.</li>
            <li> It really works without making your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it was MUCH cheaper there.</li>
            <li> Cons: Very oily.)  </li>
            <li> My hair is long straight and fine.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i actually didnt buy the item from amazon, i saw it at costco today and was excited that they would have it.</li>
            <li> First ordered from QVC until they quit carrying it then started getting it from Sephora directly and now Sephora through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Jonathan Dirt is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Start off with less and add more.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly, and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Start with a little and add more if you need to.  </li>
            <li> I tired Dirt this morning and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> when it got about to my shoulders i couldnt use my old pastes and polmades any more because they weighed down my hair..</li>
            <li> But having short hair and looking for a none gel that would allow me to mold and sculpt my hair this product was right up my ally.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy new gels, pommades, pastes, etc.</li>
            <li> I first tried it on dry hair, very frizz-prone hair, and it was a disaster.  </li>
            <li> So the next time I used it, I added alittle moisturizer first, then used it...same result.  </li>
            <li> This was the first and only purchase I have ever made off QVC</li>
            <li> I was so completely disapointed in this product!  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but more than worth it since it lasts forever because you don&#x27;t need to use that much to get the style you&#x27;ll want.  </li>
            <li> This works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have used every type of hair product for my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> Just a little rubbed on my fingers and then \\&quot;pinched\\&quot; lightly throughout my (layered) hair, and my hair looks just the way I want it to look.</li>
            <li> (considering you only have to use a little, you&#x27;re sure to save $$$).  </li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit of product and make sure you rub it in your hands before you apply it to your hair.  </li>
            <li> completely and my hair started breaking off.  </li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t really look any different with it, alone.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft and manageable, even at the end of the day, and without the sticky \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; feel.  </li>
            <li> As an old product used to use the slogan \\&quot;a</li>
            <li> so you can maintain soft spikes or a clumpier</li>
            <li> I then, pull on all the ends of my hair to add texture and barely touch the flyaways at my roots to smooth them down...</li>
            <li> American Crew Classic Wax (Pros: Inexpensive</li>
            <li> Sumotech are the only two products I will use, and I highly reccomend both.</li>
            <li> This product lasts a LONG time, though, so it&#x27;s a very frugal buy.</li>
            <li> &quot; look, I&#x27;ve spent the last several years trying just about every texturizing product available.</li>
            <li> i have to use hot rollers for just a few seconds and somehow that smooths it out and the curl falls to body with a slick, healthy sheen.  </li>
            <li> Not a single one of them comes close to offering the functionality and results that Dirt offers.     </li>
            <li> I use other Jonathan products and really like them all!</li>
            <li> I have huge curly Jew-fro hair, and this is the only product I have found that can really tame it.</li>
            <li> Whether I let it be natural, curl it more, or straighten it, I use Dirt to tame it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my old product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s loaded down with product.</li>
            <li> less is like nothing and more is horribly heavy.</li>
            <li> it works with my longer hair to keep it textured, keeps it from frizzing, and helps me keep the straight peicey look and with an upside down appliation helps give my hair a healthy boost with out falling flat in 15 minutes like the other stuff on the market!!!!</li>
            <li> This product, for sure, could be horrible if used wrong, but if you know how to use it....is absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li> Use a little first...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying out and for all of those negative people who say it isn&#x27;t worth the money, perhaps you should have tried it in Sephora first before you spent your \\&quot;hard earned\\&quot; money.</li>
            <li> Jonathan Dirt has solved this long-term issue for me in just the first few days of use.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go all in less than 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have short, thin, wavy hair that I flat iron, and I just rub my fingers along the top of the paste to just get a thin layer on the tips of my fingers and apply it to my roots, it works amazing for volume, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it weighing my hair down or looking greasy!</li>
            <li> I mean he cares right?  </li>
            <li> Get a small amount in your palm or on your finger and rub between both palms until warm and thin.  </li>
            <li> It does give my hair some volume, I have medium length, thin, straight hair with some natural wave in the back.  </li>
            <li> Only really saturating the hair with the product could have given the negative results I read about.  </li>
            <li> everything else I&#x27;ve used left my hair dry, flaked off or didn&#x27;t hold.  </li>
            <li> I know I could turn the negative reviews to positive if I just showed them how to use it.  </li>
            <li> I mean my hair is usually pretty dry</li>
            <li> if i apply it to dry hair, i rip several hundred hairs from my head because the paste is sooooo tacky my hands get stuck in all of my dry, fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> it makes your hair just rough enough to give it an edge...</li>
            <li> I am forced to conclude that the people who did not like this product did not fully read the instructions and used way too much of the product.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical because the product is very thick and doesn&#x27;t emulsify easily in my hands.</li>
            <li> I spent 26 of my hard earned cash to get this, and I could have gone to my local CVS and got some final net product for $1.99 which would have left my hair with the same feeling.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, the product was no way better than any other less expensive professional product lines such as Redken, or TIGI or any other line in the same category.  </li>
            <li> Dirt is like a super-thick, dry paste.  </li>
            <li> I just blow dry, scrunching my hair with my fingers and when almost dry, I turn my head upside-down and apply about a dime size amount of Dirt into the roots.</li>
            <li> I usually just blow dry it with no moisturizers as my hair naturally produces oil.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this overpriced product, you get the same or even better results with less expensive products.</li>
            <li> (the less you touch your, the less frizzy it will be) and dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> It simply weighs your hair down and makes it greasy, plus it provides NO hold.</li>
            <li> Totally overpriced and just weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on purchasing other Jonathan Products!</li>
            <li> the jar says wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair, wavy (if I let it dry by itself), thick, and VERY uncooperative.</li>
            <li> It tends to be dry, it&#x27;s thick, course, and naturally curly.</li>
            <li> I only wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I honestly find him a little annoying, but this product definitely isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it reminds me of a block of slightly wet talcum powder.  </li>
            <li> Then, I tried it with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Your hair WON&#x27;T look overly done-up, like you spent 45 minutes working on it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the volumizing foam on my wet hair</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just want to try the small size, but I can&#x27;t stand paying several dollars for shipping on one ounce of product!  </li>
            <li> I have a layered, razor cut that flips out and, before, was using three other products (pomade-for shine, manipulator-for flip, and aquage paste-for volume).  </li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair limp and greasy - even if I only use a little dab.  </li>
            <li> Well as a BIG fan of the show and of Jonathan I could hardly wait to try this product.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not worth the price tag ($26 I believe).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it really did work.  </li>
            <li> Good for outrageous styling, but not for subtler styles.)  </li>
            <li> I knew that Jonathan could not let me down.</li>
            <li> I am trying not to blame Jon, it could have been his people who let me down, but I am loosing faith.  </li>
            <li> What a let down with this product...</li>
            <li> All it does is weight my hair down and make it sticky.</li>
            <li> I must say this person must have greasy hair to begin with and then smeared half of the container on their head.</li>
            <li> Other products that you get from the store make your hair crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> For a guy like me with hair that is a little bit over an inch, you really only need a very small amount, a dab less than the size of a dime rubbed in your palms.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over do it or you&#x27;ll have a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> I mean this is his life long dream, why would he waiver on quality?  </li>
            <li> , that is how little you need.  </li>
            <li> again, a little help, folks at Jonathon.  </li>
            <li> little dab&#x27;l do ya\\</li>
            <li> it seems to \\&quot;absorb\\&quot; into my hair or something, b/c the hold goes away a little.  </li>
            <li> Shake it out a little</li>
            <li> You have to use just a little or it can become heavy.  </li>
            <li> , if you use too much it looks greasy and dirty.</li>
            <li> Why would he promote such a poor product?  </li>
            <li> like I had helmet hair and pomades felt heavy and would just stop holding.</li>
            <li> then..it totally dried my hair out..</li>
            <li> i probably wasted about $2.75 of product trying to figure all that out.  </li>
            <li> I really do not understand all the negative reviews?</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product from a friend who did not enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> This keeps it in place without it being stiff.</li>
            <li> BTW, Dirt doesn&#x27;t hold stiff spikes.</li>
            <li> Hold is too stiff.</li>
            <li> No stylist could ever tame it.</li>
            <li> It is not worth it!!</li>
            <li> I equate this to the thighmaster, a horrible product being promoted by a celebrity for cash, and not the love of the consumer.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a magic cure for me.  </li>
            <li> I was anxiously hoping to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because it made my head feel it was dipped in vaseline, and it left big grease spots on my pillows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over the past year.</li>
            <li> (as with Dirt, put a small amount on the ends).</li>
            <li> I am not sure what everyone is complaining about.</li>
            <li> To provide some context, here are some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried, arranged approximately in descending order of my satisfaction with them:    </li>
            <li> Bed Head Hard</li>
            <li> Hard to control.</li>
            <li> I found it too sticky and thick and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold by late afternoon when I needed it to work all day.</li>
            <li> I have read all the negative reviews for this product and I am amazed.  </li>
            <li> One negative I also noticed is it leaves glitter in your hand after you apply it</li>
            <li> Cons: Extremely thick.</li>
            <li> And because it is a PASTE, it&#x27;s extremely thick</li>
            <li> &quot; look, but what does that mean?  </li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time, so don&#x27;t be afraid of the price.  </li>
            <li> the instructions are terribly vague and for that Jonathon products deserve the bad reviews; they asked for it by not being clear.  </li>
            <li> Cons: Very thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no hair on my head that curls the same as one next to it, so it was bad, bad, bad.</li>
            <li> The negative comments all in a row for all his products look suspicously fake!)</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve learned through an expensive trial and error: &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This stuff is useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the name seemed to be well rather foreshadowing as it made my hair well feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> Cons: Very expensive, ineffective hold, sticky texture, leaves hair feeling damaged after wash-out.)  </li>
            <li> Smells bad.)</li>
            <li> Work Dirt through just the ends, unless you want a very dirty look.</li>
            <li> also... it isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, so it doesn&#x27;t leave an annoying feeling in your hands as you adjust it during the day....</li>
            <li> I bought it inspite of my hate for the ego maniac and was dissapointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Well as a BIG fan of the show and of Jonathan I could hardly wait to try this product.  Admitedly I found the name Dirt to be somewhat of a turn off but I really respected Jonathan&#x27;s commitment to quality as he demonstrated so forcefully on his show.  Unfortunately the name seemed to be well rather foreshadowing as it made my hair well feel dirty.  This is not something I was hoping to accomplish.  Bed Head by TIGI is a better product.</li>
            <li> After seeing this product hyped on the smash reality hit show \\&quot;blow out\\&quot; I was dieing to try it.  I knew that Jonathan could not let me down. Oh with his charisma and that certain Joie de vie that gives me a rush how could he.  However after trying this product I have to say my balloon has been burst.  I spent 26 of my hard earned cash to get this, and I could have gone to my local CVS and got some final net product for $1.99 which would have left my hair with the same feeling.  There is nothing special to this product.  I equate this to the thighmaster, a horrible product being promoted by a celebrity for cash, and not the love of the consumer.  Why would he do this to us?  I am trying not to blame Jon, it could have been his people who let me down, but I am loosing faith.  Why would he promote such a poor product?  I mean he cares right?  He is so above product promotion just for cash.  I mean this is his life long dream, why would he waiver on quality?  I was going to make an appointment with his salon when I go on vacation to LA next summer, have a whole day planned out for it, now I just have doubt. Please Please Please Please save your money, or (and I am sure Jonathan would love this since he cares so much for the enviroment) dontate the money you want to spend on this product to some charity that will help save our Earth.</li>
            <li> I must say that this is by far the best hair pomade or paste that I have ever used. I used LA Looks gel for the longest time but that always ended up flaking out and making me look like I had dandruff by the end of the day. Before this I used Crew Pomade, a good product but not quite as lasting and effective as I would like. It didn&#x27;t hold by late afternoon when I needed it to work all day. Dirt is the first product I have used where I can&#x27;t feel that it is there. This is the first time that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s loaded down with product. With gel I always had to use so much to make it hold all day that I felt like I had helmet hair and pomades felt heavy and would just stop holding. I am a waiter in a busy restaurant and that is a really good test for any hair care product because I&#x27;m always on the move and my hair has to withstand steam and heat. While this product costs more you don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as a pomade or gel so it lasts much longer. After reading the review that said this left a grease stain on a pillow I must say this person must have greasy hair to begin with and then smeared half of the container on their head. I put on what I consider to be an excess amount and couldn&#x27;t get it to leave a stain on anything. For a guy like me with hair that is a little bit over an inch, you really only need a very small amount, a dab less than the size of a dime rubbed in your palms. This stuff isn&#x27;t gel or sculpting foam and shouldn&#x27;t be used in the quantities that those products are used. This stuff also smells better than any hair care product I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> Ok.  I am such a fan of Jonathan Antin and his show.  I SO want his products to do well for him.  I wanted to run to Sephora and grab ALL of his products but at the hefty price, I opted to try Dirt first since he promoted it so much on his show.  Upon opening the jar, the smell is just OUTSTANDING!  I must have stiffed it for 10 minutes before I put the top back on.  It smells REALLY good!  I went home, washed my hair and followed the directions on how to use it.  Now.  I have to say that I am a woman of color and I have medium-course hair.  I usually just blow dry it with no moisturizers as my hair naturally produces oil.  Jonathan said his products are for ALL hair types and Dirt did the job for the first day..then..it totally dried my hair out..completely and my hair started breaking off.  So the next time I used it, I added alittle moisturizer first, then used it...same result.  I am alittle bummed that this happened since initially my hair looks fabulous!  I gave it 2 stars because it smelled so darn good but for ME, personally, it just wrecked my hair.  I only used it a couple times so it didn&#x27;t do TOO much damage, but to go from totally healthy hair that didn&#x27;t fall out to hair that broke off in pieces, it&#x27;s just not worth the price tag ($26 I believe). I haven&#x27;t given up on ole Johnny Boy, I will try his shampoo and conditioner and let you know!</li>
            <li> I have read all the negative reviews for this product and I am amazed.  Could their jars have been replaced by aliens?  I have short, bodiless hair and this product gives me the full, separated look that I have tried many products for with dismal results.  I am forced to conclude that the people who did not like this product did not fully read the instructions and used way too much of the product.  Only really saturating the hair with the product could have given the negative results I read about.  Used properly, this product is great!</li>
            <li> This product works well when I use it with a curling iron.  The low rating is for the cost.  I just don&#x27;t think it is worth over $20.</li>
            <li> I have used every type of hair product for my fine, limp hair.  Jonathan Dirt is hands down my favorite.  I know I could turn the negative reviews to positive if I just showed them how to use it.  I just ran out of my jar after 2.5 years...that&#x27;s right, that is how little you need.  This was the first and only purchase I have ever made off QVC and they explained well how to use the product.  Get a small amount in your palm or on your finger and rub between both palms until warm and thin.  I then, pull on all the ends of my hair to add texture and barely touch the flyaways at my roots to smooth them down...sometimes, I will use what is left on my hands and reach my hands up under my hair to lift at the roots.  This product, for sure, could be horrible if used wrong, but if you know how to use it....is absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m yet to try this product because I just finished placing my order.  I just want to try the small size, but I can&#x27;t stand paying several dollars for shipping on one ounce of product!  I was just about to order here, when I realized that the shipping is free if you order directly from [...].  Hope it helps someone save some cash!</li>
            <li> Dirt is like a super-thick, dry paste.  it reminds me of a block of slightly wet talcum powder.  the instructions are terribly vague and for that Jonathon products deserve the bad reviews; they asked for it by not being clear.  it&#x27;s supposed to give your hair that \\&quot;next day\\&quot; look, but what does that mean?  here&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve learned through an expensive trial and error: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;my hair is straight and reaches my shoulder blades.  it&#x27;s processed, so not the healthiest and tends to look frizzy here in the gulf humidity.  for my hair, i&#x27;ve learned i need a pea-sized or slightly larger amount.  less is like nothing and more is horribly heavy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;when to put it on?  the jar says wet or dry.  again, a little help, folks at Jonathon.  if i apply it to dry hair, i rip several hundred hairs from my head because the paste is sooooo tacky my hands get stuck in all of my dry, fly-away hair.  best to do it while wet, but if i blow dry my hair after applying it i can&#x27;t even tell i used it so for my hair in my location, it&#x27;s best on wet hair, air dried. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;last, it&#x27;s not a magic cure for me.  my hair doesn&#x27;t really look any different with it, alone.  i have to use hot rollers for just a few seconds and somehow that smooths it out and the curl falls to body with a slick, healthy sheen.  without Dirt, hot rollers don&#x27;t eliminate my frizz, so i can definitely see that the product with my usual anti-frizz, ionic rollers is what&#x27;s best for me.  i probably wasted about $2.75 of product trying to figure all that out.  a little more product info would have been great.</li>
            <li> Dirt has proven to be an amazing product...I&#x27;m \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; with how great it works!  I have a layered, razor cut that flips out and, before, was using three other products (pomade-for shine, manipulator-for flip, and aquage paste-for volume).  I just received Dirt last week, and after putting on just a bit, got the look that I was wanting, without all the hassle of three different products.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but well worth it (considering you only have to use a little, you&#x27;re sure to save $$$).  and the smell, ::sigh:: is so great!  (Even if it hadn&#x27;t worked as great as it does, I think I would still purchase it just for the delicious scent)  :)  I love that I can run my fingers through my hair and it&#x27;s soft and manageable, even at the end of the day, and without the sticky \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; feel.  I definitely plan on purchasing other Jonathan Products!</li>
            <li> I was anxiously hoping to try this product.  I&#x27;m a fan of the show and it seemed like Jonathan was really pushing for a good product.  After all, he IS hair.  I was really disappointed because it made my head feel it was dipped in vaseline, and it left big grease spots on my pillows.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my fine limp hair.  I can dry my hair and put a \\&quot;dab\\&quot;( not even pea size as directed) on mostly just the ends of damp or dry hair crunch and go and have great body.  I use other Jonathan products and really like them all!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I used to buy new gels, pommades, pastes, etc. every month because I could never find one that worked exactly how I wanted it to.  But I first tried this a year ago and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used since.  And it lasts a long time, so don&#x27;t be afraid of the price.  One container lasts me about 6 months, so you only have to buy it twice a year.  I&#x27;ll be ordering my third order of it soon.</li>
            <li> I love Jonathan Dirt. It lets me style my hair and forget about it. Other products that you get from the store make your hair crunchy and stiff. This keeps it in place without it being stiff. I&#x27;ve used it for over the past year. First ordered from QVC until they quit carrying it then started getting it from Sephora directly and now Sephora through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. It smells awesome and makes my hair look even better. My hair is long straight and fine. Definitely worth trying out and for all of those negative people who say it isn&#x27;t worth the money, perhaps you should have tried it in Sephora first before you spent your \\&quot;hard earned\\&quot; money. I tried it first then bought it on the spot! Go get it!</li>
            <li> This product could not be found anywhere in Southern California.. not even @ Jonathan Salon.  I bought this for my girlfriend online and once we got it she put some on.. she absolutely loves it!!  Great Product.. don&#x27;t believe those other reviews.. A++</li>
            <li> What a let down with this product... All it does is weight my hair down and make it sticky. I use to love Jonathan, but now I am soooo disapointed in his products.. EVERYONE save your money!! It is not worth it!!</li>
            <li> I am not a reality follower.  I saw someone at the mall with great hair, so I asked her what she used on it .  She told me the name and where to order it. It is simply wonderful!  I love the almond scent as well. You have to use just a little or it can become heavy.  I rub it between my hands and fingers swoosh my hands through my hair in an upward position. It gives my curly shoulder length hair so much body.....springy! I&#x27;ve tried many products....this is the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> When Jonathan first spoke of creating \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot; I thought my prayers had been answered, yet I was doubtfull. My completely unmanageable hair behaved better the day after washing but ended up greasy and smelled dirty. Dirt really is the best product for unmanageable hair. If used correctly and in moderation, it is very lightweight non-greasy. The day I used it, people constantly complimenting my hair. I have already recommended it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product, as does my sister and mother. BUT... BUT &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my mother used to be a hairdresser so she kind of emphasized DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH !! Thats the deal, if you use too much it looks greasy and dirty. If you use just enough it will work like a charm. I mean my hair is usually pretty dry and my sisters gets greasy looking after a day and both of us love this stuff, so I think that shows how versatile it is. You just have to figure out how much to use for **** YOUR HAIR ****. Start off with less and add more. HAPPY STYLING !!</li>
            <li> This works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry. I have long hair and I love using this product. It works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I just had my fine, processed hair cut into a short layered wedge.  It was shoulder length before and I used a Revlon thermal-air styler to make it acceptable.  After using Dirt, I no longer have to spend ANY time styling it!!  I just blow dry, scrunching my hair with my fingers and when almost dry, I turn my head upside-down and apply about a dime size amount of Dirt into the roots. Flip up and I&#x27;m ready to go all in less than 3 minutes.  I find it important to rub Dirt between my palms to warm it up before applying.  Use a little first...you can always add more. It gave my hair great body and control. Hope this product works for you too!</li>
            <li> This was the first product I bought from his line. It does give my hair some volume, I have medium length, thin, straight hair with some natural wave in the back.  You only have to use a little bit of product and make sure you rub it in your hands before you apply it to your hair.  I have not lost any hair using this product either and wonder how that could even happen.  I do however like his volumizing foam better for volume. This product was not the hit I thought it was going to be but it works ok but I do not think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t figure out why the others have rated this product sooo incredibly low... perhaps a hair product involves too many subjective considerations... What ever the case, I loved the product and I suggest people try it... I have never found a hair product that felt and smelled as great as this one does... it makes your hair just rough enough to give it an edge... also... it isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, so it doesn&#x27;t leave an annoying feeling in your hands as you adjust it during the day.... just try it...</li>
            <li> I have huge curly Jew-fro hair, and this is the only product I have found that can really tame it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  As an old product used to use the slogan \\&quot;a little dab&#x27;l do ya\\&quot;, it is true with this product.  Don&#x27;t over do it or you&#x27;ll have a greasy mess.  Start with a little and add more if you need to.  Always melt by rubbing hands together first.  Smells great too!  My only beef is the price.  Most of us aren&#x27;t used to paying those Rodeo Drive prices, Jonathan.  $26 may not be a lot to you, but....  :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is a great product. As a former stylist I can say without a doubt that this is the cream of the crop! I really do not understand all the negative reviews? As with anything having the product is one thing but knowing your hair and how to use this product is quite another. My fiance has bone straight hair and he watchees the show with me. He kind of liked the way Jonathan styled his hair so I decided to grab this product. After using this product on him the bone straight hair is easily managable and it looks great. No greasy, flaky, or helmet head type of look! AFter showing him how to apply the product and what he must do to get &#x27;the look&#x27; he is able to manage his hair easily enough! Great product....not just for women either!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is useless. It simply weighs your hair down and makes it greasy, plus it provides NO hold. Jonathon has got some nerve charging 26 bucks!! I got ripped off! Try Rusk Wired if you are looking for a great styling cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, with a well receded hair line I still tried to get what&#x27;s left to be manageable and look good - everything else I&#x27;ve used left my hair dry, flaked off or didn&#x27;t hold.  Jonathan Dirt has solved this long-term issue for me in just the first few days of use.  Dirt provides the manageability, hold and look I&#x27;ve strived for and even smells great with its almond scent.  I recommend this without reservation.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Work Dirt through just the ends, unless you want a very dirty look. It&#x27;s stiffer than hair wax so you can maintain soft spikes or a clumpier look than with hair wax. BTW, Dirt doesn&#x27;t hold stiff spikes. If you have fine hair and just want a little soft texture, hair wax might work better for you. I like Brit Style hair wax for that purpose (as with Dirt, put a small amount on the ends).</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair limp and greasy - even if I only use a little dab.  I will never buy it again!</li>
            <li> I was so completely disapointed in this product!  They did a great job at promotion, which I bought into.  Totally overpriced and just weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i wanted some texture/volume and that great hair you get the day after you get it cut. I found it too sticky and thick and hard to work with. Granted, i am not the best with styling my hair so for someone like me this did not work out.  Also, i thought the smell was just ok. So far, the best product I have found to give some volume and texture to my straight hair is by Tigi and its called Bed Head (its a spray wax). It really works without making your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> it works!!! &lt;br /&gt;i actually didnt buy the item from amazon, i saw it at costco today and was excited that they would have it. &lt;br /&gt;it was MUCH cheaper there. &lt;br /&gt;$10. i couldnt believe it! &lt;br /&gt;its 3.35 oz same amount i think. &lt;br /&gt;it make my hair really light and and soft.  &lt;br /&gt;and can practically feel each strand shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product from a friend who did not enjoy it.  But having short hair and looking for a none gel that would allow me to mold and sculpt my hair this product was right up my ally.  It leaves my hair frizz free and mold able to do what I please with it, but about half way through the day it seems to \\&quot;absorb\\&quot; into my hair or something, b/c the hold goes away a little.  But it does leave my hair softer and shiny which I enjoy.    One negative I also noticed is it leaves glitter in your hand after you apply it and sometimes after you wash your hands. It also smells great, like desert!  Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I like Dirt Texturizing Paste so much that when I&#x27;m using one jar, I always have another, unopened one ready when the first jar runs out. This product lasts a LONG time, though, so it&#x27;s a very frugal buy. The scent is a light vanilla-almond when you first put it in and the scent dissipates after a while so unless someone gets REALLY close to you, no one will detect it. I use very little of it which, I think, is the mark of a good product. I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair, wavy (if I let it dry by itself), thick, and VERY uncooperative. Whether I let it be natural, curl it more, or straighten it, I use Dirt to tame it down. Just a little rubbed on my fingers and then \\&quot;pinched\\&quot; lightly throughout my (layered) hair, and my hair looks just the way I want it to look. Flyaways and unruly hair problems are solved right away. If I can trust the online info, it also does not contain animal products and is not tested on animals. I hope that&#x27;s true. I recommend it highly, and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what everyone is complaining about. This is the best texturizing paste I have ever used. I only wish it was a little cheaper. Great smell and great feel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the TV Show Blowout, the purpose of promoting the product line in front of a mass audience.  This was a waste of money, the product was no way better than any other less expensive professional product lines such as Redken, or TIGI or any other line in the same category.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this overpriced product, you get the same or even better results with less expensive products. It does have a nice smell, but other the products smell nice too.  They overpriced this stuff because they feel the TV show allows them too, and don&#x27;t fall into that trap \\&quot;if they use it on TV, it must be good\\&quot;...it won&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> I dare Jonathan to cut and style my hair. I don&#x27;t think he could do it. It tends to be dry, it&#x27;s thick, course, and naturally curly. No stylist could ever tame it. But dirt helps. I first tried it on dry hair, very frizz-prone hair, and it was a disaster.  There&#x27;s no hair on my head that curls the same as one next to it, so it was bad, bad, bad. Then, I tried it with wet hair. After leave-in conditioner, I rub some dirt into my palms and pull my palms (not fingers) through my hair, kind of like I&#x27;m flat ironing with my palms.  Shake it out a little (the less you touch your, the less frizzy it will be) and dry naturally.  My hair curls, but some hairs stick together giving it that I-don&#x27;t-do-anything-to-my-hair-it-just-looks-this-way look.  Beats frizz, too.  Just don&#x27;t get too close to the roots with product.</li>
            <li> In an effort to perfect the \\&quot;purposefully messy\\&quot; look, I&#x27;ve spent the last several years trying just about every texturizing product available. Not a single one of them comes close to offering the functionality and results that Dirt offers.     At first, I was skeptical because the product is very thick and doesn&#x27;t emulsify easily in my hands. All doubt were laid to rest, though, when, in a hurry, I worked it through damp (towel-dried) hair, ran out the door, and discovered later in the day that my hair looked its best in years -- just as if it had been professionally styled!     This product achieves incredible texture and separation -- the hairs seem to automatically cluster together in ideal-sized pieces, which then seem to automatically splay out in a very natural-looking way. Your hair WON&#x27;T look overly done-up, like you spent 45 minutes working on it. Best yet: this stuff rinses out almost completely with plain water (no shampoo). And it leaves your hair feeling conditioned and healthy. I just can&#x27;t imagine a product better suited to this application.    One suggestion: if you like your hair shiny, I&#x27;d recommend layering a coat of shine spray (such as Bed Head Headrush) on after you&#x27;ve styled with Dirt.    To provide some context, here are some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried, arranged approximately in descending order of my satisfaction with them:    1. Aveda Control Paste (Pros: Smells luscious, washes out OK. Cons: Hair feels sticky. Style doesn&#x27;t last through the day.)  2. Davines Wonder Wax (Pros: Smells good, offers incredible shine, strong hold. Cons: Extremely thick. Requires 3-4 washings to remove.)  3. D:Fi D:Struct Pliable Molding Creme (Pros: Flexible hold, rinses out of hair easily. Cons: Nauseating pina colada fragrance.)  4. Bed Head Hard To Get Texturizing Paste (Pros: Strong hold. Cons: Very thick and sticky. Leaves spots on car headrests, etc.)  5. Bed Head Manipulator (Similar to #4.)  6. Bumble &amp; Bumble Styling Wax (Pros: Nice smell, rinses out of hair easily. Cons: Very expensive, ineffective hold, sticky texture, leaves hair feeling damaged after wash-out.)  7. American Crew Classic Wax (Pros: Inexpensive, easy to find. Cons: Very oily.)  8. American Crew Fiber (Pros: Inexpensive, easy to find. Cons: Hold is too stiff. Good for outrageous styling, but not for subtler styles.)  9. Cristophe Beverly Hills Texturizing Fiber Paste (Pros: Inexpensive, sold at CVS. Cons: Despicable texture. Hard to control. Smells bad.)</li>
            <li> I bought Dirt and the voluming foam last night at Sephora.  I tired Dirt this morning and LOVED it.  I used a smudge and it really did give my stick straight, fine hair some body and movement.  I was skeptical but it really did work.  Even my husband, who was making fun of me for buying it, liked it.  It also smells GREAT!  I can&#x27;t wait to try the volumizing foam on my wet hair and then the Dirt to texture it up! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(It looks like someone has a personal vendetta against Jonathan or his product line!  The negative comments all in a row for all his products look suspicously fake!)</li>
            <li> I bought it inspite of my hate for the ego maniac and was dissapointed. I&#x27;ll go back to my old product.</li>
            <li> i am absolutely in love with product. my hair is growing out from an extremely short hair cut. when it got about to my shoulders i couldnt use my old pastes and polmades any more because they weighed down my hair.. and i&#x27;m a NEED volume kind of girl. this stuff is amazing. it works with my longer hair to keep it textured, keeps it from frizzing, and helps me keep the straight peicey look and with an upside down appliation helps give my hair a healthy boost with out falling flat in 15 minutes like the other stuff on the market!!!! this is a must have for any woman!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My mother is a hair dresser so I have tried every product there is, and this one is my favorite.  If you use it properly then it&#x27;s amazing.  It&#x27;s a texturizing paste, not super glue, you can&#x27;t expect amazing hold out of it.  And because it is a PASTE, it&#x27;s extremely thick so you only need a tiny amount.  I have short, thin, wavy hair that I flat iron, and I just rub my fingers along the top of the paste to just get a thin layer on the tips of my fingers and apply it to my roots, it works amazing for volume, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it weighing my hair down or looking greasy! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles from this product.  It does exactly what it claims to do!  Plus, it smells amazing!  Oh, and also...I am NOT in love with Jonathan nor his TV show, I bought this product before I had even heard of him or his TV show...I honestly find him a little annoying, but this product definitely isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought dirt on a reccomendation from a friend, and this stuff is great.  I&#x27;m a dude with short hair and I wanted something that would give me good hold and texture with low to medium shine, and Dirt did it.  Smells great, too.  I can do pretty much anything to my hair with this stuff.  Expensive, but more than worth it since it lasts forever because you don&#x27;t need to use that much to get the style you&#x27;ll want.  This and B&amp;B Sumotech are the only two products I will use, and I highly reccomend both.</li>
