            <li>This works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Perfect!  </li>
            <li>But really great!</li>
            <li>I searched for a medium sized bag at a good price FOREVER!  </li>
            <li>Great bag for a good price!</li>
            <li>Great bag, really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get a great use out of it.</li>
            <li>The size is great, has lots of storage compartments, and also doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.</li>
            <li>is great.  </li>
            <li>Brush holder on top has ability to hold Mascera, lipgloss, conceiler(sp?) and brushes!!  </li>
            <li>so, it&#x27;s going to be perfect. :)</li>
            <li>It will suffice until I can find a really good case for my needs.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered in perfect condition and quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this bag!</li>
            <li>Recommended for sure!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;idea\\&quot; of this COSMETIC SOLUTIONS Bag is great, but the item is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I had to call customer service to get the address and make my own.</li>
            <li>So far, she&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Would be good for college students or people who travel with their makeup and do not need a light case.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this bag to be as large as it was, but it&#x27;s a really good size!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:) :)[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love the area for your brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is still usable, but could have been better manufactured.</li>
            <li>I just love this.</li>
            <li>Many that are not pictured.</li>
            <li>It has tons of compartments and holds everything and more.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It has so many compartments.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the pull out part and a part for brushes.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use the brush holders in it - I slip a dual pro-palette in the top section.  </li>
            <li>I returned it of course and found a better one.</li>
            <li>The outside is nice, it is a good size and can hold a good amount of brushes and makeup.</li>
            <li>Just got this one and so far, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>She wanted a train case style but not plastic as it cracks and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something easy and nonprofessional looking, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>I can fit all my makeup easily, and trust me...</li>
            <li>Overall happy with this bag.  </li>
            <li>It actually had more room than I thought which was even better!</li>
            <li>When I originally bought it, it was $48, now it is $36</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size, deep..</li>
            <li>and I will be posting a video to show exactly what I am talking about!  </li>
            <li>overall-i really like it and it will fit everything i need.</li>
            <li>For a nearly $40 item, I was expecting better quality.</li>
            <li>and I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, because I liked the different compartments.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $20 worth.</li>
            <li>love love love the hard case and fold out trays inside!</li>
            <li>Only thing that could make it better would be another fold out set of drawers on the right hand side.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Love all of the compartments and especially the brush holder part!  </li>
            <li>the pink trim is perfect with the black since I&#x27;m not that much of a girly girl.</li>
            <li>I will create a video review as well to show off a few of my FAVORITE features!  </li>
            <li>My only issue with it is that the boxes that fold out don&#x27;t pull out as far as I personally would have liked them to, since it makes getting items from the lower box harder in the way that they overlap, but other than that, it&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li>It shipped fast as well</li>
            <li>you need too much room for that.  </li>
            <li>The item was delivered relatively fast - placed an order on Wednesday night, got it delivered on Tuesday night.</li>
            <li>For roughly $40 i was expecting it to be better.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for my niece - she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really do like it</li>
            <li>I bought this travel bag because I like really compact and organized make up all the time.</li>
            <li>This is nice for caring smaller items and see what they are, or possibly NOT what they are depending on what you are carrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received mine two days early and it was exactly what the description said it would be.</li>
            <li>Before I use to have to put my make up in different bags to make sure that they didn&#x27;t come open and get all over the place, but this have compartments for everything.</li>
            <li>In the top part  where the makeup brushes are held there are  holes by the stitching with white material showing through, this is definitely a flaw.</li>
            <li>(so far!!)  </li>
            <li>And I love the little trays for misc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for the zippers and pockets, but they are hard to get to all the time.</li>
            <li>You can pack so much into this little case, and it keeps everything super organized!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s no small task.</li>
            <li>Only issue is that storage boxes seem to fold down more than they should when I close bag.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy - even though I do have a LOT of makeup.  </li>
            <li>Spend the extra few dollars on a better case.</li>
            <li>I purchased for airline travel and it was much too large and heavy for my needs.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is when traveling it will take too much space in your car and it is too big to carry.</li>
            <li>Great on the outside poor on the inside, not worth the price charged.</li>
            <li>The little accordion shelves are useful and even though they pop out a lil off-kilter, they work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used big train cases from Sephora, soft ones from Sonia Kashuk and this one</li>
            <li>The outside part of the bag was nice but the inside was very poorly made.</li>

            <li> It was so cheap and cheesy</li>
            <li> I was PLEASEANTLY surprsied when it showed up LARGER than expected and the quality &amp; zippers all working well</li>
            <li> Really spacious on the inside with lots of pockets for brushes and other small cosmetic items!</li>
            <li> It came crushed on one end which demonstrated how not sturdy it was.</li>
            <li> that way my brushes will not get crushed by my products and in case of any spills, I will not have to worry about the case.  </li>
            <li> It obviously has is a bit heavy when nothing is in it as it has compartments inside</li>
            <li> Item was not as expected...</li>
            <li> The metal piece on one side was bent making the trays not work correctly &amp; ware down the sides when I moved the tray in &amp; out, dry glue was everywhere.</li>
            <li> Not really sure why there are so many bad reviews</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you close the bag, the &amp;#34;Slide out shelf&amp;#34; gets pushed down and some of the products fall out.  </li>
            <li> Drawer hinges were bent, drawers tilt down and dump everything out.</li>
            <li> The shelves are covered in a glued on plastic black material.</li>
            <li> The black material is not glued on neatly and there are gaps.  </li>
            <li> Here are a few....</li>
            <li> and it is a durable build not cheap.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that I could keep my everyday make up in.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge issue since bag still closes</li>
            <li> I was willing to try another and hope that I just got the one bad bag.</li>
            <li> After SERCHING for about a week, I broke down and decided to choose the City Lights Microfiber Cosmetic Bag!!  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a small travel bag this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I had a small, hard case before and had to keep my brushes separate.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think it will break now with the hard shell case inside.</li>
            <li> I like that the walls are hard sided.  </li>
            <li> and I can hardly move the little box compartments as it is!!</li>
            <li> After processing the order I had read some reviews that were negative about the quality &amp; zippers sticking.  </li>
            <li> The shelves inside were not connected all the way, one of the zippers kept disconnecting and there was sawdust in the glue inside the (broken) shelves.</li>
            <li> poor quality material for the price that I paid.  </li>
            <li> I hate carrying this big thing around tho.</li>
            <li> I purchased this makeup case thinking I was getting a deal, but when I received it, it was broken.</li>
            <li> I was worried about all the bad reviews, but I do know how harsh everyone can be on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> It cheep and poorly made!!</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I feel bad about this purchase</li>
            <li> But the inside trays arrived dusty and just horrible looking.</li>
            <li> Returned immediately, very disappointed do not purchase it, you will regret it.</li>
            <li> I will be Returning this piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> This cosmetics bag is HORRIBLE!</li>

            <li> Great bag, really happy with this purchase. Holds all of my makeup and brushes well.</li>
            <li> After SERCHING for about a week, I broke down and decided to choose the City Lights Microfiber Cosmetic Bag!!  After processing the order I had read some reviews that were negative about the quality &amp; zippers sticking.  I was PLEASEANTLY surprsied when it showed up LARGER than expected and the quality &amp; zippers all working well (so far!!)  I will create a video review as well to show off a few of my FAVORITE features!  Here are a few....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Brush holder on top has ability to hold Mascera, lipgloss, conceiler(sp?) and brushes!!  This helps save room for some of my larger makeup items!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  There are atleast 4-6 zipper compartments around the case in different areas!  Some of these pockets are see thru and others are not!  This is nice for caring smaller items and see what they are, or possibly NOT what they are depending on what you are carrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps and I will be posting a video to show exactly what I am talking about!  But I would say at this point I am VERY IMPRESSED with this product!!! :) :) :)[[ASIN:B0035RDYJ4 City Lights Microfiber Cosmetic Bag]]</li>
            <li> For a nearly $40 item, I was expecting better quality. The shelves inside were not connected all the way, one of the zippers kept disconnecting and there was sawdust in the glue inside the (broken) shelves. You can&#x27;t even get a replacement - just a return. Too bad. I was willing to try another and hope that I just got the one bad bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves it! It actually had more room than I thought which was even better! It shipped fast as well</li>
            <li> This was perfect to put all my make up in for vacation. and it is a durable build not cheap.</li>
            <li> I searched for a medium sized bag at a good price FOREVER!  Just got this one and so far, it&#x27;s great.  I love the area for your brushes.  And I love the little trays for misc. items.  It&#x27;s deep enough and I have no problem with the zippers.  I had a small, hard case before and had to keep my brushes separate.  I also have one of those monsters cases that fold out -- you need too much room for that.  I wanted something that I could keep my everyday make up in.  This works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered relatively fast - placed an order on Wednesday night, got it delivered on Tuesday night. The \\&quot;idea\\&quot; of this COSMETIC SOLUTIONS Bag is great, but the item is cheaply made. For roughly $40 i was expecting it to be better. Zippers are a bit screwed up, as well as the eye-shadow drawers. It is still usable, but could have been better manufactured. I was contemplating on returning it.</li>
            <li> It came crushed on one end which demonstrated how not sturdy it was. I returned it</li>
            <li> The metal piece on one side was bent making the trays not work correctly &amp; ware down the sides when I moved the tray in &amp; out, dry glue was everywhere. The outside part of the bag was nice but the inside was very poorly made. When I originally bought it, it was $48, now it is $36 and I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. Returned immediately, very disappointed do not purchase it, you will regret it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, because I liked the different compartments. Before I use to have to put my make up in different bags to make sure that they didn&#x27;t come open and get all over the place, but this have compartments for everything. I just love this. I&#x27;ll get a great use out of it.</li>
            <li> i like how everything is organised in this case.  that way my brushes will not get crushed by my products and in case of any spills, I will not have to worry about the case.  thanks</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I needed.  Only thing that could make it better would be another fold out set of drawers on the right hand side.  But really great!</li>
            <li> Love this bag! I was worried about all the bad reviews, but I do know how harsh everyone can be on Amazon. This bag is just as described...I can fit all my makeup easily, and trust me...that&#x27;s no small task. It&#x27;s not too big though, still could be a carry on.  There are pockets everywhere on this thing. Many that are not pictured. Recommended for sure!</li>
            <li> Overall happy with this bag.  Lots of compartments to hold everything.  Only issue is that storage boxes seem to fold down more than they should when I close bag.  Not a huge issue since bag still closes but I can&#x27;t tell if this is supposed to happen or not.</li>
            <li> Not really sure why there are so many bad reviews if this item. I received mine two days early and it was exactly what the description said it would be. It is a big bag as the dimensions say they would be. It has tons of compartments and holds everything and more. If you are looking for a small travel bag this is not for you. It obviously has is a bit heavy when nothing is in it as it has compartments inside but it isn&#x27;t any heavier than it says. I love it and I do take it with me on my vacations and weekends away.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the size of this bag, but it will do the job to hold all my makeup...hehe It has so many compartments. The only downfall is when traveling it will take too much space in your car and it is too big to carry. My advise to others is think twice before ordering it.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my niece - she absolutely loves it. She&#x27;s been looking for a make-up bag for quite sometime. She wanted a train case style but not plastic as it cracks and breaks easily. So far, she&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet but, i checked it all out. I love that it has the pull out part and a part for brushes. It&#x27;s a good size, deep.. I have a trip coming up so, it&#x27;s going to be perfect. :)</li>
            <li> Drawer hinges were bent, drawers tilt down and dump everything out. The inside lining was pealing up zippers SUCK! Junk Junk Junk!!! I will be Returning this piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> This cosmetics bag is HORRIBLE! When it arrived and I opened the box my mouth dropped! It was so cheap and cheesy and it was coming apart! It didn&#x27;t even have a return label. I had to call customer service to get the address and make my own. I sent it back ASAP. I did however get a prompt refund including s &amp; h.</li>
            <li> I purchased for airline travel and it was much too large and heavy for my needs. Would be good for college students or people who travel with their makeup and do not need a light case. Product was delivered in perfect condition and quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this bag as a travel bag for my makeup. I have had a caboodles makeup case for several years it is well made and I love it. But the caboodles make up case is to big for me to travel with on short trips. So I looked for a smaller case. This  makeup case looks like it was thrown together. The outside is nice, it is a good size and can hold a good amount of brushes and makeup. But the inside trays arrived dusty and just horrible looking. The shelves are covered in a glued on plastic black material. The black material is not glued on neatly and there are gaps.  In the top part  where the makeup brushes are held there are  holes by the stitching with white material showing through, this is definitely a flaw. Great on the outside poor on the inside, not worth the price charged.</li>
            <li> Love all of the compartments and especially the brush holder part!  My only complaint is that when you close the bag, the &amp;#34;Slide out shelf&amp;#34; gets pushed down and some of the products fall out.  I can handle that, though.  Great bag for a good price!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this bag to be as large as it was, but it&#x27;s a really good size! Really spacious on the inside with lots of pockets for brushes and other small cosmetic items! My only issue with it is that the boxes that fold out don&#x27;t pull out as far as I personally would have liked them to, since it makes getting items from the lower box harder in the way that they overlap, but other than that, it&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li> i brought this for my make up I love it it holds all my make up its big and has alot of room</li>
            <li> Item was not as expected... poor quality material for the price that I paid.  I feel bad about this purchase</li>
            <li> The size is great, has lots of storage compartments, and also doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room. The shelves fall but they still keep your things in place. I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something easy and nonprofessional looking, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> It cheep and poorly made!! I&#x27;m returning it ASAP!! There is glue all over the the compartments and I can hardly move the little box compartments as it is!! Don&#x27;t buy it! Wast of time and money</li>
            <li> It is way bigger than what i thought it would be when i measured for the size to buy it. I really do like it tho. plenty of pockets. love love love the hard case and fold out trays inside! I drop my bag now and all my compacts break. i don&#x27;t think it will break now with the hard shell case inside. the pink trim is perfect with the black since I&#x27;m not that much of a girly girl. overall-i really like it and it will fit everything i need. I hate carrying this big thing around tho. I would like something smaller.</li>
            <li> I actually like this bag.  I have a brush roll that I keep in it so I don&#x27;t use the brush holders in it - I slip a dual pro-palette in the top section.  I like that the walls are hard sided.  It&#x27;s not heavy - even though I do have a LOT of makeup.  The little accordion shelves are useful and even though they pop out a lil off-kilter, they work and I don&#x27;t see any sort of problem with them.  I&#x27;ve used big train cases from Sephora, soft ones from Sonia Kashuk and this one is great.  I like that it&#x27;s micro-fiber; understated and doesn&#x27;t scream MAKE-UP!  No problems for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this travel bag because I like really compact and organized make up all the time. It&#x27;s nice for the zippers and pockets, but they are hard to get to all the time. The fold out tray broke the second I opened it. It will suffice until I can find a really good case for my needs. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money. It&#x27;s $20 worth.</li>
            <li> You can pack so much into this little case, and it keeps everything super organized!</li>
            <li> I purchased this makeup case thinking I was getting a deal, but when I received it, it was broken. The trays that pop out did not pop out properly and caused my makeup to fall out of it. I returned it of course and found a better one. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this piece of crap. Spend the extra few dollars on a better case.</li>
