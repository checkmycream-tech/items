            <li>LOVE THIS !</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>and I truly love it!</li>
            <li>Okay, I use it with finillite am and pm cream, all together I have seen amazing results!</li>
            <li>Would HIGHLY recommend to EVERYONE!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Its amazing</li>
            <li>I purchased this to use with my Body Scrub and cellulite cream and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>and if you have a good diet and drink lots of water is better for it to do the job.</li>
            <li>Love this products, it feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li>-otherwise I do not feel this penetrates the layers of skins effectively.     </li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it would be just another gadget that I would end up not using</li>
            <li>All efforts combined, I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is good for the body as well.</li>
            <li>and was thrilled when she gave me one for my birthday.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I have a noticeable difference in mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it would so nice and massaging to use.....</li>
            <li>It rolls nicely on my skin and it feels kind of warm afterwards.</li>
            <li>and I have been super impressed with the quality of the product and most important, the results!  </li>
            <li>only explanation for all the good reviews of this product is that maybe they were reviewed by the manufacturer&#x27;s wife, daughter, best friend etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are quick to respond to any questions and happy to help with anything that I needed!agine not having this Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>I am very confident in this product, it is truly excellent at improving circulation which really is key in the battle against cellulite</li>
            <li>I am having great results and my skin is looking so much nicer!</li>
            <li>I think cupping works better</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than massaging with my hands.</li>
            <li>This works to the appropriate degree.</li>
            <li>definetly works, use it two or more times a day for about 10-15 min</li>
            <li>I use this along with toning cream for a better outcome.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to massage in the Svelte PRO Supercharged Organic Anti-Cellulite Treatment with L&#x27;Carnitine, CoQ10 and 25 Fat Fighting Slimulators lotion and love the results.</li>
            <li>You do need to use this with a combination of diet and exercise, but it helps with the results when using the body scrub and the cellulite cream! :-)</li>
            <li>My cellulite (or fat deposits) seems to be concentrated mostly on the sides of my thighs and by using this with a combination of exercise and creams, I feel this massager has truly helped.</li>
            <li>I gave this three stars, because I love it for a massager, but can&#x27;t tell any difference with cellulite.</li>
            <li>I think help with cellulite comes by changing your diet, and there is no miraculous magic to do it for you.</li>
            <li>Typically more if I&#x27;m sore after working out, helps my muscles recover faster.</li>
            <li>You just slip it on your hand and the strap of the back of it holds it there perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things and this masager</li>
            <li>and I just love having massages.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>so I am preventively using this massager on the areas that I most want them like my thighs and my backside.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great addition to anyone who wants to take care of their skin and body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li>I use it on the top of my legs and it feels as if it is helping also with circulation.</li>
            <li>and as it is waterproof it is safe to do so.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this in the shower with the &amp;#34;L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This was an interesting buy.</li>
            <li>but it was not horrible.</li>
            <li>but it was a more deeper tissue massager</li>
            <li>, i am sure, it works on cellulite too.</li>
            <li>Love this easy to use product.  </li>
            <li>If you do forget to dry/wipe it off after use, just use a paper towel or magic eraser and any rusty-looking spots come off easily</li>
            <li>It feels like it provides very good deep massage.</li>
            <li>but this could be a bit more comfortable with its roller ball design and the hand strap adjustable and a bit</li>
            <li>Good construction and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and i already am seeing POSITIVE RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li>It is great and very convenient to use - fits perfectly in the hand and delivers enough force without too much effort.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the rollers glide and massage with ease.</li>
            <li>I do bruise easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flexible and easily glides along the areas of your body to help reduce cellulite.  </li>
            <li>It is waterproof, easy to hold (non slip) and fits into your hand so you can hold it easily.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I am giving this product a chance because the long term results will be great.  </li>
            <li>Noticed huge difference in the appearance of my cellulite.  </li>
            <li>It does make your cellulite appear more smooth, at least temporarily, so it&#x27;s perfect when you need to show off those legs!  </li>
            <li>but I have seen fabulous results.</li>
            <li>Well....the Phat QR Massager works FANTASTIC, it helped me reduce the apperance of my cellulite, I use it every time.  </li>
            <li>The Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager works great to loosen up my muscles and relieve a lot of my back pain.  </li>
            <li>overall, im happy with it.</li>
            <li>Not just good for breaking up fatty tissue in the legs, really good for increasing the circulation in the legs.</li>
            <li>Usually I use in the shower and it worked perfect, it is as good as new.</li>
            <li>I have found it very useful for reducing muscle sourness.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this unique contraption, I decided to give it a try and see how well it works.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>i have to agree with one of the reviews saying that the metal balls deteriorated(it works ok at first)</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant change in the amount and appearance of my cellulite with these three products used together.</li>
            <li>as an avid tennis player, i get sore muscles more often than i would like to.</li>
            <li>So far I am really impressed, my thighs are starting to look smoother!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>This product is small and would make the perfect gift for anyone interested smoothing out their look!</li>
            <li>Cool massager.</li>
            <li>This is good for sore muscles especially after workouts.</li>
            <li>This is a cool massager.</li>
            <li>Cool, cool, cool product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel good, is easy to use, and makes my skin just look nice overall.</li>
            <li>This simple tool is an easy to use, effective aide to breaking up the cellulite.  </li>
            <li>However, once I figured it out.....I can&#x27;t imagine not having this Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, They shipped quickly and the company is very customer friendly!</li>
            <li>, They shipped quickly and the company is very customer friendly!</li>
            <li>Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly for solving cellulite problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a massager with rolling balls, nothing extraordinary...</li>
            <li>Luckily I don&#x27;t have issues with cellulite</li>
            <li>i often use it in a bath tub with salts and bubbles and it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>nice massager i used it everyday and relieve all my stress pretty nice product specially when you need a massage</li>
            <li>Then when I got used it (after using it a couple times), I noticed that the feeling actually started to feel pretty good.</li>
            <li>What a great little body and cellulite massager.  </li>
            <li>I also make my husband use it on my back and it feels amazing</li>
            <li>and I thought it was broke after a week after the purchase, but after using another few days, it worked like it used too, so I am happy with the product now.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin this will be better as it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks</li>
            <li>I was contacted by Sweetsation Therapy and asked if I would help to provide honest reviews for some of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I explained that I was currently trying to get rid of some stubborn cellulite on my outer thighs</li>
            <li>Really worth buying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also just really nice as a simple body massager.</li>
            <li>As far as the product goes it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>it seems worth the effort.</li>
            <li>and I really feel like it is a pampering tool for anyone who wants to feel like they are making the most of reducing cellulite.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li>I have been so impressed with the results so much that I even ordered a couple extra massagers as back up just in case the first one ever breaks.</li>
            <li>&amp; I do see improvement right after use</li>
            <li>Are you going to eat right?</li>
            <li>Just make sure you aren&#x27;t too vigorous with it on places that may bruise easily because I can definitely see that happening if too much pressure is applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is cool to the touch and really feels that it can help with tight muscles or when you just need a good massage.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I will be getting some for early XMAS gifts this year.</li>
            <li>and I use it everyday along with my NuElle  cellulite lotion, and I have seeing incredible results so far.</li>
            <li>I love the way it works and is shaped for easy manipulation up and down or side to side as the balls move over your legs or tummy.</li>
            <li>(the metal massage balls are super easy to pop out and put back in).</li>
            <li>Like most women for me cellulite is a constant on going battle</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this in the shower, but am pleased with it&#x27;s overall performance.</li>
            <li>Today is the first day of use.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it HIGHLY!!  </li>
            <li>I apply the cream first, let it soak in, and then I use the massager to increase my circulation in that area.  </li>
            <li>Feeling better overall.</li>
            <li>I have the whole Phat QR Solutions Anti Cellulite Collection!</li>
            <li>so much!</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it is waterproof since I got in a habit to use it in a hot bath with salt and minerals.</li>
            <li>This little massager is so much more effective than any lotion because it actually does help your circulation</li>
            <li>so if you use it in shower make sure you take it out and dry it even if its in there a couple of hours the balls do rust..</li>
            <li>, I can only put this down to ease of use, and the great massaging sensation this product gives.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other cellulite massagers in the past and can honestly say this product is in a league of its own.</li>
            <li>Being plastic and stainless steel this can be used in water without having to worry about it rusting.  </li>
            <li>and it really gets the circulation going.  </li>
            <li>I didnt massage thighs with much pressure at all, yet</li>
            <li>On a side note: I recieved this package in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>The whole intended purpose of the massager, in my opinion, would be to rub in lotion or oil.</li>
            <li>im real motivated to keep going with my program!The massager</li>
            <li>and I saw such a fantastic improvement.</li>
            <li>I have battled cellulite my whole life &amp; will try any product that claims to improve.</li>
            <li>Very compact I can take it with me anywhere.</li>
            <li>once you get the hang of it, and it really makes the lotion penetrate deeper.</li>
            <li>It has really reduced the appearance of the cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>and I can see some much improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It really does help to stimulate tissues and get that blood going.</li>
            <li>This massager is great for aching and tired muscles.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>and you can massage any sore muscles that really need it as well.</li>
            <li>what I meant by that is that I used too much pressure and didn&#x27;t know how to use it and wasn&#x27;t used to it.</li>
            <li>I have also been using the &amp;#34;NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate&amp;#34; and the combination of the three products is a home run!!!</li>
            <li>so I was excited at the prospect of trying these products out and actually getting results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof so that I can take it in the shower with me and not have to worry about it getting messed up like other massagers like this.</li>
            <li>I guess I am lucky to not have much of cellulite, at least nothing much that would nag at me, but I am sure it helps this problem too.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it alone would work but its nice for the price</li>
            <li>Especially since the view from behind is getting better and better thanks to these two products!  </li>
            <li>I sleep better and wake up less sore too.</li>
            <li>The massager has 7 deep set stainless steel ball bearings, upon initial inspection I was slightly concerned that if I applied too much pressure when using the massager then the motion of the ball bearings rolling would cause it to pinch my skin, fortunately this is not the case at all and the ball bearings really do aid in easy movement of the massager over the skin no matter how much pressure is being applied at the time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the cellulite massager</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will continue to use this massager for a very long time, and really cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li>I have is that the strap that goes around your hand could have been designed a little better.</li>
            <li>From looking at it, it doesn&#x27;t seem that it would do very much -- but those 7 little steel balls really do their job provided the pressure you apply is adequate.  </li>
            <li>i always use a cloth wipe it clean after using it, and keep it in a dry place.</li>
            <li>Great quality product and not to expensive.</li>
            <li>You wont waste your money, I love it and would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I started my Anti-cellulite Program a month ago, I purchased the Phat QR Massager and with an Anti-cellulite Fat Burner by Eveline Cosmetics, along with a workout 3-4 days a week,lots of fresh juices and a low calorie diet.</li>
            <li>Probably will buy a few more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>As a pro tennis player, it&#x27;s a must for me after a good game.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a deep tissue massage or something a little more gentle, this product is capable of providing both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would return it if I could, the problem is that I live abroad.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>but I love it, my husband can hear me using it because the balls make a little noise and he runs in the room &amp;#34;Do my back&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>First of all, I have tried several products from Skin QR</li>
            <li>The improvement wasn&#x27;t immediate, but as the weeks have past my legs are beginning feel and look much better.</li>
            <li>It was different than I thought it would be the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that this would make any difference in the looks of my legs, and I am not sure still if it does or not, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Another tip I have-try to use  on bare skin or in tight fitting clothes</li>
            <li>I can hold this securely, but if you have larger hands then may not fit as the strap doesn&#x27;t really adjust and is really just one size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to handle and you can mindlessly massage while watching tv or whatever.  </li>
            <li>Many of the cellulite lumps and bumps on my legs have become remarkably less noticeable and some areas they have already disappeared entirely.</li>
            <li>5just days of used i noticed my cellulite getting a lot better, it&#x27;s not to hard to the skin</li>
            <li>Once you start using this massager its quite clear that a lot of thought has gone into the design.</li>
            <li>I was not initially convinced this product would work very well, however using it has completely converted me.</li>
            <li>I get a free but and thigh massage, and my husband gets to enjoy the view from behind!  </li>
            <li>It clearly improves circulation.</li>
            <li>and they recommended this product along with the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate and the L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub.</li>
            <li>, the design with the ball bearings really helps prevent this which ultimately means you can use it for longer.</li>
            <li>have been trying to use the massager every evening after applying NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate to my thighs, aiming for around 15-20 minutes per session.</li>
            <li>I bought this for use with the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate cream.  </li>
            <li>I would advise taking a lighter hand at applying the pressure when starting -- I believe too much pressure would hurt or make you bruise.  </li>
            <li>hours later Im very sore.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the NeElle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite concentrate and my husband</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll comment on what I do like so far.  </li>
            <li>When I take the time to use this, I really notice a difference in the way my skin looks and feels (especially after continued use).</li>
            <li>I have been using this massager for nearly two months now</li>
            <li>Which probably won&#x27;t be for a long time since the products seems pretty well made to me.</li>
            <li>but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with the products from Argania LLC.  </li>
            <li>So I called the company and they told me that those reviews are old and now this massager comes waterproof.</li>
            <li>BUT it is never too early to take care of your skin</li>
            <li>but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I started with just the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate</li>
            <li>I thought it would just be soft and roll over my skin</li>
            <li>It feels like my tissues are alive.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra ten minutes or so in the shower to feel like your skin is renewed.</li>
            <li>This little thing gets right into the neck/shoulders areas really well.</li>
            <li>but im a very patient person if you want results quickly and are just using this item with a excessive amount of cellulite I would hafta say this item is not for you</li>
            <li>Overall decent product.</li>
            <li>but it takes more than just using this item especially if you have a excessive amount like me..</li>
            <li>The flexible base really helps the massager follow the contours of your body which allows for a much deeper more effective massage compared to other products which have a solid base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The balls spin effortlessly and the little hand grip and bendable plastic holder makes it easy to do shoulders, legs, butt etc and feels like it&#x27;s actually making a difference.</li>
            <li>so I had to pay quite high delivery fees, which made the overall price of the product to high for what it actually is.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend giving them a try, especially if you have stubborn cellulite that is making you self-conscious!</li>
            <li>I have to say that I have tried several massagers on the market, and this is the only one that really showed results.</li>
            <li>I get sore muscles often due to being an avid runner.</li>
            <li>I like this rolly glove for massaging my body in general.</li>
            <li>The hand strap fits my hand but just barely.  </li>
            <li>As far as results go, there has been definite improvement, the skin does appear smoother than before, but it is yet to have an effect on some of the deepest dimples.</li>
            <li>I do about 30 minutes of massage every day and use the massager in combination with the natural scrub from the same brand ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I actually use it with the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say whether it holds up after a decent amount of use</li>
            <li>For when I need a deeper, harder massage to ease my back spasms, then this does work but it does feel a bit rougher than other hand massaging products I have, so you do have to be a bit more careful on the skin.  </li>
            <li>when I first tried it, I was a little worried.</li>
            <li>i bought this knowing not to expect a miracle, or actually even a slight difference, but within a week i noticed an improvement, haven&#x27;t seen much since, though.  </li>

            <li> Would HIGHLY recommend to EVERYONE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its amazing</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with my Body Scrub and cellulite cream and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> and if you have a good diet and drink lots of water is better for it to do the job.</li>
            <li> Love this products, it feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li> -otherwise I do not feel this penetrates the layers of skins effectively.     </li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it would be just another gadget that I would end up not using</li>
            <li> All efforts combined, I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is good for the body as well.</li>
            <li> and was thrilled when she gave me one for my birthday.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I have a noticeable difference in mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it would so nice and massaging to use.....</li>
            <li> It rolls nicely on my skin and it feels kind of warm afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I have been super impressed with the quality of the product and most important, the results!  </li>
            <li> only explanation for all the good reviews of this product is that maybe they were reviewed by the manufacturer&#x27;s wife, daughter, best friend etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are quick to respond to any questions and happy to help with anything that I needed!agine not having this Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> I am very confident in this product, it is truly excellent at improving circulation which really is key in the battle against cellulite</li>
            <li> I am having great results and my skin is looking so much nicer!</li>
            <li> I think cupping works better</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than massaging with my hands.</li>
            <li> This works to the appropriate degree.</li>
            <li> definetly works, use it two or more times a day for about 10-15 min</li>
            <li> I use this along with toning cream for a better outcome.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to massage in the Svelte PRO Supercharged Organic Anti-Cellulite Treatment with L&#x27;Carnitine, CoQ10 and 25 Fat Fighting Slimulators lotion and love the results.</li>
            <li> You do need to use this with a combination of diet and exercise, but it helps with the results when using the body scrub and the cellulite cream! :-)</li>
            <li> My cellulite (or fat deposits) seems to be concentrated mostly on the sides of my thighs and by using this with a combination of exercise and creams, I feel this massager has truly helped.</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars, because I love it for a massager, but can&#x27;t tell any difference with cellulite.</li>
            <li> I think help with cellulite comes by changing your diet, and there is no miraculous magic to do it for you.</li>
            <li> Typically more if I&#x27;m sore after working out, helps my muscles recover faster.</li>
            <li> You just slip it on your hand and the strap of the back of it holds it there perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things and this masager</li>
            <li> and I just love having massages.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> so I am preventively using this massager on the areas that I most want them like my thighs and my backside.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great addition to anyone who wants to take care of their skin and body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I use it on the top of my legs and it feels as if it is helping also with circulation.</li>
            <li> and as it is waterproof it is safe to do so.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this in the shower with the &amp;#34;L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This was an interesting buy.</li>
            <li> but it was not horrible.</li>
            <li> but it was a more deeper tissue massager</li>
            <li> , i am sure, it works on cellulite too.</li>
            <li> Love this easy to use product.  </li>
            <li> If you do forget to dry/wipe it off after use, just use a paper towel or magic eraser and any rusty-looking spots come off easily</li>
            <li> It feels like it provides very good deep massage.</li>
            <li> but this could be a bit more comfortable with its roller ball design and the hand strap adjustable and a bit</li>
            <li> Good construction and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and i already am seeing POSITIVE RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li> It is great and very convenient to use - fits perfectly in the hand and delivers enough force without too much effort.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the rollers glide and massage with ease.</li>
            <li> I do bruise easy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flexible and easily glides along the areas of your body to help reduce cellulite.  </li>
            <li> It is waterproof, easy to hold (non slip) and fits into your hand so you can hold it easily.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I am giving this product a chance because the long term results will be great.  </li>
            <li> Noticed huge difference in the appearance of my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> It does make your cellulite appear more smooth, at least temporarily, so it&#x27;s perfect when you need to show off those legs!  </li>
            <li> but I have seen fabulous results.</li>
            <li> Well....the Phat QR Massager works FANTASTIC, it helped me reduce the apperance of my cellulite, I use it every time.  </li>
            <li> The Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager works great to loosen up my muscles and relieve a lot of my back pain.  </li>
            <li> overall, im happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not just good for breaking up fatty tissue in the legs, really good for increasing the circulation in the legs.</li>
            <li> Usually I use in the shower and it worked perfect, it is as good as new.</li>
            <li> I have found it very useful for reducing muscle sourness.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this unique contraption, I decided to give it a try and see how well it works.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> i have to agree with one of the reviews saying that the metal balls deteriorated(it works ok at first)</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant change in the amount and appearance of my cellulite with these three products used together.</li>
            <li> as an avid tennis player, i get sore muscles more often than i would like to.</li>
            <li> So far I am really impressed, my thighs are starting to look smoother!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> This product is small and would make the perfect gift for anyone interested smoothing out their look!</li>
            <li> Cool massager.</li>
            <li> This is good for sore muscles especially after workouts.</li>
            <li> This is a cool massager.</li>
            <li> Cool, cool, cool product.</li>
            <li> Not only does it feel good, is easy to use, and makes my skin just look nice overall.</li>
            <li> This simple tool is an easy to use, effective aide to breaking up the cellulite.  </li>
            <li> However, once I figured it out.....I can&#x27;t imagine not having this Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, They shipped quickly and the company is very customer friendly!</li>
            <li> , They shipped quickly and the company is very customer friendly!</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly for solving cellulite problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a massager with rolling balls, nothing extraordinary...</li>
            <li> Luckily I don&#x27;t have issues with cellulite</li>
            <li> i often use it in a bath tub with salts and bubbles and it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> nice massager i used it everyday and relieve all my stress pretty nice product specially when you need a massage</li>
            <li> Then when I got used it (after using it a couple times), I noticed that the feeling actually started to feel pretty good.</li>
            <li> What a great little body and cellulite massager.  </li>
            <li> I also make my husband use it on my back and it feels amazing</li>
            <li> and I thought it was broke after a week after the purchase, but after using another few days, it worked like it used too, so I am happy with the product now.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin this will be better as it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks</li>
            <li> I was contacted by Sweetsation Therapy and asked if I would help to provide honest reviews for some of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I explained that I was currently trying to get rid of some stubborn cellulite on my outer thighs</li>
            <li> Really worth buying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also just really nice as a simple body massager.</li>
            <li> As far as the product goes it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> it seems worth the effort.</li>
            <li> and I really feel like it is a pampering tool for anyone who wants to feel like they are making the most of reducing cellulite.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li> I have been so impressed with the results so much that I even ordered a couple extra massagers as back up just in case the first one ever breaks.</li>
            <li> &amp; I do see improvement right after use</li>
            <li> Are you going to eat right?</li>
            <li> Just make sure you aren&#x27;t too vigorous with it on places that may bruise easily because I can definitely see that happening if too much pressure is applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is cool to the touch and really feels that it can help with tight muscles or when you just need a good massage.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I will be getting some for early XMAS gifts this year.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday along with my NuElle  cellulite lotion, and I have seeing incredible results so far.</li>
            <li> I love the way it works and is shaped for easy manipulation up and down or side to side as the balls move over your legs or tummy.</li>
            <li> (the metal massage balls are super easy to pop out and put back in).</li>
            <li> Like most women for me cellulite is a constant on going battle</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this in the shower, but am pleased with it&#x27;s overall performance.</li>
            <li> Today is the first day of use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it HIGHLY!!  </li>
            <li> I apply the cream first, let it soak in, and then I use the massager to increase my circulation in that area.  </li>
            <li> Feeling better overall.</li>
            <li> I have the whole Phat QR Solutions Anti Cellulite Collection!</li>
            <li> so much!</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it is waterproof since I got in a habit to use it in a hot bath with salt and minerals.</li>
            <li> This little massager is so much more effective than any lotion because it actually does help your circulation</li>
            <li> so if you use it in shower make sure you take it out and dry it even if its in there a couple of hours the balls do rust..</li>
            <li> , I can only put this down to ease of use, and the great massaging sensation this product gives.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other cellulite massagers in the past and can honestly say this product is in a league of its own.</li>
            <li> Being plastic and stainless steel this can be used in water without having to worry about it rusting.  </li>
            <li> and it really gets the circulation going.  </li>
            <li> I didnt massage thighs with much pressure at all, yet</li>
            <li> On a side note: I recieved this package in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> The whole intended purpose of the massager, in my opinion, would be to rub in lotion or oil.</li>
            <li> im real motivated to keep going with my program!The massager</li>
            <li> and I saw such a fantastic improvement.</li>
            <li> I have battled cellulite my whole life &amp; will try any product that claims to improve.</li>
            <li> Very compact I can take it with me anywhere.</li>
            <li> once you get the hang of it, and it really makes the lotion penetrate deeper.</li>
            <li> It has really reduced the appearance of the cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> and I can see some much improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It really does help to stimulate tissues and get that blood going.</li>
            <li> This massager is great for aching and tired muscles.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> and you can massage any sore muscles that really need it as well.</li>
            <li> what I meant by that is that I used too much pressure and didn&#x27;t know how to use it and wasn&#x27;t used to it.</li>
            <li> I have also been using the &amp;#34;NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate&amp;#34; and the combination of the three products is a home run!!!</li>
            <li> so I was excited at the prospect of trying these products out and actually getting results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it is waterproof so that I can take it in the shower with me and not have to worry about it getting messed up like other massagers like this.</li>
            <li> I guess I am lucky to not have much of cellulite, at least nothing much that would nag at me, but I am sure it helps this problem too.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it alone would work but its nice for the price</li>
            <li> Especially since the view from behind is getting better and better thanks to these two products!  </li>
            <li> I sleep better and wake up less sore too.</li>
            <li> The massager has 7 deep set stainless steel ball bearings, upon initial inspection I was slightly concerned that if I applied too much pressure when using the massager then the motion of the ball bearings rolling would cause it to pinch my skin, fortunately this is not the case at all and the ball bearings really do aid in easy movement of the massager over the skin no matter how much pressure is being applied at the time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the cellulite massager</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will continue to use this massager for a very long time, and really cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I have is that the strap that goes around your hand could have been designed a little better.</li>
            <li> From looking at it, it doesn&#x27;t seem that it would do very much -- but those 7 little steel balls really do their job provided the pressure you apply is adequate.  </li>
            <li> i always use a cloth wipe it clean after using it, and keep it in a dry place.</li>
            <li> Great quality product and not to expensive.</li>
            <li> You wont waste your money, I love it and would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I started my Anti-cellulite Program a month ago, I purchased the Phat QR Massager and with an Anti-cellulite Fat Burner by Eveline Cosmetics, along with a workout 3-4 days a week,lots of fresh juices and a low calorie diet.</li>
            <li> Probably will buy a few more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> As a pro tennis player, it&#x27;s a must for me after a good game.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a deep tissue massage or something a little more gentle, this product is capable of providing both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would return it if I could, the problem is that I live abroad.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but I love it, my husband can hear me using it because the balls make a little noise and he runs in the room &amp;#34;Do my back&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> First of all, I have tried several products from Skin QR</li>
            <li> The improvement wasn&#x27;t immediate, but as the weeks have past my legs are beginning feel and look much better.</li>
            <li> It was different than I thought it would be the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this would make any difference in the looks of my legs, and I am not sure still if it does or not, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Another tip I have-try to use  on bare skin or in tight fitting clothes</li>
            <li> I can hold this securely, but if you have larger hands then may not fit as the strap doesn&#x27;t really adjust and is really just one size.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to handle and you can mindlessly massage while watching tv or whatever.  </li>
            <li> Many of the cellulite lumps and bumps on my legs have become remarkably less noticeable and some areas they have already disappeared entirely.</li>
            <li> 5just days of used i noticed my cellulite getting a lot better, it&#x27;s not to hard to the skin</li>
            <li> Once you start using this massager its quite clear that a lot of thought has gone into the design.</li>
            <li> I was not initially convinced this product would work very well, however using it has completely converted me.</li>
            <li> I get a free but and thigh massage, and my husband gets to enjoy the view from behind!  </li>
            <li> It clearly improves circulation.</li>
            <li> and they recommended this product along with the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate and the L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub.</li>
            <li> , the design with the ball bearings really helps prevent this which ultimately means you can use it for longer.</li>
            <li> have been trying to use the massager every evening after applying NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate to my thighs, aiming for around 15-20 minutes per session.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use with the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate cream.  </li>
            <li> I would advise taking a lighter hand at applying the pressure when starting -- I believe too much pressure would hurt or make you bruise.  </li>
            <li> hours later Im very sore.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the NeElle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite concentrate and my husband</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll comment on what I do like so far.  </li>
            <li> When I take the time to use this, I really notice a difference in the way my skin looks and feels (especially after continued use).</li>
            <li> I have been using this massager for nearly two months now</li>
            <li> Which probably won&#x27;t be for a long time since the products seems pretty well made to me.</li>
            <li> but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with the products from Argania LLC.  </li>
            <li> So I called the company and they told me that those reviews are old and now this massager comes waterproof.</li>
            <li> BUT it is never too early to take care of your skin</li>
            <li> but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I started with just the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate</li>
            <li> I thought it would just be soft and roll over my skin</li>
            <li> It feels like my tissues are alive.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra ten minutes or so in the shower to feel like your skin is renewed.</li>
            <li> This little thing gets right into the neck/shoulders areas really well.</li>
            <li> but im a very patient person if you want results quickly and are just using this item with a excessive amount of cellulite I would hafta say this item is not for you</li>
            <li> Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> but it takes more than just using this item especially if you have a excessive amount like me..</li>
            <li> The flexible base really helps the massager follow the contours of your body which allows for a much deeper more effective massage compared to other products which have a solid base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The balls spin effortlessly and the little hand grip and bendable plastic holder makes it easy to do shoulders, legs, butt etc and feels like it&#x27;s actually making a difference.</li>
            <li> so I had to pay quite high delivery fees, which made the overall price of the product to high for what it actually is.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend giving them a try, especially if you have stubborn cellulite that is making you self-conscious!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have tried several massagers on the market, and this is the only one that really showed results.</li>
            <li> I get sore muscles often due to being an avid runner.</li>
            <li> I like this rolly glove for massaging my body in general.</li>
            <li> The hand strap fits my hand but just barely.  </li>
            <li> As far as results go, there has been definite improvement, the skin does appear smoother than before, but it is yet to have an effect on some of the deepest dimples.</li>
            <li> I do about 30 minutes of massage every day and use the massager in combination with the natural scrub from the same brand ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I actually use it with the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say whether it holds up after a decent amount of use</li>
            <li> For when I need a deeper, harder massage to ease my back spasms, then this does work but it does feel a bit rougher than other hand massaging products I have, so you do have to be a bit more careful on the skin.  </li>
            <li> when I first tried it, I was a little worried.</li>
            <li> i bought this knowing not to expect a miracle, or actually even a slight difference, but within a week i noticed an improvement, haven&#x27;t seen much since, though.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m honestly not that consistent in using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to see results but since a lot of people claim they saw results</li>
            <li> The area is usually left very red after use, which is generally an indication there is increased blood circulation in that area, and does usually remain red for quite a while after use as well.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was only messaging one thigh with this device and noticed only a slight difference which could have been attributed to a number of things.</li>
            <li> As for the pain...I don&#x27;t know if I am tough or the others that complain are weak but it doesn&#x27;t really hurt unless you have super human strength.</li>
            <li> It does not take long to do</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said this, but is is not emphasized enough.</li>
            <li> But, let me ask you... who uses a massager on dry skin?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product religiously every night for the last few weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you really plan on doing this everyday.</li>
            <li> Being one who suffers from constant back problems with the muscles in my back and neck, I am always interested in trying different things to help, especially when my significant other suffers from WMFS (weak massaging finger symdrom ;-).  </li>
            <li> I was confused at first to see that it was waterproof and some reviews mentioned that it rusted.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to loose hope until I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Then a couple weeks down the road, my husband even mentioned that he was starting to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 7 stainless steel balls are set on flexible plastic base, again initially I had concerns about this as it came across fairly flimsy, but again after using the massager I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> Apparently there is a difference between cellulite and fat deposits, but they look the same, so it&#x27;s hard to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> It actually is working, after a week I am noticing a little bit of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I had incredibly deep bruises when I started using this and continue to get them when I am a little too rough</li>
            <li> Use this product gently because the beads/balls in the device are metal and can be heavy when pushed into the skin too hard.</li>
            <li> It says not to get the massager wet in the instructions.</li>
            <li> In order to wash the massager, you&#x27;re going to have to get it wet.</li>
            <li> This product is like a \\&quot;mini miracle\\&quot; to me considering all the money I have spent on cellulite and firming creams over the years that never seem to work.</li>
            <li> There are a few things in life that I believe are necessary to have</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving it wet in shower.</li>
            <li> I think this is in part due to the plastic holders on the balls that sit a little too low and can press against and pinch the skin instead of just the balls.  </li>
            <li> I used this product at night time in combination with  skin brushing http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JFZDQ/ref&#x3D;oh_o01_s00_i00_details and this other brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about this massager</li>
            <li> Well other than lipo.</li>
            <li> but I work and work out a lot and due to that Sore and aching muscles</li>
            <li> This has been a miracle for that because I can rub his back without having to put all the pressure that I usually do.</li>
            <li> It is perhaps because I see myself every day and small changes might be not so obvious, while they haven&#x27;t seen me for a while.</li>
            <li> While lotions can help firm up loose skin, they have a much harder time penetrating to break up fat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you have slight cellulite you want to reduce</li>
            <li> It does hurt when you roll over your &#x27;sites&#x27; but I haven&#x27;t gotten any bruising from it and the longer I use it the less it hurts.</li>
            <li> i use it now in conjuction with nivea&#x27;s anti-cellulite serum and again i&#x27;ve noticed less dimpling.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that the circulation problems I previously was experiencing on my legs seem to have improved.</li>
            <li> Havent had it for that long.. do beleive that with hard work you can get rid of cellulite</li>
            <li> This does make my skin seem softer and less tight which makes working out and building muscle a little easier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on other inferior products!</li>
            <li> I also like using this as a regular messaging for my muscles after a tough work out-</li>
            <li> I took off one star because 3 of the balls did not roll for few days</li>
            <li> This a waste of money a Hugh joke don&#x27;t work  and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference within just a few days.....</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd product I purchased from this company and so far none has disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I have had a few small bruises but nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> must admit I have found myself looking forward to using this each evening, which is a bit of a novelty as these things usually become a chore after a while</li>
            <li> I am not really sure about the effectiveness of this massager for cellulite , but I got this massager for massaging muscles after working out.</li>
            <li> I usually just use the massager on my legs for about 20 minutes a day without using oils or creams.</li>
            <li> Don&#x60;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> My hands are small and slip through the security band.</li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> I do hafta add to use this with lubricate or it drags on your skin and dont press too hard or it will bruise you and it rusts</li>
            <li> Moreover, It is hard to use.</li>
            <li> I can do it for myself or my spouse can massage those areas for me that are hard to reach.</li>
            <li> Or would you want to use the same dirty massager on yourself over and over?</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have in the past found that other massagers that don&#x27;t use ball bearings become very difficult to manoeuvre when trying to achieve a deeper massage which can result in a lot of arm ache</li>
            <li> I have always been a little skeptical when it comes to products for cellulite</li>
            <li> There is only one downfall and it&#x27;s nothing too bad because you can do what my husband does</li>
            <li> Earlier I said a stronger/more painful than I thought....</li>
            <li> and I use it when my neck, shoulder, arm and calve muscle gets tired.</li>
            <li> just flat out crap</li>
            <li> It had a little stronger/more painful feeling than I was expecting</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slide, it hurts the skin, is completely useless.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am sore when I get home from work and when I saw \\&quot;water proof\\</li>
            <li> This was uncomfortable to use and saw no results.</li>
            <li> Very poor design.</li>
            <li> The balls feel awful on your skin when you are rubbing it dry.</li>
            <li> Kinda awkward grip</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> so bad you can always rely on this product</li>
            <li> This was painful and didn&#x27;t work after bearing it for a week.</li>
            <li> disappointed..</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to describe how awful</li>
            <li> (I have terrible blood circulation) - which helps with cellulite.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:8252c75b1dee5f17ef3956e384aeba7e]] Being one who suffers from constant back problems with the muscles in my back and neck, I am always interested in trying different things to help, especially when my significant other suffers from WMFS (weak massaging finger symdrom ;-).  So when I was offered this unique contraption, I decided to give it a try and see how well it works.  Since I am not using this for cellulite, I can&#x27;t say how well this works for that.  This massager is essentially 7 steel balls held in a plastic/silicone holder with a hand strap.  The hand strap fits my hand but just barely.  I can hold this securely, but if you have larger hands then may not fit as the strap doesn&#x27;t really adjust and is really just one size.  Being plastic and stainless steel this can be used in water without having to worry about it rusting.  For when I need a deeper, harder massage to ease my back spasms, then this does work but it does feel a bit rougher than other hand massaging products I have, so you do have to be a bit more careful on the skin.  I think this is in part due to the plastic holders on the balls that sit a little too low and can press against and pinch the skin instead of just the balls.  This does work at getting aches and pains and can give a deep massage but this could be a bit more comfortable with its roller ball design and the hand strap adjustable and a bit larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This works well. With everything you need to keep working on it every day. I think cupping works better but if you have sensitive skin this will be better as it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks</li>
            <li> Cool massager. Great for sore muscles and massage with therapeutic oils. A must for a gym bag.</li>
            <li> I was contacted by Sweetsation Therapy and asked if I would help to provide honest reviews for some of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I explained that I was currently trying to get rid of some stubborn cellulite on my outer thighs and they recommended this product along with the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate and the L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub. Like most women for me cellulite is a constant on going battle so I was excited at the prospect of trying these products out and actually getting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other cellulite massagers in the past and can honestly say this product is in a league of its own. Once you start using this massager its quite clear that a lot of thought has gone into the design. The massager has 7 deep set stainless steel ball bearings, upon initial inspection I was slightly concerned that if I applied too much pressure when using the massager then the motion of the ball bearings rolling would cause it to pinch my skin, fortunately this is not the case at all and the ball bearings really do aid in easy movement of the massager over the skin no matter how much pressure is being applied at the time. I have in the past found that other massagers that don&#x27;t use ball bearings become very difficult to manoeuvre when trying to achieve a deeper massage which can result in a lot of arm ache, the design with the ball bearings really helps prevent this which ultimately means you can use it for longer. This glides over the skin rather than tugging and pulling at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7 stainless steel balls are set on flexible plastic base, again initially I had concerns about this as it came across fairly flimsy, but again after using the massager I was proven wrong. The flexible base really helps the massager follow the contours of your body which allows for a much deeper more effective massage compared to other products which have a solid base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to use the massager every evening after applying NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Firming Concentrate to my thighs, aiming for around 15-20 minutes per session. The area is usually left very red after use, which is generally an indication there is increased blood circulation in that area, and does usually remain red for quite a while after use as well. As far as results go, there has been definite improvement, the skin does appear smoother than before, but it is yet to have an effect on some of the deepest dimples. I am very confident in this product, it is truly excellent at improving circulation which really is key in the battle against cellulite and I really hope over the next few weeks/months the improvement will continue. Like all treatments or products that aid in the battle against cellulite, the results wont come over night, but will take patience and dedication over an extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I have found myself looking forward to using this each evening, which is a bit of a novelty as these things usually become a chore after a while, I can only put this down to ease of use, and the great massaging sensation this product gives. If you are looking for a deep tissue massage or something a little more gentle, this product is capable of providing both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from my review I was not initially convinced this product would work very well, however using it has completely converted me. I am sure I will continue to use this massager for a very long time, and really cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use with the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate cream.  I apply the cream and use the massager to work it in on my belly, butt and thighs. Easy to use and the rollers glide and massage with ease. I haven&#x27;t tried this in the shower, but am pleased with it&#x27;s overall performance. I am having great results and my skin is looking so much nicer! I even have my husband use this massager to give me a back rub.  His hands tire when he rubs my back and this massager allows him to rub longer.</li>
            <li> I am a dermatologist, and I decided to give it a try based on the wonderful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The only explanation for all the good reviews of this product is that maybe they were reviewed by the manufacturer&#x27;s wife, daughter, best friend etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is horrible!!! I can&#x27;t begin to describe how awful this product is.&lt;br /&gt; It doesn&#x27;t slide, it hurts the skin, is completely useless. I would return it if I could, the problem is that I live abroad.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this! it&#x27;s going to the trash after 1 use.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have tried several massagers on the market, and this is the only one that really showed results. You have to be patient, but after about 14 days, you will see results.  I have had three babies in a 6 year period, and have used it all.  You wont waste your money, I love it and would recommend it.  I love it so much, I will be getting some for early XMAS gifts this year.</li>
            <li> Skin QR sent me this along with their  L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed to review for my GlamRiver blog. First of all, I have tried several products from Skin QR and I have been super impressed with the quality of the product and most important, the results!  Now I can add the Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager to the list. The Cellulite Massager is perfect to use in the shower since it&#x27;s waterproof!  I also make my husband use it on my back and it feels amazing, it&#x27;s a multi-tasker in our house.  It does make your cellulite appear more smooth, at least temporarily, so it&#x27;s perfect when you need to show off those legs!  Great product and for the price it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This simple tool is an easy to use, effective aide to breaking up the cellulite.  I use it daily and it really gets the circulation going.  From looking at it, it doesn&#x27;t seem that it would do very much -- but those 7 little steel balls really do their job provided the pressure you apply is adequate.  I would advise taking a lighter hand at applying the pressure when starting -- I believe too much pressure would hurt or make you bruise.  It&#x27;s a great aide in improving skin texture.</li>
            <li> Didnt know what to expect before recieving it yesterday. Its not as flimsy as I thought it may be. It actually seems quite durable and sturdy. Has a simple adjustable handle on back. I bought it in hopes of getting rid of the plentiful cellulite on my thighs. Today is the first day of use. I didnt massage thighs with much pressure at all, yet hours later Im very sore. Im going to stick with this gizmo and hope it helps. On a side note: I recieved this package in a very timely manner. Im impressed with how quickly order was processed and shipped to me.</li>
            <li> I used this product at night time in combination with  skin brushing http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JFZDQ/ref&#x3D;oh_o01_s00_i00_details and this other brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MI3E4/ref&#x3D;oh_o06_s00_i00_details&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after 5just days of used i noticed my cellulite getting a lot better, it&#x27;s not to hard to the skin and if you have a good diet and drink lots of water is better for it to do the job. Recommended</li>
            <li> I have an issue with this massager. It says not to get the massager wet in the instructions. But, let me ask you... who uses a massager on dry skin? The whole intended purpose of the massager, in my opinion, would be to rub in lotion or oil. The balls feel awful on your skin when you are rubbing it dry. So, the massager does not work for its intended purpose. Furthermore, wouldn&#x27;t the massager need to be washed occasionally? Or would you want to use the same dirty massager on yourself over and over? In order to wash the massager, you&#x27;re going to have to get it wet. Very poor design. The metal balls rusted after the third use. I am returning this product asap. It has no use to me if I can&#x27;t rub lotion in with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly for solving cellulite problem. I also use it to comfort my back and shoulders. Really worth buying.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure about the effectiveness of this massager for cellulite , but I got this massager for massaging muscles after working out. It works a lot better than massaging with my hands. I workout a lot and I use it when my neck, shoulder, arm and calve muscle gets tired. I took off one star because 3 of the balls did not roll for few days and I thought it was broke after a week after the purchase, but after using another few days, it worked like it used too, so I am happy with the product now.</li>
            <li> This a waste of money a Hugh joke don&#x27;t work  and just flat out crap I wish I never bought it</li>
            <li> This works to the appropriate degree. At some point, you are also going to have to exercise to tone up the underlying muscle, so don&#x27;t think that you can skip that step as well. This little massager is so much more effective than any lotion because it actually does help your circulation (I have terrible blood circulation) - which helps with cellulite. While lotions can help firm up loose skin, they have a much harder time penetrating to break up fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also just really nice as a simple body massager. Just make sure you aren&#x27;t too vigorous with it on places that may bruise easily because I can definitely see that happening if too much pressure is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal balls aren&#x27;t deteriorating for me but I also don&#x27;t use this in the shower - though the packaging does say it is waterproof, I just haven&#x27;t tried. And like all metal objects - yes, the metal balls are cold until you warm it up. It does not take long to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is that the strap that goes around your hand could have been designed a little better.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about this massager but now that I tried it I love it! It takes time (after all, cellulite did not get there overnight!) but I have seen fabulous results. I do about 30 minutes of massage every day and use the massager in combination with the natural scrub from the same brand ([[ASIN:B003J4TJTM L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed, 12oz]]). My legs are looking firmer and firmer-I have been using both products for about 2 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Belgium so I had to pay quite high delivery fees, which made the overall price of the product to high for what it actually is. It&#x27;s just a massager with rolling balls, nothing extraordinary...</li>
            <li> Works great as a rolling massager.  This is good for sore muscles especially after workouts. Can be used all over the body. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I started my Anti-cellulite Program a month ago, I purchased the Phat QR Massager and with an Anti-cellulite Fat Burner by Eveline Cosmetics, along with a workout 3-4 days a week,lots of fresh juices and a low calorie diet.My cellulite is not gone yet, but its definetly reduced, my skin looks firmer and im real motivated to keep going with my program!The massager definetly works, use it two or more times a day for about 10-15 min and you will get results!</li>
            <li> The Phat massager seems to be working. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and used it faithfully daily. The dimples seem to look   smoother. I will continue to massage my thighs daily and get back to you with the results after three months.</li>
            <li> I am an artist/faux finisher and I constantly lift, bend and climb ladders and scaffolding. Needless to say I am sore when I get home from work and when I saw \\&quot;water proof\\&quot; - I had to try it. Well, it works and I absolutely love it!! This is one of the products that you can say \\&quot; God bless the individual who came up with this!\\&quot; I can now relax and massage my achey muscles while Im cleaning up the days paint and debris! Its amazing I sleep better and wake up less sore too. It is so wonderful as a massager that I forgot that it serves another purpose. I bought this as a set with the cellulite treatment. I&#x27;ll start evaluating the cellulite lotion to see if it makes a visible difference and submit another eval. once I have emptied the bottle. One thing I can say now about the cellulite treatment is it smells wonderful! Lets hope it works as well as the massager. I will definitely let everyone know.</li>
            <li> Love this products, it feels so good on your skin. I use it for my cellulite and I saw such a fantastic improvement.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Noticed huge difference in the appearance of my cellulite.  Feels great on the skin.  Would HIGHLY recommend to EVERYONE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Massager is sturdy and good construction and holds well on my hand while massaging. Does not slip off. And it helps to reduce water retention and reduce cellulite. I am using it with their lotion and scrub too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product religiously every night for the last few weeks &amp; I do see improvement right after use but like it says it&#x27;s a temporary product. I have battled cellulite my whole life &amp; will try any product that claims to improve. I would recommend this product if you have slight cellulite you want to reduce but if you have a lot of it this product is not miracle worker. As for the pain...I don&#x27;t know if I am tough or the others that complain are weak but it doesn&#x27;t really hurt unless you have super human strength. I do bruise easy so I have had a few small bruises but nothing to complain about. Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> Havent had it for that long.. do beleive that with hard work you can get rid of cellulite but it takes more than just using this item especially if you have a excessive amount like me..I do hafta add to use this with lubricate or it drags on your skin and dont press too hard or it will bruise you and it rusts so if you use it in shower make sure you take it out and dry it even if its in there a couple of hours the balls do rust..dont have visible results yet but im a very patient person if you want results quickly and are just using this item with a excessive amount of cellulite I would hafta say this item is not for you</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this product is!  I bought this with the NeElle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite concentrate and my husband and I love them!  I get a free but and thigh massage, and my husband gets to enjoy the view from behind!  Especially since the view from behind is getting better and better thanks to these two products!  I will recommend this to all my girlfriends....I&#x27;m sure their husbands will thank me!</li>
            <li> Love this easy to use product.  It&#x27;s flexible and easily glides along the areas of your body to help reduce cellulite.  I use this along with toning cream for a better outcome.  This product is small and would make the perfect gift for anyone interested smoothing out their look!</li>
            <li> Good qwality product,easy to use,it does the job! Very compact I can take it with me anywhere. Now I have to buy another one for my wife,she tried it and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to see results but since a lot of people claim they saw results I&#x27;ll comment on what I do like so far.  It&#x27;s easy to handle and you can mindlessly massage while watching tv or whatever.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t operate on batteries or needs to be plugged in and there is no noise involved.  You can take it anywhere with you and I think it feels good on my legs.  It&#x27;s a great way to get your circulation going which I believe is a factor when it comes to cellulite.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to massage in the Svelte PRO Supercharged Organic Anti-Cellulite Treatment with L&#x27;Carnitine, CoQ10 and 25 Fat Fighting Slimulators lotion and love the results. The feeling takes some getting used to, but it starts to feel really great once you get the hang of it, and it really makes the lotion penetrate deeper. If you do forget to dry/wipe it off after use, just use a paper towel or magic eraser and any rusty-looking spots come off easily (the metal massage balls are super easy to pop out and put back in). When I take the time to use this, I really notice a difference in the way my skin looks and feels (especially after continued use).</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said this, but is is not emphasized enough. Use this product gently because the beads/balls in the device are metal and can be heavy when pushed into the skin too hard. I had incredibly deep bruises when I started using this and continue to get them when I am a little too rough this device.     As for removing cellulite-that is a debatable topic as to which method helped me get rid of cellulite. Initially, I was only messaging one thigh with this device and noticed only a slight difference which could have been attributed to a number of things. I started using a cream, made some dietary changes, and began lifting weights. This does make my skin seem softer and less tight which makes working out and building muscle a little easier. Another tip I have-try to use  on bare skin or in tight fitting clothes-otherwise I do not feel this penetrates the layers of skins effectively.     I also like using this as a regular messaging for my muscles after a tough work out-but I doubt this is the \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; with the five star rating that just gets rid of cellulite over night.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use this on our thigh and stomach area for our cellulite.  It seem to work.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> I have been using this massager for nearly two months now and I have seen a remarkable improvement in my cellulite. The improvement wasn&#x27;t immediate, but as the weeks have past my legs are beginning feel and look much better. I usually just use the massager on my legs for about 20 minutes a day without using oils or creams. Many of the cellulite lumps and bumps on my legs have become remarkably less noticeable and some areas they have already disappeared entirely. I have been so impressed with the results so much that I even ordered a couple extra massagers as back up just in case the first one ever breaks. Which probably won&#x27;t be for a long time since the products seems pretty well made to me. This product is like a \\&quot;mini miracle\\&quot; to me considering all the money I have spent on cellulite and firming creams over the years that never seem to work. I was beginning to loose hope until I bought this product. I am excited to see my legs will looks in a couple of months!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with my Body Scrub and cellulite cream and it is amazing. The balls on the outside of the scrubber help to &amp;#34;knead&amp;#34; the skin to help improve circulation and stimulate fat loss. You do need to use this with a combination of diet and exercise, but it helps with the results when using the body scrub and the cellulite cream! :-)</li>
            <li> Don&#x60;t waste your money! I have used it for a long time  but I haven&#x60;t noticed anything. Moreover, It is hard to use.</li>
            <li> nice massager i used it everyday and relieve all my stress pretty nice product specially when you need a massage so bad you can always rely on this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Apparently there is a difference between cellulite and fat deposits, but they look the same, so it&#x27;s hard to tell the difference. Fat deposits however are easier to get rid of my means of massaging out /breaking up the fat deposits, so they don&#x27;t give you that lumpy look. My cellulite (or fat deposits) seems to be concentrated mostly on the sides of my thighs and by using this with a combination of exercise and creams, I feel this massager has truly helped. It does hurt when you roll over your &#x27;sites&#x27; but I haven&#x27;t gotten any bruising from it and the longer I use it the less it hurts. I feel like my legs do look smoother.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you really plan on doing this everyday. Think about it before you buy it. Are you going to commit to it to see results? Are you going to workout? Are you going to eat right? All this must be done for progress. There is no miracle cure, you have to work for it. Just want to point this out so you don&#x27;t waste money. As far as the product goes it&#x27;s ok you can get these anywhere it&#x27;s nothing special. Kinda awkward grip but in THEORY if you do work for it it could help.</li>
            <li> perfect tool for sore muscles</li>
            <li> this product TRULY delivers...  i use this w/ the seaweed Xtract anti-cellulite gel and i already am seeing POSITIVE RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li> Great massager for every kind of sore muctles. As a pro tennis player, it&#x27;s a must for me after a good game.</li>
            <li> I have been using this massager for the several month each time after the workout. I have found it very useful for reducing muscle sourness. Usually I use in the shower and it worked perfect, it is as good as new. Will definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> i have to agree with one of the reviews saying that the metal balls deteriorated(it works ok at first).....i started using it 3 weeks ago, and i never used in shower ...i always use a cloth wipe it clean after using it, and keep it in a dry place. however, i started to notice the metal deteriorated since last week....i have to throw it away...disappointed..</li>
            <li> I bought the Phat QR Cellulite Massager with one thought in my mind and that was to work on reducing the apperance of my cellulite.  Well....the Phat QR Massager works FANTASTIC, it helped me reduce the apperance of my cellulite, I use it every time.  It&#x27;s the perfect size and easy to use.  I would recommend it HIGHLY!!  Thank you Skin QR.</li>
            <li> This massager took a while to get used to using. My hands are small and slip through the security band. It does help somewhat with the appearance of cellulite. So for the bit of difficulty I have keeping it secured to my hand it seems worth the effort. I like that I can use it in or out of the shower - which gives me the option of using body wash or the lotion of my choice.</li>
            <li> What a great little body and cellulite massager.  I have always been a little skeptical when it comes to products for cellulite but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with the products from Argania LLC.  I started using the massager to loosen up my muscles and work out the knots in my upper back.  The Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager works great to loosen up my muscles and relieve a lot of my back pain.  After using it on my back I decided to give it a try on my thighs aka &amp;#34;troubled cellulite area.&amp;#34;  It actually is working, after a week I am noticing a little bit of a difference.  I know products take time to work and I am so glad I am giving this product a chance because the long term results will be great.  I actually use it with the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate.  I apply the cream first, let it soak in, and then I use the massager to increase my circulation in that area.  So far I am really impressed, my thighs are starting to look smoother!  I would highly recommend the cellulite massager but you do have to give it a chance (meaning try it for longer than a day).  However, if you are just looking for a massager that is easy to use this one is great!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> i bought this knowing not to expect a miracle, or actually even a slight difference, but within a week i noticed an improvement, haven&#x27;t seen much since, though.  overall, im happy with it. i use it now in conjuction with nivea&#x27;s anti-cellulite serum and again i&#x27;ve noticed less dimpling. (sigh) why, oh, why do some women go through this. don&#x27;t we deal with enough? :o)</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars, because I love it for a massager, but can&#x27;t tell any difference with cellulite. I think help with cellulite comes by changing your diet, and there is no miraculous magic to do it for you. Well other than lipo.</li>
            <li> I love this cellulite massager! I keep it in the shower and I use it everyday along with my NuElle  cellulite lotion, and I have seeing incredible results so far. It fits perfectly in my hand and it has a handle on it as well, which makes it a lot easier to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something practical that you can use on the go, this is it! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this every day and I see a big difference! It has really reduced the appearance of the cellulite on my thighs. I love this great gadget!</li>
            <li> I used this for a while and all it did was make me sore. I used it and afterwards used  two types of cellulite cream and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it would be just another gadget that I would end up not using but I love it, my husband can hear me using it because the balls make a little noise and he runs in the room &amp;#34;Do my back&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> This is a great body massager for shower. I think it helps with cellulift but I&#x27;m honestly not that consistent in using it. Typically more if I&#x27;m sore after working out, helps my muscles recover faster.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this massager and how great it works for her cellulite. After reading all the reviews I decided to try it too. I was confused at first to see that it was waterproof and some reviews mentioned that it rusted. So I called the company and they told me that those reviews are old and now this massager comes waterproof. (and they even gave me discount code, yeey) It didn&#x27;t disappoint. I like this massager. It works great just like my friend said. You just slip it on your hand and the strap of the back of it holds it there perfectly. If you massage your own body you can control the pressure and speed, and find the best way that works for you. I use it with cellulite lotion and skin brush. All efforts combined, I am thrilled with the results. Receiving back massage with scented oil is so relaxing too. It&#x27;s a must have tool for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li> Luckily I don&#x27;t have issues with cellulite but I work and work out a lot and due to that Sore and aching muscles is my issue. This tool does a lot to loosen me up. I often use it in the tub with salts and it&#x27;s great. Does the job</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference</li>
            <li> This was painful and didn&#x27;t work after bearing it for a week. I couldn&#x27;t do it any longer. In the&lt;br /&gt;trash it went.</li>
            <li> This is a cool massager. It is cool to the touch and really feels that it can help with tight muscles or when you just need a good massage.</li>
            <li> Great quality product and not to expensive. I have tried so many things and this masager it really works. I use it everyday for about 10 minutes and I can see some much improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting a hand held roller/massager.  I will probably use this as a gift for christmas.  I wanted it for the pain and blood flow in my legs.</li>
            <li> This was uncomfortable to use and saw no results.</li>
            <li> I am actually using it for a face and neck self-massage. It is great and very convenient to use - fits perfectly in the hand and delivers enough force without too much effort. I am sure it is good for the body as well.</li>
            <li> Not just good for breaking up fatty tissue in the legs, really good for increasing the circulation in the legs.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. It works well for sore muscles and cellulite alike. Feeling better overall. Good construction and reasonable price. My husband enjoys his massage too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen one of these massagers at my g/f&#x27;s house and was thrilled when she gave me one for my birthday. Cool, cool, cool product. As we all women struggle with cellulite, I think everyone should have one. It really does help to stimulate tissues and get that blood going. You can use it not just for cellulite issues, but just about everything. It feels so good.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  It broke about the tenth time I used it.  I can&#x27;t seem to fix it either.  I should have listened to the negative reviews.  A waste of money!</li>
            <li> This came in a kit I ordered with the body scrub and cellulite cream. This massager is great for aching and tired muscles.  I can&#x27;t say it gets rid of cellulite, but it does rev up circulation and improves skin appearance.  Will continue to use products from this line, as I love them!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ! GREAT QUALITY</li>
            <li> The best hand held massager ever!</li>
            <li> it works good! it took me about a week to see improvement though, it feels really good like a massager and works well! I recommend it</li>
            <li> There are a few things in life that I believe are necessary to have and this is one of them. My husband has had back surgery and is always having back/shoulder pain still and I just love having massages. One thing I can always look forward to is having my husband rub my back every night before bed. For me, I like to rub his back but he likes it deep and I don&#x27;t have big hands so after a while I get sore. This has been a miracle for that because I can rub his back without having to put all the pressure that I usually do. For him, it&#x27;s great. For me, it&#x27;s even better. I don&#x27;t have cellulite since I am only 25 BUT it is never too early to take care of your skin so I am preventively using this massager on the areas that I most want them like my thighs and my backside. Not only does it feel good, is easy to use, and makes my skin just look nice overall. I love that it is waterproof so that I can take it in the shower with me and not have to worry about it getting messed up like other massagers like this. There is only one downfall and it&#x27;s nothing too bad because you can do what my husband does but because he has some hair on his back, the balls tend to grab the hairs. It&#x27;s not that comfortable but in the shower it works great and with a shirt on it works great. I have no issues with it myself so I can&#x27;t complain. I think it&#x27;s a great addition to anyone who wants to take care of their skin and body. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review*</li>
            <li> Nice, feels good.  I purchased this to add to my methods for reducing the look of the cellulite on my legs.  Not sure if it alone would work but its nice for the price</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely brilliant massager for reducing the appearance of cellulite. I use my massager every morning in the shower and I really feel like it is a pampering tool for anyone who wants to feel like they are making the most of reducing cellulite. It is waterproof, easy to hold (non slip) and fits into your hand so you can hold it easily. I love the way it works and is shaped for easy manipulation up and down or side to side as the balls move over your legs or tummy. I use it on the top of my legs and it feels as if it is helping also with circulation. I use it while in the shower with the water running and as it is waterproof it is safe to do so. I use it in conjuction with the body blaster seaweed scrub. Well worth the extra ten minutes or so in the shower to feel like your skin is renewed. I have also noticed that the circulation problems I previously was experiencing on my legs seem to have improved. Great invention and a lovely pampering tool.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd product I purchased from this company and so far none has disappointed. It is a simple massager and I am using it along with their Nuelle cellulite treatment. Both deliver results. My girlfriends noticed an improvement and commented, while I had reservations. It is perhaps because I see myself every day and small changes might be not so obvious, while they haven&#x27;t seen me for a while. It&#x27;s a great inexpensive tool and it&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this in the shower with the &amp;#34;L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed &amp;#34;. What a great combo for helping to reduce the appearance of cellulite on my thighs!!! I have also been using the &amp;#34;NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate&amp;#34; and the combination of the three products is a home run!!! Don&#x27;t waste your time on other inferior products!</li>
            <li> This was an interesting buy. The balls spin effortlessly and the little hand grip and bendable plastic holder makes it easy to do shoulders, legs, butt etc and feels like it&#x27;s actually making a difference. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say whether it holds up after a decent amount of use but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I have the whole Phat QR Solutions Anti Cellulite Collection! I started with just the NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate and I like that so much! I could tell a difference within just a few days.....Then a couple weeks down the road, my husband even mentioned that he was starting to notice a difference. Then I got the L&#x27;or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed and the Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These three when used together are unbeatable. This is the best thing that I have gotten and used for cellulite. I have two kids and so of course I have cellulite on my outer thighs and buttocks and then on my stomach as well. I have noticed a significant change in the amount and appearance of my cellulite with these three products used together. I would HIGHLY recommend giving them a try, especially if you have stubborn cellulite that is making you self-conscious! I can honestly say that I have a noticeable difference in mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to this product....I thought it would so nice and massaging to use.....when I first tried it, I was a little worried. It had a little stronger/more painful feeling than I was expecting but it was not horrible. Then when I got used it (after using it a couple times), I noticed that the feeling actually started to feel pretty good. It was different than I thought it would be the first time I used it. I thought it would just be soft and roll over my skin but it was a more deeper tissue massager and I truly love it! I think that the best part about it is that YOU are the one that controls the pressure that is applied. That allows you to control how deep of muscle you massage and you can massage any sore muscles that really need it as well. Earlier I said a stronger/more painful than I thought....what I meant by that is that I used too much pressure and didn&#x27;t know how to use it and wasn&#x27;t used to it. However, once I figured it out.....I can&#x27;t imagine not having this Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, They shipped quickly and the company is very customer friendly! They are quick to respond to any questions and happy to help with anything that I needed!agine not having this Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, They shipped quickly and the company is very customer friendly!

            <li> as an avid tennis player, i get sore muscles more often than i would like to. this tool is a life saver. i often use it in a bath tub with salts and bubbles and it helps tremendously. deep tissue massage that it provides, i am sure, it works on cellulite too. good quality too and you can take it with you everywhere, its compact enough.</li>
            <li> I like this rolly glove for massaging my body in general. I get sore muscles often due to being an avid runner. I appreciate that it is waterproof since I got in a habit to use it in a hot bath with salt and minerals. It feels so good. And it hasn&#x27;t rusted at all. I guess I am lucky to not have much of cellulite, at least nothing much that would nag at me, but I am sure it helps this problem too. It feels like it provides very good deep massage. Probably will buy a few more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this would make any difference in the looks of my legs, and I am not sure still if it does or not, but I love it. Did that make any sense? Okay, I use it with finillite am and pm cream, all together I have seen amazing results! The massager feels good, I use it in the tub or just with the creams. I would recommend this product 100%!</li>
            <li> I have tried cellulite products from this seller before and loved them. This product is not an exception. It rolls nicely on my skin and it feels kind of warm afterwards. It feels like my tissues are alive. It clearly improves circulation. Being waterproof is a big plus. I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving it wet in shower.</li>
            <li> This little thing gets right into the neck/shoulders areas really well. I can do it for myself or my spouse can massage those areas for me that are hard to reach. I use it in the shower and bathtub too.</li>
