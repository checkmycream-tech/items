    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This Cetaphil lotion is perfect because it provides the sun defense (SPF 50)</li>
            <li>Thus, it&#x27;s not the best product to use by those wearing make-up.</li>
            <li>I have already started using this product and what I noticed best</li>
            <li>and it does a superb job.  </li>
            <li>A great product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe Cetaphil came out with this product because I&#x27;m usually very happy with their stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>This is definetely on of the best sunblock lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li>Best regards, Tannya</li>
            <li>and this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>It works great!  </li>
            <li>Just perfect!</li>
            <li>I was using the Purpose brand....which had a SPF of 15 but was awesome otherwise.</li>
            <li>If these cosmetic trifles do not concern you, however, then this product is superb (provided that you are not sweating profusely or swimming in the ocean, etc.).</li>
            <li>Perfect for California weather.</li>
            <li>Perfect for oily acne prone skin.</li>

            <li>very good for my son.</li>
            <li>very good</li>
            <li>Excellent protection against the sun, and good moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>but people say I have beautiful dewy skin.</li>
            <li>I realize 50 spf is great coverage.     </li>
            <li>I always mix foundation with moisturizer and this is a great way to incorporate spf with my make up and not hurt my skin.    </li>
            <li>In the summertime it is a great aunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>A great product for summer</li>
            <li>Plus, my make-up goes on great over this face lotion.</li>
            <li>Great for every use.</li>
            <li>This sunblock is great.  </li>
            <li>Great Product, great protection for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to order on line and am happy about that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I should point out that this product feels great as a moisturizer on my skin.</li>
            <li>This product may work great for you</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>I have found that it works great and will continue to use it on her.</li>
            <li>I will keep on buying this great product.</li>
            <li>It also has a great Spf of 50, which is what I need for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and I will keep using it for the excellent protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>Very good product, Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it during my hour-long runs in bright sunlight.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s good: It works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SPF 50 and does a good job protecting the skin from the sun.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does prevent sun damage, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, so maybe this wouldn&#x27;t work for darker skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I apply it after applying my aftershave lotion and am good for the day.</li>
            <li>So, this is a winner, and I&#x27;m always thrilled to be happy with drugstore-priced stuff.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to find a spf 50 moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for a purse/makeup bag and the pump is just right.</li>
            <li>My love for Cetaphil products continues!</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>However, if they may have colored lotion, it would be even better!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has no order and goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>However, it does moisturize my face nicely and I can wear makeup over the sunblock, it doesn&#x27;t cause a break</li>
            <li>I liked that this sunscreen/moisturizer absorbs so nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li>Now knowing the &amp;#34;disappointment&amp;#34; was my own doing</li>
            <li>What a nice way to protect my face from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.</li>
            <li>Just need to keep blotting tissues handy.  </li>
            <li>Nice feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this gives good sun protection, and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out at all</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and then I don&#x27;t feel anything afterwards, which is very nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good sunscreen product, and very straight forward.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and thoroughly and provideds great protection.</li>
            <li>Usually I love the smell of sunscreens, but this had some kind of additive I suspect</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is a good brand, and i&#x27;m sure this sunscreen is great, but on people of color or darker complected people it doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion with sunblock I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>after all looking good is the primary concern.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s suitable for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin and the SPF</li>
            <li>I noticed greater sun protection with this product; it&#x27;s nice to have the sunscreen included in the moisturizer</li>
            <li>It does a great job of protecting you from the sun and it is very much not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It works great and protects my skin very well!</li>
            <li>It has a very light fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  </li>
            <li>It feels very light on my skin and it´s not grease.</li>
            <li>She is very light complected</li>
            <li>This is a very mild product and does not irritate my skin and effectively moisturizes it.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair plus I am taking a medication that makes me even more sensitive to burning.  </li>
            <li>the more you add, the more rubbing away the chalky film you&#x27;ll have to do.  </li>
            <li>I need it more than she anyway.</li>
            <li>We love the Cetaphil products and have used the soaps and lotions for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li>B001E96NKC Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, SPF-15, 1.4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]] or</li>
            <li>This is essentially the best skin care product that I have received from vine.    </li>
            <li>I use it on my face, chest and top of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love that the scent is</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I have it.  </li>
            <li>This one is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it I have to put powder on top of it to get rid of the shine.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I love love this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema, and most sunscreens either trigger a flare up or burn her skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>sun protection is ok but</li>
            <li>It is nice that it is more than sunscreen, as it is a moisturizing product along with providing the highest SPF available.  </li>
            <li>However, the sunscreen in this moisturizer will not prevent the need to reapply more product every two hours if you are exposing your skin to the sun continuously or for more than 10 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li>Based on results the next day I will say that this lotion is superb at protecting skin from the sun.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a stickler for sunscreens and have worn an SPF 30 or more since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, for a moisturizer with an SPF 50, it has a nice light weight slippery texture.</li>
            <li>most things sting my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin tends to flake and peel a lot in the winter, mostly because I use a retinol product, but I still like it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy but my skin glows more than I prefer--I don&#x27;t always like that</li>
            <li>I sometimes mix a dab of foundation with it and pat that on as a top layer to reduce the whiteness and even out my skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>And the price is somewhat satisfied</li>
            <li>Also many doctors recommend using Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>but there may be better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and feel confident I&#x27;m being protected from the sun with the 50 SPF.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years as I am have eczema</li>
            <li>Simply put, this sunscreen and moisturizer is the best product of its type that I have used.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This penetrates very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The SPF is obviously great, as are the physical-blocking ingredients, but the moisturizing action is much too great and if you have oil-prone skin</li>
            <li>Very good one product remedy for those who will be exposed to sun for more than just brief periods.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for all out there who have a dry skin problem.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and it is available at your local pharrmacy.  </li>
            <li>It works great on my sensitive skin and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is great sun protection, I guess, but doesn&#x27;t meet my needs as far as being a sunscreen I can wear under makeup.</li>
            <li>this sunscreen misses the mark in terms of being an ideal facial sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil does a great job, my face feels soft and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>I like the way it&#x27;s bottled and pumps easily.</li>
            <li>It is easily applied, and protected me all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It protects well, and despite not having any \\&quot;sport\\&quot; designation, it doesn&#x27;t seem to easily wear off from perspiration.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than brands at the makeup counters, and I honestly think it&#x27;s a better product.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to work it into your face and leaves a fine film</li>
            <li>It works just fine for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>If I blot it, it is fine.  </li>
            <li>This goes on smooth, and has no headache producing strong scent, but it does leave a shine, even under foundation.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Cetaphil products.  </li>
            <li>In the summer I up the ante and add a moisturizer with an SPF of 50, a huge sunhat that also has an SPF of 50, and prescription polarized sunglasses.</li>
            <li>It is great to use on days when I am going to be outside.  </li>
            <li>Odor free and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and when I am wearing it, I do feel protected from the sun</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Non-comedogenic, Non-greasy, Fragrance free from the #1 dermatologist recommended brand\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>It is fragence free, so your husband or kids can use it without worrying about a sunscreen or beachy smell.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer goes on my face smoothly and feels so light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  light and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>It was great for the summer months but in the dryer winter weather it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>One way is to use chemicals that absorb the UV light before it hits your skin.  </li>
            <li>The Cetaphil goes on light and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer and, because I have brown spots in several places, I always use this to cover those before I go out and work in the yard.</li>
            <li>and I like the non oil feeling and the smooth of the lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any white residue and my makeup goes on great.  </li>
            <li>Yes, there is a LIGHT smell, once you rub it in, it goes away.  </li>
            <li>This is a great combination product - moisturizer and sunscreen (SPF-50) for daily use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Cetaphil can come out with a better face sunscreen than this and look forward to their new and improved formula.</li>
            <li>SPF is so helpful and the quality is just amazing since i live in Dubai and it still leaves my skin moist but not oily.</li>
            <li>My skin is horribly dry and this feels great going on but it feels a tad greasy after an hour or two.  </li>
            <li>liked this product because it was unscented, seemed to do the job of moisturizing my skin while I fooled around in the yard, and it wasn&#x27;t greasy like many similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a moisturizer, there is nothing special about this.  </li>
            <li>but I think that on someone else, the whiteness could stand out and not look right!</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens are a bit too greasy to use as lotion (plus they don&#x27;t really serve that purpose).</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, without an oily feeling and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>It provides good sun protection and daily use.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin; I&#x27;ve used it daily with good results.  </li>
            <li>I spend extra time working it into my (somewhat fair) skin</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and also have allergic reactions to some facial products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>True, SPF 50 is better than say SPF30, but the regular sport-spray lotions are much better on my eyes than this</li>
            <li>I liked the look, it wasn&#x27;t what I would call shiny or greasy at first but actually gave me a healthy looking glow under my foundation, that lasted maybe an hour</li>
            <li>I use this with other face products and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit more \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and leaves a bit more residue on the face than standard moisturizer -</li>
            <li>Instead of a flip top, mine has a mini-pump top, which I actually prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rubs</li>
            <li>As with most Cetaphil products, the price is high.  </li>
            <li>Living in the Southwest, I make sure to moisturize with a high spf.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a high SPF.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty great innovation, particularly for those sensitive areas around the mouth and eyes where chemicals could cause irritation.</li>
            <li>Exactly the moisturizer I was looking for.. Very light weight, and high spf!</li>
            <li>flip top seems like it would be a nice little item to carry in a purse, and the lack of chemicals make it suitable for even very young children.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a very minor tradeoff for a good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Normally it is just clean skin, a light moisturizer, and me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, never clogs my pores, and really protects.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth using.</li>
            <li>She liked the product and reported that it applied smoothly, was not greasy, had minimal odor, and didn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great option, especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is worth trying no matter your skin type, and I will use this product again.</li>
            <li>I developed an itching reaction to most sunblocks;&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>So far it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried for blocking the sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works as good as i expected.</li>
            <li>I put it on every single day and am very pleased that I am protected from the sun.</li>
            <li>But I put it on right when I get out of the shower, before I eat breakfast.  </li>
            <li>What is lacking is the claim of broad spectrum UVA/UVB sun protection that most sunscreen products advertise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll fly to Miami for a day or two, and if I don&#x27;t use a sunscreen my face will get that reddish appearance (not a healthy tan, a reddish appearance).  </li>
            <li>The tube is small in size so it is easy to carry and the pump on top works fine and eliminates spillage.</li>
            <li>You certainly can&#x27;t use this as moisturizer alone, it should be thought of as a sunscreen with some mild moisturizing properties to it.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for 50 and up year old women and men.</li>
            <li>very, very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, too.</li>
            <li>This moisturizes really well and has sunscreen to boot!  </li>
            <li>Considering all of the top notch SPF moisturizers on the market, we may opt for alternatives in the future (like the retinol-based [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Also because its summer and I am doing a transatlantic trip to Asia which is really really hot now.    </li>
            <li>face feels baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It exactly what it claims to be: SPF 50, non-greasy, and NO FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it protects from the sun, but i dont wanna walk around looking ashy and greasy at the same time, and putting makeup or face powder over</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may not be for everyone, and you may prefer to use it as a face appropriate sunblock, but I would use it daily.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes when there is a higher (like more than 15 SPF) sunscreen in a lotion, it sort of just sits on the surface of my face and makes my subsequent makeup application smeary.</li>
            <li>but that is to be expected since it is needs to leave some kind of layer on the skin in order to protect.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my skin and people constantly ask me what I use.</li>
            <li>This the first thing I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>all!&lt;br /&gt;The lotion moisturizes really well, and is quickly absorbed into in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I have to blot my face once during the day if it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
            <li>and I am on the first tube.</li>
            <li>No creepy smell</li>
            <li>but I LOVE it for daily wear.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use this product.</li>
            <li>I was really bummed because I brought a two pack from Amazon on it!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well with sun light</li>
            <li>i prefer the higher spf rating.  </li>
            <li>So good, in fact, that I&#x27;ll look for another Cetaphil moisturizer (without SPF 50) for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I had began talking walks around high noon in the sun and started to tan quickly.</li>
            <li>Having spent the better part of three years looking for a suitable suncream which would protect AND moisturize, I ended up last summer with MD Skincare&#x27;s orange bottle SPF 30.  </li>
            <li>I also love the small size tube can fit right in your pocketbook or pocket--easy to carry for days outdoors.  </li>
            <li>Using a regular sunscreen and then using a good moisturizer after being outside would be preferable both in regards to cost and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;m writing a review as the first one didn&#x27;t get posted up.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this moisturizer as CETAPHIL is a reputable company with quality products, but this moisturizer is just TERRIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think consistently wearing SPF is a part of that, but Cetaphil is really moisturizing as well, so I&#x27;m not using 2 separate products to get moisture or layering products on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I saw this product and saw it had a SF 50 rating I didn&#x27;t quite believe it could be any good, because I&#x27;ve tried an SPF 30 in the past and it was almost like paint.</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for good sun protection.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and this moisturizes enough with great SPF coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am currently using acne medication and needed a strong sunblock to wear during the day.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is labeled as fragrance free, which I interpret as not having any masking fragrance since there is a slight familiar \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; odor.      </li>
            <li>Also, it may smell like sunscreen on your face if you don&#x27;t really work it in.  </li>
            <li>price is a bit up there, but so is the SPF, and it&#x27;s meant just for the face, not your whole body.</li>
            <li>This product has so much sunscreen in it that I cannot use it as moisturizer - when applied, it made my skin sting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cautious to the types of</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is know to be gentle on skin</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>, it feels greasy and my skin is very shiny and oily looking after I put the product on.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely light skin and must wear a daily sunscreen on my face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen looks ashey on the skin, and is very shiny.</li>
            <li>The lotion is VERY hydrating</li>
            <li>The following are the product claims:        \\&quot;This light, non greasy moisturizer nourishes and hydrates your skin while also protecting it from</li>
            <li>Please, when you send the product, include the respective invoice over the package, because is too important to get out the merchandise.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, and moisturizes the skin, almost like standard Cetaphil lotions.  </li>
            <li>If SPF is too much for you, try the lower SPF option.</li>
            <li>It has an impressive amount of effective sunscreen ingredients in a standard lotion base.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, but does smell a tad like sunsblock.&lt;br /&gt;SPF</li>
            <li>It seems to help, I like the way it my skin feel very moist after using it.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using it up on my neck and arms where I didn&#x27;t care as much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this sunscreen, but it&#x27;s too shiny.  </li>
            <li>Really like the packaging.</li>
            <li>Somehow, someway Celaphil found a way to make SPF 50 non-greasy, light weight and with no filmy white residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product can be applied above cheekbones and even on eyelids lightly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skin care junkie, and I remember Paula Begoun in the &#x27;90s talking about how Cetaphil cleanser was all a person really needed.  </li>
            <li>So, periodically I would use Cetaphil stuff (on travel, at my mom&#x27;s house, whatever), but on the whole this was not a brand I&#x27;d choose except in a pinch.    </li>
            <li>I tried it under my eyes before working in the yard, and it worked very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to keep mine in the glove compartment of my car for those times when it is really sunny</li>
            <li>It is better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m done with breakfast and ready to put on my makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY greasy.</li>
            <li>I chose Cetaphil because of it&#x27;s gentle reputation.  </li>
            <li>Very  moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Like most Cetaphil products you really don&#x27;t have to worry about having your skin dry out as a result of product use, however, aside from the &#x27;hydrating&#x27; factor and decent SPF protection</li>
            <li>However, even though it&#x27;s a nice facial moisturizer, I would not use it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>When I wasn&#x27;t on my cream though, it made my face feel kinda greasy, but other than that, it worked just fine!</li>
            <li>The other way is to use a physical barrier to the light, which is why there are so many lifeguards with painted noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, I am always interested in new moisturizing products that have sunscreens.    </li>
            <li>This is not a big deal when I am off in the yard and completely alone, but not so good when I am out with people.&lt;br /&gt;While this product offers protection and does a good job moisturizing, I&#x27;m not pleased with the white residue.</li>
            <li>Since so many of Cetaphil&#x27;s other products work well with her skin, we thought we&#x27;d try their sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>it is better than other defense moisturizer i have used before.</li>
            <li>Spending a few more minutes rubbing it into the skin also help reduce the shininess I observed when I first began using this product.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to see such a high SPF from them for the face.     </li>
            <li>so be sure to only add a tiny bit for your WHOLE face--</li>
            <li>starters I experimented with this product on a recent weekend outing to Palm Springs where I played 18 holes of mid-morning golf in full sunlight (and no hat) with temperatures hovering in the mid-80&#x27;s range.</li>
            <li>There are very few products that are effective for both UVB and UVA.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those who want to protect their skin from those harmful rays.</li>
            <li>As a sunblock, you probably should use a little bit more, but it never feels greasy on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:</li>
            <li>but I find it a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, too bad</li>
            <li>After application you can apply your make up as you normally would.</li>
            <li>If you have normal to oily skin, this may feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>face is oily and my neck is normal.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have normally oily skin.</li>
            <li>If you let your beard grow out a few days, it does cling to the hair and takes a bit more work to rub in.</li>
            <li>I know it works because my cheeks will look very red after using other products that either don&#x27;t last in the water or don&#x27;t feel good going</li>
            <li>When the Cetaphil sunscreen arrived I tested it right away - we&#x27;d just come back from the indoor pool, and I took my shower and used this on my face.  </li>
            <li>and so when the opportunity presented itself to try something new that may help me prevent damage to my skin from the sun, I took it thinking this may be it.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and wanted a moisturizer for my face that I could use every day.</li>
            <li>We live in S Arizona.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (</li>
            <li>It is a thick lotion (still thinner than a cream) and you do need to apply it evenly and massage it until it absorbs completely--it takes maybe a little more effort than a thinner lotion, but not that much more.</li>
            <li>Ofcourse it does look white when u first apply it, But it vanishes and keeps the face well moisturized.    </li>
            <li>As a caramel complected person I was in dire need of  a facial moisturizer with a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>I swear that even the fine lines look less visible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not meant to sit on top of the skin, so work it in if it seems slick</li>
            <li>The fact that it is both sun block and moisturizer in one means I&#x27;m not overwhelming my skin with too many products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for rosacea and eczema; I tried many different moisturizers over the years and most of them would make my red skin get worse; this has been the only product that really helps and protects from the sun as well.</li>
            <li>As an active mother who lives on the shore we&#x27;re frequently out in the sun, and I&#x27;m always on the look out for a product with high SPF that won&#x27;t cause breakouts or make me super greasy.</li>
            <li>If you have very pale skin it might not be so noticeable, and you might need the ultra-high SPF more.</li>
            <li>part I liked least actually was the fact that my skin never regained its normal color after applying this.  </li>
            <li>So moral of story, sample something before you buy large quantities of it because you never know how your skin will react.</li>
            <li>thing I did notice is that while it does give me a longer window before sensitive skin breaks out, I do need to get this off my face as soon as I don&#x27;t want the sun protection anymore.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I takes a considerable effort to rub it into the skin as its consistency is quite tick.</li>
            <li>, the above two points don&#x27;t really matter to me when I know I am going out in the sun</li>
            <li>No breakouts with my breakout-prone and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>(they are really sensitive and you should never put any product that is not specifically designed for that area on them.)  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy on my neck at all.  </li>
            <li>50 has got you well protected and the moisturizes keep it baby soft.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll reserve this for days at the beach or playing in the yard and stick with my Olay Complete SPF 30 for under makeup.</li>
            <li>This one promised to be noncomedogenic and so far – no breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I started using Cetaphil 50</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many more expensive high-SPF daily moisturizers, but I always come back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my skin all the time--in fact, the sandwich maker at Subway today didn&#x27;t believe me when I told her how old I am.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and spend a lot of time outdoors, gardening &amp; landscaping.</li>
            <li>So she gave me a sample of Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunblock with Helioplex and it works really well for me and no break outs.  </li>
            <li>I read about it in &amp;#34;The Complete Beauty Bible&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Again, once it is rubbed in completely, the sheen goes away as well.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels soft after use</li>
            <li>It is light enough that I don&#x27;t mind wearing everyday, which I should, but so many products annoy me after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>My face has left with a white look and even after 15 or 20 minutes after application it hadn&#x27;t completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>It has kept those brown spots from getting worse, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have problems with the pigment, as some reviewers said, because I have pale skin, but I would definitely not recommend using this on your face or for anything more than sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Being a fan of Cetaphil&#x27;s various face washes and lotions I was excited to see their recent introduction of a SPF 50 facial sunscreen product.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a gray sheen that is very strange and funny looking.  </li>
            <li>This is basically sunscreen (not moisturizer with a little bit of sun protection), smells so strong and the SPF makes your skin super pale and chalky.</li>
            <li>It also is a little white when first applied but that too goes away once it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself isn&#x27;t super thick, more like a plain sunscreen feels, but a small dab covers my face and neck easily.</li>
            <li>when more is not better, or even necessary.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer after getting a mild facial sunburn.</li>
            <li>My skin type is combination skin and sensitive, and when added to the humid weather in my country, I tend to have pretty active breakouts.</li>
            <li>With a little experimenting it appears that two squirts (half as much as originally suggested) and applying it more carefully gives me the same protection.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other sun protectors that keep off that much sun, this isn&#x27;t thick and pasty.  </li>
            <li>but since I have dry skin I end up absorbing it after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li>It has the typical white semi-powdery residue of all sunscreens, but is much less oily, which I liked.  </li>
            <li>I recently started using Cetaphils facial cleanser and lotions and really like them</li>
            <li>but I would not depend on this product for broad spectrum UVA/UVB sun</li>
            <li>Yeah, while applying it, it was super white and thick, but I just kept gently massaging it in.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning on using a moisturizer under makeup, I&#x27;m not certain this would be your first bet, but this is designed for outdoor use (SPF 50), and most ladies who spend lots of time outdoors have forsaken makeup while out there, as the need to apply sunscreen and bug spray would waste your efforts anyway, as would water from your swimming or just plain old perspiration.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the Cetaphil products are generally produced with skin sensitivity in mind.  </li>
            <li>so I intend to use the same on my 4 month old too.    </li>
            <li>I use it on bare skin in the morning and then put on my concealer, no foundation.</li>
            <li>I ended up with the old standby Pevonia sunscreen, which is moisturizing, but only SPF 15.    </li>
            <li>Cetaphil offers this product as a facial moisturizer with SPF 50 sun block.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with this product irritating my skin--which I tend to have happen with many others---</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s not: Pretty much everything else.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and I am always looking to try new moisturizers to see how well they moisturize.</li>
            <li>I like the Cetaphil moisturizer as a daily use product in such circumstances as it is not greasy at all and offers protection for my face.      </li>
            <li>so you will get that milky sweat dripping down your cheek if conditions are hot enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that the resultant shininess was due to my simply using too much.</li>
            <li>The Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer did much to soothe and partially protect my sunburned face.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more from this sunscreen, but it&#x27;s like any other: thick and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am in my late 30s and my skin can easily look dry these days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The moisturizer is thick and tends to stay on the surface of the skin rather than being absorbed quickly; while it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb as quickly as other products I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;m not entirely certain</li>
            <li>Nurse at dermatologist&#x27;s office said to use high SPF due to laser treatments.  </li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW (also read my update below): My only disappointment was that it even though it is absorbed quickly, it left the skin shiny.</li>
            <li>I normally use Anthelios Fluide Extreme sunscreen but tried this one because I had a coupon</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin incredibly smooth, but takes a little while to absorb and can leave me looking a little dewy.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This Cetaphil lotion is perfect because it provides the sun defense (SPF 50)</li>
            <li> Thus, it&#x27;s not the best product to use by those wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> I have already started using this product and what I noticed best</li>
            <li> and it does a superb job.  </li>
            <li> A great product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Cetaphil came out with this product because I&#x27;m usually very happy with their stuff.  </li>
            <li> Great!  </li>
            <li> This is definetely on of the best sunblock lotions I have tried.</li>

            <li> Just perfect!</li>
            <li> I was using the Purpose brand....which had a SPF of 15 but was awesome otherwise.</li>
            <li> If these cosmetic trifles do not concern you, however, then this product is superb (provided that you are not sweating profusely or swimming in the ocean, etc.).</li>
            <li> Perfect for California weather.</li>
            <li> Perfect for oily acne prone skin.</li>

            <li> very good for my son.</li>
            <li> very good</li>
            <li> Excellent protection against the sun, and good moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> but people say I have beautiful dewy skin.</li>
            <li> I realize 50 spf is great coverage.     </li>
            <li> I always mix foundation with moisturizer and this is a great way to incorporate spf with my make up and not hurt my skin.    </li>
            <li> In the summertime it is a great aunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> A great product for summer</li>
            <li> Plus, my make-up goes on great over this face lotion.</li>
            <li> Great for every use.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is great.  </li>
            <li> Great Product, great protection for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have to order on line and am happy about that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I should point out that this product feels great as a moisturizer on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product may work great for you</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> I have found that it works great and will continue to use it on her.</li>
            <li> I will keep on buying this great product.</li>
            <li> It also has a great Spf of 50, which is what I need for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and I will keep using it for the excellent protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> Very good product, Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it during my hour-long runs in bright sunlight.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s good: It works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SPF 50 and does a good job protecting the skin from the sun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it does prevent sun damage, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, so maybe this wouldn&#x27;t work for darker skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I apply it after applying my aftershave lotion and am good for the day.</li>
            <li> So, this is a winner, and I&#x27;m always thrilled to be happy with drugstore-priced stuff.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to find a spf 50 moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for a purse/makeup bag and the pump is just right.</li>
            <li> My love for Cetaphil products continues!</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> However, if they may have colored lotion, it would be even better!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Great and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has no order and goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> However, it does moisturize my face nicely and I can wear makeup over the sunblock, it doesn&#x27;t cause a break</li>
            <li> I liked that this sunscreen/moisturizer absorbs so nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li> Now knowing the &amp;#34;disappointment&amp;#34; was my own doing</li>
            <li> What a nice way to protect my face from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.</li>
            <li> Just need to keep blotting tissues handy.  </li>
            <li> Nice feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this gives good sun protection, and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out at all</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and then I don&#x27;t feel anything afterwards, which is very nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good sunscreen product, and very straight forward.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and thoroughly and provideds great protection.</li>
            <li> Usually I love the smell of sunscreens, but this had some kind of additive I suspect</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a good brand, and i&#x27;m sure this sunscreen is great, but on people of color or darker complected people it doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion with sunblock I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> after all looking good is the primary concern.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s suitable for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin and the SPF</li>
            <li> I noticed greater sun protection with this product; it&#x27;s nice to have the sunscreen included in the moisturizer</li>
            <li> It does a great job of protecting you from the sun and it is very much not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It works great and protects my skin very well!</li>
            <li> It has a very light fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  </li>
            <li> It feels very light on my skin and it´s not grease.</li>
            <li> She is very light complected</li>
            <li> This is a very mild product and does not irritate my skin and effectively moisturizes it.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair plus I am taking a medication that makes me even more sensitive to burning.  </li>
            <li> the more you add, the more rubbing away the chalky film you&#x27;ll have to do.  </li>
            <li> I need it more than she anyway.</li>
            <li> We love the Cetaphil products and have used the soaps and lotions for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li> B001E96NKC Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, SPF-15, 1.4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]] or</li>
            <li> This is essentially the best skin care product that I have received from vine.    </li>
            <li> I use it on my face, chest and top of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love that the scent is</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I have it.  </li>
            <li> This one is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it I have to put powder on top of it to get rid of the shine.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I love love this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema, and most sunscreens either trigger a flare up or burn her skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> sun protection is ok but</li>
            <li> It is nice that it is more than sunscreen, as it is a moisturizing product along with providing the highest SPF available.  </li>
            <li> However, the sunscreen in this moisturizer will not prevent the need to reapply more product every two hours if you are exposing your skin to the sun continuously or for more than 10 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li> Based on results the next day I will say that this lotion is superb at protecting skin from the sun.  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a stickler for sunscreens and have worn an SPF 30 or more since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, for a moisturizer with an SPF 50, it has a nice light weight slippery texture.</li>
            <li> most things sting my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin tends to flake and peel a lot in the winter, mostly because I use a retinol product, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy but my skin glows more than I prefer--I don&#x27;t always like that</li>
            <li> I sometimes mix a dab of foundation with it and pat that on as a top layer to reduce the whiteness and even out my skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> And the price is somewhat satisfied</li>
            <li> Also many doctors recommend using Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> but there may be better products out there.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and feel confident I&#x27;m being protected from the sun with the 50 SPF.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years as I am have eczema</li>
            <li> Simply put, this sunscreen and moisturizer is the best product of its type that I have used.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This penetrates very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The SPF is obviously great, as are the physical-blocking ingredients, but the moisturizing action is much too great and if you have oil-prone skin</li>
            <li> Very good one product remedy for those who will be exposed to sun for more than just brief periods.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for all out there who have a dry skin problem.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and it is available at your local pharrmacy.  </li>
            <li> It works great on my sensitive skin and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is great sun protection, I guess, but doesn&#x27;t meet my needs as far as being a sunscreen I can wear under makeup.</li>
            <li> this sunscreen misses the mark in terms of being an ideal facial sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil does a great job, my face feels soft and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I like the way it&#x27;s bottled and pumps easily.</li>
            <li> It is easily applied, and protected me all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It protects well, and despite not having any \\&quot;sport\\&quot; designation, it doesn&#x27;t seem to easily wear off from perspiration.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than brands at the makeup counters, and I honestly think it&#x27;s a better product.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to work it into your face and leaves a fine film</li>
            <li> It works just fine for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> If I blot it, it is fine.  </li>
            <li> This goes on smooth, and has no headache producing strong scent, but it does leave a shine, even under foundation.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Cetaphil products.  </li>
            <li> In the summer I up the ante and add a moisturizer with an SPF of 50, a huge sunhat that also has an SPF of 50, and prescription polarized sunglasses.</li>
            <li> It is great to use on days when I am going to be outside.  </li>
            <li> Odor free and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and when I am wearing it, I do feel protected from the sun</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Non-comedogenic, Non-greasy, Fragrance free from the #1 dermatologist recommended brand\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> It is fragence free, so your husband or kids can use it without worrying about a sunscreen or beachy smell.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on my face smoothly and feels so light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  light and non greasy.  </li>
            <li> It was great for the summer months but in the dryer winter weather it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous.  </li>
            <li> One way is to use chemicals that absorb the UV light before it hits your skin.  </li>
            <li> The Cetaphil goes on light and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and, because I have brown spots in several places, I always use this to cover those before I go out and work in the yard.</li>
            <li> and I like the non oil feeling and the smooth of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any white residue and my makeup goes on great.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there is a LIGHT smell, once you rub it in, it goes away.  </li>
            <li> This is a great combination product - moisturizer and sunscreen (SPF-50) for daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Cetaphil can come out with a better face sunscreen than this and look forward to their new and improved formula.</li>
            <li> SPF is so helpful and the quality is just amazing since i live in Dubai and it still leaves my skin moist but not oily.</li>
            <li> My skin is horribly dry and this feels great going on but it feels a tad greasy after an hour or two.  </li>
            <li> liked this product because it was unscented, seemed to do the job of moisturizing my skin while I fooled around in the yard, and it wasn&#x27;t greasy like many similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer, there is nothing special about this.  </li>
            <li> but I think that on someone else, the whiteness could stand out and not look right!</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens are a bit too greasy to use as lotion (plus they don&#x27;t really serve that purpose).</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, without an oily feeling and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> It provides good sun protection and daily use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin; I&#x27;ve used it daily with good results.  </li>
            <li> I spend extra time working it into my (somewhat fair) skin</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and also have allergic reactions to some facial products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> True, SPF 50 is better than say SPF30, but the regular sport-spray lotions are much better on my eyes than this</li>
            <li> I liked the look, it wasn&#x27;t what I would call shiny or greasy at first but actually gave me a healthy looking glow under my foundation, that lasted maybe an hour</li>
            <li> I use this with other face products and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit more \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and leaves a bit more residue on the face than standard moisturizer -</li>
            <li> Instead of a flip top, mine has a mini-pump top, which I actually prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rubs</li>
            <li> As with most Cetaphil products, the price is high.  </li>
            <li> Living in the Southwest, I make sure to moisturize with a high spf.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a high SPF.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great innovation, particularly for those sensitive areas around the mouth and eyes where chemicals could cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Exactly the moisturizer I was looking for.. Very light weight, and high spf!</li>
            <li> flip top seems like it would be a nice little item to carry in a purse, and the lack of chemicals make it suitable for even very young children.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a very minor tradeoff for a good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Normally it is just clean skin, a light moisturizer, and me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, never clogs my pores, and really protects.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth using.</li>
            <li> She liked the product and reported that it applied smoothly, was not greasy, had minimal odor, and didn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great option, especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is worth trying no matter your skin type, and I will use this product again.</li>
            <li> I developed an itching reaction to most sunblocks;&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> So far it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried for blocking the sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it works as good as i expected.</li>
            <li> I put it on every single day and am very pleased that I am protected from the sun.</li>
            <li> But I put it on right when I get out of the shower, before I eat breakfast.  </li>
            <li> What is lacking is the claim of broad spectrum UVA/UVB sun protection that most sunscreen products advertise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll fly to Miami for a day or two, and if I don&#x27;t use a sunscreen my face will get that reddish appearance (not a healthy tan, a reddish appearance).  </li>
            <li> The tube is small in size so it is easy to carry and the pump on top works fine and eliminates spillage.</li>
            <li> You certainly can&#x27;t use this as moisturizer alone, it should be thought of as a sunscreen with some mild moisturizing properties to it.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it for 50 and up year old women and men.</li>
            <li> very, very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, too.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes really well and has sunscreen to boot!  </li>
            <li> Considering all of the top notch SPF moisturizers on the market, we may opt for alternatives in the future (like the retinol-based [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Also because its summer and I am doing a transatlantic trip to Asia which is really really hot now.    </li>
            <li> face feels baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It exactly what it claims to be: SPF 50, non-greasy, and NO FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it protects from the sun, but i dont wanna walk around looking ashy and greasy at the same time, and putting makeup or face powder over</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may not be for everyone, and you may prefer to use it as a face appropriate sunblock, but I would use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes when there is a higher (like more than 15 SPF) sunscreen in a lotion, it sort of just sits on the surface of my face and makes my subsequent makeup application smeary.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected since it is needs to leave some kind of layer on the skin in order to protect.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my skin and people constantly ask me what I use.</li>
            <li> This the first thing I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> all!&lt;br /&gt;The lotion moisturizes really well, and is quickly absorbed into in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I have to blot my face once during the day if it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
            <li> and I am on the first tube.</li>
            <li> No creepy smell</li>
            <li> but I LOVE it for daily wear.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this product.</li>
            <li> I was really bummed because I brought a two pack from Amazon on it!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well with sun light</li>
            <li> i prefer the higher spf rating.  </li>
            <li> So good, in fact, that I&#x27;ll look for another Cetaphil moisturizer (without SPF 50) for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I had began talking walks around high noon in the sun and started to tan quickly.</li>
            <li> Having spent the better part of three years looking for a suitable suncream which would protect AND moisturize, I ended up last summer with MD Skincare&#x27;s orange bottle SPF 30.  </li>
            <li> I also love the small size tube can fit right in your pocketbook or pocket--easy to carry for days outdoors.  </li>
            <li> Using a regular sunscreen and then using a good moisturizer after being outside would be preferable both in regards to cost and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m writing a review as the first one didn&#x27;t get posted up.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this moisturizer as CETAPHIL is a reputable company with quality products, but this moisturizer is just TERRIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think consistently wearing SPF is a part of that, but Cetaphil is really moisturizing as well, so I&#x27;m not using 2 separate products to get moisture or layering products on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I saw this product and saw it had a SF 50 rating I didn&#x27;t quite believe it could be any good, because I&#x27;ve tried an SPF 30 in the past and it was almost like paint.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for good sun protection.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and this moisturizes enough with great SPF coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am currently using acne medication and needed a strong sunblock to wear during the day.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is labeled as fragrance free, which I interpret as not having any masking fragrance since there is a slight familiar \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; odor.      </li>
            <li> Also, it may smell like sunscreen on your face if you don&#x27;t really work it in.  </li>
            <li> price is a bit up there, but so is the SPF, and it&#x27;s meant just for the face, not your whole body.</li>
            <li> This product has so much sunscreen in it that I cannot use it as moisturizer - when applied, it made my skin sting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cautious to the types of</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is know to be gentle on skin</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> , it feels greasy and my skin is very shiny and oily looking after I put the product on.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely light skin and must wear a daily sunscreen on my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen looks ashey on the skin, and is very shiny.</li>
            <li> The lotion is VERY hydrating</li>
            <li> The following are the product claims:        \\&quot;This light, non greasy moisturizer nourishes and hydrates your skin while also protecting it from</li>
            <li> Please, when you send the product, include the respective invoice over the package, because is too important to get out the merchandise.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, and moisturizes the skin, almost like standard Cetaphil lotions.  </li>
            <li> If SPF is too much for you, try the lower SPF option.</li>
            <li> It has an impressive amount of effective sunscreen ingredients in a standard lotion base.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, but does smell a tad like sunsblock.&lt;br /&gt;SPF</li>
            <li> It seems to help, I like the way it my skin feel very moist after using it.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using it up on my neck and arms where I didn&#x27;t care as much.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this sunscreen, but it&#x27;s too shiny.  </li>
            <li> Really like the packaging.</li>
            <li> Somehow, someway Celaphil found a way to make SPF 50 non-greasy, light weight and with no filmy white residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product can be applied above cheekbones and even on eyelids lightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care junkie, and I remember Paula Begoun in the &#x27;90s talking about how Cetaphil cleanser was all a person really needed.  </li>
            <li> So, periodically I would use Cetaphil stuff (on travel, at my mom&#x27;s house, whatever), but on the whole this was not a brand I&#x27;d choose except in a pinch.    </li>
            <li> I tried it under my eyes before working in the yard, and it worked very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to keep mine in the glove compartment of my car for those times when it is really sunny</li>
            <li> It is better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m done with breakfast and ready to put on my makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY greasy.</li>
            <li> I chose Cetaphil because of it&#x27;s gentle reputation.  </li>
            <li> Very  moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Like most Cetaphil products you really don&#x27;t have to worry about having your skin dry out as a result of product use, however, aside from the &#x27;hydrating&#x27; factor and decent SPF protection</li>
            <li> However, even though it&#x27;s a nice facial moisturizer, I would not use it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> When I wasn&#x27;t on my cream though, it made my face feel kinda greasy, but other than that, it worked just fine!</li>
            <li> The other way is to use a physical barrier to the light, which is why there are so many lifeguards with painted noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, I am always interested in new moisturizing products that have sunscreens.    </li>
            <li> This is not a big deal when I am off in the yard and completely alone, but not so good when I am out with people.&lt;br /&gt;While this product offers protection and does a good job moisturizing, I&#x27;m not pleased with the white residue.</li>
            <li> Since so many of Cetaphil&#x27;s other products work well with her skin, we thought we&#x27;d try their sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> it is better than other defense moisturizer i have used before.</li>
            <li> Spending a few more minutes rubbing it into the skin also help reduce the shininess I observed when I first began using this product.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to see such a high SPF from them for the face.     </li>
            <li> so be sure to only add a tiny bit for your WHOLE face--</li>
            <li> starters I experimented with this product on a recent weekend outing to Palm Springs where I played 18 holes of mid-morning golf in full sunlight (and no hat) with temperatures hovering in the mid-80&#x27;s range.</li>
            <li> There are very few products that are effective for both UVB and UVA.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those who want to protect their skin from those harmful rays.</li>
            <li> As a sunblock, you probably should use a little bit more, but it never feels greasy on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:</li>
            <li> but I find it a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, too bad</li>
            <li> After application you can apply your make up as you normally would.</li>
            <li> If you have normal to oily skin, this may feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> face is oily and my neck is normal.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have normally oily skin.</li>
            <li> If you let your beard grow out a few days, it does cling to the hair and takes a bit more work to rub in.</li>
            <li> I know it works because my cheeks will look very red after using other products that either don&#x27;t last in the water or don&#x27;t feel good going</li>
            <li> When the Cetaphil sunscreen arrived I tested it right away - we&#x27;d just come back from the indoor pool, and I took my shower and used this on my face.  </li>
            <li> and so when the opportunity presented itself to try something new that may help me prevent damage to my skin from the sun, I took it thinking this may be it.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and wanted a moisturizer for my face that I could use every day.</li>
            <li> We live in S Arizona.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (</li>
            <li> It is a thick lotion (still thinner than a cream) and you do need to apply it evenly and massage it until it absorbs completely--it takes maybe a little more effort than a thinner lotion, but not that much more.</li>
            <li> Ofcourse it does look white when u first apply it, But it vanishes and keeps the face well moisturized.    </li>
            <li> As a caramel complected person I was in dire need of  a facial moisturizer with a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> I swear that even the fine lines look less visible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not meant to sit on top of the skin, so work it in if it seems slick</li>
            <li> The fact that it is both sun block and moisturizer in one means I&#x27;m not overwhelming my skin with too many products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for rosacea and eczema; I tried many different moisturizers over the years and most of them would make my red skin get worse; this has been the only product that really helps and protects from the sun as well.</li>
            <li> As an active mother who lives on the shore we&#x27;re frequently out in the sun, and I&#x27;m always on the look out for a product with high SPF that won&#x27;t cause breakouts or make me super greasy.</li>
            <li> If you have very pale skin it might not be so noticeable, and you might need the ultra-high SPF more.</li>
            <li> part I liked least actually was the fact that my skin never regained its normal color after applying this.  </li>
            <li> So moral of story, sample something before you buy large quantities of it because you never know how your skin will react.</li>
            <li> thing I did notice is that while it does give me a longer window before sensitive skin breaks out, I do need to get this off my face as soon as I don&#x27;t want the sun protection anymore.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I takes a considerable effort to rub it into the skin as its consistency is quite tick.</li>
            <li> , the above two points don&#x27;t really matter to me when I know I am going out in the sun</li>
            <li> No breakouts with my breakout-prone and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> (they are really sensitive and you should never put any product that is not specifically designed for that area on them.)  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy on my neck at all.  </li>
            <li> 50 has got you well protected and the moisturizes keep it baby soft.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll reserve this for days at the beach or playing in the yard and stick with my Olay Complete SPF 30 for under makeup.</li>
            <li> This one promised to be noncomedogenic and so far – no breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I started using Cetaphil 50</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many more expensive high-SPF daily moisturizers, but I always come back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my skin all the time--in fact, the sandwich maker at Subway today didn&#x27;t believe me when I told her how old I am.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and spend a lot of time outdoors, gardening &amp; landscaping.</li>
            <li> So she gave me a sample of Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunblock with Helioplex and it works really well for me and no break outs.  </li>
            <li> I read about it in &amp;#34;The Complete Beauty Bible&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Again, once it is rubbed in completely, the sheen goes away as well.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels soft after use</li>
            <li> It is light enough that I don&#x27;t mind wearing everyday, which I should, but so many products annoy me after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My face has left with a white look and even after 15 or 20 minutes after application it hadn&#x27;t completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> It has kept those brown spots from getting worse, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have problems with the pigment, as some reviewers said, because I have pale skin, but I would definitely not recommend using this on your face or for anything more than sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of Cetaphil&#x27;s various face washes and lotions I was excited to see their recent introduction of a SPF 50 facial sunscreen product.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a gray sheen that is very strange and funny looking.  </li>
            <li> This is basically sunscreen (not moisturizer with a little bit of sun protection), smells so strong and the SPF makes your skin super pale and chalky.</li>
            <li> It also is a little white when first applied but that too goes away once it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself isn&#x27;t super thick, more like a plain sunscreen feels, but a small dab covers my face and neck easily.</li>
            <li> when more is not better, or even necessary.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer after getting a mild facial sunburn.</li>
            <li> My skin type is combination skin and sensitive, and when added to the humid weather in my country, I tend to have pretty active breakouts.</li>
            <li> With a little experimenting it appears that two squirts (half as much as originally suggested) and applying it more carefully gives me the same protection.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other sun protectors that keep off that much sun, this isn&#x27;t thick and pasty.  </li>
            <li> but since I have dry skin I end up absorbing it after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> It has the typical white semi-powdery residue of all sunscreens, but is much less oily, which I liked.  </li>
            <li> I recently started using Cetaphils facial cleanser and lotions and really like them</li>
            <li> but I would not depend on this product for broad spectrum UVA/UVB sun</li>
            <li> Yeah, while applying it, it was super white and thick, but I just kept gently massaging it in.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning on using a moisturizer under makeup, I&#x27;m not certain this would be your first bet, but this is designed for outdoor use (SPF 50), and most ladies who spend lots of time outdoors have forsaken makeup while out there, as the need to apply sunscreen and bug spray would waste your efforts anyway, as would water from your swimming or just plain old perspiration.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the Cetaphil products are generally produced with skin sensitivity in mind.  </li>
            <li> so I intend to use the same on my 4 month old too.    </li>
            <li> I use it on bare skin in the morning and then put on my concealer, no foundation.</li>
            <li> I ended up with the old standby Pevonia sunscreen, which is moisturizing, but only SPF 15.    </li>
            <li> Cetaphil offers this product as a facial moisturizer with SPF 50 sun block.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with this product irritating my skin--which I tend to have happen with many others---</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s not: Pretty much everything else.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and I am always looking to try new moisturizers to see how well they moisturize.</li>
            <li> I like the Cetaphil moisturizer as a daily use product in such circumstances as it is not greasy at all and offers protection for my face.      </li>
            <li> so you will get that milky sweat dripping down your cheek if conditions are hot enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that the resultant shininess was due to my simply using too much.</li>
            <li> The Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer did much to soothe and partially protect my sunburned face.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more from this sunscreen, but it&#x27;s like any other: thick and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s and my skin can easily look dry these days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The moisturizer is thick and tends to stay on the surface of the skin rather than being absorbed quickly; while it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb as quickly as other products I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;m not entirely certain</li>
            <li> Nurse at dermatologist&#x27;s office said to use high SPF due to laser treatments.  </li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW (also read my update below): My only disappointment was that it even though it is absorbed quickly, it left the skin shiny.</li>
            <li> I normally use Anthelios Fluide Extreme sunscreen but tried this one because I had a coupon</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin incredibly smooth, but takes a little while to absorb and can leave me looking a little dewy.</li>
            <li> That is the secret behind the sun defense powers in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream went on very nicely, and without a lot of scent (it says it is unscented, but it smells like standard issue hand lotion to me).  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to use 2 oz for full coverage, but even less than that leaves a blue-white tint to my pale white face.</li>
            <li> So if I&#x27;m going to be outside for an extended period of time, I may just gauge how at risk I really am for sunburn, and take alternative precautions as well, such as a ball cap, spend some of that time outside in shady areas or under a shelter, etc.</li>
            <li> It left me very shiny, and seems to highlight even small wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trick is learn how much you need (which turns-out to be very little) to protect your face and ears.</li>
            <li> tiny bit goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> , even though this looks like a teeny tiny container, it lasts for a long time because it&#x27;s so concentrated.</li>
            <li> This is not a broad spectrum sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Ive been  complimented on my new &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; a few times and am also protected from UVB / UVA rays</li>
            <li> I keep a tube in my bag at all times for those extra sunny or dry days.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had the same experience with it and she has dry skin.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil products in the past (a big fan of their soaps and body washes), but I have to say I&#x27;m not surprised that the majority of the reviews for this particular product hover around the 3 to 4 star range.  </li>
            <li> It is worth a try if you don&#x27;t like heavily fragranced items or heavy creams on your face.</li>
            <li> im highly sensitive and found this to be one of the few products that don&#x27;t irritate I would recommend it</li>
            <li> and limit how long I keep this on my face.</li>
            <li> That is too long for me.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t had any flare-ups and it didn&#x27;t burn, even when we used it on a patch of rough skin that is still healing from her last flare up.    </li>
            <li> I feel sun protect all day long.</li>
            <li> Only downside is amt of zinc oxide in it that gives one a pasty look until it sinks in.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal but completely unacceptable to me.  </li>
            <li> I like that this sunblock is a tiny bit white because it helps tone down the redness in my skin from the medications.  </li>
            <li> I can use other daily moisturizers with sunscreen that don&#x27;t leave quite a shine on my face.</li>
            <li> I work for CBS, NBC, Fox, and other TV networks - outside!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but after a short while the roseacea flares up.</li>
            <li> I hardly feel it on my face while it is really not too much on the face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It says it is fragrance free which must mean no additional scents are added, but it does smell a little bit like typical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> Without that this moisturizer works well to soothe dry skin</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer I feel it is only average.        </li>
            <li> The reason is that it feels just a little heavy on my face, but it does have a high SPF.</li>
            <li> Also, as some reviewers noted, it does leave a thin white film, as all lotions with a high SPF tend to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting regular hand lotion on your face, although a bit less moisturizing.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently sunscreens started appearing that have the same titanium dioxide paint, but with such a small particle size that it can be rubbed into the skin and not show.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I suggest mixing it 1/2-1/2 with your regular moisturizer, as a little goes a long way!!  </li>
            <li> I dab a little dot on each finger, distribute on my face, and that&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> My only critism is that it is a little heavy, so you have to spend some time rubbing it in, else you will look like you have a white face paint on.</li>
            <li> The cetaphil is expensive but a little goes a long way, however it also left me with quite a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides, I&#x27;m a bit uncomfortable with chemicals being absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will update the same after my trip in few weeks time.    </li>
            <li> After a few days I realized, the irritation was similar to when you use sunscreen and when you sweat it gets in on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands (no exaggeration) on face creams at department stores.</li>
            <li> Read the label carefully.  </li>
            <li> They used to be for $2 off, but the last few boxes had a $4 off coupon- for ANY Cetaphil product.</li>
            <li> Overall I found that the sunscreen lasted a long time and did rub in well initially, but for active people if you sweat and it gets in your eyes, prepare for serious burning and irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so keep that in mind when dispensing the lotion.</li>
            <li> Nor did it leave a white-color residue after drying - contrary to what some other reviewers reported.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping that it would provide the sun blocking effects I need without the annoyances of other products like stinging eyes, rub-off, white-face, pore-clogging, etc.  </li>
            <li> My face was extremely greasy and chalky looking all day from this.</li>
            <li> So even though the tube is small, it will last for awhile.  </li>
            <li> Also, unlike other facial screens that I&#x27;ve used in the past this cream does tend to feel a bit greasy (as opposed to blending into your skin) and will leave a noticeable sheen.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommended cetaphil with SPF and since then I have never switched to any other product.</li>
            <li> I need spf 50 but all other sunscreens, even when applied below cheekbones, irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite heavy and white-appearing on the face, especially for those with a little bit of existing coloration.</li>
            <li> This is somewhat heavy on my face, but not surprisingly so, given the high degree of protection.  </li>
            <li> It claims to be fragrance-free, that might be true, but it certainly smells awful.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, a small pearl size drop goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Sadly this product isn&#x27;t my holy grail, I&#x27;d really like something I can use on a day to day basis under my makeup (mineral foundation).</li>
            <li> This stuff will work beautifully so long as you&#x27;re not on a harsh medicine like me!</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is thick, uncolored, and unscented.</li>
            <li> In your hand it feels like a medium thick lotion, on you face initially</li>
            <li> The product is a thick white liquid.  </li>
            <li> product is thick in texture, but still somewhat runny, very white, and a bit greasy-feeling (despite what the label says).  </li>
            <li> There are no strong odors and absolutely no stinging.</li>
            <li> Regarding fragrance-free:  although I don&#x27;t think there are any perfumes in the product, it still does have a slight fragrance (which I notice), although much less than a typical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I tried to use less but was still too oily for me.</li>
            <li> have darker skin, so this lotion also leaves me with a slight whitish haze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> over spf 30 or less</li>
            <li> and then I was just a shiny greasy looking mess and had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Very little odor, and certainly  no perfumes.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that I have random white patches all over my face no matter how much I attempt to smooth out my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy</li>
            <li> use the tiniest little bit as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It leaves a little sheen as well</li>
            <li> A little greasy</li>
            <li> matter how much or little I put on this stuff</li>
            <li> It does leave a white cast behind which I also try to hide with powder or makeup.</li>
            <li> This is not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> But if you massage it well this film becomes imperceptible.</li>
            <li> If I use this on my skin after the medications it does burn parts of my face for a few minutes then goes away.  </li>
            <li> I have had some small allergic reactions to other sunscreens, I am not sure what ingredient or additive is the culprit, but haven&#x27;t had trouble with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell a little like sunscreen, but hello, SPF 50!</li>
            <li> and I was out of my usual sunscreen.   </li>
            <li> Sunscreen and face usual equals breakouts.</li>
            <li> No overwhelming smell at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Cetaphil has the reputation it does, as every product I&#x27;ve tried of theirs I notice it&#x27;s too greasy and leaves me oily and prone to break-out.  </li>
            <li> When I started using this, I would break out in a 2-3 small pimples on my face and one on my chest where I used it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little irritating to see my face in the mirror a couple hours after I apply the lotion and see how moist and greasy my face looks.  </li>
            <li> My skin has a medium-bronzey-orangey tone, and my face is a little darker than the rest of my skin for some reason, so the white residue isn&#x27;t really bad or noticeable --</li>
            <li> It does the job of screening from the sun as far as I can tell, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but the shine is really bad.  </li>
            <li> Then I heard that people of color should use an SPF of at least 30</li>
            <li> Only protects against sunburn , not damaging and dangerous UVA rays.  </li>
            <li> have roseacea--and it helps keep the redness down--at least it doesn&#x27;t trigger it like others can.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an issue that it&#x27;s too thick to to be worn under makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I found it extremely thick and with a rather off-putting scent.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s thick, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or filmy.  </li>
            <li> The built-in pump meters-out very small amounts.</li>
            <li> Beauty is not easy!!</li>
            <li> , the product makes me, a very pale person, even paler!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not good under makeup</li>
            <li> I did use it as a sunscreen on my neck and chest, and it was inoffensive in that application, if gluey.</li>
            <li> it is even worse.</li>
            <li> But I fall for the hype of a lot of skin care companies and was never really happy with the drying nature of Cetaphil cleanser.   </li>
            <li> I use moisturizing lotion on my face almost every day but hardly ever use sunblock, though reports say we all should be these days to protect from all the bad UV rays.</li>
            <li> Just downsized from 5 stars to 4 stars: It&#x27;s too expensive for the use that you get for it.</li>
            <li> So that is why I say it fails as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is extremely expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I talked to my dermatologist and asked if there was something wrong with my skin because I was getting pimples from something that I thought was non-comedogenic.  </li>
            <li> sunscreen part is awful, it leaves a white film residue</li>
            <li> Very expensive for just over one ounce of product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a bad thing.</li>
            <li> The one really bad thing about this product is that by midday, my eyes were irritated.  </li>
            <li> They are shocked when I tell them.</li>
            <li> But now I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I mix it together with the sun screen and a base primer on the face</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going to hate this product.</li>
            <li> The price for what you get is simply outrageous.  </li>
            <li> This cream is the worst face sunscreen I have ever tried!    </li>
            <li> It leaves a whitish tinge to the face for hours after applying, and yes, I do rub it in thoroughly, but the worst is how greasy and shiny it made my face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This moisturizes really well and has sunscreen to boot!  Only complaints would be that it may leave a chalky film on your face if you don&#x27;t work the product in well enough.  A little goes a long way so be sure to only add a tiny bit for your WHOLE face--the more you add, the more rubbing away the chalky film you&#x27;ll have to do.  Also, it may smell like sunscreen on your face if you don&#x27;t really work it in.  I like how it makes my skin feel and appreciate the protection from the sun.  I keep a tube in my bag at all times for those extra sunny or dry days.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to find a spf 50 moisturizer.  It is great to use on days when I am going to be outside.  I like the fact that it has no order and goes on nicely.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> im highly sensitive and found this to be one of the few products that don&#x27;t irritate I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I use moisturizing lotion on my face almost every day but hardly ever use sunblock, though reports say we all should be these days to protect from all the bad UV rays. This Cetaphil lotion is perfect because it provides the sun defense (SPF 50) that I&#x27;m looking for while also acting as a facial moisturizer whether I&#x27;m going out in the sun or not. Most sunscreens are a bit too greasy to use as lotion (plus they don&#x27;t really serve that purpose). This stuff works as both. Definitely worth using.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is thick, uncolored, and unscented. It avoids the problems that cause a lot of sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is thick and tends to stay on the surface of the skin rather than being absorbed quickly; while it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb as quickly as other products I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;m not entirely certain that&#x27;s a bad thing. If you&#x27;re planning on using a moisturizer under makeup, I&#x27;m not certain this would be your first bet, but this is designed for outdoor use (SPF 50), and most ladies who spend lots of time outdoors have forsaken makeup while out there, as the need to apply sunscreen and bug spray would waste your efforts anyway, as would water from your swimming or just plain old perspiration. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an issue that it&#x27;s too thick to to be worn under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, I&#x27;m a bit uncomfortable with chemicals being absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice is that while it does give me a longer window before sensitive skin breaks out, I do need to get this off my face as soon as I don&#x27;t want the sun protection anymore. Left on for extended periods, it did cause my face to break out, just like everything else does. So if I&#x27;m going to be outside for an extended period of time, I may just gauge how at risk I really am for sunburn, and take alternative precautions as well, such as a ball cap, spend some of that time outside in shady areas or under a shelter, etc. and limit how long I keep this on my face. I won&#x27;t be using this overnight, but who needs SPF at night?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit up there, but so is the SPF, and it&#x27;s meant just for the face, not your whole body. It will last you a while unless you wear it constantly, and you won&#x27;t burn when you have this on.</li>
            <li> I like the cream, my wife doesn&#x27;t. I need it more than she anyway. She says it feels greasy. I just think it is smoother.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. This product has so much sunscreen in it that I cannot use it as moisturizer - when applied, it made my skin sting. I did use it as a sunscreen on my neck and chest, and it was inoffensive in that application, if gluey. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil products in the past (a big fan of their soaps and body washes), but I have to say I&#x27;m not surprised that the majority of the reviews for this particular product hover around the 3 to 4 star range.  The truth is I found this cr&amp;egrave;me to be a big eye-irritant. I&#x27;m very cautious to the types of cr&amp;egrave;mes I use on my face and so when the opportunity presented itself to try something new that may help me prevent damage to my skin from the sun, I took it thinking this may be it. But now I am disappointed. True, SPF 50 is better than say SPF30, but the regular sport-spray lotions are much better on my eyes than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue with the cr&amp;egrave;me is its heavy-duty-ness. I takes a considerable effort to rub it into the skin as its consistency is quite tick. Then at the end of the day, it take quite a bit of scrubbing to wash it off. Overall, I&#x27;d stay away from this product. Instead, try Coppertone line of sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product as a daily moisturizer for one month.  She liked the product and reported that it applied smoothly, was not greasy, had minimal odor, and didn&#x27;t flake.  Nor did it leave a white-color residue after drying - contrary to what some other reviewers reported.  We love the Cetaphil products and have used the soaps and lotions for 10+ years.  As with most Cetaphil products, the price is high.  Considering all of the top notch SPF moisturizers on the market, we may opt for alternatives in the future (like the retinol-based [[ASIN:B001E96NKC Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, SPF-15, 1.4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]] or [[ASIN:B001E96NZM Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer, 1.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)]]).</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and then I don&#x27;t feel anything afterwards, which is very nice.  I have been using it for my baby and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Odor free and not greasy. Does the job</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth, and has no headache producing strong scent, but it does leave a shine, even under foundation. Thus, it&#x27;s not the best product to use by those wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> This product is very pleasant to use. It has almost no odor and it goes on like moisturizer. But the white titanium dioxide paints your skin a ghostly white. It soaks in after a while with extra rubbing, but I waited for 15 minutes and my face was still noticeably white. That is too long for me. If you have very pale skin it might not be so noticeable, and you might need the ultra-high SPF more. I could not consider this product as anything but a sun-block.</li>
            <li> As a sunscreen this product works well.  It has the typical white semi-powdery residue of all sunscreens, but is much less oily, which I liked.  However, I found it extremely thick and with a rather off-putting scent.  Usually I love the smell of sunscreens, but this had some kind of additive I suspect is designed to make it seem \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;, i.e. to mask the inherent smell of the chemicals in the lotion.    As a moisturizer, there is nothing special about this.  It&#x27;s like putting regular hand lotion on your face, although a bit less moisturizing.   You certainly can&#x27;t use this as moisturizer alone, it should be thought of as a sunscreen with some mild moisturizing properties to it.  The price for what you get is simply outrageous.  Using a regular sunscreen and then using a good moisturizer after being outside would be preferable both in regards to cost and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This is essentially the best skin care product that I have received from vine.    Also because its summer and I am doing a transatlantic trip to Asia which is really really hot now.    I realize 50 spf is great coverage.     I have already started using this product and what I noticed best is its blends in without a trace.    Ofcourse it does look white when u first apply it, But it vanishes and keeps the face well moisturized.    Cetaphil is know to be gentle on skin so I intend to use the same on my 4 month old too.    I mix it with my foundation when I am heading out and it does a superb job.  I always mix foundation with moisturizer and this is a great way to incorporate spf with my make up and not hurt my skin.    Will update the same after my trip in few weeks time.    Thanks</li>
            <li> This works very well.  It goes on smoothly and when I am wearing it, I do feel protected from the sun and I don&#x27;t have problems with burns.  I use it on my face, chest and top of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the scent is very, very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the product makes me, a very pale person, even paler!  It gives me a gray sheen that is very strange and funny looking.  This does go away eventually during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it feels greasy and my skin is very shiny and oily looking after I put the product on.  It&#x27;s a little irritating to see my face in the mirror a couple hours after I apply the lotion and see how moist and greasy my face looks.  Blech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the above two points don&#x27;t really matter to me when I know I am going out in the sun and I need some protection.  This stuff works and I&#x27;m glad I have it.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and I will keep using it for the excellent protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and I am always looking to try new moisturizers to see how well they moisturize. Cetaphil does a great job, my face feels soft and smooth all day. It also has a great Spf of 50, which is what I need for my fair skin. It works great on my sensitive skin and does not cause breakouts. A great product!</li>
            <li> No breakouts with my breakout-prone and sensitive skin.  I suggest mixing it 1/2-1/2 with your regular moisturizer, as a little goes a long way!!  No greasiness...and face feels baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have extremely light skin and must wear a daily sunscreen on my face. This one is outstanding. It goes on smoothly, without an oily feeling and is quickly absorbed. There are no strong odors and absolutely no stinging. After application you can apply your make up as you normally would. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> At times I travel for business in warmer climates and often business meals and meetings take place outdoors.  I&#x27;ll fly to Miami for a day or two, and if I don&#x27;t use a sunscreen my face will get that reddish appearance (not a healthy tan, a reddish appearance).  For these times I need some protection that is as neutral in application and appearance as possible.  I like the Cetaphil moisturizer as a daily use product in such circumstances as it is not greasy at all and offers protection for my face.      Regarding fragrance-free:  although I don&#x27;t think there are any perfumes in the product, it still does have a slight fragrance (which I notice), although much less than a typical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I normally use Anthelios Fluide Extreme sunscreen but tried this one because I had a coupon and I was out of my usual sunscreen.   I can&#x27;t believe Cetaphil came out with this product because I&#x27;m usually very happy with their stuff.  This cream is the worst face sunscreen I have ever tried!    It leaves a whitish tinge to the face for hours after applying, and yes, I do rub it in thoroughly, but the worst is how greasy and shiny it made my face. My face looked like it had baby oil on it, and felt so greasy I had to wash the stuff off after a couple of hours.    A friend of mine had the same experience with it and she has dry skin.     I&#x27;m sure Cetaphil can come out with a better face sunscreen than this and look forward to their new and improved formula. In the meantime SAVE YOUR MONEY and don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> I am very fair plus I am taking a medication that makes me even more sensitive to burning.  I have not gotten sunburned since I started using this product.  It is a little greasy but since I have dry skin I end up absorbing it after a couple hours.  It also is a little white when first applied but that too goes away once it is absorbed.  This is a very mild product and does not irritate my skin and effectively moisturizes it.  It is terrific to have a product that is both a sunscreen and moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Living in the Southwest, I make sure to moisturize with a high spf. I found this made my face oily which is not a look I like.  I tried to use less but was still too oily for me.</li>
            <li> Great!  Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Cetaphil\\&quot;, the name speaks for itself. In the wintertime I have dry-looking facial skin; Cetaphil smooths out my skin. In the summertime it is a great aunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use the tiniest little bit as a moisturizer. As a sunblock, you probably should use a little bit more, but it never feels greasy on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Just downsized from 5 stars to 4 stars: It&#x27;s too expensive for the use that you get for it. I went with Neutrogena instead.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have never gotten a sunburnwhile wearing it. It exactly what it claims to be: SPF 50, non-greasy, and NO FRAGRANCE. It can be used for both sexes. This is definetely on of the best sunblock lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a good brand, and i&#x27;m sure this sunscreen is great, but on people of color or darker complected people it doesnt work very well. Its greasy and it turns white. I&#x27;m sure it protects from the sun, but i dont wanna walk around looking ashy and greasy at the same time, and putting makeup or face powder over it is even worse. If they come up with one for \\&quot;all\\&quot; skin types i&#x27;m in!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and I was suprised at how well this did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is scented and smells like regular sunblock.  In your hand it feels like a medium thick lotion, on you face initially it feels like a thicker lotion.  It does leave a white film on your face - even very white faces as it doesn&#x27;t absorb totally.  However, it does moisturize my face nicely and I can wear makeup over the sunblock, it doesn&#x27;t cause a break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not be for everyone, and you may prefer to use it as a face appropriate sunblock, but I would use it daily.  A little goes a long way, so keep that in mind when dispensing the lotion.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen looks ashey on the skin, and is very shiny. It is great sun protection, I guess, but doesn&#x27;t meet my needs as far as being a sunscreen I can wear under makeup. This product was not well thought out.</li>
            <li> The lotion is VERY hydrating but I find it a little overwhelming. Every time I use it I have to put powder on top of it to get rid of the shine. It does leave a white cast behind which I also try to hide with powder or makeup.</li>
            <li> Living all my life in Southern California, I have seen what the sun and outdoors can do to your skin.  Therefore, I am always interested in new moisturizing products that have sunscreens.    This product is being promoted as a combination sunblock and facial moisturizer.  The following are the product claims:        \\&quot;This light, non greasy moisturizer nourishes and hydrates your skin while also protecting it from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays\\&quot;    The product is a thick white liquid.  You only need a dab to cover your face.  It takes a while to work it into your face and leaves a fine film but it is non greasy.  As a moisturizer I feel it is only average.        \\&quot;Non-comedogenic, Non-greasy, Fragrance free from the #1 dermatologist recommended brand\\&quot;    The product does have a sunscreen smell but that fades once it is worked into the skin.      The one really bad thing about this product is that by midday, my eyes were irritated.  After a few days I realized, the irritation was similar to when you use sunscreen and when you sweat it gets in on your eyelids. (they are really sensitive and you should never put any product that is not specifically designed for that area on them.)  So that is why I say it fails as a moisturizer.  Over the course of the day you are going touch your face then your eyelids.    I would only recommend this product to be used when you are going to be outside and need a sunscreen.  This is not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s good: It works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not: Pretty much everything else. This is extremely expensive stuff. It claims to be fragrance-free, that might be true, but it certainly smells awful. It&#x27;s quite heavy and white-appearing on the face, especially for those with a little bit of existing coloration.</li>
            <li> I liked that this sunscreen/moisturizer absorbs so nicely into my skin. Sometimes when there is a higher (like more than 15 SPF) sunscreen in a lotion, it sort of just sits on the surface of my face and makes my subsequent makeup application smeary. This penetrates very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it is fragrance free which must mean no additional scents are added, but it does smell a little bit like typical sunscreen. Must be the nature of the product. The lotion itself isn&#x27;t super thick, more like a plain sunscreen feels, but a small dab covers my face and neck easily. I have had some small allergic reactions to other sunscreens, I am not sure what ingredient or additive is the culprit, but haven&#x27;t had trouble with this. It is worth a try if you don&#x27;t like heavily fragranced items or heavy creams on your face. It is light enough that I don&#x27;t mind wearing everyday, which I should, but so many products annoy me after a few weeks. Hopefully the lighter texture and smell of this will encourage me to continue using it daily. Don&#x27;t forget your neck and the backs of your hands!</li>
            <li> I appreciate the Cetaphil products are generally produced with skin sensitivity in mind.  I ordered this product hoping that it would provide the sun blocking effects I need without the annoyances of other products like stinging eyes, rub-off, white-face, pore-clogging, etc.  Overall I found that the sunscreen lasted a long time and did rub in well initially, but for active people if you sweat and it gets in your eyes, prepare for serious burning and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part I liked least actually was the fact that my skin never regained its normal color after applying this.  Even after extensive rubbing.  What a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, my face didn&#x27;t get sunburned, either.</li>
            <li> Please, when you send the product, include the respective invoice over the package, because is too important to get out the merchandise. Best regards, Tannya</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  It&#x27;s SPF 50 and does a good job protecting the skin from the sun.  Unlike many other sun protectors that keep off that much sun, this isn&#x27;t thick and pasty.  It goes on smooth, and moisturizes the skin, almost like standard Cetaphil lotions.  It is a bit more \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and leaves a bit more residue on the face than standard moisturizer - but that is to be expected since it is needs to leave some kind of layer on the skin in order to protect.  It has a very light fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  It works just fine for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite moisturizers.  It provides good sun protection and daily use.  It is not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and this is perfect for me.  I can use it as a moisturizer and sunscreen.  The basic moisturizers just don&#x27;t do it for me.  This is perfect for all out there who have a dry skin problem.  I love love this product.</li>
            <li> El Cetaphil UVS/UVB es muy buen producto para hidratar la piel de mis pequeños nietos y protejerlos de los doños causados por los rayos del sol</li>
            <li> A great product for summer</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema, and most sunscreens either trigger a flare up or burn her skin.  Since so many of Cetaphil&#x27;s other products work well with her skin, we thought we&#x27;d try their sunscreen.  It works great!  She hasn&#x27;t had any flare-ups and it didn&#x27;t burn, even when we used it on a patch of rough skin that is still healing from her last flare up.    I also used it on my face.  Although it&#x27;s thick, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or filmy.  The sunscreen is labeled as fragrance free, which I interpret as not having any masking fragrance since there is a slight familiar \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; odor.      It&#x27;s a great option, especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent protection against the sun, and good moisturizer as well. But it leaves a white residue. My skin has a medium-bronzey-orangey tone, and my face is a little darker than the rest of my skin for some reason, so the white residue isn&#x27;t really bad or noticeable -- but I think that on someone else, the whiteness could stand out and not look right!</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and wanted a moisturizer for my face that I could use every day. It is not heavy. It does not feel greasy. I put it on every single day and am very pleased that I am protected from the sun. I love that it has a high SPF. I have not had any problems with my skin breaking out.</li>
            <li> It feels very light on my skin and it´s not grease. I feel sun protect all day long. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands (no exaggeration) on face creams at department stores. Ever since I switched to Cetaphil SPF 50 I get so many compliments on my skin and people constantly ask me what I use. They are shocked when I tell them. Plus, my make-up goes on great over this face lotion. If SPF is too much for you, try the lower SPF option.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Sunscreen and face usual equals breakouts. This the first thing I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t happen. I work outdoors and use it almost daily. I also use their daily 30spf.</li>
            <li> I just began using this a week or 2 ago and I absolutely love it. As a caramel complected person I was in dire need of  a facial moisturizer with a higher SPF. I was using the Purpose brand....which had a SPF of 15 but was awesome otherwise. I had began talking walks around high noon in the sun and started to tan quickly. Then I heard that people of color should use an SPF of at least 30 and then I came across Cetaphil. Very expensive for just over one ounce of product in my opinion. But you only need 1 pump to cover your face. It leaves a little sheen as well but I don&#x27;t mind it. Ive been  complimented on my new &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; a few times and am also protected from UVB / UVA rays.......success!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more from this sunscreen, but it&#x27;s like any other: thick and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have darker skin, so this lotion also leaves me with a slight whitish haze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use a lot of it. But your face will look shiny and greasy, which isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does prevent sun damage, so that&#x27;s good. But if you&#x27;re like me and looking for a non-greasy, non-shiny facial sunscreen, you need to go for a liquid lotion, like L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the trick.  I have normal to dry skin and this moisturizes enough with great SPF coverage.  No overwhelming smell at all.  If you have normal to oily skin, this may feel greasy.  This is the best lotion with sunblock I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> sun protection is ok but the white film it leaves on your face in intolerable....i trashed it....after all looking good is the primary concern.</li>
            <li> it is better than other defense moisturizer i have used before. i used it when i went to a beach and it protected well.</li>
            <li> My face was extremely greasy and chalky looking all day from this. I am returning the product. Do not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer makes my skin look so dewy and refreshed! It is a thick lotion (still thinner than a cream) and you do need to apply it evenly and massage it until it absorbs completely--it takes maybe a little more effort than a thinner lotion, but not that much more. I am in my late 30s and my skin can easily look dry these days. When I apply this moisturizer, the skin looks so drenched and restored. I swear that even the fine lines look less visible. It makes my skin look younger and plumper. Also, as some reviewers noted, it does leave a thin white film, as all lotions with a high SPF tend to do. But if you massage it well this film becomes imperceptible. In my case, I actually like the effect because it evens my skin tone and brightens my complexion--kind of like foundation. I have fair skin, so maybe this wouldn&#x27;t work for darker skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though this looks like a teeny tiny container, it lasts for a long time because it&#x27;s so concentrated. I dab a little dot on each finger, distribute on my face, and that&#x27;s enough. With almost daily use, my current bottle has lasted for over three months.</li>
            <li> FOLLOWING REVIEW BY \\&quot;!MRS. KNOW IT ALL\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is designed specifically for the face.  It is nice that it is more than sunscreen, as it is a moisturizing product along with providing the highest SPF available.  There are very few products that are effective for both UVB and UVA.  I also love the small size tube can fit right in your pocketbook or pocket--easy to carry for days outdoors.  It is fragence free, so your husband or kids can use it without worrying about a sunscreen or beachy smell.  You don&#x27;t need much, a small pearl size drop goes a long way.  So even though the tube is small, it will last for awhile.  I have not had any problems with this product irritating my skin--which I tend to have happen with many others---so that is even another added bonus.  I highly recommend this product for those who want to protect their skin from those harmful rays.</li>
            <li> Very good one product remedy for those who will be exposed to sun for more than just brief periods.  However, the sunscreen in this moisturizer will not prevent the need to reapply more product every two hours if you are exposing your skin to the sun continuously or for more than 10 minutes at a time.  It also is necessary to reapply the product if you swim, sweat, or wipe the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very good sunscreen product, and very straight forward.  It has an impressive amount of effective sunscreen ingredients in a standard lotion base.  There are no bells and whistles.  It&#x27;s sunscreen without fragrance, so it&#x27;s suitable for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is oily and my neck is normal.  This is somewhat heavy on my face, but not surprisingly so, given the high degree of protection.  It is not heavy on my neck at all.  It does leave a bit of a white cast which seems to fade as the skin absorbs the product.  No one has called me Casper yet, so I don&#x27;t think anyone has noticed.  Neither the whiteness nor the heaviness are deal-breakers for me.  They&#x27;re a very minor tradeoff for a good sunscreen.  This is worth trying no matter your skin type, and I will use this product again.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of Cetaphil&#x27;s various face washes and lotions I was excited to see their recent introduction of a SPF 50 facial sunscreen product.  Like most Cetaphil products you really don&#x27;t have to worry about having your skin dry out as a result of product use, however, aside from the &#x27;hydrating&#x27; factor and decent SPF protection this sunscreen misses the mark in terms of being an ideal facial sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters I experimented with this product on a recent weekend outing to Palm Springs where I played 18 holes of mid-morning golf in full sunlight (and no hat) with temperatures hovering in the mid-80&#x27;s range. Based on results the next day I will say that this lotion is superb at protecting skin from the sun.  On the downside this product isn&#x27;t quite sweatproof so you will get that milky sweat dripping down your cheek if conditions are hot enough.  Also, unlike other facial screens that I&#x27;ve used in the past this cream does tend to feel a bit greasy (as opposed to blending into your skin) and will leave a noticeable sheen.  If these cosmetic trifles do not concern you, however, then this product is superb (provided that you are not sweating profusely or swimming in the ocean, etc.).</li>
            <li> Read the label carefully.  This is not a broad spectrum sunscreen.  Only protects against sunburn , not damaging and dangerous UVA rays.  I wish I knew this before I purchased.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it contains two products that I need to use into one, thereby increasing the likelehood that I&#x27;ll use it at all!&lt;br /&gt;The lotion moisturizes really well, and is quickly absorbed into in my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, but does smell a tad like sunsblock.&lt;br /&gt;SPF 50 has got you well protected and the moisturizes keep it baby soft.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> As an active mother who lives on the shore we&#x27;re frequently out in the sun, and I&#x27;m always on the look out for a product with high SPF that won&#x27;t cause breakouts or make me super greasy. I recently started using Cetaphils facial cleanser and lotions and really like them so I was excited to see such a high SPF from them for the face.     Sadly this product isn&#x27;t my holy grail, I&#x27;d really like something I can use on a day to day basis under my makeup (mineral foundation). The cetaphil is expensive but a little goes a long way, however it also left me with quite a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; at first I liked the look, it wasn&#x27;t what I would call shiny or greasy at first but actually gave me a healthy looking glow under my foundation, that lasted maybe an hour and then I was just a shiny greasy looking mess and had to wash it off. I think I&#x27;ll reserve this for days at the beach or playing in the yard and stick with my Olay Complete SPF 30 for under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times. Great for every use.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is great.  It is not overly pastey.  It absorbs quickly and thoroughly and provideds great protection.</li>
            <li> It seems to help, I like the way it my skin feel very moist after using it.  It does leave a white film on your face probabily because of the thickness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  It&#x27;s all I use--every day, all year.  Cetaphil products  were recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW (also read my update below): My only disappointment was that it even though it is absorbed quickly, it left the skin shiny. Please don&#x27;t confuse &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; for it is neither greasy or oily. The trick is learn how much you need (which turns-out to be very little) to protect your face and ears. The built-in pump meters-out very small amounts. 4 squirts gives you not quite a quarter-sized glob.. Just enough with a bit left over, which I apply to the back of my neck. I apply it after applying my aftershave lotion and am good for the day. I&#x27;ve slept without washing this off. It does not stain the bed linen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE+++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second order of two tubes. I&#x27;ve learned that the resultant shininess was due to my simply using too much. With a little experimenting it appears that two squirts (half as much as originally suggested) and applying it more carefully gives me the same protection. Spending a few more minutes rubbing it into the skin also help reduce the shininess I observed when I first began using this product. A case (for me) when more is not better, or even necessary. Now knowing the &amp;#34;disappointment&amp;#34; was my own doing I&#x27;ve changed my overall rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product left my face SOOO OILY! I don&#x27;t have normally oily skin. Maybe I have to blot my face once during the day if it&#x27;s hot out. But using this product my face was constantly oily throughout the day even after blotting over and over again. I didn&#x27;t have problems with the pigment, as some reviewers said, because I have pale skin, but I would definitely not recommend using this on your face or for anything more than sunscreen. It&#x27;s definitely not good under makeup</li>
            <li> I use this with other face products and it works great.  Does not leave my face feeling greasy and it keeps my skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer after getting a mild facial sunburn. The Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer did much to soothe and partially protect my sunburned face. What is lacking is the claim of broad spectrum UVA/UVB sun protection that most sunscreen products advertise. The Cetaphil moisturizer may do this but it is not stated on the package directions. Without that this moisturizer works well to soothe dry skin but I would not depend on this product for broad spectrum UVA/UVB sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend with caveats given.</li>
            <li> A little greasy but it will do. I mix it together with the sun screen and a base primer on the face</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to use 2 oz for full coverage, but even less than that leaves a blue-white tint to my pale white face. I ended up using it up on my neck and arms where I didn&#x27;t care as much. But it does not work as a facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Having gotten on the Cetaphil bandwagon, I decided to test out their moisturizer with 50 spf for daytime. I have tried to use moisturizers that double as sunscreens before but always got breakouts. This one promised to be noncomedogenic and so far – no breakouts. I use it on bare skin in the morning and then put on my concealer, no foundation. So far it&#x27;s been great. It&#x27;s the perfect size for a purse/makeup bag and the pump is just right. My love for Cetaphil products continues!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream to use as a daily sunscreen, to avoid further age-spots.  It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin; I&#x27;ve used it daily with good results.  I do have one child whose skin reacts to sunscreen by breaking out in a rash.  This child used it twice on his face without getting a rash; we are both Cetaphil moisture cream users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in February, I&#x27;ve applied it every day, and it&#x27;s June now and I am on the first tube.</li>
            <li> Perfect for California weather. I have oily acne prone skin and I don&#x27;t like to try products. My doctor recommended cetaphil with SPF and since then I have never switched to any other product. Perfect for oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for rosacea and eczema; I tried many different moisturizers over the years and most of them would make my red skin get worse; this has been the only product that really helps and protects from the sun as well. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li> Great Product, great protection for my skin.  The only downside is that after applying it to you skin it leaves you skin white.</li>
            <li> Very good product, Love it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this sunscreen, but it&#x27;s too shiny.  It does the job of screening from the sun as far as I can tell, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but the shine is really bad.  I can use other daily moisturizers with sunscreen that don&#x27;t leave quite a shine on my face. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and non-greasy sunblock. Leaves zero greasy residue on skin. Only drawback is skin looks like it has white layer although it seems to disappear after an hour or so. Really like the packaging. I would give it a five if it wasn&#x27;t for the white layer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a stickler for sunscreens and have worn an SPF 30 or more since I was a teenager. (Sun damage causes wrinkles!) I have sensitive skin, so I started using Cetaphil 50+ and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve purchased many more expensive high-SPF daily moisturizers, but I always come back to Cetaphil. It&#x27;s light, never clogs my pores, and really protects. I get compliments on my skin all the time--in fact, the sandwich maker at Subway today didn&#x27;t believe me when I told her how old I am. I think consistently wearing SPF is a part of that, but Cetaphil is really moisturizing as well, so I&#x27;m not using 2 separate products to get moisture or layering products on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any high-SPF product, this will leave a slightly white veil on the skin unless you thoroughly rub it in and let it absorb into the skin. It&#x27;s not meant to sit on top of the skin, so work it in if it seems slick or like it gives you a veil on your skin. I love it and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> When I saw this product and saw it had a SF 50 rating I didn&#x27;t quite believe it could be any good, because I&#x27;ve tried an SPF 30 in the past and it was almost like paint. Somehow, someway Celaphil found a way to make SPF 50 non-greasy, light weight and with no filmy white residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and love it. This moisturizer goes on my face smoothly and feels so light I forget I&#x27;ve got it on. What a nice way to protect my face from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.</li>
            <li> I purchased Cetaphil Defense because of its recommendation by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s  light and non greasy.  I like the way it&#x27;s bottled and pumps easily.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and spend a lot of time outdoors, gardening &amp; landscaping. I need spf 50 but all other sunscreens, even when applied below cheekbones, irritate my eyes. This product can be applied above cheekbones and even on eyelids lightly. Doesn&#x27;t leach.  Only downside is amt of zinc oxide in it that gives one a pasty look until it sinks in. Then it is time to reapply!  I use another moisturizer w/spf when not working outdoors.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, too bad my local CVS doesn&#x27;t carry it.  I have to order on line and am happy about that.</li>
            <li> I work for CBS, NBC, Fox, and other TV networks - outside! I developed an itching reaction to most sunblocks;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist suggested Cetaphil with sunblock. I tried it, and it works. It is easily applied, and protected me all day.&lt;br /&gt;I have 14 days of CBS golf this month and am thankful that I found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care junkie, and I remember Paula Begoun in the &#x27;90s talking about how Cetaphil cleanser was all a person really needed.  But I fall for the hype of a lot of skin care companies and was never really happy with the drying nature of Cetaphil cleanser.   So, periodically I would use Cetaphil stuff (on travel, at my mom&#x27;s house, whatever), but on the whole this was not a brand I&#x27;d choose except in a pinch.    Having spent the better part of three years looking for a suitable suncream which would protect AND moisturize, I ended up last summer with MD Skincare&#x27;s orange bottle SPF 30.  It was great for the summer months but in the dryer winter weather it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough.  I ended up with the old standby Pevonia sunscreen, which is moisturizing, but only SPF 15.    When the Cetaphil sunscreen arrived I tested it right away - we&#x27;d just come back from the indoor pool, and I took my shower and used this on my face.  Beautiful!  Yeah, while applying it, it was super white and thick, but I just kept gently massaging it in.  Five minutes after I walked away, the whiteness was gone; there is no shine; my son says, \\&quot;Your skin feels moist!\\&quot;    So, this is a winner, and I&#x27;m always thrilled to be happy with drugstore-priced stuff.</li>
            <li> There are five different sunscreens in this product.  Five!  So far it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried for blocking the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is thick in texture, but still somewhat runny, very white, and a bit greasy-feeling (despite what the label says).  Very little odor, and certainly  no perfumes. While the packaging implies that you could use this as regular moisturizer on your face, I would not recommend it.  It left me very shiny, and seems to highlight even small wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for just an outing in the sun?  Fabulous.  I&#x27;ve used it during my hour-long runs in bright sunlight.  It protects well, and despite not having any \\&quot;sport\\&quot; designation, it doesn&#x27;t seem to easily wear off from perspiration.  It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, too.</li>
            <li> There are really only two ways of making a sunscreen.  One way is to use chemicals that absorb the UV light before it hits your skin.  The other way is to use a physical barrier to the light, which is why there are so many lifeguards with painted noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently sunscreens started appearing that have the same titanium dioxide paint, but with such a small particle size that it can be rubbed into the skin and not show.  This is a pretty great innovation, particularly for those sensitive areas around the mouth and eyes where chemicals could cause irritation. That is the secret behind the sun defense powers in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream went on very nicely, and without a lot of scent (it says it is unscented, but it smells like standard issue hand lotion to me).  I tried it under my eyes before working in the yard, and it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip top seems like it would be a nice little item to carry in a purse, and the lack of chemicals make it suitable for even very young children.  I think I&#x27;m going to keep mine in the glove compartment of my car for those times when it is really sunny but we didn&#x27;t plan ahead enough to bring lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean P. Logue, 2009</li>
            <li> This stuff lives up to its billing.  It does a great job of protecting you from the sun and it is very much not greasy.  My only critism is that it is a little heavy, so you have to spend some time rubbing it in, else you will look like you have a white face paint on.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil offers this product as a facial moisturizer with SPF 50 sun block.  And for a day of sun, I&#x27;d use it.  However, even though it&#x27;s a nice facial moisturizer, I would not use it on a daily basis.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients for this product sounds like a recipe from Dr. Frankenstein&#x27;s lab.  The chief ingredient for sun block is titanium oxide, but along with it comes aluminum oxide -- and aluminum products are not something I care to use on my skin regularly.  While the jury is still out on the effects of aluminum on the brain, I&#x27;m steering away from it whenever I can.  Aluminum has been established as a neurotoxin, so it&#x27;s not a candidate for daily use in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I should point out that this product feels great as a moisturizer on my skin. So good, in fact, that I&#x27;ll look for another Cetaphil moisturizer (without SPF 50) for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Cetaphil product based on my Dermatologist recommendation. My skin type is combination skin and sensitive, and when added to the humid weather in my country, I tend to have pretty active breakouts. The Cetaphil goes on light and does not feel greasy. The fact that it is both sun block and moisturizer in one means I&#x27;m not overwhelming my skin with too many products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Cetaphil has the reputation it does, as every product I&#x27;ve tried of theirs I notice it&#x27;s too greasy and leaves me oily and prone to break-out.  This product is no different. The SPF is obviously great, as are the physical-blocking ingredients, but the moisturizing action is much too great and if you have oil-prone skin you&#x27;re going to hate this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and, because I have brown spots in several places, I always use this to cover those before I go out and work in the yard. It has kept those brown spots from getting worse, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, every time I&#x27;ve purchased it, there has been a coupon inside. They used to be for $2 off, but the last few boxes had a $4 off coupon- for ANY Cetaphil product. That&#x27;s always nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, for a moisturizer with an SPF 50, it has a nice light weight slippery texture. It also leaves my skin incredibly smooth, but takes a little while to absorb and can leave me looking a little dewy. Sometimes during application it stings a bit, but disclaimer: most things sting my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I think it&#x27;s a solid product for the money, the only downfall is that sometimes it isn&#x27;t hydrating enough- my skin tends to flake and peel a lot in the winter, mostly because I use a retinol product, but I still like it. Oh yeah, and this product never makes me breakout- I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year.</li>
            <li> Nurse at dermatologist&#x27;s office said to use high SPF due to laser treatments.  I am a huge fan of Cetaphil products.  My skin is horribly dry and this feels great going on but it feels a tad greasy after an hour or two.  If I blot it, it is fine.  No creepy smell and it does not burn like some SPF products.  Will buy again.  Just need to keep blotting tissues handy.  Beauty is not easy!!</li>
            <li> excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin and the SPF +50 allows one product application, rather than 2. Nice feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> I agree with the others about it looking white if not well patted and rubbed in but I LOVE it for daily wear. I spend extra time working it into my (somewhat fair) skin so it doesn&#x27;t look white. It isn&#x27;t greasy but my skin glows more than I prefer--I don&#x27;t always like that but people say I have beautiful dewy skin. I sometimes mix a dab of foundation with it and pat that on as a top layer to reduce the whiteness and even out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well for swim workouts and it doesn&#x27;t burn or make my face break out. I know it works because my cheeks will look very red after using other products that either don&#x27;t last in the water or don&#x27;t feel good going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have roseacea--and it helps keep the redness down--at least it doesn&#x27;t trigger it like others can. I&#x27;ve tried other products but after a short while the roseacea flares up.</li>
            <li> Great and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I think the sun protection works.  But it is loaded with paraben.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have tried it before and I like the non oil feeling and the smooth of the lotion. I hardly feel it on my face while it is really not too much on the face. However, if they may have colored lotion, it would be even better!</li>
            <li> Love it! It helps protect my face from the sun</li>
            <li> This works great!  I am allergic to some moisturizers but not this one.  It does not leave any white visible stuff on my face like some of these.  The sun protection works all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff will work beautifully so long as you&#x27;re not on a harsh medicine like me! It made my face feel like it was burning! And my face was really red, and all my acne was inflamed. When I wasn&#x27;t on my cream though, it made my face feel kinda greasy, but other than that, it worked just fine!</li>
            <li> Exactly the moisturizer I was looking for.. Very light weight, and high spf! After I tried this I signed up for subscribe &amp; save!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this product. It is better than what I expected. And the price is somewhat satisfied</li>
            <li> Use this every day - the package I received is different than the picture. Instead of a flip top, mine has a mini-pump top, which I actually prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rubs in well, though it starts very white. If you let your beard grow out a few days, it does cling to the hair and takes a bit more work to rub in. Small price to pay for good sun protection.</li>
            <li> This is basically sunscreen (not moisturizer with a little bit of sun protection), smells so strong and the SPF makes your skin super pale and chalky. I might still try the lower SPF, but I would not use this as a daily moisturizer unless I was a lifeguard at a beach.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer every morning.  It&#x27;s much cheaper than brands at the makeup counters, and I honestly think it&#x27;s a better product.  The SPF 50 is great!  Yes, it is think.  And yes, it needs some time to soak in.  But I put it on right when I get out of the shower, before I eat breakfast.  By the time I&#x27;m done with breakfast and ready to put on my makeup I don&#x27;t notice any white residue and my makeup goes on great.  I have very sensitive skin (re acne-prone), but I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a little like sunscreen, but hello, SPF 50!</li>
            <li> Both boys suffered from facial blemishes and using this SPF moisturizer did not exacerbate the problem. Goes on without being oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this gives good sun protection, and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out at all or I&#x27;d have given it only 1 star. It&#x27;s VERY greasy. It was like an oil spill on my face all day. Looking for another sunscreen. If I can find my receipt, I am returning this.</li>
            <li> So a moisturizer with SPF 55... I was in heaven. Also many doctors recommend using Cetaphil. I have very good skin a maybe get a pimple 1-2 times a year.  When I started using this, I would break out in a 2-3 small pimples on my face and one on my chest where I used it.  Not a huge deal but completely unacceptable to me.  I was really bummed because I brought a two pack from Amazon on it!  I talked to my dermatologist and asked if there was something wrong with my skin because I was getting pimples from something that I thought was non-comedogenic.  Anyway, my doctor said that everyone reacts differently to different products and that you just have to keep on trying different ones until one works for you. So she gave me a sample of Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunblock with Helioplex and it works really well for me and no break outs.  So moral of story, sample something before you buy large quantities of it because you never know how your skin will react. This product may work great for you but it didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer but I don&#x27;t love it.  The reason is that it feels just a little heavy on my face, but it does have a high SPF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for years.  It protects me from burns and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation. I will use this for years to come.</li>
            <li> Moisture part is alright, sunscreen part is awful, it leaves a white film residue o. Your face that turns flaky when it dries making it look like your skin is peeling</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well with sun light so my doctor recommends me to use this sun screen all the time. It works with me.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and my dermatologist recommended this brand product.  It works great and protects my skin very well!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and it is available at your local pharrmacy.  I read about it in &amp;#34;The Complete Beauty Bible&amp;#34; by Paula Begoun.</li>
            <li> This is the daily face cream that my daughter uses every day.  She is very light complected and I am concerned about the health of her skin.  I chose Cetaphil because of it&#x27;s gentle reputation.  It works great.  Yes, there is a LIGHT smell, once you rub it in, it goes away.  Yes, there is a sheen that lingers for a minute.  Again, once it is rubbed in completely, the sheen goes away as well.  She doesn&#x27;t come in after playing outside with a sunburn, or increased freckles (it&#x27;s a concern of hers).  I have found that it works great and will continue to use it on her.</li>
            <li> This is a great combination product - moisturizer and sunscreen (SPF-50) for daily use. Recommended by my dermatologist. I noticed greater sun protection with this product; it&#x27;s nice to have the sunscreen included in the moisturizer so I don&#x27;t have to use multiple products.</li>
            <li> I am currently using acne medication and needed a strong sunblock to wear during the day.  I like that this sunblock is a tiny bit white because it helps tone down the redness in my skin from the medications.  If I use this on my skin after the medications it does burn parts of my face for a few minutes then goes away.  It leaves my face a bit shiny and greasy.  I like that it is unscented but there may be better products out there.</li>
            <li> We live in S Arizona. My wife uses this regularly and loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and feel confident I&#x27;m being protected from the sun with the 50 SPF.</li>
            <li> very good for my son.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years as I am have eczema skin.&lt;br /&gt;The SPF is so helpful and the quality is just amazing since i live in Dubai and it still leaves my skin moist but not oily.</li>
            <li> Very  moisturizing. Skin feels soft after use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup. Normally it is just clean skin, a light moisturizer, and me. In the summer I up the ante and add a moisturizer with an SPF of 50, a huge sunhat that also has an SPF of 50, and prescription polarized sunglasses. All of this is because I like to spend 2 to 3 hours working in the yard. I have fair skin and also have allergic reactions to some facial products.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product because it was unscented, seemed to do the job of moisturizing my skin while I fooled around in the yard, and it wasn&#x27;t greasy like many similar products.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was the amount of time it took for this product to absorb in the skin.  On initial application I look like a kabuki. My face has left with a white look and even after 15 or 20 minutes after application it hadn&#x27;t completely absorbed. This is not a big deal when I am off in the yard and completely alone, but not so good when I am out with people.&lt;br /&gt;While this product offers protection and does a good job moisturizing, I&#x27;m not pleased with the white residue.</li>
            <li> I will keep on buying this great product. I strongly recommend it for 50 and up year old women and men.</li>
            <li> Not overly smelly.Not greasy. Simply put, this sunscreen and moisturizer is the best product of its type that I have used. The tube is small in size so it is easy to carry and the pump on top works fine and eliminates spillage.</li>
            <li> Everything in perfect order;</li>
            <li> Very good!!!! very good I love it. it works as good as i expected. impressive. I will come back again</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m writing a review as the first one didn&#x27;t get posted up.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this moisturizer as CETAPHIL is a reputable company with quality products, but this moisturizer is just TERRIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how much or little I put on this stuff it makes me look like a total greaseball. The worst part is that I have random white patches all over my face no matter how much I attempt to smooth out my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily or combination skin stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> this brand of lotion was recommended by my dermatologist. i prefer the higher spf rating.  over spf 30 or less</li>
