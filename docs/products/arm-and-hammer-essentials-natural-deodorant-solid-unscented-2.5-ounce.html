            <li>Even after running and even my clothes smell great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great that I can buy it online.</li>

            <li>So happy I found this.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>and now he loves it too, so its great for men and women.</li>
            <li>I bought both the \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; scent and the unscented to try and see which I liked best.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my son and worked just great.</li>
            <li>This product is very nice, it doesn&#x27;t burn, it works.</li>
            <li>The deodorant has a REALLY nice scent!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it would just mix with my sweat and my armpits had this combination of pleasant, yet funky smell and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to eliminate toxins if I can, and deoderant and face creams were two good places to start.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good this deodorant is.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>and of course I want to smell good all the time.</li>
            <li>This product works well, but I dohave to reapply after 12 hours to maintain optimum freshness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that good products have to go by the wayside.</li>
            <li>and it seemed like it&#x27;d be a good choice.</li>
            <li>This is a good option if you want to avoid chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I have not had good luck using deodorants instead of anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li>, the best I&#x27;ve used are Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials and the MenScience Advanced.</li>
            <li>I find this works well, it allows me to sweat and flush out toxins while keeping me smelling good.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t need antiperspirant so this seemed like a good choice.</li>
            <li>Good buy for people looking for deoderant as opposed to antipersperant.</li>
            <li>Works good, but it does have a orangish scent to it.</li>
            <li>If they ever perfect the unscented part, though, I&#x27;d sure love to find a healthy unscented deodorant to try!</li>
            <li>This is a great, safe deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Great &amp; safe for children.</li>
            <li>this deodorant has a great smell and best of all, it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>I found this product about 2 years ago - and I love it!</li>
            <li>I had read other reviews on the smell but decided to give it a try anyway, hoping for the best... an unscented, aluminum-free deodorant would be just perfect!</li>
            <li>Outstanding product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy this deodorant is aluminum free.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like citronella, but</li>
            <li>: well as much as I liked this product in the beginning, I no longer us it.</li>
            <li>For me both provide effective all-day under-arm odor</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest here and say that the deodorant &#x27;crystal&#x27; didn&#x27;t work for me; neither did any of the Tom&#x27;s brand stuff (except for the anti-perspirant, which does have aluminum in it).  </li>
            <li>He liked the smell and wetness protection but just didn&#x27;t agree with his skin.</li>
            <li>That is a nice plus to the product.</li>
            <li>The unscented is kind of misleading.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get myself some soon because after all these years of using the kind with aluminum in it, I need a safer alternative.</li>
            <li>Very good stuff, and has a great light citrus smell when first applied.</li>
            <li>great clean smelling deodorant without all the aluminum and chemicals.</li>
            <li>it says its unscented but it has a very strong lemon smell or something like that, had to give them away</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect!  </li>
            <li>Overall, great effective product at a great rate and nice smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, &amp; these A&amp;H are my fave as well as the Weleda Rose spray deodorant.</li>
            <li>so i got this stuff yesterday afternoon and applied it right away; great scent, light and breezy!</li>
            <li>If you are lucky and don&#x27;t have any body odor (something that I&#x27;m constantly aware of when I sweat) then it would work perfectly fine--for me</li>
            <li>The first month I experienced some itching and irritation but didn&#x27;t think anything abnormal of it because I don&#x27;t have any allergies.</li>
            <li>The scent is very, very light, with notes of chamomile, geranium, and orange peel.</li>
            <li>It was very lightly scented, almost unscented.  </li>
            <li>very light smell even though it says unscented.</li>
            <li>bottom line is that this is a very good product for patients with eczema or very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, when I apply just a bit and pat myself with a towel after I cannot smell it easily and the product is still effective.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found my deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li>the more I thought about it,</li>
            <li>the more I sweat.</li>
            <li>I have about more than 3/4 of it just sitting underneath my sink.</li>
            <li>Arm and Hammer unscented is my favorite deodorate, period.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine on days of rest, because if I use antiperspirants too many days in a row I develop sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love.</li>
            <li>This is an ok deodorant, but not an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s refreshing.     </li>
            <li>I love baking soda for my teeth, so I thought I would try this deodorant.    </li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t pay more than that for them.  </li>
            <li>You will still perspire, as this is not an antiperspirant, but I think that is healthy (antiperspirants all contain aluminum in some form).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found just dressing more appropriately so that I don&#x27;t sweat</li>
            <li>does a better job at keeping me from getting smelly than this deodorant does.  </li>
            <li>Maybe ladies will like it better.</li>
            <li>I love how this deoderant doesn&#x27;t leave stains on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>It helped somewhat better than most but after a while the scent goes away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with how well it works.want to use aluminum products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with how well it works.</li>
            <li>and it seems to help the sticky feel and for you to smell better longer.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I seem to allergic to most deodorants.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; somewhere to gain the healthy benefit.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for any better.</li>
            <li>Mind you, I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of smelling like a guy, but it was the best solution I could come up with.</li>
            <li>Paraben and aluminum free!</li>
            <li>Love this product, will order again</li>
            <li>I love the A&amp;H Essentials brand though, for sure.</li>
            <li>Triclosan has been removed from most products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Like many of my patients I am allergic to aluminum based antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>While it can be an irritant in eczema patients if the concentrations are over 5% it is found in many oral and injectable medications as well as dog food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to work OK.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps the funk at bay lol.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, this is better than that of Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li>Love the citrus scent and wont leave sticky residue on your armpits.</li>
            <li>one of the most toxic pollutants know.</li>
            <li>All great, fine experience, thanks!</li>
            <li>I am now a loyal user (unless I start making my own).  </li>
            <li>I will easily pay more to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great natural deodorizer product!  </li>
            <li>Very good at controlling both odor and wetness, and I&#x27;m a big sweater!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is aluminum &amp; paraben free.  </li>
            <li>It has a lemon smell and works great for a couple hours, but by the end of the day seems to be completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Sure it claims to be Aluminium free.</li>
            <li>Wonderful choice when looking for a more chemical free alternative to other deodorants.</li>
            <li>Finally a natural, gluten free, deodorant that works!!!  </li>
            <li>Very light, fresh, citrusy scent  Keeps me stink free!</li>
            <li>It is unscented, however, it has a very nice natural lemony smell.  </li>
            <li>, I smell fresh (it&#x27;s a citrusy scent that is absolutely delightful and not overpowering in any way)and because the stick applies \\&quot;clear\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t have to worry about white goop getting all over my shirts.</li>
            <li>It absorbs seemingly very quickly.</li>
            <li>if you have strong body odor issues, you may have to assess this product yourself to see if it will work for you.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent is too strong for me, not a fan.</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural deodorants and this one is BY FAR the best.</li>
            <li>As for this deodorant, if you put it on and do nothing all day, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>All I want is to not stink and this works fine.</li>
            <li>Fine product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well and smells fine.</li>
            <li>But because of the huge price difference I&#x27;ve settled on the Arm &amp; Hammer as my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By far the best natural deodorant out there.</li>
            <li>These A&amp;H natural deodorants work the best of all the natural ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The deodorant says its unscented, it does have a light citrus smell which is not over powering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants in my quest for the best.</li>
            <li>I enjoy shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This does work and it does NOT have aluminum, which is fantastic, but what&#x27;s up with the triclosan?</li>
            <li>I tried the men&#x27;s science advanced (4x the price)</li>
            <li>this product does not and keeps me odor free.</li>
            <li>It dries to a light feeling</li>
            <li>, it is light and citrus-y.</li>
            <li>Arm &amp; Hammer is a really great brand for people looking for an all-natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>I decided I do like the FRESH scent better though vs the unscented.</li>
            <li>Arm &amp; Hammer uses all natural ingredients so this is a really good choice if you are avoiding chemicals.</li>
            <li>be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li>for many years after learning that most deodorants contained aluminum, i have tried various \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones that would for the most part cover the odor, but i suppose i sweat like a pig because they didnt seem to help control the sweating.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to find an affordable deodorant at the aisle that is also &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Mennen ruined their original Speedstick when they updated it.  </li>
            <li>I read that the unscented had a light, sweet citrus scent</li>
            <li>I ordered unscented, because that&#x27;s the kind I bought (the label said), and they sent me the other kind, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to see so many positive reviews of Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Antiperspirant Deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made a personal choice to be OK with Triclosan as I feel it is partly why this deodorant is so effective.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it is as effective as your normal, chemical filled deodorants, but it comes pretty close!</li>
            <li>Then I saw Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials in my local drugstore, and remembered baking soda can be a pretty good deodorant, and who knows better than Arm &amp; Hammer?</li>
            <li>I previously used Right Guard for 25 years and it worked great except like most others, it contains aluminum and it&#x27;s aerosol.     </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this deodorant so much</li>
            <li>I would buy more if I found them at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This smells good but doesn&#x27;t last for anything.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Speed-Stick Unscented Solid.</li>
            <li>None of the stuff that causes irritation (I am a sensitive kind of guy) and doesn&#x27;t have fragrances either.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the product, the citrus smell was really strong, but either I got used to it, or it mellowed out, because I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li>I bought this one with no scent, but it has a very slight, extremely pleasant scent that I love.</li>
            <li>used the standard Arm &amp; Hammer unscented for a while and liked it just fine.</li>
            <li>No product keeps me entirely odor free, but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The other is Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which, in my experience, smells great but doesn&#x27;t work,</li>
            <li>I love Arm &amp; Hammer as a company though and was willing to try their other natural deodorant, the fresh instead of this unscented one and that one has worked excellent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I would go with Tom&#x27;s of Maine unscented, which has mild, citrus&#x27;y fragrance.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the non-Essentials version is easier to find now that this line of deodorants bombed.</li>
            <li>Smells like orange, but quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>I started looking when I was pregnant and have been using this one ever since.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spend a little more money and get a better one with better ingrediants.</li>
            <li>I was also very pleased that it was unscented as the only smell I want is my cologne.     </li>
            <li>This one has a very light scent that pretty much disappears once you apply it.</li>
            <li>Its actually a rather nice smell and pretty strong but still, not unscented.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t think it worked very well on the odor at first, but the longer I used it, the better it worked.</li>
            <li>probably won&#x27;t buy this deodorant again and instead still try and find a better deodorant that is natural and does not leave any marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li>But what I discovered was REALLY pleasing and a surprise!!  </li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited to get this.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this one because of the positive reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried toms and a few others, but feel that this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products</li>
            <li>I tried it, and it didn&#x27;t stop the sweating (which was ok, because it&#x27;s natural) but it did NOTHING for the odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched and tried many of the natural deodorants from the health food stores.  </li>
            <li>now it seems to be better somewhat natural deodorants</li>
            <li>If you actually go outside, on just a warm day, maybe run an errand, etc.</li>
            <li>The Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Fresh works too, but I don&#x27;t like the scent</li>
            <li>Searching for an unscented antiperspirant to replace Mennen Speed stick Fresh that I used for years but is discontinued.  </li>
            <li>No artificial chemicals.</li>
            <li>Even though it says no scent it does smell fresh.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it isn&#x27;t an anti-perspirant, but that is kind of the reason I sought it out, was to avoid aluminum.</li>
            <li>I will buy the fresh from now on.</li>
            <li>I would rather apply deodorant with aluminum than have triclosan be absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use the Crystone stick for about 3 years before I developed an allergy to that</li>
            <li>It works much better than Crystal, and is completely hypogenic.  </li>
            <li>As the day goes on the scent does kind of fade, but I found that using this in the summertime, it takes several applications to ward off body odor</li>
            <li>So if this one didn&#x27;t work for you perhaps try the Fresh version.</li>
            <li>Have you ever used antiperspirant and then your armpits just sweat it right off?</li>
            <li>Given the fact that Arm &amp; Hammer makes great products for laundry detergent, cleaning, and their basic Baking Soda we all love and use to get rid of troublesome odors, their deodorant falls short of making your underarms smell after a busy day at work.</li>
            <li>First of all I had a bit of mild burning reaction for about 15 minutes right after application during first week of use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing they were going after the crunchy, organic crowd with this new formula and rebranding, but I don&#x27;t know what kind of natural product could cause a reaction like this (besides poison ivy).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product wears out rather quickly, and if you need whole day protection and you sweat, you might look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>so I thought using this would be a great way to prevent yellow stains on white t-shirts and undershirts because it&#x27;s aluminum-free.</li>
            <li>MenScience Advanced Fragrance Free Deodorant and several others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very low-key citrus (like orange) scent when you first put it on, but that fades pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been searching for something more natural to put on your body, I highly recommend giving Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials a try.</li>
            <li>i bought this because i go camping regularly and all the unnatural smells like cologne, shampoo, soap, and deodorant attract many insects.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love it, but it still left me stinky.</li>
            <li>Even though it says unscented, it actually has more of a baby powder scent, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>It stays on the job for about 8 hours, and this is even in hot, humid Florida.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really works!</li>
            <li>So I sweat when I get hot...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hot</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>; the scent is more for a male.  </li>
            <li>Although I am a woman, I have been using male deodorants for years, because I felt like they worked better and kept me smelling \\&quot;fresh\\</li>
            <li>I thought this was a better choice over using regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>Will see when it gets hot.</li>
            <li>I experience irritation from most anti-perspirants and this one was no different.  </li>
            <li>I expected it to be more natural and better for me, but I do not like it.</li>
            <li>I will say that I am not extremely prone to strong body odor</li>
            <li>Mennen, go back to the \\&quot;original formula\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>After using this deodorant for the last couple of months, here is what I&#x27;ve noticed:  - Lemon/citrus smell, it&#x27;s pretty strong for the first hour or so, wears off after that.</li>
            <li>I think the ingredients naturally smell citrus-like, which smells clean.</li>
            <li>This is the only underarm deodorant product I have found that has natural ingredients yet is reasonably effective.</li>
            <li>its better than other natural deodorizers as in it does not melt or feel like a paste, instead it glides quite easily.</li>
            <li>:) I go all day long without smelling like armpits.</li>
            <li>Turns out this is a little stick of MAGIC!</li>
            <li>and I work closely with large groups of people</li>
            <li>this product sounded too good to be true, but I decided I&#x27;d take the risk of spending $3 for a possible waste.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who sweats more than the average, I&#x27;d probably stay away from this and try and find a different natural alternative.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different natural brands that don&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li>I was dissapointed because I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>it just smells very \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It has a very wet/greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>The smell is present and it smells like cheap synthetic soap.</li>
            <li>And really none of them work for any amount of time.  </li>
            <li>but they really don&#x27;t advertise it.  </li>
            <li>I needed something without a lot of additives for my very athletic kids.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Scent isn&#x27;t really existant.</li>
            <li>It was much stronger than I thought it would be based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually really irritated with this product.</li>
            <li>It is VERY scented like oranges.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works very well</li>
            <li>I was happiest, though, with my old Speedstick Fresh.  </li>
            <li>If I apply too much I smell like the deodorant.</li>
            <li>product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Has a clear and distinct orange/citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well without any toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>that Arm &amp; Hammer provides aluminum free deodorant that ACTUALLY works, unlike Tom&#x27;s and the crystal products.</li>
            <li>worked ok for a few hours, but still didn&#x27;t leave me smelling as fresh at the end of the day...</li>
            <li>but so far it seems safe, just not something that has to be added to soaps in such widespread fashion.</li>
            <li>Seems less toxic, quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have long looked for a good deo that keeps me dry</li>
            <li>I came across the A&amp;H Essentials Natural at Wal-Mart and then they stopped carrying it right after I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Most other products irritate my skin, but this one does not.</li>
            <li>Does much better than other brands I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it stained the pits of my shirts, which is a problem I never had with any other deodorant in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t do anything that brings you to sweat it will last throughout the day, any kind of sweating though and it won&#x27;t mask the smell at all.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and does not have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>They go on with a little bit of a gel or light layer on the underarm, but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li>and I tend to sweat more than the average person</li>
            <li>but this ruins that for sure.</li>
            <li>I have a new friend!</li>
            <li>Hard to find a good natural unscented Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and I live in an area that can be very humid.</li>
            <li>- If I showered and washed my pits a bit more vigorously (say, after a workout), there is a slight stinging sensation when I apply the deodorant.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve never suffered from sever perspiration and was mainly trying to find a way to cover or prevent the \\&quot;pit-stench\\</li>
            <li>Does a decent job of keeping the odor away without using the aluminum.  </li>
            <li>It has very little or no odor by itself and yet works great on me, a 58 year old male.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t want to stink to high heaven while its doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t want to stink to high heaven while its doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is conscience of what you are putting on your body.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my 8 year son who has started Getty a little musty after an active day lol.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely stop the sweating, but I have noticed I don&#x27;t sweat as much.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it&#x27;s ALL natural,  </li>
            <li>This works and does not have most of the harsh chemicals and additives that I am trying to avoid as they grow.</li>
            <li>After searching for more natural deodorant alternatives, I finally stumbled across this Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials product and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li>I was having a reaction to my normal deodorant and had to switch to this.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive, and although this does still make me a little itchy, it&#x27;s so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I live in FL where people sweat.</li>
            <li>The scented is too strong, all the other natural deodorants cause chapness under the arms.      </li>
            <li>So I search Amazon for a natural Deodorant (not antiperspirant, two very different things) that is strong and lasting.</li>
            <li>It really is unscented and seems to work just as well if not a bit better, for me at least.</li>
            <li>Not super strong, but if you are allergic to fragrances, it will give you a headache until you(if you can) get used to it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good all natural deodorant that actually works</li>
            <li>This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used under the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; label that actually works.</li>
            <li>I would be capitalizing on this product because it&#x27;s truly natural and it works!  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered a stick on Amazon and later found that it is sold at my local Rite Aid.</li>
            <li>I am still a big fan of Arm and Hammer Baking Soda and recommend it for brushing your teeth and many other uses.  </li>
            <li>No sticky feel, no overwhelming smell and refreshing to know that there are no harsh chemicals in it!</li>
            <li>I have seen the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent of this at Walgreens, but I am only interested in the unscented version.  </li>
            <li>My kids and I are all very chemically sensitive so although the citrus cent is natural, it still contains natural salicylates which we react to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first and only deodorant that hasn&#x27;t managed to stop me smelling.</li>
            <li>I have been on a constant search to find a natural deodorant, and many of them fall short on the essential functions that deodorant is supposed to perform.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work any better and left me with slight irritation in under arms.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it works, goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey.</li>
            <li>Clearly, there is a price to pay if you want to avoid aluminum-based compounds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on completely clear and works all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to go natural with my deodorant.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand that, but some people would not be bothered, especially if they don&#x27;t have much sense of smell.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it&#x27;s very unattracted--even if it&#x27;s only me who notices.</li>
            <li>and I bought the Thai crystal spray that&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s perfectly natural and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and has not caused any problems even with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend to a person with sensitive skin or anybody else for that matter.</li>
            <li>Yet it had to be able to provide at least an all-day odor control.</li>
            <li>Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Natural Deodorant Unscented does in fact have a scent</li>
            <li>So if you are sensitive to natural fragrances, this may not work for you.</li>
            <li>With all the cancers out there, specifically breast cancer, which I&#x27;ve always figured was from the aluminum in anti-perspirant deodorant, I&#x27;m turning to natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I do frequently sweat at my job</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this Natural Deodorant by Arm &amp; Hammer by chance.</li>
            <li>it was the same as Ultra Max which I really like, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It might be unscented, but the natural ingredients have their scents.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 yr old son.</li>
            <li>I like this deodorant - all natural.</li>
            <li>but it did nothing to curb sweat or odor, whereas the power of baking soda is used in Arm &amp; Hammer as a natural alternative to aluminum-laden product, and it works well.</li>
            <li>I bought a 6-pack a long-long time ago(can&#x27;t remember really) and I have 2 left...</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking, natural and unscented, doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be a natural scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally to those hung up on &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34; I will point out that apricot pits are about as natural as it gets and they contain cyanide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>How can you call a product natural if it contains propylene glycol?</li>
            <li>A&amp;H make two natural deodorants, this nearly unscented version and the &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li>But as is par for the course w/ natural deodorants, if you sweat, you have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see how you can call something natural if it includes ingredients that turn into dioxin,</li>
            <li>It distinctly smells like lemon but less than a normal deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This deordorant.works well most of the time but in Texas when it is really hot sticky weather, it can fail.  </li>
            <li>I wish it lasted as long as the more harsh deodorants.    </li>
            <li>For the first few weeks it did what it was supposed to, but after a while it began to make my underarms itch INTENSELY.</li>
            <li>(In particular, 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (external) (2,8-DCDD) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) are produced.</li>
            <li>This was a first for me because my skin is not very sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had any kind of trouble like this from various other deodorants.</li>
            <li>Also, it goes on &#x27;wetter&#x27; or stickier than I like, and stays (less) sticky through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a modest sweater and don&#x27;t stink much during normal activity, or after 5 mile run, so sometimes go without deoderant or antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few including Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Deodorant Stick-Unscented, Naturally Fresh Roll On Deodorant Crystal,  </li>
            <li>I tried it several times, I hoped for the best... but to me, and for my needs -- this stuff is worthless.    </li>
            <li>The Unscented variety actually has a slight citrus hint to it, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t add any EXTRA scent to it, other than what the ingredients themselves already had, but this has a VERY STRONG orange/citrus scent, and I think it smells rather foul after a few hours of even wearing it under normal/everyday conditions.</li>
            <li>Also, my research had indicated that using an antiperspirant is not particularly healthy because it prevents your armpits from secreting pollutants and stuff - which is the main reason you sweat in the first place.</li>
            <li>For the first few days I sweated a lot, but by the end of the first week, that had stopped completely except in conditions of extreme exertion.</li>
            <li>I actually like the way it smells and have been pleasantly surprised at the end of the day when my armpits still smell like the deodorant and not b.o.</li>
            <li>I had to switch back to my old deodorant and trash this one.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a natural deodorant that both works, and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  </li>
            <li>For years, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually deodorizes.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t completely prevent me from sweating.</li>
            <li>This is the third \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Kind of uncomfortable for 5-10 minutes until it goes away.  </li>
            <li>Works better than my secret antiperspirant and probably healthier.</li>
            <li>The unscented version has a slight lime-ish scent to it but is very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Most natural products have failed us.  </li>
            <li>Second, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, a crystal stone works much better than this fake natural product.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t last long and has a slight sticky feel to it, I think it&#x27;s still worth your health in the end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how dry I am with this product too.  </li>
            <li>i got tired of overpowering deodorants with strong scent.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I was happy to find it.</li>
            <li> It works great too.</li>
            <li> so in a couple hours, it doesn&#x27;t smell great anymore,</li>
            <li> Even after running and even my clothes smell great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great that I can buy it online.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> and now he loves it too, so its great for men and women.</li>
            <li> I bought both the \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; scent and the unscented to try and see which I liked best.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son and worked just great.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice, it doesn&#x27;t burn, it works.</li>
            <li> The deodorant has a REALLY nice scent!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it would just mix with my sweat and my armpits had this combination of pleasant, yet funky smell and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to eliminate toxins if I can, and deoderant and face creams were two good places to start.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good this deodorant is.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> and of course I want to smell good all the time.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but I dohave to reapply after 12 hours to maintain optimum freshness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that good products have to go by the wayside.</li>
            <li> and it seemed like it&#x27;d be a good choice.</li>
            <li> This is a good option if you want to avoid chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I have not had good luck using deodorants instead of anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> , the best I&#x27;ve used are Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials and the MenScience Advanced.</li>
            <li> I find this works well, it allows me to sweat and flush out toxins while keeping me smelling good.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t need antiperspirant so this seemed like a good choice.</li>
            <li> Good buy for people looking for deoderant as opposed to antipersperant.</li>
            <li> Works good, but it does have a orangish scent to it.</li>
            <li> If they ever perfect the unscented part, though, I&#x27;d sure love to find a healthy unscented deodorant to try!</li>
            <li> This is a great, safe deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Great &amp; safe for children.</li>
            <li> this deodorant has a great smell and best of all, it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> I found this product about 2 years ago - and I love it!</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews on the smell but decided to give it a try anyway, hoping for the best... an unscented, aluminum-free deodorant would be just perfect!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy this deodorant is aluminum free.</li>
            <li> It kind of smells like citronella, but</li>
            <li> : well as much as I liked this product in the beginning, I no longer us it.</li>
            <li> For me both provide effective all-day under-arm odor</li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest here and say that the deodorant &#x27;crystal&#x27; didn&#x27;t work for me; neither did any of the Tom&#x27;s brand stuff (except for the anti-perspirant, which does have aluminum in it).  </li>
            <li> He liked the smell and wetness protection but just didn&#x27;t agree with his skin.</li>
            <li> That is a nice plus to the product.</li>
            <li> The unscented is kind of misleading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get myself some soon because after all these years of using the kind with aluminum in it, I need a safer alternative.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff, and has a great light citrus smell when first applied.</li>
            <li> great clean smelling deodorant without all the aluminum and chemicals.</li>
            <li> it says its unscented but it has a very strong lemon smell or something like that, had to give them away</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect!  </li>
            <li> Overall, great effective product at a great rate and nice smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, &amp; these A&amp;H are my fave as well as the Weleda Rose spray deodorant.</li>
            <li> so i got this stuff yesterday afternoon and applied it right away; great scent, light and breezy!</li>
            <li> If you are lucky and don&#x27;t have any body odor (something that I&#x27;m constantly aware of when I sweat) then it would work perfectly fine--for me</li>
            <li> The first month I experienced some itching and irritation but didn&#x27;t think anything abnormal of it because I don&#x27;t have any allergies.</li>
            <li> The scent is very, very light, with notes of chamomile, geranium, and orange peel.</li>
            <li> It was very lightly scented, almost unscented.  </li>
            <li> very light smell even though it says unscented.</li>
            <li> bottom line is that this is a very good product for patients with eczema or very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, when I apply just a bit and pat myself with a towel after I cannot smell it easily and the product is still effective.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found my deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> the more I thought about it,</li>
            <li> the more I sweat.</li>
            <li> I have about more than 3/4 of it just sitting underneath my sink.</li>
            <li> Arm and Hammer unscented is my favorite deodorate, period.  </li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine on days of rest, because if I use antiperspirants too many days in a row I develop sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love.</li>
            <li> This is an ok deodorant, but not an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s refreshing.     </li>
            <li> I love baking soda for my teeth, so I thought I would try this deodorant.    </li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t pay more than that for them.  </li>
            <li> You will still perspire, as this is not an antiperspirant, but I think that is healthy (antiperspirants all contain aluminum in some form).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found just dressing more appropriately so that I don&#x27;t sweat</li>
            <li> does a better job at keeping me from getting smelly than this deodorant does.  </li>
            <li> Maybe ladies will like it better.</li>
            <li> I love how this deoderant doesn&#x27;t leave stains on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> It helped somewhat better than most but after a while the scent goes away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with how well it works.want to use aluminum products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with how well it works.</li>
            <li> and it seems to help the sticky feel and for you to smell better longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I seem to allergic to most deodorants.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; somewhere to gain the healthy benefit.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for any better.</li>
            <li> Mind you, I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of smelling like a guy, but it was the best solution I could come up with.</li>
            <li> Paraben and aluminum free!</li>
            <li> Love this product, will order again</li>
            <li> I love the A&amp;H Essentials brand though, for sure.</li>
            <li> Triclosan has been removed from most products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Like many of my patients I am allergic to aluminum based antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> While it can be an irritant in eczema patients if the concentrations are over 5% it is found in many oral and injectable medications as well as dog food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to work OK.  </li>
            <li> It really keeps the funk at bay lol.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this is better than that of Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> Love the citrus scent and wont leave sticky residue on your armpits.</li>
            <li> one of the most toxic pollutants know.</li>
            <li> All great, fine experience, thanks!</li>
            <li> I am now a loyal user (unless I start making my own).  </li>
            <li> I will easily pay more to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great natural deodorizer product!  </li>
            <li> Very good at controlling both odor and wetness, and I&#x27;m a big sweater!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is aluminum &amp; paraben free.  </li>
            <li> It has a lemon smell and works great for a couple hours, but by the end of the day seems to be completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Sure it claims to be Aluminium free.</li>
            <li> Wonderful choice when looking for a more chemical free alternative to other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural, gluten free, deodorant that works!!!  </li>
            <li> Very light, fresh, citrusy scent  Keeps me stink free!</li>
            <li> It is unscented, however, it has a very nice natural lemony smell.  </li>
            <li> , I smell fresh (it&#x27;s a citrusy scent that is absolutely delightful and not overpowering in any way)and because the stick applies \\&quot;clear\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t have to worry about white goop getting all over my shirts.</li>
            <li> It absorbs seemingly very quickly.</li>
            <li> if you have strong body odor issues, you may have to assess this product yourself to see if it will work for you.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent is too strong for me, not a fan.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants and this one is BY FAR the best.</li>
            <li> As for this deodorant, if you put it on and do nothing all day, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> All I want is to not stink and this works fine.</li>
            <li> Fine product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well and smells fine.</li>
            <li> But because of the huge price difference I&#x27;ve settled on the Arm &amp; Hammer as my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By far the best natural deodorant out there.</li>
            <li> These A&amp;H natural deodorants work the best of all the natural ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The deodorant says its unscented, it does have a light citrus smell which is not over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants in my quest for the best.</li>
            <li> I enjoy shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This does work and it does NOT have aluminum, which is fantastic, but what&#x27;s up with the triclosan?</li>
            <li> I tried the men&#x27;s science advanced (4x the price)</li>
            <li> this product does not and keeps me odor free.</li>
            <li> It dries to a light feeling</li>
            <li> , it is light and citrus-y.</li>
            <li> Arm &amp; Hammer is a really great brand for people looking for an all-natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> I decided I do like the FRESH scent better though vs the unscented.</li>
            <li> Arm &amp; Hammer uses all natural ingredients so this is a really good choice if you are avoiding chemicals.</li>
            <li> be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> for many years after learning that most deodorants contained aluminum, i have tried various \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones that would for the most part cover the odor, but i suppose i sweat like a pig because they didnt seem to help control the sweating.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find an affordable deodorant at the aisle that is also &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Mennen ruined their original Speedstick when they updated it.  </li>
            <li> I read that the unscented had a light, sweet citrus scent</li>
            <li> I ordered unscented, because that&#x27;s the kind I bought (the label said), and they sent me the other kind, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to see so many positive reviews of Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Antiperspirant Deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a personal choice to be OK with Triclosan as I feel it is partly why this deodorant is so effective.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it is as effective as your normal, chemical filled deodorants, but it comes pretty close!</li>
            <li> Then I saw Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials in my local drugstore, and remembered baking soda can be a pretty good deodorant, and who knows better than Arm &amp; Hammer?</li>
            <li> I previously used Right Guard for 25 years and it worked great except like most others, it contains aluminum and it&#x27;s aerosol.     </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant so much</li>
            <li> I would buy more if I found them at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This smells good but doesn&#x27;t last for anything.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Speed-Stick Unscented Solid.</li>
            <li> None of the stuff that causes irritation (I am a sensitive kind of guy) and doesn&#x27;t have fragrances either.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the product, the citrus smell was really strong, but either I got used to it, or it mellowed out, because I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this one with no scent, but it has a very slight, extremely pleasant scent that I love.</li>
            <li> used the standard Arm &amp; Hammer unscented for a while and liked it just fine.</li>
            <li> No product keeps me entirely odor free, but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The other is Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which, in my experience, smells great but doesn&#x27;t work,</li>
            <li> I love Arm &amp; Hammer as a company though and was willing to try their other natural deodorant, the fresh instead of this unscented one and that one has worked excellent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I would go with Tom&#x27;s of Maine unscented, which has mild, citrus&#x27;y fragrance.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the non-Essentials version is easier to find now that this line of deodorants bombed.</li>
            <li> Smells like orange, but quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> I started looking when I was pregnant and have been using this one ever since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spend a little more money and get a better one with better ingrediants.</li>
            <li> I was also very pleased that it was unscented as the only smell I want is my cologne.     </li>
            <li> This one has a very light scent that pretty much disappears once you apply it.</li>
            <li> Its actually a rather nice smell and pretty strong but still, not unscented.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t think it worked very well on the odor at first, but the longer I used it, the better it worked.</li>
            <li> probably won&#x27;t buy this deodorant again and instead still try and find a better deodorant that is natural and does not leave any marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li> But what I discovered was REALLY pleasing and a surprise!!  </li>
            <li> so I was pretty excited to get this.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this one because of the positive reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried toms and a few others, but feel that this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products</li>
            <li> I tried it, and it didn&#x27;t stop the sweating (which was ok, because it&#x27;s natural) but it did NOTHING for the odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched and tried many of the natural deodorants from the health food stores.  </li>
            <li> now it seems to be better somewhat natural deodorants</li>
            <li> If you actually go outside, on just a warm day, maybe run an errand, etc.</li>
            <li> The Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Fresh works too, but I don&#x27;t like the scent</li>
            <li> Searching for an unscented antiperspirant to replace Mennen Speed stick Fresh that I used for years but is discontinued.  </li>
            <li> No artificial chemicals.</li>
            <li> Even though it says no scent it does smell fresh.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it isn&#x27;t an anti-perspirant, but that is kind of the reason I sought it out, was to avoid aluminum.</li>
            <li> I will buy the fresh from now on.</li>
            <li> I would rather apply deodorant with aluminum than have triclosan be absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use the Crystone stick for about 3 years before I developed an allergy to that</li>
            <li> It works much better than Crystal, and is completely hypogenic.  </li>
            <li> As the day goes on the scent does kind of fade, but I found that using this in the summertime, it takes several applications to ward off body odor</li>
            <li> So if this one didn&#x27;t work for you perhaps try the Fresh version.</li>
            <li> Have you ever used antiperspirant and then your armpits just sweat it right off?</li>
            <li> Given the fact that Arm &amp; Hammer makes great products for laundry detergent, cleaning, and their basic Baking Soda we all love and use to get rid of troublesome odors, their deodorant falls short of making your underarms smell after a busy day at work.</li>
            <li> First of all I had a bit of mild burning reaction for about 15 minutes right after application during first week of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing they were going after the crunchy, organic crowd with this new formula and rebranding, but I don&#x27;t know what kind of natural product could cause a reaction like this (besides poison ivy).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product wears out rather quickly, and if you need whole day protection and you sweat, you might look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> so I thought using this would be a great way to prevent yellow stains on white t-shirts and undershirts because it&#x27;s aluminum-free.</li>
            <li> MenScience Advanced Fragrance Free Deodorant and several others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very low-key citrus (like orange) scent when you first put it on, but that fades pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been searching for something more natural to put on your body, I highly recommend giving Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials a try.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i go camping regularly and all the unnatural smells like cologne, shampoo, soap, and deodorant attract many insects.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it, but it still left me stinky.</li>
            <li> Even though it says unscented, it actually has more of a baby powder scent, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> It stays on the job for about 8 hours, and this is even in hot, humid Florida.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really works!</li>
            <li> So I sweat when I get hot...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hot</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> ; the scent is more for a male.  </li>
            <li> Although I am a woman, I have been using male deodorants for years, because I felt like they worked better and kept me smelling \\&quot;fresh\\</li>
            <li> I thought this was a better choice over using regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> Will see when it gets hot.</li>
            <li> I experience irritation from most anti-perspirants and this one was no different.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be more natural and better for me, but I do not like it.</li>
            <li> I will say that I am not extremely prone to strong body odor</li>
            <li> Mennen, go back to the \\&quot;original formula\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> After using this deodorant for the last couple of months, here is what I&#x27;ve noticed:  - Lemon/citrus smell, it&#x27;s pretty strong for the first hour or so, wears off after that.</li>
            <li> I think the ingredients naturally smell citrus-like, which smells clean.</li>
            <li> This is the only underarm deodorant product I have found that has natural ingredients yet is reasonably effective.</li>
            <li> its better than other natural deodorizers as in it does not melt or feel like a paste, instead it glides quite easily.</li>
            <li> :) I go all day long without smelling like armpits.</li>
            <li> Turns out this is a little stick of MAGIC!</li>
            <li> and I work closely with large groups of people</li>
            <li> this product sounded too good to be true, but I decided I&#x27;d take the risk of spending $3 for a possible waste.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the kind of person who sweats more than the average, I&#x27;d probably stay away from this and try and find a different natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different natural brands that don&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> I was dissapointed because I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> it just smells very \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It has a very wet/greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> The smell is present and it smells like cheap synthetic soap.</li>
            <li> And really none of them work for any amount of time.  </li>
            <li> but they really don&#x27;t advertise it.  </li>
            <li> I needed something without a lot of additives for my very athletic kids.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t really existant.</li>
            <li> It was much stronger than I thought it would be based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really irritated with this product.</li>
            <li> It is VERY scented like oranges.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works very well</li>
            <li> I was happiest, though, with my old Speedstick Fresh.  </li>
            <li> If I apply too much I smell like the deodorant.</li>
            <li> product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Has a clear and distinct orange/citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well without any toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> that Arm &amp; Hammer provides aluminum free deodorant that ACTUALLY works, unlike Tom&#x27;s and the crystal products.</li>
            <li> worked ok for a few hours, but still didn&#x27;t leave me smelling as fresh at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> but so far it seems safe, just not something that has to be added to soaps in such widespread fashion.</li>
            <li> Seems less toxic, quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have long looked for a good deo that keeps me dry</li>
            <li> I came across the A&amp;H Essentials Natural at Wal-Mart and then they stopped carrying it right after I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Most other products irritate my skin, but this one does not.</li>
            <li> Does much better than other brands I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it stained the pits of my shirts, which is a problem I never had with any other deodorant in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t do anything that brings you to sweat it will last throughout the day, any kind of sweating though and it won&#x27;t mask the smell at all.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and does not have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> They go on with a little bit of a gel or light layer on the underarm, but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li> and I tend to sweat more than the average person</li>
            <li> but this ruins that for sure.</li>
            <li> I have a new friend!</li>
            <li> Hard to find a good natural unscented Deodorant.  </li>
            <li> and I live in an area that can be very humid.</li>
            <li> - If I showered and washed my pits a bit more vigorously (say, after a workout), there is a slight stinging sensation when I apply the deodorant.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never suffered from sever perspiration and was mainly trying to find a way to cover or prevent the \\&quot;pit-stench\\</li>
            <li> Does a decent job of keeping the odor away without using the aluminum.  </li>
            <li> It has very little or no odor by itself and yet works great on me, a 58 year old male.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want to stink to high heaven while its doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want to stink to high heaven while its doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is conscience of what you are putting on your body.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 8 year son who has started Getty a little musty after an active day lol.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely stop the sweating, but I have noticed I don&#x27;t sweat as much.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it&#x27;s ALL natural,  </li>
            <li> This works and does not have most of the harsh chemicals and additives that I am trying to avoid as they grow.</li>
            <li> After searching for more natural deodorant alternatives, I finally stumbled across this Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials product and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> I was having a reaction to my normal deodorant and had to switch to this.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive, and although this does still make me a little itchy, it&#x27;s so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I live in FL where people sweat.</li>
            <li> The scented is too strong, all the other natural deodorants cause chapness under the arms.      </li>
            <li> So I search Amazon for a natural Deodorant (not antiperspirant, two very different things) that is strong and lasting.</li>
            <li> It really is unscented and seems to work just as well if not a bit better, for me at least.</li>
            <li> Not super strong, but if you are allergic to fragrances, it will give you a headache until you(if you can) get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good all natural deodorant that actually works</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used under the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; label that actually works.</li>
            <li> I would be capitalizing on this product because it&#x27;s truly natural and it works!  </li>
            <li> I originally ordered a stick on Amazon and later found that it is sold at my local Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> I am still a big fan of Arm and Hammer Baking Soda and recommend it for brushing your teeth and many other uses.  </li>
            <li> No sticky feel, no overwhelming smell and refreshing to know that there are no harsh chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> I have seen the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent of this at Walgreens, but I am only interested in the unscented version.  </li>
            <li> My kids and I are all very chemically sensitive so although the citrus cent is natural, it still contains natural salicylates which we react to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first and only deodorant that hasn&#x27;t managed to stop me smelling.</li>
            <li> I have been on a constant search to find a natural deodorant, and many of them fall short on the essential functions that deodorant is supposed to perform.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work any better and left me with slight irritation in under arms.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it works, goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey.</li>
            <li> Clearly, there is a price to pay if you want to avoid aluminum-based compounds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on completely clear and works all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go natural with my deodorant.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand that, but some people would not be bothered, especially if they don&#x27;t have much sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it&#x27;s very unattracted--even if it&#x27;s only me who notices.</li>
            <li> and I bought the Thai crystal spray that&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s perfectly natural and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and has not caused any problems even with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend to a person with sensitive skin or anybody else for that matter.</li>
            <li> Yet it had to be able to provide at least an all-day odor control.</li>
            <li> Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Natural Deodorant Unscented does in fact have a scent</li>
            <li> So if you are sensitive to natural fragrances, this may not work for you.</li>
            <li> With all the cancers out there, specifically breast cancer, which I&#x27;ve always figured was from the aluminum in anti-perspirant deodorant, I&#x27;m turning to natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I do frequently sweat at my job</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this Natural Deodorant by Arm &amp; Hammer by chance.</li>
            <li> it was the same as Ultra Max which I really like, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It might be unscented, but the natural ingredients have their scents.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 yr old son.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant - all natural.</li>
            <li> but it did nothing to curb sweat or odor, whereas the power of baking soda is used in Arm &amp; Hammer as a natural alternative to aluminum-laden product, and it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought a 6-pack a long-long time ago(can&#x27;t remember really) and I have 2 left...</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking, natural and unscented, doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be a natural scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally to those hung up on &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34; I will point out that apricot pits are about as natural as it gets and they contain cyanide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> How can you call a product natural if it contains propylene glycol?</li>
            <li> A&amp;H make two natural deodorants, this nearly unscented version and the &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> But as is par for the course w/ natural deodorants, if you sweat, you have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see how you can call something natural if it includes ingredients that turn into dioxin,</li>
            <li> It distinctly smells like lemon but less than a normal deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This deordorant.works well most of the time but in Texas when it is really hot sticky weather, it can fail.  </li>
            <li> I wish it lasted as long as the more harsh deodorants.    </li>
            <li> For the first few weeks it did what it was supposed to, but after a while it began to make my underarms itch INTENSELY.</li>
            <li> (In particular, 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (external) (2,8-DCDD) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) are produced.</li>
            <li> This was a first for me because my skin is not very sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had any kind of trouble like this from various other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Also, it goes on &#x27;wetter&#x27; or stickier than I like, and stays (less) sticky through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a modest sweater and don&#x27;t stink much during normal activity, or after 5 mile run, so sometimes go without deoderant or antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few including Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Deodorant Stick-Unscented, Naturally Fresh Roll On Deodorant Crystal,  </li>
            <li> I tried it several times, I hoped for the best... but to me, and for my needs -- this stuff is worthless.    </li>
            <li> The Unscented variety actually has a slight citrus hint to it, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t add any EXTRA scent to it, other than what the ingredients themselves already had, but this has a VERY STRONG orange/citrus scent, and I think it smells rather foul after a few hours of even wearing it under normal/everyday conditions.</li>
            <li> Also, my research had indicated that using an antiperspirant is not particularly healthy because it prevents your armpits from secreting pollutants and stuff - which is the main reason you sweat in the first place.</li>
            <li> For the first few days I sweated a lot, but by the end of the first week, that had stopped completely except in conditions of extreme exertion.</li>
            <li> I actually like the way it smells and have been pleasantly surprised at the end of the day when my armpits still smell like the deodorant and not b.o.</li>
            <li> I had to switch back to my old deodorant and trash this one.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a natural deodorant that both works, and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  </li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually deodorizes.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t completely prevent me from sweating.</li>
            <li> This is the third \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Kind of uncomfortable for 5-10 minutes until it goes away.  </li>
            <li> Works better than my secret antiperspirant and probably healthier.</li>
            <li> The unscented version has a slight lime-ish scent to it but is very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Most natural products have failed us.  </li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, a crystal stone works much better than this fake natural product.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t last long and has a slight sticky feel to it, I think it&#x27;s still worth your health in the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how dry I am with this product too.  </li>
            <li> i got tired of overpowering deodorants with strong scent.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve tried other deodorants with little success as I have, I&#x27;d suggest giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve tried other deodorants with little success as I have, I&#x27;d suggest giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural deodorant because the aluminum in other deodorants darken my underarms.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 4 other natural deodorants, including the crystal rock type, but they all caused rashes and itching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found myself pretty smelly if I am working hard several hours after putting this on.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and your typical deodorants (dove, suave, etc) break me out.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get away from the market saturated with products full of aluminum and so many other terrible chemicals.</li>
            <li> Long lasting deodorant with a long lasting effect.</li>
            <li> It last a long time, this block, and it doesn&#x27;t have any aluminum stuff in it, and you don&#x27;t have to put it on with your fingers, and you don&#x27;t have to spray it on (Oh, my God!)</li>
            <li> Works great as far as a deodorant/antiperspirant, but the smell is disgusting.</li>
            <li> The scent that I detect is a minimal, citrus-like scent that is not objectionable to me and is due to the natural ingredients some of which are: Chamomile Oil, Coriander Oil, Geranium Oil, and Orange Peel Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I seem to have a minor allergy to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get away all of the chemicals surrounding us these days and was having quite a bit of trouble finding a natural (sans aluminum) deodorant that works, and works well.</li>
            <li> I had just as bad luck with this one as I did with many other natural deodorants, by the time noon came around, I smelt like an un-showered musty hippy.</li>
            <li> as a deodorizer it works for a few hours but its not long lasting.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the other authorized stores but only Kroger had it.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, this one actually works.</li>
            <li> It works, doesn&#x27;t smell, and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> I like powders that go on dry and stay dry.  </li>
            <li> There are only a few out there, and the ones I&#x27;ve tried left me sticky and/or stinky.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two years now, and haven&#x27;t had a single underarm aluminum stain ruin any of my shirts.</li>
            <li> but now I wish I had bought every single one on the shelf.</li>
            <li> But this simply smells too strong and unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> It eventually left a dark line on my underarms</li>
            <li> I narrowed it down to deodorants lacking aluminum compounds (such as aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrex gly).</li>
            <li> there is a slight initial smell which goes</li>
            <li> It is &amp;#34;very smooth&amp;#34; going on, it DOES NOT leave white marks all over my clothes, AND I haven&#x27;t had body odor, smelled up my underarms on my tops, soiled them, or been wet under my arms!!!  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering, but it is really not unscented.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is too wet and runny for a stick.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a few to several hours, depending on your level of activity.</li>
            <li> so sweat was minimal, this deodorant just didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> Triclosan was found in Greifensee sediment that was over 30 years old, suggesting that triclosan is degraded or removed slowly in sediment.[10]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also leaves no white residue on black - yay!  </li>
            <li> When the skin under my arms isn&#x27;t raw and burning red, it is the consistency of leather.</li>
            <li> Super product, especially where there is a water shortage and needing to not smell bad, this is the product to get.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m limited I pray that the small use of Triclosan will not cause long term harm.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this deodorant for my boyfriend because all the other men&#x27;s deodorant irritated him and he refused to wear a women&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Still looking for a deoderant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum and some other ingredients in here</li>
            <li> I have had problems in the past trying to transition from antiperspraints to \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is their use of Triclosan which in some circles is not healthy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because I&#x27;ve been loyal to the Arm &amp; Hammer brand for most of my life, but they&#x27;ve seriously damaged my trust in them with this terrible product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be shopping around for other brands now.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (including The Rock), this one doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li> I finally stopped wearing this deodorant and no more sweating.</li>
            <li> While the other two (Tom&#x27;s and Earth Science) didn&#x27;t smell, I did.</li>
            <li> Not too pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Update, skin in and around the armpits are peeling off due to this deodorant.</li>
            <li> In the environment, triclosan may be degraded by microorganisms or react with sunlight, forming other compounds, which include between 3 and 12% of chlorophenols and dioxin</li>
            <li> It works and it lasts all day, no matter how active I am.</li>
            <li> I use this on days that I will be physically active and</li>
            <li> Does not have that nasty sticky feel like most natural deodorant do.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have never experienced a rash like this with any other hygienic products.</li>
            <li> I was a little sceptical about a deodorant only product, but I was tired of the rash in my armpits from traditional aluminum antiperspirant ingredients as well as the discoloration in all my clothes</li>
            <li> I think my armpits are even turning lighter (I suffer from dark underarms).</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use it, and it&#x27;s not worth returning.  </li>
            <li> No more grey stains on the arm pits of our shirts.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is not unscented.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating completely, but it is decreased to some extent.</li>
            <li> This natural deodorant product is designed without additional chemicals that are unnecessary for someone with kidney problems.</li>
            <li> Yet, just like a lot of other deodorants, it still leaves white marks on my clothes after wearing them (especially black shirts).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After about a week of using this product it irritated my underarms and it hurt to have my arms down by my side.</li>
            <li> I wondered if the deoderant would still work without the aluminum and other ingredients, and for me it does!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with all of the previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> I use the unscented; it does have a slight scent of citrus</li>
            <li> These used to be less than $2 at Walmart and now they are not sold at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> I sweat less</li>
            <li> I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine previously</li>
            <li> Always works and has never let me down - even in hot, muggy weather.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty rank, skunky lemony scent to it, that makes you smell like you ran out of regular deodorant and tried to use Pledge thinking no one would be the wiser.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be a little funky.</li>
            <li> I did a little research on aluminum-free deodorants and read the reviews on this one</li>
            <li> Not just a little skin peeling.</li>
            <li> This solved my allergy problem,  but there is no or little odor or wetness protection.</li>
            <li> I also want something with little to no perfumes because the intent is to not smell at all, not to smell \\&quot;good\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little like citronella candles,</li>
            <li> Does not work for me, even a little bit.</li>
            <li> and it makes my underarms a little tender.</li>
            <li> Also, this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lemon scent sticks to your clothes like glue, and even after multiple washings is damn near impossible to get out.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to antiperspirant deodorants, and this product is the least irritating one I have found.  </li>
            <li> This gets me to the mid-afternoon at work which is a bit awkward because I don&#x27;t want to reapply in the middle of the office and then smell like lemon/citrus for the next hour or so.    </li>
            <li> I tend to perspire heavily</li>
            <li> This has NO aluminum or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now</li>
            <li> You should save yourself the trouble and probably pass on this one.</li>
            <li> For everyday wear, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out something else.</li>
            <li> Considering that it&#x27;s natural, I thought I was weird.</li>
            <li> one, it&#x27;s not unscented, so right there we&#x27;re off to a bad start.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worst of all, this stuff gave me a pretty bad rash.</li>
            <li> Then I went back to regular deodorants and didn&#x27;t like the stains, the aluminum and all the other crap that it caused and had in</li>
            <li> the only other comment is that this does have a very faint citrus scent to it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is bad in any way nor is it scented like anything particular</li>
            <li> I never finished the product because it actually started burning under my arms a bit, and from what I&#x27;ve read one of the other ingredients is just as bad for you.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find women&#x27;s deodorant that is not an antiperspirant with aluminum compounds.  </li>
            <li> That is hardly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and is a know carcinogen.  </li>
            <li> Wrote this review before, but it looks like Arm &amp; Hammer re-listed the item to clear out all of the bad reviews it had.</li>
            <li> I do have one complaint, but it&#x27;s about the product description on Amazon: this deodorant IS NOT an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Knowing that it doesn&#x27;t contain any aluminum, I expected this would offer no protection, but boy was I wrong</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.    </li>
            <li> Scary that the metal in the other deodorants does that isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> Very shady.</li>
            <li> Sounds nasty, but it is true.  </li>
            <li> I live overseas and can shop in the base commissary</li>
            <li> I tried others, including Tom&#x27;s of Maine, and found them seriously lacking.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from the regular deodorants that are supposedly bad, so I tried this.</li>
            <li> Not pleasant to have that smell on your body.</li>
            <li> Next I am trying this:  [...]</li>
            <li> First the ingredients a terrible, almost all are quimical and cancer ingredients.</li>
            <li> They were weak, and poor at their jobs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product; you won&#x27;t be disappointed and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough finding unscented deoderant</li>
            <li> So you can see the frustrating cycle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product started burning after three days of use, it made me smell worse.</li>
            <li> It smells like a hint of menthol and sulfur, and ends up making my armpits smell worse than they would without it.</li>
            <li> It smells worse than BO.</li>
            <li> It smells citrusy, not that the smell is a real negative.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it makes my skin itch and gives me a rash.   </li>
            <li> Do be wary of the ingredients though-</li>
            <li> I was a skeptical and the reviews I read about it</li>
            <li> Contains triclosan which is known to be dangerous.</li>
            <li> It can be freezing cold and my armpits sweat.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has an unpleasant smell in itself, which did not improve when applied.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find just a deodorant, let alone one that is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Are they saying we smell so bad we need a pesticide under our arms to get rid of the stink?</li>
            <li> Let me start at the beginning: After hours of internet browsing, I came to the conclusion that the aluminum in my antiperspirant was bad for me.</li>
            <li> , I never smell badly.</li>
            <li> It is still absolutely painful, and the blows to my self confidence are noticeable to my close friends and colleagues.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the effectiveness of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Hated it.  </li>
            <li> the sweat protection is on par with the terrible aluminum variants.</li>
            <li> I was disgusted to realize this product contains triclosan.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been on a constant search to find a natural deodorant, and many of them fall short on the essential functions that deodorant is supposed to perform. Given the fact that Arm &amp; Hammer makes great products for laundry detergent, cleaning, and their basic Baking Soda we all love and use to get rid of troublesome odors, their deodorant falls short of making your underarms smell after a busy day at work. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients... but it smells like a man&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> great clean smelling deodorant without all the aluminum and chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is the only underarm deodorant product I have found that has natural ingredients yet is reasonably effective. Most other products irritate my skin, but this one does not. I tend to perspire heavily and I live in an area that can be very humid. No product keeps me entirely odor free, but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this deodorant for my boyfriend because all the other men&#x27;s deodorant irritated him and he refused to wear a women&#x27;s deodorant. The deodorant says its unscented, it does have a light citrus smell which is not over powering. My boyfriend loves it and is asking for more so ill be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go natural with my deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried toms and a few others, but feel that this is the best by far. Very good at controlling both odor and wetness, and I&#x27;m a big sweater!</li>
            <li> Contains triclosan which is known to be dangerous.</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve used under the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; label that actually works. It kind of smells like citronella, but whatever. It works and it lasts all day, no matter how active I am. I still don&#x27;t smell like B.O. at the end of the day. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get away from the market saturated with products full of aluminum and so many other terrible chemicals.</li>
            <li> I hightly recommend this deoderant. I&#x27;ve been trying to eliminate toxins if I can, and deoderant and face creams were two good places to start. I wondered if the deoderant would still work without the aluminum and other ingredients, and for me it does! I ordered from Amazon because I don&#x27;t see this brand in the stores I shop. Anyway, it works, goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good this deodorant is. And no aluminum. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant.  I will not buy any that has aluminum in it. Arm &amp; Hammer makes a great product.  I also like the unscented.  I am not into smelly perfume type deodorants.  I could no longer find this product on the store shelves in my area, that is what lead me to look online.  I am so glad I found my deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum. I actually like the way it smells and have been pleasantly surprised at the end of the day when my armpits still smell like the deodorant and not b.o. Doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating completely, but it is decreased to some extent. Good product.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere (!) in town, but couldn&#x27;t find this deodorant in stores. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it. My skin is extremely sensitive, and although this does still make me a little itchy, it&#x27;s so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It smells like food because a lot of herbs are used in it.  I can&#x27;t stand that, but some people would not be bothered, especially if they don&#x27;t have much sense of smell.  I threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This is a great, safe deodorant.  It&#x27;s tough finding unscented deoderant so I was happy to find it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 8 year son who has started Getty a little musty after an active day lol. This has NO aluminum or harsh chemicals. It works great too. Great &amp; safe for children.</li>
            <li> It does have a lemony smell to it, but after like one hour, I still had the \\&quot;B-O\\&quot; smell.  The only thing that has worked for me is Deodomom.  You might try it if Arm and Hammer doesn&#x27;t work for you!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores. I did find it once. That&#x27;s why I knew to look for it. But since then, that store stopped carrying it, and nobody else does, either. There are 46 million kinds of deodorant in any given store, and 2 of them don&#x27;t have aluminum something in them. One of those is a spray. The other is Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which, in my experience, smells great but doesn&#x27;t work, so in a couple hours, it doesn&#x27;t smell great anymore, if you know what I mean.    This is a solid block of deodorant, a stick, I think it&#x27;s called, and it&#x27;s a lot. It last a long time, this block, and it doesn&#x27;t have any aluminum stuff in it, and you don&#x27;t have to put it on with your fingers, and you don&#x27;t have to spray it on (Oh, my God!) Everything you could ask for. And it doesn&#x27;t stink. I ordered unscented, because that&#x27;s the kind I bought (the label said), and they sent me the other kind, but it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s not too strong-smelling, and it does the job, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. What can you say about a deodorant. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff. If you can&#x27;t use anti-perspirants, give it a try. Chances are you&#x27;ll like it. A lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants in my quest for the best. I try to stay away from the aluminum and paraben packed deodorants.     Arm and Hammer&#x27;s Essentials seems to be a winner. It works incredibly well.     I do have one complaint, but it&#x27;s about the product description on Amazon: this deodorant IS NOT an antiperspirant. It won&#x27;t stop sweating.     Other than that I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant so much and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;Not to be too graphic, but I&#x27;m a female and of course I want to smell good all the time. I always sweat! It can be freezing cold and my armpits sweat. Or if I even think of something that makes me nervous it&#x27;s like Niagra Falls in my armpits. Not only that, but when I sweat there&#x27;s definitely an odor. I used to have a lot of deodorants that had the flowery, perfumy smells and they worked, but it mixed with my b.o. and my clothes reeked! I don&#x27;t know why, but it&#x27;s very unattracted--even if it&#x27;s only me who notices. Sometimes it would just mix with my sweat and my armpits had this combination of pleasant, yet funky smell and the more I thought about it, the more I sweat. So you can see the frustrating cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products and I bought the Thai crystal spray that&#x27;s all natural. I tried it, and it didn&#x27;t stop the sweating (which was ok, because it&#x27;s natural) but it did NOTHING for the odor. I was dissapointed because I really wanted it to work. Although it did work for my sister-in-law, but just not for me. Then I went back to regular deodorants and didn&#x27;t like the stains, the aluminum and all the other crap that it caused and had in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this and figured I had nothing to lose. OH MY GOSH! I bought this one with no scent, but it has a very slight, extremely pleasant scent that I love. It doesn&#x27;t completely stop the sweating, but I have noticed I don&#x27;t sweat as much. My armpits don&#x27;t produce any odor---NONE! Even after running and even my clothes smell great. I just can&#x27;t get over the fact that I don&#x27;t have any b.o. and I&#x27;m even happier that it doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum!! I think my armpits are even turning lighter (I suffer from dark underarms). I can&#x27;t say enough for Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant. Definitely give it a try!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: well as much as I liked this product in the beginning, I no longer us it. I have about more than 3/4 of it just sitting underneath my sink. If you are lucky and don&#x27;t have any body odor (something that I&#x27;m constantly aware of when I sweat) then it would work perfectly fine--for me I think my body got used to the smell and so it didn&#x27;t work as well as in the beginning. I actually switched over to a clinical strength deodorant (although it leaves white marks) I don&#x27;t see that I will change deodorants in the future.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great!  I love the fact that it is aluminum &amp; paraben free.  I can&#x27;t find this in any of my local drug store or supermarkets in San Francisco, so it&#x27;s great that I can buy it online.</li>
            <li> The deodorant worked well all day, but caused some skin irritation on my pits. Therefore i can&#x27;t use it so its not for me.</li>
            <li> Arm and Hammer unscented is my favorite deodorate, period.  The scented is too strong, all the other natural deodorants cause chapness under the arms.      I can&#x27;t find the unscented version in the stores, so I had to order it online.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to antiperspirant deodorants, and this product is the least irritating one I have found.  I use this on days that I will be physically active and Tom&#x27;s of Maine on days of rest, because if I use antiperspirants too many days in a row I develop sensitivity.  This product works well, but I dohave to reapply after 12 hours to maintain optimum freshness.</li>
            <li> I like the scent because it&#x27;s not to over powering but idk what is in it but it makes my arm pits red and burn!! Even after a while after epilating them. Still looking for a deoderant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum and some other ingredients in here I don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;ll spend a little more money and get a better one with better ingrediants.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i go camping regularly and all the unnatural smells like cologne, shampoo, soap, and deodorant attract many insects. so i need everything to be unscented for my camping trips. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is bad in any way nor is it scented like anything particular it just smells very \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;. Its actually a rather nice smell and pretty strong but still, not unscented.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave permanent stains on the underarm area of my shirts. I narrowed it down to deodorants lacking aluminum compounds (such as aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrex gly). I tried others, including Tom&#x27;s of Maine, and found them seriously lacking. After only a couple hours, I would have to reapply the deodorants. They were weak, and poor at their jobs. Then I saw Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials in my local drugstore, and remembered baking soda can be a pretty good deodorant, and who knows better than Arm &amp; Hammer? So I grabbed the unscented version, because I prefer all of my toiletries to be unscented (the only thing I want to smell is my cologne). I fell in love. It eliminates the odors admirably, and no reapplication is necessary, unless I&#x27;ve been sweating a bit. The scent is very, very light, with notes of chamomile, geranium, and orange peel. Also, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two years now, and haven&#x27;t had a single underarm aluminum stain ruin any of my shirts.</li>
            <li> This is an ok deodorant, but not an antiperspirant.  It is not as described.  It has a very wet/greasy feel.  I won&#x27;t use it, and it&#x27;s not worth returning.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!</li>
            <li> for many years after learning that most deodorants contained aluminum, i have tried various \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones that would for the most part cover the odor, but i suppose i sweat like a pig because they didnt seem to help control the sweating. every morning i would wake up and my underarms would be sweaty and my bedroom would smell like a mens locker room BEFORE they showered! so i got this stuff yesterday afternoon and applied it right away; great scent, light and breezy! went to bed last night and woke up not smelling funky and sweating like a stuck pig! YAYYY i plan on buying a case of this stuff it WORKS!!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will. Does much better than other brands I have used over the years. I plan on keeping one in my bathroom from now on. I enjoy shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> First of all I had a bit of mild burning reaction for about 15 minutes right after application during first week of use.  The product wears out rather quickly, and if you need whole day protection and you sweat, you might look somewhere else. The smell is present and it smells like cheap synthetic soap. Clearly, there is a price to pay if you want to avoid aluminum-based compounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I would go with Tom&#x27;s of Maine unscented, which has mild, citrus&#x27;y fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with all of the previous reviews.  I&#x27;ve searched and tried many of the natural deodorants from the health food stores.  And really none of them work for any amount of time.  I previously used Right Guard for 25 years and it worked great except like most others, it contains aluminum and it&#x27;s aerosol.     I came across the A&amp;H Essentials Natural at Wal-Mart and then they stopped carrying it right after I started using it.  I looked at all the other authorized stores but only Kroger had it.  It&#x27;s great to see that Amazon has it. Of course what don&#x27;t they have.  This product works great and lasts all day. I will say I don&#x27;t like the smell of the scented product.  I use the unscented; it does have a slight scent of citrus but it&#x27;s refreshing.     A&amp;H has a great product on their hands but they really don&#x27;t advertise it.  I would be capitalizing on this product because it&#x27;s truly natural and it works!  Did you hear that A&amp;H Marketing!  What are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> I have had problems in the past trying to transition from antiperspraints to \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.  I&#x27;m surprised at how dry I am with this product too.  The only issue I have is their use of Triclosan which in some circles is not healthy to use.  Since I&#x27;m limited I pray that the small use of Triclosan will not cause long term harm.  Overall, great effective product at a great rate and nice smell. I originally ordered a stick on Amazon and later found that it is sold at my local Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> I love baking soda for my teeth, so I thought I would try this deodorant.    Unfortunately it makes my skin itch and gives me a rash.   I am still a big fan of Arm and Hammer Baking Soda and recommend it for brushing your teeth and many other uses.  Perhaps it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I would buy more if I found them at a reasonable price.  These used to be less than $2 at Walmart and now they are not sold at Walmart.  Now I can only find them online and I won&#x27;t pay more than that for them.  It&#x27;s a shame that good products have to go by the wayside.</li>
            <li> This does work and it does NOT have aluminum, which is fantastic, but what&#x27;s up with the triclosan? Are they saying we smell so bad we need a pesticide under our arms to get rid of the stink? Gee whiz.</li>
            <li> I needed something without a lot of additives for my very athletic kids.  Most natural products have failed us.  This works and does not have most of the harsh chemicals and additives that I am trying to avoid as they grow.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it, but it still left me stinky.</li>
            <li> as a deodorizer it works for a few hours but its not long lasting. its better than other natural deodorizers as in it does not melt or feel like a paste, instead it glides quite easily. there is a slight initial smell which goes away.&lt;br /&gt;right now it seems to be better somewhat natural deodorants so i will use it for now.</li>
            <li> Very light, fresh, citrusy scent  Keeps me stink free!</li>
            <li> Wrote this review before, but it looks like Arm &amp; Hammer re-listed the item to clear out all of the bad reviews it had. Very shady. Luckily, the non-Essentials version is easier to find now that this line of deodorants bombed. Here&#x27;s my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the standard Arm &amp; Hammer unscented for a while and liked it just fine. Then the local stores stopped carrying it in favor of the &#x27;Essentials&#x27; version. This stuff is garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, it&#x27;s not unscented, so right there we&#x27;re off to a bad start. It has a pretty rank, skunky lemony scent to it, that makes you smell like you ran out of regular deodorant and tried to use Pledge thinking no one would be the wiser. Also, this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lemon scent sticks to your clothes like glue, and even after multiple washings is damn near impossible to get out. On top of that, it stained the pits of my shirts, which is a problem I never had with any other deodorant in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, this stuff gave me a pretty bad rash. I do not have sensitive skin and have never experienced a rash like this with any other hygienic products. I&#x27;m guessing they were going after the crunchy, organic crowd with this new formula and rebranding, but I don&#x27;t know what kind of natural product could cause a reaction like this (besides poison ivy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because I&#x27;ve been loyal to the Arm &amp; Hammer brand for most of my life, but they&#x27;ve seriously damaged my trust in them with this terrible product. I&#x27;ll be shopping around for other brands now.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I will buy.  1.  It is not an antiperspirant, which can cause breast cancer.  2.  It is unscented, however, it has a very nice natural lemony smell.  I really like this product.  Please continue to carry it.</li>
            <li> this works!! i got tired of overpowering deodorants with strong scent. I tried the men&#x27;s science advanced (4x the price) and it didn&#x27;t work any better and left me with slight irritation in under arms. this product does not and keeps me odor free. the only other comment is that this does have a very faint citrus scent to it.</li>
            <li> Great natural deodorizer product!  No sticky feel, no overwhelming smell and refreshing to know that there are no harsh chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> This smells good but doesn&#x27;t last for anything. I wanted a natural deodorant because the aluminum in other deodorants darken my underarms. As for this deodorant, if you put it on and do nothing all day, you&#x27;ll be fine. If you actually go outside, on just a warm day, maybe run an errand, etc. you&#x27;ll be a little funky. It&#x27;ll be a mixture of the deodorant and you sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different but this was my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; deodorant for about 7 months now and I really like it.  It has a very low-key citrus (like orange) scent when you first put it on, but that fades pretty quickly.  Unlike some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (including The Rock), this one doesn&#x27;t break me out.  It dries to a light feeling and I don&#x27;t detect any stickiness.  I also walk several miles at a rapid pace several times a week and I have specifically checked and detect no odor, so this product is doing its job.  You will still perspire, as this is not an antiperspirant, but I think that is healthy (antiperspirants all contain aluminum in some form).  I will say that I am not extremely prone to strong body odor and I am a slim person, so if you have strong body odor issues, you may have to assess this product yourself to see if it will work for you.  Another thing I like about this deodorant is that I can detect no odor from it or from my perspiration on my clothing.  It also leaves no white residue on black - yay!  I have seen the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent of this at Walgreens, but I am only interested in the unscented version.  If you&#x27;ve been searching for something more natural to put on your body, I highly recommend giving Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials a try.</li>
            <li> Have you ever used antiperspirant and then your armpits just sweat it right off? Thats because your body does not want aluminium clogging up your pores! This is a very good deodorant and it lasts all day. I have been using it for a few years now and I fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the effectiveness of this deodorant. I&#x27;m in shape and not a smelly guy to begin with so I thought using this would be a great way to prevent yellow stains on white t-shirts and undershirts because it&#x27;s aluminum-free. I did a little research on aluminum-free deodorants and read the reviews on this one and it seemed like it&#x27;d be a good choice. To my dismay, this product only lasts a couple hours and by lunch time it&#x27;s effects have worn off and I work at an office job where I&#x27;m sitting 99% of the time. Up until lunch it worked and smelled great though. After about a week of using this product it irritated my underarms and it hurt to have my arms down by my side. This was a first for me because my skin is not very sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had any kind of trouble like this from various other deodorants. I had to switch back to my old deodorant and trash this one. You should save yourself the trouble and probably pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Was in search of a minimalist fragrance-free deodorant. Not even antiperspirant, just a deodorant. Tried out this Arm &amp; Hammer &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; Deodorant for three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Great! No odor.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: Itchy pits. Maybe an adjustment period? Continued using deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: Armpits red and skin peeling. Not just a little skin peeling. A lot of skin peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t last longer than 8 hrs and I seem to have a minor allergy to it.  I&#x27;ve found just dressing more appropriately so that I don&#x27;t sweat does a better job at keeping me from getting smelly than this deodorant does.  For times when stewing in sweat is unavoidable, I&#x27;m back to using aluminum based deodorants.</li>
            <li> After searching for more natural deodorant alternatives, I finally stumbled across this Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials product and haven&#x27;t looked back. Unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, this one actually works. Even though it says unscented, it actually has more of a baby powder scent, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Goes on completely clear and works all day.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a natural deodorant that both works, and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  I have tried about 4 other natural deodorants, including the crystal rock type, but they all caused rashes and itching. It stays on the job for about 8 hours, and this is even in hot, humid Florida. Best of all, no aluminum! I give this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for men. Doesn&#x27;t hold too well. Scent isn&#x27;t really existant. Maybe ladies will like it better.</li>
            <li> Oh. My. God. This deodorant really works! Let me start at the beginning: After hours of internet browsing, I came to the conclusion that the aluminum in my antiperspirant was bad for me. I think I&#x27;m allergic to it. So I search Amazon for a natural Deodorant (not antiperspirant, two very different things) that is strong and lasting. I took a gamble on this one and it paid off. :) I go all day long without smelling like armpits. So I sweat when I get hot... that&#x27;s perfectly natural and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. The Unscented variety actually has a slight citrus hint to it, but it&#x27;s not bad at all. I assume the smell is there because one of the ingredients is orange peel oil. I highly recommend this product. It works.</li>
            <li> I love how this deoderant doesn&#x27;t leave stains on my clothes.  Plan to use for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy this deodorant is aluminum free. Yet, just like a lot of other deodorants, it still leaves white marks on my clothes after wearing them (especially black shirts).&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t buy this deodorant again and instead still try and find a better deodorant that is natural and does not leave any marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li> Wonderful choice when looking for a more chemical free alternative to other deodorants.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has an unpleasant smell in itself, which did not improve when applied. Then, it caused a rash under my arms, so no, I would not recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually deodorizes. I have thrown about a dozen different brands in the trash. I read a rave review of this deodorant on my local newspaper&#x27;s online site. Several days later I found it on sale at Shop-Rite for 99 cents each. I bought four but now I wish I had bought every single one on the shelf. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I found this product about 2 years ago - and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and has not caused any problems even with my sensitive skin. Always works and has never let me down - even in hot, muggy weather. I&#x27;m so happy that I found it again!!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as Speed-Stick Unscented Solid.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it is light and citrus-y. I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and it doesn&#x27;t make my armpits sticky as hell, to the point I don&#x27;t want to touch them at all. The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t completely prevent me from sweating. It helps but it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it. In any case, I will definitely buy it again after I am done with this one.</li>
            <li> This product started burning after three days of use, it made me smell worse. I would not recommend to a person with sensitive skin or anybody else for that matter.</li>
            <li> This is a good option if you want to avoid chemicals.  My teenagers use it and it works well.</li>
            <li> This deordorant.works well most of the time but in Texas when it is really hot sticky weather, it can fail.  Arm &amp; Hammer uses all natural ingredients so this is a really good choice if you are avoiding chemicals.</li>
            <li> It helped somewhat better than most but after a while the scent goes away but I seem to still get a rash just haven&#x27;t found one that will help 100%</li>
            <li> This deodorant does not work for me. It made me sweat regularly. I finally stopped wearing this deodorant and no more sweating.</li>
            <li> worked ok for a few hours, but still didn&#x27;t leave me smelling as fresh at the end of the day...and i&#x27;m a sweater...same thing for Tom&#x27;s of Maine, and Crystal...gonna try the Body Satin deodorant at melaleuca.com and see how that works.</li>
            <li> Yay! Finally a natural, gluten free, deodorant that works!!!  I have tried so many different natural brands that don&#x27;t work!  I can&#x27;t say that it is as effective as your normal, chemical filled deodorants, but it comes pretty close!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get away all of the chemicals surrounding us these days and was having quite a bit of trouble finding a natural (sans aluminum) deodorant that works, and works well. I&#x27;m always hot and I tend to sweat more than the average person so I was excited to see so many positive reviews of Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Antiperspirant Deodorant. I was also very pleased that it was unscented as the only smell I want is my cologne.     After using this deodorant for the last couple of months, here is what I&#x27;ve noticed:  - Lemon/citrus smell, it&#x27;s pretty strong for the first hour or so, wears off after that. It was much stronger than I thought it would be based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read here. No one ever commented on it, but I could smell it and that was enough for me.  - If I showered and washed my pits a bit more vigorously (say, after a workout), there is a slight stinging sensation when I apply the deodorant. Kind of uncomfortable for 5-10 minutes until it goes away.  - Lasts for 6 or 7 hours. This gets me to the mid-afternoon at work which is a bit awkward because I don&#x27;t want to reapply in the middle of the office and then smell like lemon/citrus for the next hour or so.    Overall, 3 stars. If you&#x27;re the kind of person who sweats more than the average, I&#x27;d probably stay away from this and try and find a different natural alternative. I bought 2 to save on shipping so I&#x27;ll probably just wear it around the house if I&#x27;m not going anywhere. For everyday wear, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out something else.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; in terms of.. they didn&#x27;t add any EXTRA scent to it, other than what the ingredients themselves already had, but this has a VERY STRONG orange/citrus scent, and I think it smells rather foul after a few hours of even wearing it under normal/everyday conditions. I had read other reviews on the smell but decided to give it a try anyway, hoping for the best... an unscented, aluminum-free deodorant would be just perfect! But this simply smells too strong and unpleasant to me. I went for unscented so I could choose how I smell by what cologne I decided to wear, or not.. but this ruins that for sure. I tried it several times, I hoped for the best... but to me, and for my needs -- this stuff is worthless.    If they ever perfect the unscented part, though, I&#x27;d sure love to find a healthy unscented deodorant to try! But I&#x27;m still looking for now.</li>
            <li> I have not had good luck using deodorants instead of anti-perspirants. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few including Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Deodorant Stick-Unscented, Naturally Fresh Roll On Deodorant Crystal,  MenScience Advanced Fragrance Free Deodorant and several others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned, the best I&#x27;ve used are Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials and the MenScience Advanced. Big difference in price though... the MenScience is $19 vs only about $4 for the Arm &amp; Hammer. For me both provide effective all-day under-arm odor control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product that contained no aluminum, no parabens and no fragrance. Yet it had to be able to provide at least an all-day odor control. I found that the Arm &amp; Hammer and MenScience deodorants met my requirements in all areas and for me provides odor control even through the evening. But because of the huge price difference I&#x27;ve settled on the Arm &amp; Hammer as my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Natural Deodorant Unscented does in fact have a scent but there is no intentionally added fragrance. The scent that I detect is a minimal, citrus-like scent that is not objectionable to me and is due to the natural ingredients some of which are: Chamomile Oil, Coriander Oil, Geranium Oil, and Orange Peel Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ingredient that may give some people pause is Tricolsan. The FDA has been taking a closer look at Tricolsan to determine if it has any detremental effects but so far it seems safe, just not something that has to be added to soaps in such widespread fashion. I&#x27;ve made a personal choice to be OK with Triclosan as I feel it is partly why this deodorant is so effective. Triclosan discourages bacterial growth and bacteria is the cause of under-arm odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do perspire when you use a deodorant because deodorants do not inhibit perspiration like an anti-perspirant will. Anti-perspirants usuall use an aluminum compound that literally clogs your pores so you can&#x27;t perspire. I don&#x27;t want to use aluminum products and I don&#x27;t want to inhibit my body to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do... I just don&#x27;t want to stink to high heaven while its doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried other deodorants with little success as I have, I&#x27;d suggest giving this one a try. I&#x27;m really pleased with how well it works.want to use aluminum products and I don&#x27;t want to inhibit my body to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do...

            <li> Works great as far as a deodorant/antiperspirant, but the smell is disgusting. It smells like a hint of menthol and sulfur, and ends up making my armpits smell worse than they would without it.</li>
            <li> This is the third \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. While the other two (Tom&#x27;s and Earth Science) didn&#x27;t smell, I did. They didn&#x27;t work at all and I live in FL where people sweat. I was excited to try this one because of the positive reviews but I&#x27;ve only used it twice because of the fragrance. My kids and I are all very chemically sensitive so although the citrus cent is natural, it still contains natural salicylates which we react to. So if you are sensitive to natural fragrances, this may not work for you.</li>
            <li> With all the cancers out there, specifically breast cancer, which I&#x27;ve always figured was from the aluminum in anti-perspirant deodorant, I&#x27;m turning to natural deodorant. The smell is like lemon. While it doesn&#x27;t last long and has a slight sticky feel to it, I think it&#x27;s still worth your health in the end. I&#x27;ve bought powder and just applied that after the deodorant and it seems to help the sticky feel and for you to smell better longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I seem to allergic to most deodorants. This solved my allergy problem,  but there is no or little odor or wetness protection.</li>
            <li> I was having a reaction to my normal deodorant and had to switch to this. It has a lemon smell and works great for a couple hours, but by the end of the day seems to be completely gone.  I&#x27;ve found myself pretty smelly if I am working hard several hours after putting this on.  I wish it lasted as long as the more harsh deodorants.    Next I am trying this:  [...]</li>
            <li> My daughter has allergies, so we bought this. It works great for Zumba class and no smell! Thanks for carrying this great product!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find an affordable deodorant at the aisle that is also &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. The first month I experienced some itching and irritation but didn&#x27;t think anything abnormal of it because I don&#x27;t have any allergies. I continued using it for a few months and then the real problems started. The itching turned into an all day uncontrollable burning. I decided to take a deeper look into the ingredients to find out what&#x27;s in this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that is causing the greatest discomfort of my life. Found out that it contains Triclosan! A chemical similar to anti-freeze that affects hormone production and is a known carcinogen. I am still horrified that a company would knowingly put this ingredient in a product. And I am still recovering from the physical and emotional effects of my ordeal. When the skin under my arms isn&#x27;t raw and burning red, it is the consistency of leather. It is still absolutely painful, and the blows to my self confidence are noticeable to my close friends and colleagues. No $6 refund could ever repair the damage done. PLEASE TAKE THIS PRODUCT OFF THE SHELVES AND EXERCISE SOME CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really irritated with this product. I got this because it states it is &amp;#34;scentless.&amp;#34; I need a scentless deodorant for camping in grizzly country next month. This deodorant smells delicious. Literally, like an orange pushpop. *I* almost ate it so there is no way I can wear this while backpacking. It is NOT scentless. It is VERY scented like oranges. If they didn&#x27;t ADD scent, advertise that. Don&#x27;t say it is without scent.</li>
            <li> Works great!! No complaints at all!!! Does not have that nasty sticky feel like most natural deodorant do. ;-)</li>
            <li> I found this product years ago at Fred Meyers in Ellensburg, WA. I live overseas and can shop in the base commissary but they do not have anything like this...and that&#x27;s why I order from Amazon. This product holds up well in the tropics (Guam/Philippines) as well as temperate climates (Japan/Korea). It has very little or no odor by itself and yet works great on me, a 58 year old male. I have very sensitive skin but I have never had any problems using this.</li>
            <li> I can finally stop wasting my money on trying to find a deodorant without aluminum that works and doesn&#x27;t smell funky.  It is really hard to find women&#x27;s deodorant that is not an antiperspirant with aluminum compounds.  There are only a few out there, and the ones I&#x27;ve tried left me sticky and/or stinky.  So happy I found this.  The Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Fresh works too, but I don&#x27;t like the scent; the scent is more for a male.  The unscented smells likes citrus in the container but the scent goes away once applied.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I still sweat when I use it but I never have b.o. in fact I get complimented on my perfume regularly at work. I do frequently sweat at my job and I work closely with large groups of people, I&#x27;m a craps dealer. I always wear perfume and this deoderant to work. On my days off I don&#x27;t need the perfume. I appreciate the quality ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> Finally, a deodorant--you know, an anti-smell product. None of the stuff that causes irritation (I am a sensitive kind of guy) and doesn&#x27;t have fragrances either. All I want is to not stink and this works fine.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that is aluminum-free and does the job.  I&#x27;ll be honest here and say that the deodorant &#x27;crystal&#x27; didn&#x27;t work for me; neither did any of the Tom&#x27;s brand stuff (except for the anti-perspirant, which does have aluminum in it).  I can&#x27;t even tell you how thankful I am for this stuff.  I am now a loyal user (unless I start making my own).  Worth it!</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect!  I REALLY liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t have Aluminum in it!!  But what I discovered was REALLY pleasing and a surprise!!  I thought I would have to &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; somewhere to gain the healthy benefit.  The deodorant has a REALLY nice scent!  (And yes, it is unscented!!)  It is &amp;#34;very smooth&amp;#34; going on, it DOES NOT leave white marks all over my clothes, AND I haven&#x27;t had body odor, smelled up my underarms on my tops, soiled them, or been wet under my arms!!!  BRAVO Arm &amp; Hammer!!! :) :)  I have a new friend!</li>
            <li> I find this works well, it allows me to sweat and flush out toxins while keeping me smelling good. I go to the gym and no problems.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for any better. Got it in a couple of days. This deodorant is the only one that works for me. I am alergic to many others and it is difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I like this product because there is no smell and no form of aluminum product in it.</li>
            <li> Smells like orange, but quickly dissipates. Do be wary of the ingredients though- some things are known to be carcinogenic!</li>
            <li> If I could give this deodorant 10 stars, I would. Although I am a woman, I have been using male deodorants for years, because I felt like they worked better and kept me smelling \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; longer apposed to women&#x27;s deodorants. Mind you, I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of smelling like a guy, but it was the best solution I could come up with. I stumbled upon this Natural Deodorant by Arm &amp; Hammer by chance. I was a skeptical and the reviews I read about it this product sounded too good to be true, but I decided I&#x27;d take the risk of spending $3 for a possible waste. Turns out this is a little stick of MAGIC! While I&#x27;ve never suffered from sever perspiration and was mainly trying to find a way to cover or prevent the \\&quot;pit-stench\\&quot; this thing takes care of it all! I sweat less, I smell fresh (it&#x27;s a citrusy scent that is absolutely delightful and not overpowering in any way)and because the stick applies \\&quot;clear\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t have to worry about white goop getting all over my shirts. I highly recommend this product; you won&#x27;t be disappointed and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product!  Paraben and aluminum free!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a better choice over using regular deodorant. Seems less toxic, quick and easy to use. Plus my kids can use it as well and I don&#x27;t feel so concerned.</li>
            <li> I used this product without incident for about a week. Same routine each morning. Get out of the shower, comb hair, apply deoderant. This morning, however, both my armpits feel like I applied fire ants. will discontinue use as per manufacturer instructions regarding irritation.</li>
            <li> This worked well for my husband but after a couple of weeks it left a redness under his arm. He quit using it and the redness went a way. He liked the smell and wetness protection but just didn&#x27;t agree with his skin.</li>
            <li> I chose this product online since I can no longer find it in the store.  I really like the fact that it&#x27;s ALL natural,  It is almost impossible to find just a deodorant, let alone one that is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is conscience of what you are putting on your body.</li>
            <li> doing the  job nicely...would reorder when time comes to do so.....recommend as does not sting or cause any discomfort.. Fine product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E. David Brewer</li>
            <li> I was a little sceptical about a deodorant only product, but I was tired of the rash in my armpits from traditional aluminum antiperspirant ingredients as well as the discoloration in all my clothes so I gave it a shot. Also, my research had indicated that using an antiperspirant is not particularly healthy because it prevents your armpits from secreting pollutants and stuff - which is the main reason you sweat in the first place. For the first few days I sweated a lot, but by the end of the first week, that had stopped completely except in conditions of extreme exertion. I also didn&#x27;t think it worked very well on the odor at first, but the longer I used it, the better it worked. When I first opened the product, the citrus smell was really strong, but either I got used to it, or it mellowed out, because I don&#x27;t notice it anymore. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and hate that the only place I have found it locally is WalMart. I will easily pay more to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am looking for a deodorant that does not have the aluminum that is in antiperspirants.  Although this product does meet that requirement, I do not have all day odor protection.  I have a desk job and when I get home from work find that the smell is there.  I have been using the product for 2 weeks now thinking there might be an &amp;#34;adjustment period.&amp;#34;  Guess I will be going back to antiperspirants until I can find something else.</li>
            <li> It works, doesn&#x27;t smell, and keeps me dry.I have long looked for a good deo that keeps me dry and I found it!</li>
            <li> On the package it says unscented... Yet, when you open, and use it.......  smells like lemons.... Not super strong, but if you are allergic to fragrances, it will give you a headache until you(if you can) get used to it. I bought this thinking it was the same as Ultra Max which I really like, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works very well, I never smell badly. It is unscented, but not scent-free. I think the ingredients naturally smell citrus-like, which smells clean.</li>
            <li> Searching for an unscented antiperspirant to replace Mennen Speed stick Fresh that I used for years but is discontinued.  It was very lightly scented, almost unscented.  I like powders that go on dry and stay dry.  I also want something with little to no perfumes because the intent is to not smell at all, not to smell \\&quot;good\\&quot;.  Mennen ruined their original Speedstick when they updated it.  I&#x27;m now looking for another brand.  Bating 0 for 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my replacement research, I found this \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deoderant, unscented, and decided to try it even though it is not an antiperspirant.  Day one I didn&#x27;t like it.  It might be unscented, but the natural ingredients have their scents.  My initial reaction was that it smelled like citronella misquito candles.  Hated it.  But, I tried it for several days to see if the smell went away during the day.  It did fade, but was still there.  Also, it goes on &#x27;wetter&#x27; or stickier than I like, and stays (less) sticky through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a modest sweater and don&#x27;t stink much during normal activity, or after 5 mile run, so sometimes go without deoderant or antiperspirant.  I was happiest, though, with my old Speedstick Fresh.  Mennen, go back to the \\&quot;original formula\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell of it. It smells worse than BO. If I apply too much I smell like the deodorant. However, when I apply just a bit and pat myself with a towel after I cannot smell it easily and the product is still effective. It does not stain shirts!</li>
            <li> No more grey stains on the arm pits of our shirts.  Sounds nasty, but it is true.  Scary that the metal in the other deodorants does that isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 yr old son. He doesn&#x27;t need antiperspirant so this seemed like a good choice. You might as well be putting on pretend deodorant. It does nothing.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant - all natural. No artificial chemicals. Works well too. I used to buy it and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t do anything that brings you to sweat it will last throughout the day, any kind of sweating though and it won&#x27;t mask the smell at all.</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks it did what it was supposed to, but after a while it began to make my underarms itch INTENSELY. Considering that it&#x27;s natural, I thought I was weird. It eventually left a dark line on my underarms so I decided to stop using it. I like the smell though! I just wish it didn&#x27;t leave me wanting to itch at my underarms especially in public .-.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job of keeping the odor away without using the aluminum.  Good buy for people looking for deoderant as opposed to antipersperant.</li>
            <li> All great, fine experience, thanks!</li>
            <li> First the ingredients a terrible, almost all are quimical and cancer ingredients. Second, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, a crystal stone works much better than this fake natural product.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant.  It keeps me dry and does not have a strong scent.  Does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, will order again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good all natural deodorant that actually works but this one is it! I started looking when I was pregnant and have been using this one ever since. Even though it says &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; it does have an orange-y scent to it which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Arm &amp; Hammer is a really great brand for people looking for an all-natural deodorant that actually works. I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine previously but it did nothing to curb sweat or odor, whereas the power of baking soda is used in Arm &amp; Hammer as a natural alternative to aluminum-laden product, and it works well. I know that A&amp;H tests on animals but, though unlabeled, this variety- being &amp;#34;natural essentials&amp;#34; might not have been.</li>
            <li> Not for me. Sure it claims to be Aluminium free. But it contains Triclosan. Read up about the risks of Triclosan and humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first and only deodorant that hasn&#x27;t managed to stop me smelling.</li>
            <li> Arm &amp; Hammer is the perfect item for my life needs.  This natural deodorant product is designed without additional chemicals that are unnecessary for someone with kidney problems.</li>
            <li> Long lasting deodorant with a long lasting effect. Knowing that it doesn&#x27;t contain any aluminum, I expected this would offer no protection, but boy was I wrong, it just doesn&#x27;t smell at all no matter the conditions and the sweat protection is on par with the terrible aluminum variants. I bought a 6-pack a long-long time ago(can&#x27;t remember really) and I have 2 left...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Even though it says no scent it does smell fresh. That is a nice plus to the product. I like it.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking, natural and unscented, doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue. Does the job well, no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Works well all day, but it NOT unscented. Has a clear and distinct orange/citrus smell to it. Not overpowering, but it is really not unscented.</li>
            <li> Works good, but it does have a orangish scent to it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it isn&#x27;t an anti-perspirant, but that is kind of the reason I sought it out, was to avoid aluminum. Can&#x27;t win em all, but otherwise, this is excellent deodorant. I decided I do like the FRESH scent better though vs the unscented. It smells a little like citronella candles, very light smell even though it says unscented. I will buy the fresh from now on. I love the A&amp;H Essentials brand though, for sure.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a good natural unscented Deodorant.  Have used this for years and I trust it to do the job.</li>
            <li> I was disgusted to realize this product contains triclosan.  That is hardly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and is a know carcinogen.  I would rather apply deodorant with aluminum than have triclosan be absorbed into my skin.  Triclosan has been removed from most products.  How something can have it and be associated as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; is beyond me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and your typical deodorants (dove, suave, etc) break me out.  This is the only deodorant I have found that works and doesn&#x27;t break my skin out.</li>
            <li> Super product, especially where there is a water shortage and needing to not smell bad, this is the product to get.</li>
            <li> Not for me. This deodorant is too wet and runny for a stick. After I put it on, it gets all over my clothing. It&#x27;s supposed to be a natural scent but it has the strongest lemon scent EVER.  I smell it all day. I&#x27;m over it.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me, even a little bit. I would not recommend wasting your time or your money on this product.</li>
            <li> As a dermatologist in private practice for 29 years I not only approve of this product I use it on a daily basis and have for two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many of my patients I am allergic to aluminum based antiperspirants. I also have an allergy to fragrance and Balsam of Peru (used as a fragrance). I was able to use the Crystone stick for about 3 years before I developed an allergy to that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the complaints about propylene glycol they are overblown. While it can be an irritant in eczema patients if the concentrations are over 5% it is found in many oral and injectable medications as well as dog food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally to those hung up on &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34; I will point out that apricot pits are about as natural as it gets and they contain cyanide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is a very good product for patients with eczema or very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from the regular deodorants that are supposedly bad, so I tried this. It does work, but &#x27;unscented&#x27; still smells like I rubbed oranges under my arms for about 30 minutes after application. I never finished the product because it actually started burning under my arms a bit, and from what I&#x27;ve read one of the other ingredients is just as bad for you. I ended up moving to the unscented &#x27;crystal&#x27; deodorant. It really is unscented and seems to work just as well if not a bit better, for me at least.</li>
            <li> it says its unscented but it has a very strong lemon smell or something like that, had to give them away coz could not stand the smell</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have used.  It works much better than Crystal, and is completely hypogenic.  Very good stuff, and has a great light citrus smell when first applied.</li>
            <li> Seems to work OK.  Will see when it gets hot.</li>
            <li> How can you call a product natural if it contains propylene glycol? I dont like how the  ingredient list is not shown.Not too pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Update, skin in and around the armpits are peeling off due to this deodorant.</li>
            <li> By far the best natural deodorant out there. It really keeps the funk at bay lol.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells fine. To my surprise, this is better than that of Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> A&amp;H make two natural deodorants, this nearly unscented version and the &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34; one. I like them both. This one has a very light scent that pretty much disappears once you apply it. These A&amp;H natural deodorants work the best of all the natural ones I&#x27;ve tried. They go on with a little bit of a gel or light layer on the underarm, but it goes away quickly and I&#x27;ve never noticed it get on my clothes. It absorbs seemingly very quickly. It lasts for a few to several hours, depending on your level of activity. But as is par for the course w/ natural deodorants, if you sweat, you have to reapply throughout the day. I&#x27;ve tried many, &amp; these A&amp;H are my fave as well as the Weleda Rose spray deodorant. Plus these are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Love the citrus scent and wont leave sticky residue on your armpits. Works better than my secret antiperspirant and probably healthier.</li>
            <li> Here is Wikipedia on triclosan: Triclosan is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the European Union. During wastewater treatment, a portion of triclosan is degraded, while the remaining adsorbs to sewage sludge or exits the plant in wastewater effluent.[10][11] In the environment, triclosan may be degraded by microorganisms or react with sunlight, forming other compounds, which include between 3 and 12% of chlorophenols and dioxin (In particular, 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (external) (2,8-DCDD) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) are produced. Both also are photolabile and, thus, are intermediates.), or it may adsorb to particles that settle out of the water column and form sediment.[10][12] Triclosan was found in Greifensee sediment that was over 30 years old, suggesting that triclosan is degraded or removed slowly in sediment.[10]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how you can call something natural if it includes ingredients that turn into dioxin, one of the most toxic pollutants know. I also wouldn&#x27;t want it on my skin. Read the label!</li>
            <li> I experience irritation from most anti-perspirants and this one was no different.  I expected it to be more natural and better for me, but I do not like it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants and this one is BY FAR the best. The unscented version has a slight lime-ish scent to it but is very subtle and pleasant. I really like the smell. The \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent is too strong for me, not a fan. This stuff works really well without any toxic chemicals. I even gave one of my sticks to my husband once and now he loves it too, so its great for men and women.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice, it doesn&#x27;t burn, it works. My only complaint is that it is not unscented. It smells citrusy, not that the smell is a real negative. I just don&#x27;t like the scent I wish it didn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> The unscented is kind of misleading. It distinctly smells like lemon but less than a normal deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want an unscented deodorant so when I wear cologne I wouldnt have two smells going on so this was kind of disappointing</li>
            <li> I bought both the \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; scent and the unscented to try and see which I liked best. I read that the unscented had a light, sweet citrus scent so I was pretty excited to get this. To my dismay, it smells like an orange-scented cleaner. Not pleasant to have that smell on your body. As the day goes on the scent does kind of fade, but I found that using this in the summertime, it takes several applications to ward off body odor and it makes my underarms a little tender. I do like that Arm &amp; Hammer provides aluminum free deodorant that ACTUALLY works, unlike Tom&#x27;s and the crystal products.</li>
            <li> this deodorant has a great smell and best of all, it&#x27;s natural! I bought it for my son and worked just great.</li>
            <li> I had just as bad luck with this one as I did with many other natural deodorants, by the time noon came around, I smelt like an un-showered musty hippy. I work in an office environment so sweat was minimal, this deodorant just didn&#x27;t do the trick. I love Arm &amp; Hammer as a company though and was willing to try their other natural deodorant, the fresh instead of this unscented one and that one has worked excellent. So if this one didn&#x27;t work for you perhaps try the Fresh version.</li>
            <li> I use all types of Arm and Hammer products and actually bought this deodorant for my husband.  He says he loves it and it does the trick.  The best part is that it has no aluminum in it.  I&#x27;m going to get myself some soon because after all these years of using the kind with aluminum in it, I need a safer alternative.</li>
