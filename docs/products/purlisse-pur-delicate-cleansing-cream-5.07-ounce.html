            <li>let me tell you this is THE BEST FACIAL MOISTURIZER I HAVE EVER</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser ever, specifically for some one with acne prone skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Love the way my face feels after cleansing with this product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it and had to purchase it.</li>
            <li>but this leaves my skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s butt! :)</li>

            <li>I love this cleanser...</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it leaves my skin soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>so I bought the full size version!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, Jennifer, for making this exceptional product.</li>
            <li>this works great and doesn&#x27;t make me more red than I already am waiting to use it longer and see if f&lt;br /&gt;Reduces</li>
            <li>It has a nice, sort of citrus-y smell to it, which surprised me, since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;soy milk&amp;#34; I figured it would have sort of a non-smell (kind of like milk of magnesia).  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, leaves face soft and smooth and the best part is it removes allll my makeup, even my mascara!</li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Received this product in my ipsy bag and fell in love with it, it&#x27;s not soapy but it really cleanses your skin and leaves it feeling soft and looking great.</li>
            <li>I can use this once daily, before I go to bed, and combined with the moisturizer, my skin is happy and clean.</li>
            <li>The formula feels silky on my skin and has a clean light scent.</li>
            <li>~lisse has come up with a way to keep our skin clean and protected without causing skin problems.  </li>
            <li>I even use it with my clarisonic when I need a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>I got a sample in my ipsy bag and HAD to buy a full size.</li>
            <li>I am going to try to return it because for the price paid I don&#x27;t want to pitch this almost full container.  </li>
            <li>It came in my ipsy glam bag and I absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>and I had to purchase the full size.  </li>
            <li>Best cleanser I&#x27;ve used in the past 5 years!</li>
            <li>It is a very gentle face cleanser that leaves my face feeling clean without feeling</li>
            <li>No having to remove eye makeup first either!</li>
            <li>Worth the expense</li>
            <li>It is pricey but 100% worth it.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin on the planet.</li>
            <li>Many others are scented or have a smell to them which I don&#x27;t like (as a man and a person with sensitive skin who doesn&#x27;t want chemical scents added to my products).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various skin items to correct problem in my T-zone with no success and then product was so impressive.  </li>
            <li>the best facial cleanser I have ever used, hands down!</li>
            <li>I loved a sample of this product as you can see from my previous post.  </li>
            <li>It takes off my eye makeup so easy and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>First tried a sample delivered by ipsy.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product when I received a sample of it in my Ipsy bag.</li>
            <li>What more can I say about a product I&#x27;ve used for years and keep using after brief attempts at finding cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin as smooth and soft as a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Its so gentle but works!</li>
            <li>And my eyes are super sensitive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>It washed well, but made my whole face break out in hives.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on the skin but removed every bit of makeup.</li>
            <li>Gentle makeup removing cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Very simple to use and feel clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a very gentle make-up remover and it leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>However when I purchased the full size I have had a completely different experience.  </li>
            <li>Cleans makeup off in one quick wash and I can use it daily without it drying my skin or causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product not only cleans my skin, it makes the texture so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other facial cleansers for my sensitive skin, and tried ones that cost less or are more convenient to get, and even after they changed the packaging a few years ago making it less convenient to use, I still like this the best.</li>
            <li>it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean with out harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>It took over a week for the whole allergic process to clear off, including peeling.</li>
            <li>It has dried out my skin and caused more breakouts than what I already had.  </li>
            <li>This is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that does not wreak havoc on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works well on my sensitive skin and still gets my mascara off!</li>
            <li>For awhile I had stopped washing my face more than once a week or so, finding every other cleanser to be instantly reddening and drying.</li>
            <li>Most notable about this product is that I&#x27;ve noticed a decreased size in my pores and less blackheads which I don&#x27;t remember it claims to correct.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin, along with occasional cystic acne and have a lot of trouble finding a good face wash.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gentle enough when I forget.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>Got this in my ipsy bag and could not believe how soft my skin was after using it.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive eyes (like even my &amp;#34;eye cream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>And even better, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would clear up my skin and minimize my pores after being sick for most of the winter and my skin was really needing some help.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it since a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> My skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble breaking out with this.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with dry skin, this is the cleanser for you.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive skin and am in my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxiously awaiting this to come back in stock.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a cleanser that did not dry me out worse and get my makeup off.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample in my ipsy bag and decided to give it a try; by the time the little tube was done</li>
            <li> It threw me off a little bit because it doesn&#x27;t lather up at all, but don&#x27;t let that misguide you.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive and weird skin that is dry in some areas and too oily in other areas, I hate it..</li>
            <li> I had a few pimples</li>
            <li> and I feel this dried them.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with cleansers being too harsh or leaving my skin dried out</li>
            <li> like it dried me out which is hard for me to find.</li>
            <li> It does remove mascara without much trouble but it burns!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t repurchase because I need a cleanser that can double as an eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I usually use a separate eye make up remover regardless</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> I have done some serious damage to my skin through years of battling acne and so finding a cleanser that won&#x27;t turn me into sandpaper is a must and very hard to find.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great buy. Melts away even my mascara!</li>
            <li> I have to echo others and say this is a great gentle cleanser. I have oily, sensitive skin and am in my late 20&#x27;s. I find this cleanser works well for removing all makeup but mascara. It does remove mascara without much trouble but it burns! I think if you&#x27;re going to market a cleanser as taking off all makeup including mascara, it needs to get the job done without stinging. Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t repurchase because I need a cleanser that can double as an eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Very nice! I was happy with it for the first couple of weeks and then I think because of my oily skin it didn&#x27;t give the same after feeling! Still a very nice product.</li>
            <li> Works well on my sensitive skin and still gets my mascara off!</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that does not wreak havoc on my super sensitive skin. For awhile I had stopped washing my face more than once a week or so, finding every other cleanser to be instantly reddening and drying. I can use this once daily, before I go to bed, and combined with the moisturizer, my skin is happy and clean. And even better, a little goes a long way. Thank you so much, Jennifer, for making this exceptional product.</li>
            <li> I, too, got this in my Ipsy bag and fell in love! I have pretty sensitive and weird skin that is dry in some areas and too oily in other areas, I hate it.. And my eyes are super sensitive. This is a very gentle make-up remover and it leaves your skin soft. I will definitely be ordering another!</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I&#x27;ve used in the past 5 years! I got a sample in my ipsy bag and HAD to buy a full size. Doesn&#x27;t foam, so it&#x27;s extremely gentle. It cleans without drying out skin. I&#x27;ll be using this for years to come in sure.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will order again, great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cleanser it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean with out harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> It washed well, but made my whole face break out in hives. It took over a week for the whole allergic process to clear off, including peeling. So awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I commented on their Instagram account about it, they deleted my comment and another person&#x27;s, who had a similar reaction.</li>
            <li> Update 4/13/16 I loved a sample of this product as you can see from my previous post.  However when I purchased the full size I have had a completely different experience.  It has dried out my skin and caused more breakouts than what I already had.  I was hoping it would clear up my skin and minimize my pores after being sick for most of the winter and my skin was really needing some help.  I am going to try to return it because for the price paid I don&#x27;t want to pitch this almost full container.  I just don&#x27;t why this experience has been so different!  I received a sample in my Ipsy Glam bag a couple of months ago and this is amazing.  I think this my favorite item I have received yet.  Most notable about this product is that I&#x27;ve noticed a decreased size in my pores and less blackheads which I don&#x27;t remember it claims to correct.  I&#x27;ve been using it nightly and my skin has improved in appearance drastically.  I&#x27;ve used various skin items to correct problem in my T-zone with no success and then product was so impressive.  In addition, this removed eye makeup when necessary without burning my eyes.  I usually use a separate eye make up remover regardless but it&#x27;s gentle enough when I forget.  The smell is great and it leaves my skin soft and refreshed.  Worth the expense and I would recommend!</li>
            <li> First tried a sample delivered by ipsy. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this product my face and skin feel amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser. However, I bought it at burlington coat factory in their beauty aisle for ten bucks.</li>
            <li> ARE YOU ATHLETIC?  If so, this line of products is for you.  All too often I would breakout after competing in an outdoor event or building up a sweat at the health club.  Pur~lisse has come up with a way to keep our skin clean and protected without causing skin problems.  I love the packaging too.  It&#x27;s perfect for the gym or to take with you when you are on the go!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, along with occasional cystic acne and have a lot of trouble finding a good face wash. I received this as a sample in my ipsy bag and decided to give it a try; by the time the little tube was done I was convinced to buy more. It is a very gentle face cleanser that leaves my face feeling clean without feeling like it dried me out which is hard for me to find. The formula feels silky on my skin and has a clean light scent. My skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble breaking out with this. I even use it with my clarisonic when I need a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I got this in an ipsy bag let me tell you this is THE BEST FACIAL MOISTURIZER I HAVE EVER USED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. It threw me off a little bit because it doesn&#x27;t lather up at all, but don&#x27;t let that misguide you. It&#x27;s literally the best it&#x27;s a little expensive but it&#x27;s so worth it since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It came in my ipsy glam bag and I absolutely fell in love with it. Best facial cleanser ever, specifically for some one with acne prone skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after cleansing with this product. If you have a problem with dry skin, this is the cleanser for you.</li>
            <li> The best makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried. Cleans makeup off in one quick wash and I can use it daily without it drying my skin or causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> I got this in my ipsy bag. It is the best I have ever tried. It takes off my eye makeup so easy and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Tried this with my Ipsy subscription &amp; loved it so I bought the full size version! It is so gentle on the skin but removed every bit of makeup. No having to remove eye makeup first either!</li>
            <li> the best facial cleanser I have ever used, hands down! It is gentle, leaves face soft and smooth and the best part is it removes allll my makeup, even my mascara! with only a pea sized amount needed! It is pricey but 100% worth it. Ive said bye bye to makeup remover wipes since trying this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I got a sample size in my March Ipsy. Let me tell you I have the most sensitive skin on the planet. I was searching for a cleanser that did not dry me out worse and get my makeup off. This product not only cleans my skin, it makes the texture so smooth and soft I can&#x27;t believe it. The rest of the Purlisse skin care is amazing as well. The serum is out of this world with the cleaner! FYI.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use and feel clean.  Use with age-delay skin serum.</li>
            <li> I have done some serious damage to my skin through years of battling acne and so finding a cleanser that won&#x27;t turn me into sandpaper is a must and very hard to find. This stuff is a godsend.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when I received a sample of it in my Ipsy bag. I fell in love with it and had to purchase it. It leaves my skin feeling so soft. I have trouble with cleansers being too harsh or leaving my skin dried out but this leaves my skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s butt! :)</li>
            <li> Received this product in my ipsy bag and fell in love with it, it&#x27;s not soapy but it really cleanses your skin and leaves it feeling soft and looking great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other facial cleansers for my sensitive skin, and tried ones that cost less or are more convenient to get, and even after they changed the packaging a few years ago making it less convenient to use, I still like this the best. It is awesome stuff. Many others are scented or have a smell to them which I don&#x27;t like (as a man and a person with sensitive skin who doesn&#x27;t want chemical scents added to my products). This stuff is great. What more can I say about a product I&#x27;ve used for years and keep using after brief attempts at finding cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> This was in my IPSY bag and I had to purchase the full size.  It works amazingly well.  Gentle makeup removing cleanser.  Who could ask for anything more?  Perhaps a cheaper price?  .. that would be nice.  :)</li>
            <li> Got this in my ipsy bag and could not believe how soft my skin was after using it. Had to go online to look for it to purchase a regular size.</li>
            <li> love it but came with a leak.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used!  I have really sensitive eyes (like even my &amp;#34;eye cream&amp;#34; burns my eyes) and I can use this cleanser to get off ALL my eye makeup--shadow, eyeliner, and yes, even mascara--and no burn, no sting, no itchy eyes.  NOTHING.  It also leaves my skin as smooth and soft as a baby&#x27;s.  It has a nice, sort of citrus-y smell to it, which surprised me, since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;soy milk&amp;#34; I figured it would have sort of a non-smell (kind of like milk of magnesia).  Will buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> Got this in my Gipsy and I love it!! Its so gentle but works! I had a few pimples and I feel this dried them. I have sensitive skin and this works great and doesn&#x27;t make me more red than I already am waiting to use it longer and see if f&lt;br /&gt;Reduces redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want try more pur-lisse products sign up for ipsy! https://www.ipsy.com/r/2mqq6</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxiously awaiting this to come back in stock.  I love this cleanser...it takes off eye makeup without the need for cotton swabs or rubbing.</li>
