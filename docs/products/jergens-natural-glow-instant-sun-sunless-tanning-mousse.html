            <li>But what makes this one the best is that it is a mousse.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll never get a California girl glow, but I&#x27;m very happy with the light tan that I did get.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and brown looking, not orange.</li>
            <li>Tried the light bronze and this one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>This is a good tanning mousse.</li>
            <li>It covers good, no smell and no brown sheets or clothes.  </li>
            <li>I used the Jergen&#x27;s scrub beforehand and the combo was good.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product ...</li>

            <li>/&gt;This is all to say that if I want to achieve a nice lightish brown, I have to resort to manmade creams like this one.</li>
            <li>It came out nice and foamy in texture and didn&#x27;t ever get plugged up.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This mousse went on very easily.  </li>
            <li>I love this better than Jergens Express!  </li>
            <li>(You may want to tape it in place from the inside, and of course, make sure the fly swatter is clean.)  </li>
            <li>The best natural colour for a light tanner ever!</li>
            <li>If you get it on a spot like bottom feed sides, just a good scrub pad will blend it off quickly.</li>
            <li>But that shows how light I was compared to the color of the tan!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely  LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s become my favorite tanner.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem is that the tanner imprints on most places I go and</li>
            <li>Okay so all tanning products have some sort of smell...</li>
            <li>If this mythical product exists out there please send it to me :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>And to my relief, it&#x27;s miles better than the self-tanner I tried like 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>This one is my go to favorite.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed after looking at the mirror, because I literally looked like I had been vacationing in the Bahamas for the last 3 days!</li>
            <li>I had better results with Jergen&#x27;s light tanning foam!</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Or maybe I&#x27;ll do one leg with each and see which one looks better.</li>
            <li>just a nice glow of light tan color.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>beautiful natural color.</li>
            <li>color looks beautiful natural and lasts for almost a week.</li>
            <li>Its just becoming summer here in Canada</li>
            <li>, it was more like a light orange.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased one it helps with a smooth application</li>
            <li>This is hands down,  the BEST out there IMO!! :)</li>
            <li>My skin has a nice natural glow, it dries extremely quickly and it smells nice - kinda like soap!</li>
            <li>I have tried every kind of tanning lotion from Loving Tan to Clinique, and this is by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no orange color, and no streaks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply the mousse spread evenly and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Sweats off easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked out fine.</li>
            <li>Fine line between &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has made a huge difference in my &#x27;readiness for summer.&#x27;</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li>so it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I must put it on lightly because I can&#x27;t see where I&#x27;ve done during the application process.</li>
            <li>I took my daughters to a water park last weekend and it was great, not showing up with my skin all winter-pasty-white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy this in the Light shade and you fair-skinned folks will not be overwhelmed by the color.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m really, really light skinned</li>
            <li>To reach my back, I slip my mitt on a fly swatter and blend away.  </li>
            <li>I use Jergens Natural Glow for Fair to Medium skin.  </li>
            <li>I use Jergens Natural Glow for Fair to Medium skin.  </li>
            <li>and you can see it right away!</li>
            <li>Good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I liked the jergens natural glow lotion</li>
            <li>After doing some research, it seemed like Jergens Instant Sun was a good budget-friendly option.  </li>
            <li>Great cost compared to other self tanners.</li>
            <li>It has made me ready to go to spring functions with skirts and shorts and feeling good about my skin in the early spring.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>This has NO odor to it and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy that has super olive skin already, but felt like I needed to be darker for an upcoming beach trip.</li>
            <li>Quick dry, easy to use - love it!</li>
            <li>I could come to one of two conclusions: 1) Gingers and &amp;#34;instant sun&amp;#34; tanning creams simply are not meant to be put together; combining two pleasant things sounds nice in theory, but much like pairing peanut butter and mint, it just ends up being an ungodly amalgamation that really should not -- and cannot -- exist peacefully.</li>
            <li>I need to do my entire body and see how it fades but so far so good!</li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s important to note that I am the pastiest guy you will ever meet.</li>
            <li>The mousse texture really helps with the easy application.</li>
            <li>Nice brown tan color that fits my reddish natural tan pretty well.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised!  </li>
            <li>It goes on really easily, and it looks natural which is important because my skin would show up any streaks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use (following the instructions) and gives my very white legs a very beautiful and natural looking color.  </li>
            <li>Amazing instant color!</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice but am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I sometimes use my little cans of St. Tropez Classic or St. Tropez Express, I mostly use this because it is inexpensive yet provides a good result.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I sometimes use my little cans of St. Tropez Classic or St. Tropez Express, I mostly use this because it is inexpensive yet provides a good result.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other products that did a good job on the tanning.</li>
            <li>The foam spreads right on and shows the color and distribution of the foam - takes all the guess work right out of it.</li>
            <li>I reapply the product every 2 days right now.</li>
            <li>but, after success there, I began using it on my face with no ill effects.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not totally offensive, but it&#x27;s not my favorite scent either, and it always lingers for about 24 hours until the product is fully developed and you can safely shower off.</li>
            <li>Way way too dark for this fair skin.</li>
            <li>I trust Jergens to offer mild products that don&#x27;t irritate the skin, and the company really came through with this product.</li>
            <li>This worked great for me and left a nice subtle bronze color, not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I really like this formula as it dries quickly</li>
            <li>But it would have probably taken the whole bottle, and based on early indications, I would have ended up more orange than brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really only been using it on my legs, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shaved and exfoliated first and then began to apply it.  </li>
            <li>and I feel that this light bronze color looked pretty natural on me.</li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate prior to use and use sparingly over elbows knees and ankles.</li>
            <li>I put moisturizer on those areas first.</li>
            <li>It smells 10 x better than the Express and the same effect as it also.  </li>
            <li>but this is way better for the above reasons for me.</li>
            <li>It does not look too orange at all, unless I&#x27;ve applied too much!  </li>
            <li>It does not look too orange at all, unless I&#x27;ve applied too much!  </li>
            <li>The color was tan, no weird orange tint making you look like an Ooma Loompa.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>Gave me a funny color.</li>
            <li>sure if I would buy it again or go back to the lotion types.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I put on 2-3 coats, which I learned very quickly was a huge mistake as I turned into a streaky mess.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t apply the mousse to any certain areas in any particular order, but I make sure to use just a tiny amount of product on my hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>I began to see a change within about an hour and a half and by the time three hours had passed, I had a nice color.  </li>
            <li>I used a mit to put it on, that worked very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like the way</li>
            <li>My husband agreed, only reluctantly and because I made him, to mousse me up with the light tanner.  </li>
            <li>Use only a light amount.  </li>
            <li>Really it wasn&#x27;t brown</li>
            <li>Thanks Jergens.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem with streaks or too much orange.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Jergens Natural Glow Instant Sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various chemical bronzers like this one, and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I feel too that the lotion types are also more moisturizing for my poor legs which are neglected most of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left a nice slight tan on my fair skin within a few hours.</li>
            <li>It takes several hours to get the full effect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, most too dark and noticeably unnatural.</li>
            <li>I made sure to first purchase some tanning mitts, one for the body, and some small ones for the face.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up I found no left over residue on my sheets or pillowcases, and smelt no weird odors!</li>
            <li>I really like the color so far.</li>
            <li>I like that the look is very gradual and natural looking</li>
            <li>I put up with it for a few more hours and then showered before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>My tan lasted a few days, maybe 4 at the most, without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just using my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li>Paper is darker than I am and this gives me a healthy dark natural  looking tan.</li>
            <li>My right are suffered the same tragedy.  </li>
            <li>It goes on all light and airy and bubbly, not a bit greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>After using gradual self-tanning lotions on and off since high school (Dove, Jergens, Nivea), I decided to try an actual self-tanner this year for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to dry quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every self tanner on the market, from drugstore brands to high end, this is by far my favourite.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted a to have a natural pre-beach glow!</li>
            <li>The first time I applied this I used my hands and it was streaky and left my hands stained.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I bought the light to medum color which is a little lighter than what I wanted</li>
            <li>It takes several hours for the color to really develop, so just put on ONE coat evenly, wash your hands right away, and let it dry.</li>
            <li>I look alive, but I don&#x27;t look bronzed like some of my friends get at the beach  </li>
            <li>When it comes out, you can see it almost has a pinkish tint, which means it goes on looking naturally tan instead of orange.</li>
            <li>my purposes of looking natural and not like a bronzed goddess this method has worked well for me</li>
            <li>have used Jergans natural glow lotion for a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural ginger</li>
            <li>and I have zero chance of getting a natural tan.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; on applying this, so that may have helped with keeping this a natural look.</li>
            <li>I also use a pair of exfoliating gloves to exfoliate my skin in the shower before applying the self-tanner, and my Clarisonic for my face, although you could very well just use a facial scrub.  </li>
            <li>After the first application I barely noticed a difference but by the second application it looked like I have been tanning for a while.</li>
            <li>The main thing I like better about it is the lack of a certain vaguely unpleasant smell that the lotions all seem to have and also that it dries very fast.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn me orange, it really does dry in 60 seconds, it rinses easily off my hands with regular soap if I wash them immediately after application, and it&#x27;s not too dark on my skintone.  </li>
            <li>I try to not sit on anything or wear tight clothing for a good solid few hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries really quickly and doesn&#x27;t make a mess or get on my towels or anything.</li>
            <li>Although the mousse has a pleasant smell, I&#x27;ve noticed that it can have that weird DHA smell if left on all</li>
            <li>but I still like to look normal aka not blinding white.</li>
            <li>And while it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; in 60 seconds you have to use your own common sense and know that it takes a few hours to really &amp;#34;set in&amp;#34; and going out to play tennis or anything where you sweat a lot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair, with green eyes and pale pale skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind a white face, arms and upper body, but I have to admit, that my legs look much nicer with some color on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased it in Light Bronze, since I have pretty fair skin and was afraid the Deep Bronze would be too dark and look strange on me, plus be more difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li>Tried the dark one first.</li>
            <li>might just be too white for this product to look natural.</li>
            <li>I used the jergens in shower primer with a loofah and shaved before hand, I also used lotion all over and put extra on the spots that normally hold extra tanner.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly, as it states it does, and I was off to my daily activities.  </li>
            <li>Sublime Glow Daily Body Moisturizer + Natural Skin Tone Enhancer, Medium, 8.0 Ounce and also another similar product by Jergens.  </li>
            <li>But, you do need to clean the residue off of your palms, one at a time, so you don&#x27;t get dark palms as other reviewers mention.</li>
            <li>other benefit of this foam, is the color is actually realistic.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate when a tanning product has a slight color at application that way you can see where it&#x27;s spreading to avoid streaks.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It promises flawless, natural-looking color instantly--and</li>

            <li> I love this better than Jergens Express!  </li>
            <li> (You may want to tape it in place from the inside, and of course, make sure the fly swatter is clean.)  </li>
            <li> The best natural colour for a light tanner ever!</li>
            <li> If you get it on a spot like bottom feed sides, just a good scrub pad will blend it off quickly.</li>
            <li> But that shows how light I was compared to the color of the tan!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely  LOVE it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s become my favorite tanner.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is that the tanner imprints on most places I go and</li>
            <li> Okay so all tanning products have some sort of smell...</li>
            <li> If this mythical product exists out there please send it to me :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> And to my relief, it&#x27;s miles better than the self-tanner I tried like 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> This one is my go to favorite.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed after looking at the mirror, because I literally looked like I had been vacationing in the Bahamas for the last 3 days!</li>
            <li> I had better results with Jergen&#x27;s light tanning foam!</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I&#x27;ll do one leg with each and see which one looks better.</li>
            <li> just a nice glow of light tan color.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> beautiful natural color.</li>
            <li> color looks beautiful natural and lasts for almost a week.</li>
            <li> Its just becoming summer here in Canada</li>
            <li> , it was more like a light orange.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased one it helps with a smooth application</li>
            <li> This is hands down,  the BEST out there IMO!! :)</li>
            <li> My skin has a nice natural glow, it dries extremely quickly and it smells nice - kinda like soap!</li>
            <li> I have tried every kind of tanning lotion from Loving Tan to Clinique, and this is by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no orange color, and no streaks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply the mousse spread evenly and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Sweats off easily.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked out fine.</li>
            <li> Fine line between &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has made a huge difference in my &#x27;readiness for summer.&#x27;</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li> so it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I must put it on lightly because I can&#x27;t see where I&#x27;ve done during the application process.</li>
            <li> I took my daughters to a water park last weekend and it was great, not showing up with my skin all winter-pasty-white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy this in the Light shade and you fair-skinned folks will not be overwhelmed by the color.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m really, really light skinned</li>
            <li> To reach my back, I slip my mitt on a fly swatter and blend away.  </li>
            <li> I use Jergens Natural Glow for Fair to Medium skin.  </li>
            <li> I use Jergens Natural Glow for Fair to Medium skin.  </li>
            <li> and you can see it right away!</li>
            <li> Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I liked the jergens natural glow lotion</li>
            <li> After doing some research, it seemed like Jergens Instant Sun was a good budget-friendly option.  </li>
            <li> Great cost compared to other self tanners.</li>
            <li> It has made me ready to go to spring functions with skirts and shorts and feeling good about my skin in the early spring.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> This has NO odor to it and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that has super olive skin already, but felt like I needed to be darker for an upcoming beach trip.</li>
            <li> Quick dry, easy to use - love it!</li>
            <li> I could come to one of two conclusions: 1) Gingers and &amp;#34;instant sun&amp;#34; tanning creams simply are not meant to be put together; combining two pleasant things sounds nice in theory, but much like pairing peanut butter and mint, it just ends up being an ungodly amalgamation that really should not -- and cannot -- exist peacefully.</li>
            <li> I need to do my entire body and see how it fades but so far so good!</li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s important to note that I am the pastiest guy you will ever meet.</li>
            <li> The mousse texture really helps with the easy application.</li>
            <li> Nice brown tan color that fits my reddish natural tan pretty well.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised!  </li>
            <li> It goes on really easily, and it looks natural which is important because my skin would show up any streaks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use (following the instructions) and gives my very white legs a very beautiful and natural looking color.  </li>
            <li> Amazing instant color!</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice but am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I sometimes use my little cans of St. Tropez Classic or St. Tropez Express, I mostly use this because it is inexpensive yet provides a good result.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I sometimes use my little cans of St. Tropez Classic or St. Tropez Express, I mostly use this because it is inexpensive yet provides a good result.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other products that did a good job on the tanning.</li>
            <li> The foam spreads right on and shows the color and distribution of the foam - takes all the guess work right out of it.</li>
            <li> I reapply the product every 2 days right now.</li>
            <li> but, after success there, I began using it on my face with no ill effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not totally offensive, but it&#x27;s not my favorite scent either, and it always lingers for about 24 hours until the product is fully developed and you can safely shower off.</li>
            <li> Way way too dark for this fair skin.</li>
            <li> I trust Jergens to offer mild products that don&#x27;t irritate the skin, and the company really came through with this product.</li>
            <li> This worked great for me and left a nice subtle bronze color, not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I really like this formula as it dries quickly</li>
            <li> But it would have probably taken the whole bottle, and based on early indications, I would have ended up more orange than brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really only been using it on my legs, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shaved and exfoliated first and then began to apply it.  </li>
            <li> and I feel that this light bronze color looked pretty natural on me.</li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate prior to use and use sparingly over elbows knees and ankles.</li>
            <li> I put moisturizer on those areas first.</li>
            <li> It smells 10 x better than the Express and the same effect as it also.  </li>
            <li> but this is way better for the above reasons for me.</li>
            <li> It does not look too orange at all, unless I&#x27;ve applied too much!  </li>
            <li> It does not look too orange at all, unless I&#x27;ve applied too much!  </li>
            <li> The color was tan, no weird orange tint making you look like an Ooma Loompa.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> Gave me a funny color.</li>
            <li> sure if I would buy it again or go back to the lotion types.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I put on 2-3 coats, which I learned very quickly was a huge mistake as I turned into a streaky mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply the mousse to any certain areas in any particular order, but I make sure to use just a tiny amount of product on my hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> I began to see a change within about an hour and a half and by the time three hours had passed, I had a nice color.  </li>
            <li> I used a mit to put it on, that worked very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like the way</li>
            <li> My husband agreed, only reluctantly and because I made him, to mousse me up with the light tanner.  </li>
            <li> Use only a light amount.  </li>
            <li> Really it wasn&#x27;t brown</li>
            <li> Thanks Jergens.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with streaks or too much orange.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Jergens Natural Glow Instant Sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various chemical bronzers like this one, and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I feel too that the lotion types are also more moisturizing for my poor legs which are neglected most of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left a nice slight tan on my fair skin within a few hours.</li>
            <li> It takes several hours to get the full effect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, most too dark and noticeably unnatural.</li>
            <li> I made sure to first purchase some tanning mitts, one for the body, and some small ones for the face.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up I found no left over residue on my sheets or pillowcases, and smelt no weird odors!</li>
            <li> I really like the color so far.</li>
            <li> I like that the look is very gradual and natural looking</li>
            <li> I put up with it for a few more hours and then showered before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> My tan lasted a few days, maybe 4 at the most, without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just using my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li> Paper is darker than I am and this gives me a healthy dark natural  looking tan.</li>
            <li> My right are suffered the same tragedy.  </li>
            <li> It goes on all light and airy and bubbly, not a bit greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After using gradual self-tanning lotions on and off since high school (Dove, Jergens, Nivea), I decided to try an actual self-tanner this year for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to dry quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every self tanner on the market, from drugstore brands to high end, this is by far my favourite.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted a to have a natural pre-beach glow!</li>
            <li> The first time I applied this I used my hands and it was streaky and left my hands stained.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I bought the light to medum color which is a little lighter than what I wanted</li>
            <li> It takes several hours for the color to really develop, so just put on ONE coat evenly, wash your hands right away, and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I look alive, but I don&#x27;t look bronzed like some of my friends get at the beach  </li>
            <li> When it comes out, you can see it almost has a pinkish tint, which means it goes on looking naturally tan instead of orange.</li>
            <li> my purposes of looking natural and not like a bronzed goddess this method has worked well for me</li>
            <li> have used Jergans natural glow lotion for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural ginger</li>
            <li> and I have zero chance of getting a natural tan.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; on applying this, so that may have helped with keeping this a natural look.</li>
            <li> I also use a pair of exfoliating gloves to exfoliate my skin in the shower before applying the self-tanner, and my Clarisonic for my face, although you could very well just use a facial scrub.  </li>
            <li> After the first application I barely noticed a difference but by the second application it looked like I have been tanning for a while.</li>
            <li> The main thing I like better about it is the lack of a certain vaguely unpleasant smell that the lotions all seem to have and also that it dries very fast.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn me orange, it really does dry in 60 seconds, it rinses easily off my hands with regular soap if I wash them immediately after application, and it&#x27;s not too dark on my skintone.  </li>
            <li> I try to not sit on anything or wear tight clothing for a good solid few hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries really quickly and doesn&#x27;t make a mess or get on my towels or anything.</li>
            <li> Although the mousse has a pleasant smell, I&#x27;ve noticed that it can have that weird DHA smell if left on all</li>
            <li> but I still like to look normal aka not blinding white.</li>
            <li> And while it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; in 60 seconds you have to use your own common sense and know that it takes a few hours to really &amp;#34;set in&amp;#34; and going out to play tennis or anything where you sweat a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair, with green eyes and pale pale skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a white face, arms and upper body, but I have to admit, that my legs look much nicer with some color on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased it in Light Bronze, since I have pretty fair skin and was afraid the Deep Bronze would be too dark and look strange on me, plus be more difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Tried the dark one first.</li>
            <li> might just be too white for this product to look natural.</li>
            <li> I used the jergens in shower primer with a loofah and shaved before hand, I also used lotion all over and put extra on the spots that normally hold extra tanner.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly, as it states it does, and I was off to my daily activities.  </li>
            <li> Sublime Glow Daily Body Moisturizer + Natural Skin Tone Enhancer, Medium, 8.0 Ounce and also another similar product by Jergens.  </li>
            <li> But, you do need to clean the residue off of your palms, one at a time, so you don&#x27;t get dark palms as other reviewers mention.</li>
            <li> other benefit of this foam, is the color is actually realistic.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate when a tanning product has a slight color at application that way you can see where it&#x27;s spreading to avoid streaks.</li>
            <li> If you shave your legs or underarms, you can do it right before applying self-tanner, but if you wax, wait at least 24 hours or else</li>
            <li> it is odd to be almost transparent one day and then look like you live in Miami the next.</li>
            <li> Color didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped, but it didn&#x27;t end up on my clothes, so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> If any dry areas, such as the feet, look orange even after washing off the guide color, I will scrub them with a damp pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> If any dry areas, such as the feet, look orange even after washing off the guide color, I will scrub them with a damp pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> but they said it looked very natural and a few of them went out and bought it for themselves.</li>
            <li> I am a very pale person of Irish decent</li>
            <li> The color does fade a little bit between my weekend applications, the way a natural tan would, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get streaks or strange looking areas,</li>
            <li> After letting it dry for 3 minutes, I went to bed.</li>
            <li> The color does have a slight yellow tint to it</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t blame the product, I am just very pale naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and this gives me a natural looking tan after 1 application.</li>
            <li> The foam minimizes mess, but I still manage to make some occasionally anyway.  </li>
            <li> Weirdly enough, it made my skin feel dry when it dried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually gone to work the next day with this stuff on, since I typically shower at night only, but lately, I&#x27;ve started washing off the mousse in the morning, because it feels quite sticky on the skin and can look a bit orange with the guide color still on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sunless tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve either had to apply every day for four or five days to finally see slight results - or - it looks orange and awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does not leave streaks either as you are smearing a wet foam over your skin</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m careful to stay out of the sun</li>
            <li> I do another layer every few days until I can tell it&#x27;s starting to get blotchy in some areas</li>
            <li> I added another layer a few days later, but no.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes, my extremely white skin had turned an almost imperceptibly browner shade of white.</li>
            <li> It dried almost instantly which prevents it from getting on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually exfoliate once a week (with scrub AND an abrasive glove) especially on my ankles and knees, no lotion, then apply this when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, I am tan and it looks like I was actually in the sun - not just dirty.</li>
            <li> The later, not being so bad, but &amp;#34;SUPER PALE&amp;#34; would be my super hero name.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I prefer it over the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I have naturally pale skin and unless I spend hours in the sun using a high SPF lotion so to tan slowly without burning, I stay pale looking</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an instant tanning product in a few years so was anxious to see how this one performed.  </li>
            <li> A tan helps to hide spider veins and dark veins too and this tanner does that as well.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve never had much luck with sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying or using.</li>
            <li> As much as I loved waking up and checking my body for what a horrible job I did applying the lotion, I don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;fun</li>
            <li> For any other areas of the body, where a pumice stone would be too harsh, just use a salt or sugar scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For any other areas of the body, where a pumice stone would be too harsh, just use a salt or sugar scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previously I used a sunless tanner that was sprayed onto a mitt to apply.</li>
            <li> It is slightly orange but that is the way I tan too</li>
            <li> it delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it about a month now, with weekly applications, and I&#x27;ve had no streaking or odd</li>
            <li> A lot gets wasted in the mitt and you rinse product down the drain.</li>
            <li> It gives a darker tan - almost too dark for my pale skin.</li>
            <li> and I like that it has a little color to see where you&#x27;re applying it.  </li>
            <li> and I was just looking for a little tint without the orange..</li>
            <li> One time I thought I was turning a little brown, but it turns out I was just looking at my mirrored reflection in a log cabin, and it was just the lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so uneven</li>
            <li> tan builds over a period of a few hours.</li>
            <li> right after you use tanner is a bad idea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice In the past month.</li>
            <li> Usually self tanners turn me orange, but this one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the rays of the sun to touch my body, so I tend to act like a vampire when out and search out every covered or shady spot, even if it splits me away from the rest of the group.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY pale skin, as you can see.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly, maybe 10 minutes at worst.</li>
            <li> Some are gels, or dry slow or too little color, too much, or worse wrong color, read orange.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, no orangey coloring.  </li>
            <li> It fades slowly but not blotchy.</li>
            <li> The color is subtle.  </li>
            <li> I have very white legs and hate to wear stocking</li>
            <li> The thing I was disappointed in was the odor that seems unavoidable with self tanners.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed - this stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> plus it keeps you from getting those terrible orange hands.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I&#x27;ve used it twice In the past month. It fades slowly but not blotchy. You can see where I kissed a spot on my foot in between my toes. But that shows how light I was compared to the color of the tan!</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works!  I&#x27;m very fair, with green eyes and pale pale skin.  Usually self tanners turn me orange, but this one didn&#x27;t.  The color is subtle.  I look alive, but I don&#x27;t look bronzed like some of my friends get at the beach  I&#x27;ll never get a California girl glow, but I&#x27;m very happy with the light tan that I did get.  I&#x27;ve really only been using it on my legs, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries really quickly and doesn&#x27;t make a mess or get on my towels or anything.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an instant tanning product in a few years so was anxious to see how this one performed.  I shaved and exfoliated first and then began to apply it.  It goes on smoothly and evenly and I like that it has a little color to see where you&#x27;re applying it.  It dried quickly, as it states it does, and I was off to my daily activities.  I began to see a change within about an hour and a half and by the time three hours had passed, I had a nice color.  The thing I was disappointed in was the odor that seems unavoidable with self tanners.  I put up with it for a few more hours and then showered before bedtime.  My tan lasted a few days, maybe 4 at the most, without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and would purchase it again.  I have a medium-light toned skin and I feel that this light bronze color looked pretty natural on me.</li>
            <li> beautiful natural color. Be sure to exfoliate prior to use and use sparingly over elbows knees and ankles. I put moisturizer on those areas first. color looks beautiful natural and lasts for almost a week. Great cost compared to other self tanners. Did not transfer to clothing or bedding.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice but am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Deeper tan than the moiturizer, not orangey.</li>
            <li> The best natural colour for a light tanner ever! I&#x27;ve used every self tanner on the market, from drugstore brands to high end, this is by far my favourite.  Its just becoming summer here in Canada so I wanted a to have a natural pre-beach glow! After one coat this does it! My skin has a nice natural glow, it dries extremely quickly and it smells nice - kinda like soap! I used a mit to put it on, that worked very well. I did use the primer and tan extender as well. So far so good! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Previously I used a sunless tanner that was sprayed onto a mitt to apply. A lot gets wasted in the mitt and you rinse product down the drain. I also was left with streaks a lot of the time. With this mousse you do not need a mitt. But, you do need to clean the residue off of your palms, one at a time, so you don&#x27;t get dark palms as other reviewers mention. Latex gloves would do the trick too. This does not leave streaks either as you are smearing a wet foam over your skin so it goes on smoothly. I must put it on lightly because I can&#x27;t see where I&#x27;ve done during the application process. It takes several hours to get the full effect so plan accordingly. This tanner is great. It has made me ready to go to spring functions with skirts and shorts and feeling good about my skin in the early spring. A tan helps to hide spider veins and dark veins too and this tanner does that as well. It is slightly orange but that is the way I tan too so I wouldn&#x27;t blame the product, I am just very pale naturally. I am buying another bottle and would recommend you do the same if you like some color and lack the time to sit in the sun or would rather not damage your skin with the sun. You will regret sun tanning as your skin begins to prematurely age!</li>
            <li> I love this better than Jergens Express!  It smells 10 x better than the Express and the same effect as it also.  I bought mine at Target when my local Ulta ran out of it.  It&#x27;s terrific if you want to get a head start on your tan whether it be vacation or want to look like you went someplace for sun!</li>
            <li> I am officially a fan of this sunless tanning foam! My skin is often called &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; or like a porcelain doll. The later, not being so bad, but &amp;#34;SUPER PALE&amp;#34; would be my super hero name. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve never had much luck with sunless tanning products. What makes this one different is that the color change is immediate. The foam spreads right on and shows the color and distribution of the foam - takes all the guess work right out of it. As much as I loved waking up and checking my body for what a horrible job I did applying the lotion, I don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;fun problem.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other benefit of this foam, is the color is actually realistic. For the first time ever, I am tan and it looks like I was actually in the sun - not just dirty. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Jergens Natural Glow Instant Sun. It promises flawless, natural-looking color instantly--and it delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it about a month now, with weekly applications, and I&#x27;ve had no streaking or odd coloration. I trust Jergens to offer mild products that don&#x27;t irritate the skin, and the company really came through with this product. The bottle recommends you use Tan Extender Daily Moisturizer between applications. I haven&#x27;t been doing that. I&#x27;m just using my normal moisturizer and it&#x27;s worked out fine. The color does fade a little bit between my weekend applications, the way a natural tan would, but I don&#x27;t mind that. The directions mention only body skin but, after success there, I began using it on my face with no ill effects. I&#x27;m just careful not to get it too near my eyes. I really like the way it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has made a huge difference in my &#x27;readiness for summer.&#x27; I took my daughters to a water park last weekend and it was great, not showing up with my skin all winter-pasty-white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other products that did a good job on the tanning. But what makes this one the best is that it is a mousse. It goes on all light and airy and bubbly, not a bit greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried. It feels good on the skin and I actually find myself looking forward to putting it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff produces a great color. When it comes out, you can see it almost has a pinkish tint, which means it goes on looking naturally tan instead of orange. The first time I used it, I put on 2-3 coats, which I learned very quickly was a huge mistake as I turned into a streaky mess. It takes several hours for the color to really develop, so just put on ONE coat evenly, wash your hands right away, and let it dry. I&#x27;m very pale and this gives me a natural looking tan after 1 application.</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle 2 days ago and I felt the need to write a review already. I put it on my legs once and I see a difference! I am very white and I was just looking for a little tint without the orange..that&#x27;s what this gave me.</li>
            <li> I recently  bought this product in the deep bronze and I absolutely  LOVE it. Paper is darker than I am and this gives me a healthy dark natural  looking tan. Trust me....I have tried them all. From department  stores to drug stores. This is hands down,  the BEST out there IMO!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this all summer and it has worked well for me. I&#x27;ve had several pre-cancerous moles removed so I&#x27;m careful to stay out of the sun but I still like to look normal aka not blinding white. My friends noticed after I started using this product that I looked tanner but they said it looked very natural and a few of them went out and bought it for themselves. The first time I applied this I used my hands and it was streaky and left my hands stained. Ever since then I have applied it with a tanning mitt and it has been perfect. I usually exfoliate once a week (with scrub AND an abrasive glove) especially on my ankles and knees, no lotion, then apply this when my skin is dry. I do another layer every few days until I can tell it&#x27;s starting to get blotchy in some areas and then I start over with exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my purposes of looking natural and not like a bronzed goddess this method has worked well for me and it&#x27;s become my favorite tanner. If you sweat a lot or shave every day obviously it&#x27;s going to come off sooner because you&#x27;re exfoliating the skin it has affected. And while it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; in 60 seconds you have to use your own common sense and know that it takes a few hours to really &amp;#34;set in&amp;#34; and going out to play tennis or anything where you sweat a lot right after you use tanner is a bad idea.</li>
            <li> I am very fair (think auburn hair, blue/grey eyes, and freckles), and burn tragically in the sun. But I hate exposing my so-fair-they&#x27;re-nearly-translucent legs in the summertime.  I&#x27;ve tried various chemical bronzers like this one, and so far this is my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t turn me orange, it really does dry in 60 seconds, it rinses easily off my hands with regular soap if I wash them immediately after application, and it&#x27;s not too dark on my skintone.  The foam minimizes mess, but I still manage to make some occasionally anyway.  Buy this in the Light shade and you fair-skinned folks will not be overwhelmed by the color. In fact I can use this two days in a row and still not end up looking like an Oompa Loompa.  Pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> My husband agreed, only reluctantly and because I made him, to mousse me up with the light tanner.  In his defense, I have had a lot of mistakes with spray tans and tanning lotions.  The biggest problem is that the tanner imprints on most places I go and things I do, including the fiberglass in the cockpit of our boat.  :D  I could have gotten away with the B &amp; B Works brand of tanner if ONLY it hadn’t had glitter in it.  You can’t blame it on the birds when there’s glitter in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mousse went on very easily.  Weirdly enough, it made my skin feel dry when it dried.  Lucky for me I had the tan extender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my skin didn’t get any darker.  I added another layer a few days later, but no.</li>
            <li> Pros: Easy to apply, no orange color, and no streaks. I really appreciate when a tanning product has a slight color at application that way you can see where it&#x27;s spreading to avoid streaks. This worked great for me and left a nice subtle bronze color, not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The &#x27;tan&#x27; smell. Okay so all tanning products have some sort of smell... you know the one. It&#x27;s not totally offensive, but it&#x27;s not my favorite scent either, and it always lingers for about 24 hours until the product is fully developed and you can safely shower off. That&#x27;s the only con. I have yet to find the perfect tanning product with no scent that leaves you bronze. If this mythical product exists out there please send it to me :)</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed - this stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Jergans natural glow lotion for a while. I hated it. I looked orange and streaky. It was so uneven and it smelled awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Jergans one last try with this mousse formula and I purchased the primer and tan extender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best PURCHASE EVER! I am thrilled with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I prime In the shower with a loofa and then apply the mousse. Then I take a towel and scrub my wrists, ankles, forearms, knees, and elbows to ensure I don&#x27;t get orange build up from the product. I wash and scrub my hands and nails. In the future, I will use this with a mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tan builds over a period of a few hours. It&#x27;s gorgeous and brown looking, not orange. I try to not sit on anything or wear tight clothing for a good solid few hours. I reapply the product every 2 days right now. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised!  Delivers natural-looking color that mimics results from the sun and last for days. It&#x27;s so easy to apply the mousse spread evenly and dries very quickly.  I have naturally pale skin and unless I spend hours in the sun using a high SPF lotion so to tan slowly without burning, I stay pale looking year-round.  I&#x27;ve tried other sunless tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve either had to apply every day for four or five days to finally see slight results - or - it looks orange and awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion works well for me; I think I&#x27;ll be using it a lot this summer!</li>
            <li> I have VERY pale skin, as you can see. I&#x27;m a natural ginger and I have zero chance of getting a natural tan. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, most too dark and noticeably unnatural. I really like this formula as it dries quickly and you can see it right away! I really like the color so far. I need to do my entire body and see how it fades but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  Use only a light amount.  Love it.</li>
            <li> great product, don&#x27;t hesitate</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m really, really light skinned and I was intrigued yet nervous to try this. And to my relief, it&#x27;s miles better than the self-tanner I tried like 3 years ago. It goes on really easily, and it looks natural which is important because my skin would show up any streaks. The mousse texture really helps with the easy application. I did wait 45 mins or so before trying clothes. It seemed to dry quickly but I didn&#x27;t want to ruin the look on my skin or my clothes. I feel like this bottle will last a while too. I went with the &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; on applying this, so that may have helped with keeping this a natural look. Great product!</li>
            <li> This has NO odor to it and dries quickly.  Love it!</li>
            <li> No sunless tanner is perfect. Some are gels, or dry slow or too little color, too much, or worse wrong color, read orange. This one is my go to favorite. Tried the dark one first. Way way too dark for this fair skin. Tried the light bronze and this one is perfect for me. If I want darker I just do it again in a couple of days. I&#x27;ve found it lasts about 4-5 days before it noticeably lightens after showering. Good enough for me. Nice brown tan color that fits my reddish natural tan pretty well. Dries very quickly, maybe 10 minutes at worst. No residue or stickiness, darkens as it dries. Basically it&#x27;s a skin stain. For coverage that works for me 4 pumps for my thighs, 3 for my shins and calves. If you get it on a spot like bottom feed sides, just a good scrub pad will blend it off quickly. I liked the jergens natural glow lotion but this is way better for the above reasons for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing instant color! I&#x27;m a guy that has super olive skin already, but felt like I needed to be darker for an upcoming beach trip. I waited until after I showered last night, then exfoliated and applied as directed. After letting it dry for 3 minutes, I went to bed. When I woke up I found no left over residue on my sheets or pillowcases, and smelt no weird odors! I was so impressed after looking at the mirror, because I literally looked like I had been vacationing in the Bahamas for the last 3 days! This stuff is amazing. I have tried every kind of tanning lotion from Loving Tan to Clinique, and this is by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> it runs and leaves streaks.. and gets on my sheets!</li>
            <li> After using gradual self-tanning lotions on and off since high school (Dove, Jergens, Nivea), I decided to try an actual self-tanner this year for the first time.  After doing some research, it seemed like Jergens Instant Sun was a good budget-friendly option.  I purchased it in Light Bronze, since I have pretty fair skin and was afraid the Deep Bronze would be too dark and look strange on me, plus be more difficult to apply.  I made sure to first purchase some tanning mitts, one for the body, and some small ones for the face.  I also use a pair of exfoliating gloves to exfoliate my skin in the shower before applying the self-tanner, and my Clarisonic for my face, although you could very well just use a facial scrub.  If you shave your legs or underarms, you can do it right before applying self-tanner, but if you wax, wait at least 24 hours or else the product may settle into your open pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer applying this after my shower, letting it stay on overnight.  Before application, I moisturize my face, ears, neck, hands, feet, elbows, knees, and underarms.  To reach my back, I slip my mitt on a fly swatter and blend away.  (You may want to tape it in place from the inside, and of course, make sure the fly swatter is clean.)  I even apply it on my eye area, but only with whatever is left on the mitt after I&#x27;ve done the rest of my face.  I have some hormonal acne, but this does not aggravate it.  I don&#x27;t apply the mousse to any certain areas in any particular order, but I make sure to use just a tiny amount of product on my hands and feet.  I&#x27;ve actually gone to work the next day with this stuff on, since I typically shower at night only, but lately, I&#x27;ve started washing off the mousse in the morning, because it feels quite sticky on the skin and can look a bit orange with the guide color still on.  Although the mousse has a pleasant smell, I&#x27;ve noticed that it can have that weird DHA smell if left on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result after washing off the guide color is a nice, natural-looking tan.  It does not look too orange at all, unless I&#x27;ve applied too much!  If any dry areas, such as the feet, look orange even after washing off the guide color, I will scrub them with a damp pumice stone.  For any other areas of the body, where a pumice stone would be too harsh, just use a salt or sugar scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I sometimes use my little cans of St. Tropez Classic or St. Tropez Express, I mostly use this because it is inexpensive yet provides a good result.  The color lasts about 5 days if I do not moisturize my skin at all.  If you want to boost your tan throughout the week, I&#x27;d suggest using a gradual self-tanning lotion.  I use Jergens Natural Glow for Fair to Medium skin.  Also, make sure to look out for coupons in your newspaper for this product, as I&#x27;ve seen them fairly often during the summer.ide color is a nice, natural-looking tan.

            <li> Fine line between &amp;#34;oh I have color!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;oh my gosh what did I do to myself?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might just be too white for this product to look natural. I had better results with Jergen&#x27;s light tanning foam!</li>
            <li> Quick dry, easy to use - love it!</li>
            <li> Sweats off easily. Have to apply indoor not out. It works okay. Not a lot of color though.</li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s important to note that I am the pastiest guy you will ever meet. While walking on the beach, from some angles I literally disappear, and outside observers perceive me as just a floating red head. As a ginger, I can&#x27;t tan, and I&#x27;ve come to grips with this. One time I thought I was turning a little brown, but it turns out I was just looking at my mirrored reflection in a log cabin, and it was just the lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all to say that if I want to achieve a nice lightish brown, I have to resort to manmade creams like this one. I cleaned myself and exfoliated and all that jazz, and then I rubbed this on. Within a few minutes, my extremely white skin had turned an almost imperceptibly browner shade of white. Really it wasn&#x27;t brown, it was more like a light orange. I could come to one of two conclusions: 1) Gingers and &amp;#34;instant sun&amp;#34; tanning creams simply are not meant to be put together; combining two pleasant things sounds nice in theory, but much like pairing peanut butter and mint, it just ends up being an ungodly amalgamation that really should not -- and cannot -- exist peacefully. Or 2) this product MIGHT have worked, had I used lots and lots of it to make up for the fact that I am the color of a ghost. But it would have probably taken the whole bottle, and based on early indications, I would have ended up more orange than brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... caveat ginger.</li>
            <li> This is a good tanning mousse. It came out nice and foamy in texture and didn&#x27;t ever get plugged up. It has a nice scent, not too overpowering. The color was tan, no weird orange tint making you look like an Ooma Loompa. It dried almost instantly which prevents it from getting on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands didn&#x27;t get stained. I just washed them and they were clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m knocking one star off is because it did get splotchy in a couple places. Other than that, I prefer it over the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I put this product on my arms and legs, and then I went to play tennis with my friends for an hour.  When I came home I noticed that the tanning solution came off with the sweat.  The front of my legs were tanned, and the back of my legs were white again.  My right are suffered the same tragedy.  I had this on subscription monthly.  I just canceled it.  Not worth buying or using.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  It covers good, no smell and no brown sheets or clothes.  Thanks Jergens.</li>
            <li> I like this.  I didn&#x27;t realize I bought the light to medum color which is a little lighter than what I wanted but that&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it advertises. Left a nice slight tan on my fair skin within a few hours. It actually goes on bronze so you are instantly tan.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, no orangey coloring.  I used the Jergen&#x27;s scrub beforehand and the combo was good.  Color didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped, but it didn&#x27;t end up on my clothes, so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> This is a good product ... Make shur you wear gloves.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed. Gave me a funny color. I&#x27;m very fair and used the lightest shade. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am a very pale person of Irish decent so I only burn when I try to tan. After the first application I barely noticed a difference but by the second application it looked like I have been tanning for a while. I like that the look is very gradual and natural looking it is odd to be almost transparent one day and then look like you live in Miami the next. I used the jergens in shower primer with a loofah and shaved before hand, I also used lotion all over and put extra on the spots that normally hold extra tanner. A mitt is a must with this product. I am so glad I purchased one it helps with a smooth application plus it keeps you from getting those terrible orange hands. The color does have a slight yellow tint to it but I remember my younger days when I could tan my tan had a yellow tint to it. If you want a back from the beach bronze look you might want to go for the deep color but if you want to just look like you have color this is the one to go with</li>
            <li> I have very white legs and hate to wear stocking so I like to use a self tanner on my legs in summer.  I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Glow Daily Body Moisturizer + Natural Skin Tone Enhancer, Medium, 8.0 Ounce and also another similar product by Jergens.  I have never used a spray on tanner before.  This works well and gives me an even tan,  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with streaks or too much orange.  The main thing I like better about it is the lack of a certain vaguely unpleasant smell that the lotions all seem to have and also that it dries very fast.  It gives a darker tan - almost too dark for my pale skin. I feel too that the lotion types are also more moisturizing for my poor legs which are neglected most of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I would buy it again or go back to the lotion types.  Perhaps after I have used it longer I will decide. Or maybe I&#x27;ll do one leg with each and see which one looks better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the rays of the sun to touch my body, so I tend to act like a vampire when out and search out every covered or shady spot, even if it splits me away from the rest of the group.  Yea, it&#x27;s a joke in the family and I get teased terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I don&#x27;t like the sun on me, my skin stays very white.  I don&#x27;t mind a white face, arms and upper body, but I have to admit, that my legs look much nicer with some color on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect for me.  It&#x27;s easy to use (following the instructions) and gives my very white legs a very beautiful and natural looking color.  I don&#x27;t get streaks or strange looking areas, just a nice glow of light tan color.  Perfect.</li>
