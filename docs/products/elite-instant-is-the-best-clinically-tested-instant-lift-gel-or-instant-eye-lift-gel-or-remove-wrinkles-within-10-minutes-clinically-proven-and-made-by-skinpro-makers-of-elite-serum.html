            <li>I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li>My husband even noticed a difference and stated how bright my eyes looked.</li>
            <li>I have used many eye creams and gels before and what first impressed me was the great container it came in.</li>

            <li>I still have two more years before completing my Bachelor’s degree, so sleep is nowhere on my radar.</li>
            <li>and I love this.  </li>
            <li>So many products come in containers, tubes or bottles that end up causing a lot of waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many products that don&#x27;t work-</li>
            <li>Many products leave you with a filmy residue on your skin, but that wasn’t the case here.</li>
            <li>Much better than spending money on therapeutic products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>this price you wont get a better product.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Like most of us, I’ve put more money than I’d care to admit into buying anti-aging, anti-wrinkle products that don’t do anything except aggravate my skin and make my wallet lighter.</li>
            <li>have a particular problem with bags under my eyes (even when I have a great night&#x27;s sleep) and lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes look and feel better, the product goes on smoothly and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li>it’s innovative and forward thinking products, and for this price you’re getting an amazing serum that shows real effects</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>And works very quickly so you can apply whenever wherever.  </li>
            <li>Increased elasticity, made fine lines disappear, and darkness lift.</li>
            <li>After just a week of using my product I noticed a huge difference in how my eyes looked.</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>The great thing about this product is that it feels like a moisturizer but actually works like a wrinkle-reducer.</li>
            <li>I felt confident, seeing the results right in the mirror.</li>
            <li>When my Elite Serum arrived I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>As a long-time skin care product oficiando, usually those of the big name, high-end department store variety, I have to say that the Elite Serum Instant stands up to the best of the best.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and goes to work.</li>
            <li>Its non oily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly with no greasy residue and by the end of the week (two applications per day)</li>
            <li>Serum Instant arrived quickly after processing the order and was packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>It doesn’t take but a few minutes to apply the serum around my eyes, but the results have been great.</li>
            <li>Putting on eye makeup and liner was finally fun again.</li>
            <li>I tried this serum because I wanted something quick and effective; my other eye serum, Lancome Absolute Eye Serum, started giving me reactions because of its strong smell.</li>
            <li>Yeah Right were the first words I thought of when I saw this product.</li>
            <li>reduced the appearance of wrinkles right away, exactly as its name suggest.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Elite Serum Instant with high hopes, due to all the wonderful reviews I came across.</li>
            <li>I put it on first thing in the am and keep it in my bag and apply it throughout the day as I need it.</li>
            <li>Many people at worked have asked me if I changed my hair or lost weight; they know something is different about me</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and it will continue to be a part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many skin products to help make me look and feel younger</li>
            <li>If you want a product that is easy to use and only takes a couple of minutes to apply, you will love Elite Serum Instant.</li>
            <li>I really wasn’t interested, but she insisted, so I went ahead with it.  </li>
            <li>My eyes were smoother and more vibrant-looking than I’d seen them in a very long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review products but, I have been so pleased with the results I have achieved from Elite Serum Instant -</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better about this product is the fact that not only is it providing temporary results, it contains peptides that help to treat fine lines and wrinkles on a long term basis as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement to dark circles (because it is an instant product) but it works great for the lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but definitely doesn&#x27;t live up to the 10 minute promise.</li>
            <li>My sensitive, pale skin does not react well to a lot of products, but this was gentle and effective!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>Also, the serum really does absorb into your skin so you do not feel like you’re wearing another layer of make-up.</li>
            <li>Its price was reasonable, and the statics provided by the company seemed promising.</li>
            <li>I cannot express how much of a confidence booster that is.</li>
            <li>I really saw an immediate illumination of the skin around my eyes without irritation.</li>
            <li>and I was left with brighter, smooth, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really brighten from what I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li>I see much dirrerence in using it.</li>
            <li>It really does what is says.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product -- actually lives up to the written promises.  </li>
            <li>This product is a light serum that doesn’t dry out your skin or make it look oily like many other products do.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the &amp;#34;dramatic results in 10 min.&amp;#34; claim - not sure what results i am supposed to see, but it is a nice feeling serum.</li>
            <li>Even after a full 8 hours of good sleep, I normally awake looking dull and tired with lines that I’m sure are visible from miles away.</li>
            <li>I’d used Dr. Gross for years with so-so results, and then some Perricone, MD, but nothing that made me want to go back for more.</li>
            <li>this level of quality, at a third of the cost of major brands, it’s pretty safe to say that the Elite Serum Instant is IT for me!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t changed the look of the bags under my eyes but the skin there feels smoother, stronger and a little more elastic after about 3 months of use, so I will keep using it for now.</li>
            <li>I found myself always wearing my eyeglasses in an attempt to conceal my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Elite Serum Instant on the internet and after reading deciding that this product was worth a try.</li>
            <li>After using this for a few weeks, I am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any long standing results, but I&#x27;m happy enough with instant results, if even only temporarily.  </li>
            <li>From the time it took me to apply the serum to the time I was ready walk out the door, in no less than fifteen minutes</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the dramatic results, still a good product.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money over the years on comparable serums sold by the big name companies that dominate most magazines and TV commercials.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just too old!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s usually not the case with these type of products.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin is more hydrated than it has been in the past</li>
            <li>Also easy to use and comes in a small cute little syringe you can keep in your purse</li>
            <li>The product is definitely quick when you apply but be careful because it tends to thicken in warmer environments.</li>
            <li>What happened in those ten minutes was nothing short of extraordinary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exactly as the name suggests, instant!!!&lt;br /&gt;It’s an instant fix for the wrinkled, patchy skin near your eyes, if you have to get ready immediate for a party, ceremony or outing.</li>
            <li>will never waste my time or money on another eye cream of gel</li>
            <li>s far as anti aging creams go, I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to try a product I haven&#x27;t heard of before.  </li>
            <li>I have kept up use of the Elite Serum Instant for several months now and continue to enjoy the same visible results as day one.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for any woman who wants to look younger without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>As far as the time it took for it to work, well I noticed a difference in the time they advertise.  </li>
            <li>Your wrinkles won’t erase completely.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone who is searching for a product to remove wrinkles near the eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this serum is providing long term benefits or if just offers Instant results that aren&#x27;t long lasting, but if not, that&#x27;s ok with me.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend that you try Elite Serum Instant.  </li>
            <li>I really like this serum - it really only works for the upper, droopy eyelids problem in my case.  </li>
            <li>It’s kind of expensive</li>
            <li>After one month I am back to wearing my contacts and I am so glad to not have to hide behind my glasses</li>
            <li>It bonds with anything you put over it, so your foundation ends up looking a little funny.  </li>
            <li>The first tube began to leak a little and the second one broke (the pump stopped pumping).  </li>
            <li>The price is over my usual beauty budget, but the way my skin looks and the fact that I don’t have to constantly go check my make-up makes this worth the price.</li>
            <li>In fact, after only a few applications, I had to double-check the label as I was certain that Elite was a member of my $100+ skin care arsenal.</li>
            <li>I’ve had wrinkles under my eyes for a few years now (getting older now!).  </li>

            <li> The price is over my usual beauty budget, but the way my skin looks and the fact that I don’t have to constantly go check my make-up makes this worth the price.</li>
            <li> In fact, after only a few applications, I had to double-check the label as I was certain that Elite was a member of my $100+ skin care arsenal.</li>
            <li> I’ve had wrinkles under my eyes for a few years now (getting older now!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a firming product that works this quickly.</li>
            <li> These serums have always worked at first, but soon their results become less and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It does so without leaving behind that white residue that cracks when I smile.  </li>
            <li> Many of the other products in my collection, expensive ones that I’ve sworn by for years, take twice as long to produce a fraction of the results that I saw, instantly, with this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue like some other instant products</li>
            <li> It also doesn’t dry my skin out which is a big plus for me because I have naturally dry skin.</li>

            <li> They started as thin, fine lines, that were barely noticeable and have progressed to deep wrinkles to the point where my makeup actually settles into them and makes them appear worse than what they are.  </li>

            <li> Definitely not worth the big box price!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d rather have an instant product that I apply everyday that works than a product that is supposed to work long term and doesn&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> and I’m not sure how long it’ll last</li>
            <li> They’re still there, but  my skin is so much smoother, and the lines are so faint that I can actually wear eye shadow and concealer my eyes without it clumping and getting stuck in my lines.</li>
            <li> It only took a few minutes for me to start noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an &#x27;instant&#x27; product, which means that it works within a few minutes of application.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this serum - it really only works for the upper, droopy eyelids problem in my case.  It hasn&#x27;t changed the look of the bags under my eyes but the skin there feels smoother, stronger and a little more elastic after about 3 months of use, so I will keep using it for now. The only complaint I have is the funky container and that&#x27;s why I subtracted 1 star.  The first tube began to leak a little and the second one broke (the pump stopped pumping).  I just took the tube apart and emptied the contents into another container with an eyedrop applicator to prevent contamination of the serum.</li>
            <li> As a university student, I usually stay up very late working on assignments and studying for exams. After mid-terms last month, I was so tired and I noticed my eyes had started to get dark circles under them. I still have two more years before completing my Bachelor’s degree, so sleep is nowhere on my radar. I tried Elite Serum Instant because the advertisement said it will instantly work on dark circles and puffins and lines.  I’ve been using this cream regularly now for over a month and I love this.  I put it on first thing in the am and keep it in my bag and apply it throughout the day as I need it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review products but, I have been so pleased with the results I have achieved from Elite Serum Instant - I just need to share.&lt;br /&gt;Over the past year my eyes have really been showing my age and between dark circles and puffiness I always looked tired or like I was just crying. I found myself always wearing my eyeglasses in an attempt to conceal my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Elite Serum Instant on the internet and after reading deciding that this product was worth a try. I am not one to resort to Botox or plastic surgery so I was praying this product would work for me. When my Elite Serum arrived I was excited to try it. I have used many eye creams and gels before and what first impressed me was the great container it came in. The applicator syringe provides control and perfect application results. So many products come in containers, tubes or bottles that end up causing a lot of waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply my Elite Serum Instant morning and night dabbing it on to my under eye area, crow&#x27;s feet and a little on my upper eye area. It absorbs quickly and goes to work. After just a week of using my product I noticed a huge difference in how my eyes looked. Putting on eye makeup and liner was finally fun again. After one month I am back to wearing my contacts and I am so glad to not have to hide behind my glasses anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never waste my time or money on another eye cream of gel and I just felt like I needed to let anyone considering buying this product know how great it is.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, at first, especially considering the price, but I went ahead and bit the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a particular problem with bags under my eyes (even when I have a great night&#x27;s sleep) and lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  I have tried many products that don&#x27;t work- some have even caused pimples with the greasy residue they leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elite Serum Instant arrived quickly after processing the order and was packaged nicely.  After reading the instructions, I immediately applied it around an under my eyes.  It absorbed quickly with no greasy residue and by the end of the week (two applications per day) I saw results.  I look younger and healthier.  Many people at worked have asked me if I changed my hair or lost weight; they know something is different about me but they can&#x27;t put their finger on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that you try Elite Serum Instant.  If you are on the fence about it- DO IT!  I realize that it is on the pricey end, however, in this case, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> It is not mentioned that only bring it results in 3 to 6 months.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> If you want a product that is easy to use and only takes a couple of minutes to apply, you will love Elite Serum Instant. When it says instant, it means instant. It only took a few minutes for me to start noticing a difference. Many products leave you with a filmy residue on your skin, but that wasn’t the case here. I keep it in my purse and apply throughout the day as needed.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I  sqeezed a little Elite Serum instant under my eye lids...the fat that had built up inside my skin&lt;br /&gt;disappeared in a short  time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> I am a mother of 3 and self employed businesswoman with very little time for myself and very little time for sleep.  Late nights over the last few years have caused dark spots and wrinkles under my eyes. I tried this serum because I wanted something quick and effective; my other eye serum, Lancome Absolute Eye Serum, started giving me reactions because of its strong smell.After using this for a few weeks, I am quite satisfied with the results. The great thing about this product is that it feels like a moisturizer but actually works like a wrinkle-reducer. There is no smell to this product whatsoever so you will not have to worry about allergies. Also, the serum really does absorb into your skin so you do not feel like you’re wearing another layer of make-up. The product is definitely quick when you apply but be careful because it tends to thicken in warmer environments. Overall, I give this product five stars because it does what it says!</li>
            <li> s far as anti aging creams go, I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to try a product I haven&#x27;t heard of before.  When it comes to Elite Serum Instant, it actually works. Not only does it help smooths out lines on your face, it works instantly, hence its name. I keep it in my purse and apply it midday for a pick me up.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any long standing results, but I&#x27;m happy enough with instant results, if even only temporarily.  Much better than spending money on therapeutic products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I did what directions said to do. And after a week of use nothing!OK for eye cream and that is it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the dramatic results, still a good product.</li>
            <li> I will admit when trying this product, I was skeptical. I have spent a lot of money over the years on comparable serums sold by the big name companies that dominate most magazines and TV commercials. These serums have always worked at first, but soon their results become less and less noticeable. Definitely not worth the big box price! When I came upon the Elite Serum Instant, I decided to give it a try. Its price was reasonable, and the statics provided by the company seemed promising. When I tried the product initially, I noticed that my crow’s feet and the laugh-lines around my eyes seemed noticeably smoother that day. I felt confident, seeing the results right in the mirror. The Elite Serum Instant helped my skin look and feel younger. The lines are not completely erased, but their appearance is lessened. I cannot express how much of a confidence booster that is. I have kept up use of the Elite Serum Instant for several months now and continue to enjoy the same visible results as day one. I recommend this product for any woman who wants to look younger without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I really saw an immediate illumination of the skin around my eyes without irritation. My sensitive, pale skin does not react well to a lot of products, but this was gentle and effective! Increased elasticity, made fine lines disappear, and darkness lift. Excellent product for the health conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price you wont get a better product. I’ve read several reviews and the company is known for it’s innovative and forward thinking products, and for this price you’re getting an amazing serum that shows real effects</li>
            <li> I purchased the Elite Serum Instant with high hopes, due to all the wonderful reviews I came across. For a few months I had been looking for a product to bring my eyes back to life, because working the night shift can really take a toll on your appearance. I tried the Maybelline Eye Brightener, but I was unsatisfied because it left a sticky residue on my skin and made it feel uncomfortably tight.  I also purchased the Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum, but noticed some discoloration around my eyes about a week into using it.&lt;br /&gt;  I am happy to say that I was not disappointed in my purchase! From the time it took me to apply the serum to the time I was ready walk out the door, in no less than fifteen minutes I saw a huge difference.  My husband even noticed a difference and stated how bright my eyes looked. The skin around my eyes look and feel better, the product goes on smoothly and does not leave any residue. It also doesn’t dry my skin out which is a big plus for me because I have naturally dry skin. Lastly, there was no discoloration and I was left with brighter, smooth, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but definitely doesn&#x27;t live up to the 10 minute promise. Maybe I&#x27;m just too old!</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad.  It does however stick to your makeup.  It bonds with anything you put over it, so your foundation ends up looking a little funny.  I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic effects though.</li>
            <li> Used as directed. Did not see any improvement at all, used faithfully for close to a month.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use. It doesn’t take but a few minutes to apply the serum around my eyes, but the results have been great. It&#x27;s an &#x27;instant&#x27; product, which means that it works within a few minutes of application.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue like some other instant products do and it doesn&#x27;t cake or flake.  Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews of products but I felt compelled to for Elite Serum Instant.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I found the Elite Serum Instant to be what they market it to be and that&#x27;s usually not the case with these type of products. As far as the time it took for it to work, well I noticed a difference in the time they advertise.  The results truly are instant.  I put it on in the am before work and it truly &amp;#34;freezes&amp;#34; the area around my eyes.  It does so without leaving behind that white residue that cracks when I smile.  The dispenser is so convenient and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaking so I actually keep mine in my purse and apply throughout the day when I need a pick me up.</li>
            <li> Yeah Right were the first words I thought of when I saw this product. Happy is the word I am now!!! This is the best, fastest eye cream on the market that WORKS! And works very quickly so you can apply whenever wherever.  This is like an instant eye left in a tube.  What&#x27;s even better about this product is the fact that not only is it providing temporary results, it contains peptides that help to treat fine lines and wrinkles on a long term basis as well.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about buying and using this product when I saw the &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; claim.This serum works wonders! Its non oily and absorbs quickly. It can be used on any type of skin and it&#x27;ll give you immediate results. It&#x27;s very hard to find a firming product that works this quickly. Overnight you can see a difference in facial contours. It doesn&#x27;t really brighten from what I&#x27;ve seen but it does lift &amp; firm. It works great with smoothing out wrinkles too!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and it will continue to be a part of my daily routine.  I am now on my second syringe!</li>
            <li> I see much dirrerence in using it.</li>
            <li> I’ve taken care of my skin my entire life, and started anti-aging treatments in my 30’s. It’s hard finding a product that delivers what it promises. I’d used Dr. Gross for years with so-so results, and then some Perricone, MD, but nothing that made me want to go back for more. And then one day my friend introduced me to this serum. I was skeptical at first, thinking “10 minutes? How will something like this show results in that time?” I really wasn’t interested, but she insisted, so I went ahead with it.  What happened in those ten minutes was nothing short of extraordinary. I couldn’t believe it! It took away years of lines immediately, making my husband remark how much younger I looked.  I actually felt like I was watching the years roll away. It’s painless, affordable, and delivers what it promises! I swear by this serum and get compliments on my eyes all the time. I look bright-eyed, younger, and happier. I don&#x27;t know if this serum is providing long term benefits or if just offers Instant results that aren&#x27;t long lasting, but if not, that&#x27;s ok with me.  I&#x27;d rather have an instant product that I apply everyday that works than a product that is supposed to work long term and doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> As a long-time skin care product oficiando, usually those of the big name, high-end department store variety, I have to say that the Elite Serum Instant stands up to the best of the best. In fact, after only a few applications, I had to double-check the label as I was certain that Elite was a member of my $100+ skin care arsenal. Here’s why…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mornings usually begin with extreme eye puffiness. Even after a full 8 hours of good sleep, I normally awake looking dull and tired with lines that I’m sure are visible from miles away. Within minutes of my first application of the Elite Serum Instant, I was headed out of my front door to start my day without the usual worry and self-consciousness about the appearance of my under eye areas. My eyes were smoother and more vibrant-looking than I’d seen them in a very long time. Many of the other products in my collection, expensive ones that I’ve sworn by for years, take twice as long to produce a fraction of the results that I saw, instantly, with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this level of quality, at a third of the cost of major brands, it’s pretty safe to say that the Elite Serum Instant is IT for me!</li>
            <li> I’ve had wrinkles under my eyes for a few years now (getting older now!).  They started as thin, fine lines, that were barely noticeable and have progressed to deep wrinkles to the point where my makeup actually settles into them and makes them appear worse than what they are.  I have tried so many skin products to help make me look and feel younger but none has worked quite like Elite Serum Instant. This product is a light serum that doesn’t dry out your skin or make it look oily like many other products do. In fact, my skin is more hydrated than it has been in the past and I don&#x27;t need to use an additional moisturizer with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know how it works but using Elite Serum Instant reduced the appearance of wrinkles right away, exactly as its name suggest.  It’s kind of expensive and I’m not sure how long it’ll last but I’m just happy to have something that works. Also easy to use and comes in a small cute little syringe you can keep in your purse (just be careful to keep it hidden!).</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> It is great. It really does what is says. The results last all day. I will recommend it to all my friends</li>
            <li> Like most of us, I’ve put more money than I’d care to admit into buying anti-aging, anti-wrinkle products that don’t do anything except aggravate my skin and make my wallet lighter. The Elite Serum Instant is one of the very, very few products that actually does what it says.  Don’t get me wrong—this isn’t the fountain of youth. Your wrinkles won’t erase completely. But I had deep crow’s feet from years of smoking (and laughing) and not wearing any sunblock. They’re still there, but  my skin is so much smoother, and the lines are so faint that I can actually wear eye shadow and concealer my eyes without it clumping and getting stuck in my lines. I NEVER thought that would happen again! The price is over my usual beauty budget, but the way my skin looks and the fact that I don’t have to constantly go check my make-up makes this worth the price.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, did not like this</li>
            <li> Fabulous product -- actually lives up to the written promises.  Would definitely buy this again and bought one tube for a friend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the &amp;#34;dramatic results in 10 min.&amp;#34; claim - not sure what results i am supposed to see, but it is a nice feeling serum. Not moisturizing, but does seem to have a smoothing effect. Not sure at this time if I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this it is horrible and I would have sent it back but I don&#x27;t know where the receipt went to.</li>
            <li> ELITE SERUM INSTANT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as the name suggests, instant!!!&lt;br /&gt;It’s an instant fix for the wrinkled, patchy skin near your eyes, if you have to get ready immediate for a party, ceremony or outing. I recommend this to everyone who is searching for a product to remove wrinkles near the eyes. I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement to dark circles (because it is an instant product) but it works great for the lines.</li>
