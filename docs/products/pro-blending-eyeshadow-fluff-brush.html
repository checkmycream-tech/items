            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>Love this brush!</li>
            <li>Nice pencil.</li>
            <li>It blends eyeshadow nicely but sheds a lot.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and it picks up the perfect amount of color.</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this brush.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s much better than this.</li>
            <li>i need  more than one.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it</li>
            <li>One of my favorite brushes--</li>
            <li>so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Ok blending brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash without a lot of fallout.</li>
            <li>They are ok for the price but lost their shape after the first wash.</li>
            <li>Not that special but blends</li>
            <li>Great for blending in the crease and absolutely no shedding or fallout.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant when it first arrived, and then again after its first wash (it can look gnarly until it dries), but it has proven to be a great little brush.</li>
            <li>I have to say that for the price this brush is pretty on point.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>Blends to perfection very comparable to sigma blending brush!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery,  kinda rough/scratchy bristles.</li>
            <li>Brand new!  </li>
            <li>Very soft bristles!</li>
            <li>It is very soft and did not shed after washing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about ordering 2 more, but maybe from the actual CS website due to the pricing here.</li>
            <li>and I must say this looks and acts exactly the same, but cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Since its not as soft as Mac 217.</li>
            <li>The are very fluffy and good to really blend those hard lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more rough than I expected but blends product pretty well.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t fluffy enough</li>

            <li> This is great brush for blending eyeshadow. I would definitely compare it to Mac 217. It blends my shadows beautifully. I use this brush every single day.

            <li> Very soft bristles! Love this brush!</li>
            <li> Ok blending brush. I bought three of these and I work as a make up artist and read a good review on these brushes from Lauren Curtis. She is big on YouTube and recommended these brushes. They are ok for the price but lost their shape after the first wash. The are very fluffy and good to really blend those hard lines. They do pick up quite a bit of excess product though, which can be a bit wasteful. Haven&#x27;t owned them long enough yet to see how they hold up over time, but will update after two or three months of continual use.</li>
