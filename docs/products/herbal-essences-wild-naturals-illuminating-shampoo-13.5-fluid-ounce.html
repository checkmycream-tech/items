            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>I think that Herbal Essences did a great job with the fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li>I also have some gray hairs that can be a bit fly away and the shampoo did not seem to help with taming those pesky hairs.</li>
            <li>It smells great.  </li>
            <li>this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo did a great job of cleansing my hair.</li>
            <li>However, it is a great shampoo and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells amazing and cleansed my hair to perfection!</li>
            <li>The shine it applied to it is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>: Let me start with what I like with the product, I love the smell of the shampoo and conditioner smells great!</li>
            <li>What a pleasant shampoo to use.</li>
            <li>A pleasant scent, luxurious lather, easy rinsing are some of the things I like best about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It has a citrus smell not too strong but perfect.</li>
            <li>The lather is really good.</li>
            <li>I feel this acted close to how a cleansing rinse would act and loved the way the shower smelled while using it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for all hair types which means that others in my household can use it</li>
            <li>I think that this is a side affect of the shampoo being for &amp;#34;all hair types.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s still a good product, it just doesn&#x27;t fill all of my needs.</li>
            <li>It smelled so good that I had strangers asking what it was.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but my hair still smelled good.</li>
            <li>The cassia seeds within are supposed to protect and strengthen hair, and I feel they do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still this is a good shampoo for those looking for sleek, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>the price range, it is a good shampoo for me.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo with a nice scent .</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from my VoxBox to test and review; I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out because the scent was wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I received compliments on how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li>Smelled good in the bottle but not so good on my hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it as a good every day shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>she loved the scent in the end</li>
            <li>it is a good product for a fair price.</li>
            <li>and like it was good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using the shampoo and conditioner my hair smelled so good.</li>
            <li>It smells so, so amazingly good.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked gorgeous and shiny after drying and styling.</li>
            <li>This is a mild shampoo with a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>and of course I LOVE hair products that not only ave a wonderful scent, but that have a wonderful scent that LASTS!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and really lasts but doesn&#x27;t overpower!</li>
            <li>I love this trio!</li>
            <li>and that was my favorite product!</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>After the first use, I thought I was jist impressed with that nice feeling</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and after rinsing it out I didn&#x27;t get that feeling</li>

            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I received this great product as a free test sample from Influenster.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>To me, I would describe this shampoo as with a nice smell, but not overly fragranced.  </li>
            <li>I loved the cute and tropical packaging, and look forward to using the rest of the Illuminating line.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up nicely and cleanses well.</li>
            <li>Used it top to toe and smells so good.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a citrusy note, kind of grapefruity.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice balance of moisture and cleans well.</li>
            <li>Now this could be a good thing if I were looking for more body to my hair</li>
            <li>This is a nice shampoo I will give to my daughter to use.</li>
            <li>but these are my own honest opinions.</li>
            <li>I liked this product alot.  </li>
            <li>But my review and opinions were completely my own, I will recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a nice scent in hair even after rinsing away.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is a creamy texture and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle of shampoo in my shower was that it smelled AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo smells so incredible that washing my hair was the highlight of my day, honestly!  </li>
            <li>It is literally the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have around in a pinch, and my husband likes it just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is the same good shampoo as we&#x27;ve experienced and it has a good scent.</li>
            <li>So girly and nice, I love it.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent and did notice a bit more shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how soft and silky it had made my hair feel even before I had got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the quality and performance of these products.</li>
            <li>and this does exactly what it claims to do, all while smelling great.</li>
            <li>Its a bright and sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>And the first day using it was great.</li>
            <li>I noticed it has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>and I used it right away after smelling it because it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Great shampoo - left my hair with an amazing shine!</li>
            <li>First of all, the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li>I got this product in an Influenster box for free to review, and I have really enjoyed using this product!</li>
            <li>The smell is very refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>I just received a free sample of the shampoo, conditioner, and oil in exchange for an honest review of the products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this shampoo, it smelt am amazing and made my hair so much shinier and softer.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, very fruity.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li>I really love the shine that it gives my hair</li>
            <li>seaberry scent is nice and light.</li>
            <li>Though I should note that I have healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I love Herbal Essence products.</li>
            <li>Most of them claim to do this or that, and I take it with a grain of salt, assuming it&#x27;s marketing.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this shampoo, however, is the smell.</li>
            <li>The shampoo makes my hair feel like its really cleaned and smells great as well.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I was able to see that the shampoo and conditioner did make a difference in terms of the shine when I just used the shampoo and conditioner alone.</li>
            <li>This product was okay,</li>
            <li>love the scent (seaberry).</li>
            <li>Okay shampoo.</li>
            <li>also I could see it gave me a bit more shine</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting smell.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and for once my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw .</li>
            <li>What more can you ask from a shampoo?</li>
            <li>I would have been much better off with the detoxifying set.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the feel of my hair after the second day with this product.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>but with this shampoo it is so hydrating that I can use it more often.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair shiny smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love these fragrances.  </li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance has been the turkish fig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love love love the smell</li>
            <li>and I was beyond pleased with the &amp;#34;tropical experience&amp;#34; as well as the results.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I did notice more shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>Love how it lathers in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I was pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried many serums and sprays.</li>
            <li>I received this in my Influenster box to review and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>and I am still as in love with it as Day 1.</li>
            <li>This product was sent to me for free to review by influenster!</li>
            <li>Scent lingered in my hair, which I love.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and healthy after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Then again, it does with most shampoos.</li>
            <li>i love the smell of it</li>
            <li>love the scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not at all overwhelming, which can sometimes happen in citrus scents.</li>
            <li>Not so with this shampoo, which made it really enjoyable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must first say that the scent of the shampoo was mild yet pleasant; it was very refreshing and more fruity than floral, which is just as I prefer.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a very clean scent to it.</li>
            <li>I loved the creamy consistency of the product and how it had a rich full lather.</li>
            <li>I got it as a complimentary product for testing purposes from influenster and adored it!!</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and rinses away quickly.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences shampoos always come with a strong lovely floral scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too fruity/floral/sweet, and the scent is so strong, especially in a hot shower.</li>
            <li>It lathered nicely, and my hair still had a nice shine and volume, despite two straight days in a fitted scrub cap for work.</li>
            <li>It lathers good and makes your hair feel fresh and clean instead of</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels after using it and the smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re still in your teens or early twenties with oily hair, this product may be great for you.</li>
            <li>This one did just that with a great soft citrus/floral smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and made my hair soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li>I really loved the scent of this shampoo and felt it cleaned my hair very well</li>
            <li>but I still recommend it as an all-around good shampoo.</li>
            <li>but since I used it with the matching conditioner, which is really good as well, I don&#x27;t know how much shine was from the shampoo or the conditioner</li>
            <li>They were soft easy to detangle smelled great</li>
            <li>This shampoo is wildly potent, wildly good, and wildly illuminating according to the bottle!  </li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed using Herbal Essences and would recommend it for an economical shampoo!  </li>
            <li>More of a clean, flowery scent.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>the ingredients are easily visible on the label.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up easily and rinses out well.  </li>
            <li>I love how clean my hair feels.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers up great and love the extra shine added to my hair.</li>
            <li>I like a strong smelling shampoo like this one.  </li>
            <li>I like to change between shampoos fairly often, so when I was given this shampoo to test and review, I was pleasantly surprised to find how much I enjoyed this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essence Wild Naturals has a very nice fragrance, a light floral aroma.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, I could run my fingers through my hair and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Ideally, shampoo cleans the hair, and conditioner actually conditions it, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it would have been nice for my hair to feel a bit softer after use of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been testing this for over a week and have received many compliments on how my hair looks soft and smooth along with smelling really good.</li>
            <li>I love great smelling shampoo-not only does it make you feel clean</li>
            <li>The smell of seaberry and tropical fruits is mild, but yet refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I received the full collection of the Illuminating products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in the Herbal Essences VoxBox and I am beyond pleased that I was introduced to this refreshing cleanser.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product for someone that want a nice clean, crisp ending .</li>
            <li>I have always been a huge fan of Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell great and left my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>this shampoo smells lightly of flowers</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this shampoo through Influenster.</li>
            <li>I got this product free to test and review</li>
            <li>i received this collection for free to review &amp; i do not like it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t really linger after washing.</li>
            <li>They always have great fragrances, and this is no different.</li>
            <li>I received a free 100ml sample in my Voxbox</li>
            <li>: I received this product for free to review**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received these products for free from Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li>received this product free to test and review but the opinions are all mine.</li>
            <li>I received this shampoo as a free sample.</li>
            <li>most Clairol shampoo products, this will cleanse the hair as-good-or-better than lower priced shampoos, but the bottle is colorful.</li>
            <li>received the product free to test and review.</li>
            <li>and my hair stayed smooth all day.</li>
            <li>I received this free to test and review.</li>
            <li>But it smelled great back then.  </li>
            <li>, you get to continue to enjoy its scent the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>So, enjoy it in the shower (or wherever you scrub your crown).</li>
            <li>n&#x27;t I got this product free to test and review</li>
            <li>I got this product free to test and review.  </li>
            <li>I was given this product free to test and review.</li>
            <li>*received this for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li>I received this product free for purposes of testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li>Despite that, it did feel REALLY clean and really strong when all was said and</li>
            <li>I loved the shine my hair had, like a professional look.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and is reminiscent of berries (I think it smells like a hybrid of Strawberry and something that I can not quite identify).</li>
            <li>Would recommend for those on vacation and seeking a light and easily accessible product.</li>
            <li>Its fine for what it does, but its nothing special.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair clean, shiny and smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li>The Seaberry is a light scent, maybe a bit citrusy and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t a super amazing shampoo, but it is excellent for normal everyday use.</li>
            <li>This might be more evident in damaged hair or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has that perfect spring fruity scent to awaken your senses while using it and it lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I used a small amount of this product to wash my hair</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m familiar with the brand.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Seaberries</li>
            <li>, I just with it was a two in one shampoo and conditioner, so I could have a clean silky head of hair.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and left my hair shiny and clean.  </li>
            <li>So, I have clean hair</li>
            <li>It rinses out clean, almost too clean, a bit squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo (I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences on and off for years) is a shampoo that lathers up and washes out clean.  </li>
            <li>I also have Herbal Essences Tea-Lightfully Clean shampoo</li>
            <li>:) I liked the way the shampoo and conditioner left my hair smelling and feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am not convinced that this shampoo is anything special.</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that the shampoo is a clear liquid, almost made me feel clean already.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for gray hair that tends to be wiry and that is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this shampoo to test and review from Influenster, so full disclosure</li>
            <li>It smells sweet, lathers up in mountains, and thoroughly cleans your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>and it was nice and soft after washing.</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li>And I love that the smell is mot over powering but stays in your hair the whole day plus some.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice and soft fruity smell.</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this shampoo due to the wonderful scent alone but the shine that it gives your hair as well! :)</li>
            <li>and I was impressed that the label promised my hair would be shiny and vibrant and that it actually was very bouncy and shiny when I was done styling.</li>
            <li>It lathers up very well, and makes my hair feel very clean.</li>
            <li>I like best is that it not only leaves my hair feeling clean, but it makes my hair smell clean all day long.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like to do is apply it, lather, and rinse quickly, then repeat but with a longer lather time.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need fancy ingredients - this is perfect for everyday, non-color treated hair.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughters really like this shampoo, and their hair looks great after using it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need a lot of shampoo which I appreciate since I go through shampoo rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for more shine.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, my hair felt light not weighed down.</li>
            <li>and so it made me use more than I normally would because I associate lather with the product working.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time after receiving a free sample to test and review.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Wild Natural Illuminating Shampoo is a nice shampoo to bring more shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I will start first with saying it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It smells divine and filled my whole bathroom with an intoxicating floral scent!</li>
            <li>left my hair feeling clean and smelling amazing .</li>
            <li>I was please to find that it left my hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li>It is a good shampoo that left my long and thick hair feeling very nice and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited when I received this product to test.</li>
            <li>First off they smell heavenly!</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself felt heavy but it washed my hair good and rinsed away easy.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday shampoo that leaved your hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li>it brings me back to going peach picking in warmer weather and having a basket of peaches in the kitchen that made the house smell amazing.</li>
            <li>I felt like this shampoo was really fresh and hydrating,</li>
            <li>This was such a nice surprise to use.</li>
            <li>When their hydration shampoo and conditioner came out, I tried it with some success.</li>
            <li>So far I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>So far, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>It would be a good daily shampoo, but I would keep expectations reasonable.</li>
            <li>I received the product complimentary from influenster.</li>
            <li>It literally smells like fresh blueberries.  </li>
            <li>I received this complimentary product from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I received product complimentary to test and review.</li>
            <li>This shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to strip my hair of its natural oils like many shampoos do.</li>
            <li>i received the product(s) complimentary to test.</li>
            <li>Overall I really liked this product</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Using it in a hot shower doesn&#x27;t give you the full shine that you&#x27;d expect to get.</li>
            <li>To me, it smells like fresh peaches...</li>
            <li>than I usually would to get a good lather, but it rinses out easily.</li>
            <li>What I really liked was that it actually left my hair smelling good a day after washing it whereas other shampoos it goes away hours after.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use a large amount to get your hair to feel clean.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very clean and natural.</li>
            <li>My hair smelled really nice, but I used a blow dryer and flat iron, causing some of the fragrance to disappear.</li>
            <li>it couldn&#x27;t be my go to hair product but for occasional use it certainly smelled pleasant and gentle</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner left my hair much more silkier, smoother, and left a great natural like smell with it!</li>
            <li>After using this with the herbal essence wild naturals conditioner and oil spray, my hair felt very soft, smooth and healthy - it just glided through my hands.  </li>
            <li>The clean, fresh, citrus scent hit me immediately and my hair was left clean and shiny!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This works great with the Wild Naturals conditioner and dry oil spray.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with a film (which is a problem I&#x27;ve faced in the past).</li>
            <li>It lathered great with just a small amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands of shampoos and conditioners to make my hair feel not only soft but look healthy as well.</li>
            <li>But after the second time that I used it, it really grew on me and now I love the smell!</li>
            <li>If my hair was very dry and frizzy, I might need something stronger, but overall this is a very good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>but if you really apply it liberally and lather really well, you will feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li>When I used them plus the Dry Oil Spray, it made my hair look more greasy and oily than clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences has three lines of their Wild Naturals product, &amp;#34;Illuminating,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Detoxifying,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Rejuvenating.&amp;#34; The illuminating line is designed to make your hair shinier and has a strong fruity berry scent.</li>
            <li>in complimentary of influenster I was able to sample this with some similar products from this line .</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft with some volume and fairly manageable.</li>
            <li>Once my hair was dried it was definitely softer and looks great!</li>
            <li>I plan on making this my main shampoo!!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair, but it&#x27;s naturally curly.</li>
            <li>I tested this without conditioner and surprisingly, while my curls are not as tame as they can be, they&#x27;re definitely better that generally are when I skip conditioner.</li>
            <li>So, I am always excited when they come out with new lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dry oil spray doesn&#x27;t make my hair look super oily either which I love.</li>
            <li>It lathers perfectly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It washes out easily and while I&#x27;m uncertain as to whether my hair is actually shinier, it certainly feels clean.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, I gave up on Herbal Essences when I was in high school, possibly middle school.</li>
            <li>I really really love the smell of the entire Illuminating collection.</li>
            <li>(and when you have a big household, you know how many bottles can build up in the shower).</li>
            <li>but I do wish it was stronger, same scent just more intensity.</li>
            <li>one big allergen in my family is quarternium, which isn&#x27;t in here, so it seems I&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li>Although the scents are quite different, my hair is not confused and came out of the shampoo/conditioner process in great condition overall.</li>
            <li>First thought -</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for that shine this works very well!</li>
            <li>Recently I was able to try the Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo free through Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li>This is a shampoo I would consider repurchasing if only it smelled better.</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo as a free to test and review product.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair, it was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>If it had a better scent I would be more likely to buy these products on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I thought they made it up at first, so I googled it.</li>
            <li>I should warn you that the first two ingredients are water and Sodium Laureth Sulfate.</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo for free to test and review from influenster.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle is the scent.</li>
            <li>It smells really good in the bottle, while washing my hair, and even after I blew dried by hair.</li>
            <li>Nice lather even with the hard water in Florida, smells like flowers, and just like I expect from Herbal Essences the smell is pretty strong and lasts.</li>
            <li>brand works great for regular to dry hair.</li>
            <li>Plus it made my hair so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It may seem strong in the shower, but it&#x27;s far more mild after you&#x27;ve rinsed it out and dried your  hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I found it to be a bit too much.</li>
            <li>It smells very tropical and pretty.</li>
            <li>Smells good and made my hair shinier than usual.</li>
            <li>They all have the same fresh scent and they clean your hair and the conditioner makes it very manageable as well.</li>
            <li>I have long, curly, &amp; highlighted hair, &amp; I was surprised by how much I liked this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Finally, it was easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and shiny, but doesnt leave build-up like some shampoos.</li>
            <li>Would be more beneficial for me if I had dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has been dry throughout the winter but after just one use of this shampoo it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking again.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is perfect for those of you with OILY hair that becomes weighed down with products and requires washing everyday.</li>
            <li>and I did not need a large amount either.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t notice extreme shine improvement, I did see some shine and my hair felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair silky and very clean but with a strange smell.</li>
            <li>I have fine to medium blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I often switch up my shampoos, so I was excited to try this new Herbal Essence Wild Naturals shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference from the previous Herbal Essences shampoo that I was using before this arrived (one of the original &amp;#34;throwback&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It suds fast.</li>
            <li>for it adding shine to my hair, I can&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li>I like my shampoo to be sudsy (no matter how much Chaz Dean and Wen tell me it doesn&#x27;t need to do that).  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that it is not sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this shampoo and thinking about the conditioner now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product!</li>
            <li>I recently received this product free from Influenster to test out</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did much for my hair in terms of illuminating it.</li>
            <li>when used with the conditioner, the smell really lasts.</li>
            <li>I got this product with the conditioner and spray in a #VoxBox thanks to #influenster.</li>
            <li>Thanks @influenster</li>
            <li>I found the berry scent to be pleasing during my shower and will readily use this product again.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t come pouring out of the bottle too fast.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well</li>
            <li>My hair did not have as much body as a volumizing shampoo though.  </li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t work much on my hair</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend either product, nor condemn them.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy virgin Asian hair, fyi, and I received a trial of this shampoo free through Influenster in order to review.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It did work very well for my daughters hair</li>
            <li>Also didn&#x27;t tangle as much.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s best used with cold water .</li>
            <li>This is an illuminating shampoo and it make my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals product free to test, but this review is completely my thoughts.</li>
            <li>I have waist long hair and it was easy to distribute through out my hair without much effort.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did, with any new hair product I use, is to check and see how it smells.</li>
            <li>It washes away very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any unwanted residue behind.</li>
            <li>I have colored, long, fine and straight hair.</li>
            <li>A basic shampoo for cleaning, suds producing, and a fruity scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sold on the fact it will clean and protect my hair better than other brands.</li>
            <li>- you need very little to get good foaming and cleaning action.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smelling citrus-y, and with a deep clean.</li>
            <li>It did seem to clean my hair without actually stripping it which is a plus for someone with curly hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Both of these products do their basic job, clean and condition, but no one has called me a vixen despite the bottles claim it will bring this hitherto undiscovered personality trait out in me.</li>
            <li>I liked it, but did not love it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and is safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li>i notice that it did give my hair a healthy look but it weighted it down</li>
            <li>I received the Illuminating shampoo, conditioner and their dry oil spray for a free trial to test.</li>
            <li>also got the dry oil in the free kit as well</li>
            <li>The seeds are high in vitamin C with health benefits as yet been unproven by clinical research in humans.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Made my hair super light and fluffy and extraordinarily soft.</li>
            <li>It seems like I have to use just a little more</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair soft, unstripped, and clean.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, wild hair</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair clean and shiny, but not greasy, or dry.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the old Herbal Essences formula, frankly.  </li>
            <li>I really like how soft the shampoo made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but very citrusy.</li>
            <li>The lather was soft and it really did feel enriching</li>
            <li>Reminds me of growing up and using the powerful scent of Herbal Essences and every time I open the bottle of shampoo, I understand why the commercials were &amp;#34;yes..!</li>
            <li>Clairol&#x27;s \\&quot;refreshing seaberry essence\\&quot; logically comes from the fruit extract of Latin species name for common sea buckthorn listed 8th on the ingredients.</li>
            <li>These shampoos and their many varities have come along way since I was a kid in the 1970s and 80s, and Herbal Essence had just one fragrance and &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of shampoo the whole family used--and it was green!  </li>
            <li>It is a nice thick shampoo</li>
            <li>For my thick long curly hair conditioner is what is the most important.</li>
            <li>This shampoo didn&#x27;t require obnoxious amounts to clean my very thick hair &amp; rinsed out easily.  </li>
            <li>Now with this new line, I thought that I would give it another shot.</li>
            <li>you get when you use any new shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had to take several deep relaxing breaths to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how fragrant the shampoo is</li>
            <li>It made my hair very soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I am not sure this is safe for color treated hair</li>
            <li>so I am not sure I will be buying unless I am sure it is.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used Herbal Essences in years and was pleasantly surprised after washing my hair!</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells; it made me look forward to shampooing my hair (which is something I usually dread).</li>
            <li>I used this product 2 days in a row in conjunction with the Herbal Essences Illuminating Conditioner and my hair was so soft!</li>
            <li>It cleaned well, lathered up well, and left my hair, not only shiny and clean, but also very soft.</li>
            <li>However, it is a little strong.</li>
            <li>What I might do to combat that is to switch up and use this one a couple times a week, and the Tea-Lightfully Clean the other times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so shiny and smooth and isn&#x27;t tangled for the first time in at least 9 months.</li>
            <li>One thing that I did notice though, as I put the shampoo on to my hair, it wouldn&#x27;t lather or budge unless my hair was super wet</li>
            <li>and I usually have to use a great deal of product, but a small amount covered my hair and got down to my roots easily.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner leave my hair shiny but not oily, soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>It takes very little shampoo to make a rich lather that thoroughly cleans even the dirtiest of hair makes it very frugal for any budget.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re apparently high in fat, which might be why my hair looks like it&#x27;s been lightly conditioned and has shine that I don&#x27;t usually get from just a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main</li>
            <li>and made my hair soft and</li>
            <li>and I felt a bit energized after using it early in the morning.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;ll have to use my old conditioner.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve always bought their shampoos and conditioners and use them frequently.</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural and</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft after and</li>
            <li>I have to say that Herbal Essences Wild Naturals impresses me.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft too and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really say if the Cassia seeds actually do anything to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li>The product is for &amp;#34;unleashing your hair&#x27;s natural shine&amp;#34; and that is what it did.</li>
            <li>So far I do like it, except on a couple of occasions</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to scents, you may want to pass on</li>
            <li>We have the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my natural but somewhat chemically treated/colored hair</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection, complementary for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother if your hair is dry, or if you really believe the claims to &amp;#34;illuminate&amp;#34; both you and your hair!</li>
            <li>I received a trial of this shampoo, conditioner, and dry oil spray in my first #voxbox from #influenster.  </li>
            <li>particular one actually DID make my hair shinier.</li>
            <li>The product gave my hair shine, fullness, and left my strands looking particularly vibrant after use.</li>
            <li>and I can actually smell it on my hair all day long unlike most other shampoos.</li>
            <li>It seems to be the only thing that gives me the high shine I am looking for.</li>
            <li>With my long curly hair, I found that Herbal Essences didn&#x27;t give me as much de-tangling or hydration that I needed.</li>
            <li>It definitely did not dull it or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>and I have gotten several people commenting on my new &amp;#34;perfume.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The only complaint I had was the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as most shampoos</li>
            <li>My hair was definately shiny and very soft the next day.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>Once I got over the smell, I had no other problems with it.</li>
            <li>so it usually looks shiny, but when used with the conditioner and dry oil of the same line, it definitely left my hair smelling nice and looking shiny.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave my wet hair feeling dry like most other shampoos do.</li>
            <li>If I catch it on a good sale I might pick it up, but otherwise I would probably continue to use the less expensive brands I normally buy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it isn&#x27;t super appealing to me either.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I really did like it.</li>
            <li>But I inevitably went back to my old brand.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing this in the near future.</li>
            <li>The shampoo also lathers well and does not dry out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure the shine was a good thing for me, made my dark brown, curly hair look slightly oily</li>
            <li>The shampoo feels a little drying at first</li>
            <li>(my hair is usually pretty soft) and dryer than usual, even after my regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>For me, someone who is no longer 20, I found the product to be a little too sweet - inviting the attention of insects out here in the country, and it left my hair so dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more girly and flowery than what I usually like, but it&#x27;s not perfumey smelling.</li>
            <li>so I would definitely recommend using the two products and the dry oil all together to get soft and shiny hair!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice an &amp;#34;illuminating effects&amp;#34; but I suppose I didn&#x27;t expect much for a shampoo that is less than $5.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise by my 4th time using Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo, conditions and dry oil spray</li>
            <li>but there are other shampoos where I have had to wash 3 or 4, with this one just the normal 2.</li>
            <li>and I have them in my normal rotation along with 3-4 other brands.</li>
            <li>We have hard water here and getting a good lather is tough.</li>
            <li>(I have shoulder-length hair) and that seemed a little bit too much (made it a tad oily).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells great</li>
            <li> I think that Herbal Essences did a great job with the fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li> I also have some gray hairs that can be a bit fly away and the shampoo did not seem to help with taming those pesky hairs.</li>
            <li> It smells great.  </li>
            <li> this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo did a great job of cleansing my hair.</li>
            <li> However, it is a great shampoo and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing and cleansed my hair to perfection!</li>
            <li> The shine it applied to it is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> : Let me start with what I like with the product, I love the smell of the shampoo and conditioner smells great!</li>
            <li> What a pleasant shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> A pleasant scent, luxurious lather, easy rinsing are some of the things I like best about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It has a citrus smell not too strong but perfect.</li>
            <li> The lather is really good.</li>
            <li> I feel this acted close to how a cleansing rinse would act and loved the way the shower smelled while using it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good for all hair types which means that others in my household can use it</li>
            <li> I think that this is a side affect of the shampoo being for &amp;#34;all hair types.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s still a good product, it just doesn&#x27;t fill all of my needs.</li>
            <li> It smelled so good that I had strangers asking what it was.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but my hair still smelled good.</li>
            <li> The cassia seeds within are supposed to protect and strengthen hair, and I feel they do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still this is a good shampoo for those looking for sleek, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> the price range, it is a good shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo with a nice scent .</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from my VoxBox to test and review; I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out because the scent was wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I received compliments on how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li> Smelled good in the bottle but not so good on my hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a good every day shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> she loved the scent in the end</li>
            <li> it is a good product for a fair price.</li>
            <li> and like it was good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo and conditioner my hair smelled so good.</li>
            <li> It smells so, so amazingly good.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked gorgeous and shiny after drying and styling.</li>
            <li> This is a mild shampoo with a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> and of course I LOVE hair products that not only ave a wonderful scent, but that have a wonderful scent that LASTS!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and really lasts but doesn&#x27;t overpower!</li>
            <li> I love this trio!</li>
            <li> and that was my favorite product!</li>

            <li> After the first use, I thought I was jist impressed with that nice feeling</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and after rinsing it out I didn&#x27;t get that feeling</li>

            <li> This shampoo smells amazing</li>
            <li> It smells amazing</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I received this great product as a free test sample from Influenster.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> To me, I would describe this shampoo as with a nice smell, but not overly fragranced.  </li>
            <li> I loved the cute and tropical packaging, and look forward to using the rest of the Illuminating line.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up nicely and cleanses well.</li>
            <li> Used it top to toe and smells so good.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a citrusy note, kind of grapefruity.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice balance of moisture and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Now this could be a good thing if I were looking for more body to my hair</li>
            <li> This is a nice shampoo I will give to my daughter to use.</li>
            <li> but these are my own honest opinions.</li>
            <li> I liked this product alot.  </li>
            <li> But my review and opinions were completely my own, I will recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a nice scent in hair even after rinsing away.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a creamy texture and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle of shampoo in my shower was that it smelled AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo smells so incredible that washing my hair was the highlight of my day, honestly!  </li>
            <li> It is literally the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have around in a pinch, and my husband likes it just fine.  </li>
            <li> This is the same good shampoo as we&#x27;ve experienced and it has a good scent.</li>
            <li> So girly and nice, I love it.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent and did notice a bit more shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how soft and silky it had made my hair feel even before I had got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the quality and performance of these products.</li>
            <li> and this does exactly what it claims to do, all while smelling great.</li>
            <li> Its a bright and sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> And the first day using it was great.</li>
            <li> I noticed it has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> and I used it right away after smelling it because it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo - left my hair with an amazing shine!</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> I got this product in an Influenster box for free to review, and I have really enjoyed using this product!</li>
            <li> The smell is very refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li> I just received a free sample of the shampoo, conditioner, and oil in exchange for an honest review of the products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this shampoo, it smelt am amazing and made my hair so much shinier and softer.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, very fruity.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li> I really love the shine that it gives my hair</li>
            <li> seaberry scent is nice and light.</li>
            <li> Though I should note that I have healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I love Herbal Essence products.</li>
            <li> Most of them claim to do this or that, and I take it with a grain of salt, assuming it&#x27;s marketing.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this shampoo, however, is the smell.</li>
            <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel like its really cleaned and smells great as well.</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I was able to see that the shampoo and conditioner did make a difference in terms of the shine when I just used the shampoo and conditioner alone.</li>
            <li> This product was okay,</li>
            <li> love the scent (seaberry).</li>
            <li> Okay shampoo.</li>
            <li> also I could see it gave me a bit more shine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It has an interesting smell.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and for once my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw .</li>
            <li> What more can you ask from a shampoo?</li>
            <li> I would have been much better off with the detoxifying set.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the feel of my hair after the second day with this product.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> but with this shampoo it is so hydrating that I can use it more often.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair shiny smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love these fragrances.  </li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance has been the turkish fig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love love love the smell</li>
            <li> and I was beyond pleased with the &amp;#34;tropical experience&amp;#34; as well as the results.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I did notice more shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> Love how it lathers in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I was pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried many serums and sprays.</li>
            <li> I received this in my Influenster box to review and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> and I am still as in love with it as Day 1.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me for free to review by influenster!</li>
            <li> Scent lingered in my hair, which I love.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and healthy after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Then again, it does with most shampoos.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of it</li>
            <li> love the scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not at all overwhelming, which can sometimes happen in citrus scents.</li>
            <li> Not so with this shampoo, which made it really enjoyable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must first say that the scent of the shampoo was mild yet pleasant; it was very refreshing and more fruity than floral, which is just as I prefer.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a very clean scent to it.</li>
            <li> I loved the creamy consistency of the product and how it had a rich full lather.</li>
            <li> I got it as a complimentary product for testing purposes from influenster and adored it!!</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and rinses away quickly.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences shampoos always come with a strong lovely floral scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too fruity/floral/sweet, and the scent is so strong, especially in a hot shower.</li>
            <li> It lathered nicely, and my hair still had a nice shine and volume, despite two straight days in a fitted scrub cap for work.</li>
            <li> It lathers good and makes your hair feel fresh and clean instead of</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using it and the smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still in your teens or early twenties with oily hair, this product may be great for you.</li>
            <li> This one did just that with a great soft citrus/floral smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and made my hair soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li> I really loved the scent of this shampoo and felt it cleaned my hair very well</li>
            <li> but I still recommend it as an all-around good shampoo.</li>
            <li> but since I used it with the matching conditioner, which is really good as well, I don&#x27;t know how much shine was from the shampoo or the conditioner</li>
            <li> They were soft easy to detangle smelled great</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wildly potent, wildly good, and wildly illuminating according to the bottle!  </li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed using Herbal Essences and would recommend it for an economical shampoo!  </li>
            <li> More of a clean, flowery scent.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> the ingredients are easily visible on the label.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up easily and rinses out well.  </li>
            <li> I love how clean my hair feels.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers up great and love the extra shine added to my hair.</li>
            <li> I like a strong smelling shampoo like this one.  </li>
            <li> I like to change between shampoos fairly often, so when I was given this shampoo to test and review, I was pleasantly surprised to find how much I enjoyed this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essence Wild Naturals has a very nice fragrance, a light floral aroma.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, I could run my fingers through my hair and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Ideally, shampoo cleans the hair, and conditioner actually conditions it, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it would have been nice for my hair to feel a bit softer after use of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing this for over a week and have received many compliments on how my hair looks soft and smooth along with smelling really good.</li>
            <li> I love great smelling shampoo-not only does it make you feel clean</li>
            <li> The smell of seaberry and tropical fruits is mild, but yet refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I received the full collection of the Illuminating products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in the Herbal Essences VoxBox and I am beyond pleased that I was introduced to this refreshing cleanser.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product for someone that want a nice clean, crisp ending .</li>
            <li> I have always been a huge fan of Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell great and left my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> this shampoo smells lightly of flowers</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo through Influenster.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test and review</li>
            <li> i received this collection for free to review &amp; i do not like it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t really linger after washing.</li>
            <li> They always have great fragrances, and this is no different.</li>
            <li> I received a free 100ml sample in my Voxbox</li>

            <li> I received this shampoo as a free sample.</li>
            <li> most Clairol shampoo products, this will cleanse the hair as-good-or-better than lower priced shampoos, but the bottle is colorful.</li>

            <li> and my hair stayed smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I received this free to test and review.</li>
            <li> But it smelled great back then.  </li>
            <li> , you get to continue to enjoy its scent the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> So, enjoy it in the shower (or wherever you scrub your crown).</li>

            <li> I loved the shine my hair had, like a professional look.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and is reminiscent of berries (I think it smells like a hybrid of Strawberry and something that I can not quite identify).</li>
            <li> Would recommend for those on vacation and seeking a light and easily accessible product.</li>
            <li> Its fine for what it does, but its nothing special.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair clean, shiny and smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li> The Seaberry is a light scent, maybe a bit citrusy and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a super amazing shampoo, but it is excellent for normal everyday use.</li>
            <li> This might be more evident in damaged hair or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has that perfect spring fruity scent to awaken your senses while using it and it lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I used a small amount of this product to wash my hair</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m familiar with the brand.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Seaberries</li>
            <li> , I just with it was a two in one shampoo and conditioner, so I could have a clean silky head of hair.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and left my hair shiny and clean.  </li>
            <li> So, I have clean hair</li>
            <li> It rinses out clean, almost too clean, a bit squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo (I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences on and off for years) is a shampoo that lathers up and washes out clean.  </li>
            <li> I also have Herbal Essences Tea-Lightfully Clean shampoo</li>
            <li> :) I liked the way the shampoo and conditioner left my hair smelling and feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am not convinced that this shampoo is anything special.</li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that the shampoo is a clear liquid, almost made me feel clean already.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful for gray hair that tends to be wiry and that is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this shampoo to test and review from Influenster, so full disclosure</li>
            <li> It smells sweet, lathers up in mountains, and thoroughly cleans your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> and it was nice and soft after washing.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nice and soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li> And I love that the smell is mot over powering but stays in your hair the whole day plus some.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice and soft fruity smell.</li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shampoo due to the wonderful scent alone but the shine that it gives your hair as well! :)</li>
            <li> and I was impressed that the label promised my hair would be shiny and vibrant and that it actually was very bouncy and shiny when I was done styling.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very well, and makes my hair feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I like best is that it not only leaves my hair feeling clean, but it makes my hair smell clean all day long.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like to do is apply it, lather, and rinse quickly, then repeat but with a longer lather time.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need fancy ingredients - this is perfect for everyday, non-color treated hair.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughters really like this shampoo, and their hair looks great after using it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need a lot of shampoo which I appreciate since I go through shampoo rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for more shine.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, my hair felt light not weighed down.</li>
            <li> and so it made me use more than I normally would because I associate lather with the product working.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time after receiving a free sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Natural Illuminating Shampoo is a nice shampoo to bring more shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I will start first with saying it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> It smells divine and filled my whole bathroom with an intoxicating floral scent!</li>
            <li> left my hair feeling clean and smelling amazing .</li>
            <li> I was please to find that it left my hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li> It is a good shampoo that left my long and thick hair feeling very nice and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I received this product to test.</li>
            <li> First off they smell heavenly!</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself felt heavy but it washed my hair good and rinsed away easy.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday shampoo that leaved your hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li> it brings me back to going peach picking in warmer weather and having a basket of peaches in the kitchen that made the house smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I felt like this shampoo was really fresh and hydrating,</li>
            <li> This was such a nice surprise to use.</li>
            <li> When their hydration shampoo and conditioner came out, I tried it with some success.</li>
            <li> So far I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> So far, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> It would be a good daily shampoo, but I would keep expectations reasonable.</li>
            <li> I received the product complimentary from influenster.</li>
            <li> It literally smells like fresh blueberries.  </li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received product complimentary to test and review.</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to strip my hair of its natural oils like many shampoos do.</li>
            <li> i received the product(s) complimentary to test.</li>
            <li> Overall I really liked this product</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Using it in a hot shower doesn&#x27;t give you the full shine that you&#x27;d expect to get.</li>
            <li> To me, it smells like fresh peaches...</li>
            <li> than I usually would to get a good lather, but it rinses out easily.</li>
            <li> What I really liked was that it actually left my hair smelling good a day after washing it whereas other shampoos it goes away hours after.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use a large amount to get your hair to feel clean.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very clean and natural.</li>
            <li> My hair smelled really nice, but I used a blow dryer and flat iron, causing some of the fragrance to disappear.</li>
            <li> it couldn&#x27;t be my go to hair product but for occasional use it certainly smelled pleasant and gentle</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner left my hair much more silkier, smoother, and left a great natural like smell with it!</li>
            <li> After using this with the herbal essence wild naturals conditioner and oil spray, my hair felt very soft, smooth and healthy - it just glided through my hands.  </li>
            <li> The clean, fresh, citrus scent hit me immediately and my hair was left clean and shiny!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This works great with the Wild Naturals conditioner and dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with a film (which is a problem I&#x27;ve faced in the past).</li>
            <li> It lathered great with just a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of shampoos and conditioners to make my hair feel not only soft but look healthy as well.</li>
            <li> But after the second time that I used it, it really grew on me and now I love the smell!</li>
            <li> If my hair was very dry and frizzy, I might need something stronger, but overall this is a very good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> but if you really apply it liberally and lather really well, you will feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li> When I used them plus the Dry Oil Spray, it made my hair look more greasy and oily than clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences has three lines of their Wild Naturals product, &amp;#34;Illuminating,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Detoxifying,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Rejuvenating.&amp;#34; The illuminating line is designed to make your hair shinier and has a strong fruity berry scent.</li>
            <li> in complimentary of influenster I was able to sample this with some similar products from this line .</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft with some volume and fairly manageable.</li>
            <li> Once my hair was dried it was definitely softer and looks great!</li>
            <li> I plan on making this my main shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair, but it&#x27;s naturally curly.</li>
            <li> I tested this without conditioner and surprisingly, while my curls are not as tame as they can be, they&#x27;re definitely better that generally are when I skip conditioner.</li>
            <li> So, I am always excited when they come out with new lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dry oil spray doesn&#x27;t make my hair look super oily either which I love.</li>
            <li> It lathers perfectly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It washes out easily and while I&#x27;m uncertain as to whether my hair is actually shinier, it certainly feels clean.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, I gave up on Herbal Essences when I was in high school, possibly middle school.</li>
            <li> I really really love the smell of the entire Illuminating collection.</li>
            <li> (and when you have a big household, you know how many bottles can build up in the shower).</li>
            <li> but I do wish it was stronger, same scent just more intensity.</li>
            <li> one big allergen in my family is quarternium, which isn&#x27;t in here, so it seems I&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li> Although the scents are quite different, my hair is not confused and came out of the shampoo/conditioner process in great condition overall.</li>
            <li> First thought -</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for that shine this works very well!</li>
            <li> Recently I was able to try the Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo free through Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li> This is a shampoo I would consider repurchasing if only it smelled better.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo as a free to test and review product.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, it was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> If it had a better scent I would be more likely to buy these products on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I thought they made it up at first, so I googled it.</li>
            <li> I should warn you that the first two ingredients are water and Sodium Laureth Sulfate.</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo for free to test and review from influenster.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle is the scent.</li>
            <li> It smells really good in the bottle, while washing my hair, and even after I blew dried by hair.</li>
            <li> Nice lather even with the hard water in Florida, smells like flowers, and just like I expect from Herbal Essences the smell is pretty strong and lasts.</li>
            <li> brand works great for regular to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Plus it made my hair so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It may seem strong in the shower, but it&#x27;s far more mild after you&#x27;ve rinsed it out and dried your  hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I found it to be a bit too much.</li>
            <li> It smells very tropical and pretty.</li>
            <li> Smells good and made my hair shinier than usual.</li>
            <li> They all have the same fresh scent and they clean your hair and the conditioner makes it very manageable as well.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, &amp; highlighted hair, &amp; I was surprised by how much I liked this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Finally, it was easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and shiny, but doesnt leave build-up like some shampoos.</li>
            <li> Would be more beneficial for me if I had dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry throughout the winter but after just one use of this shampoo it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is perfect for those of you with OILY hair that becomes weighed down with products and requires washing everyday.</li>
            <li> and I did not need a large amount either.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t notice extreme shine improvement, I did see some shine and my hair felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair silky and very clean but with a strange smell.</li>
            <li> I have fine to medium blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I often switch up my shampoos, so I was excited to try this new Herbal Essence Wild Naturals shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference from the previous Herbal Essences shampoo that I was using before this arrived (one of the original &amp;#34;throwback&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It suds fast.</li>
            <li> for it adding shine to my hair, I can&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li> I like my shampoo to be sudsy (no matter how much Chaz Dean and Wen tell me it doesn&#x27;t need to do that).  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is not sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this shampoo and thinking about the conditioner now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product!</li>
            <li> I recently received this product free from Influenster to test out</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did much for my hair in terms of illuminating it.</li>
            <li> when used with the conditioner, the smell really lasts.</li>
            <li> I got this product with the conditioner and spray in a #VoxBox thanks to #influenster.</li>
            <li> Thanks @influenster</li>
            <li> I found the berry scent to be pleasing during my shower and will readily use this product again.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t come pouring out of the bottle too fast.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very well</li>
            <li> My hair did not have as much body as a volumizing shampoo though.  </li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t work much on my hair</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t recommend either product, nor condemn them.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy virgin Asian hair, fyi, and I received a trial of this shampoo free through Influenster in order to review.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It did work very well for my daughters hair</li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t tangle as much.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s best used with cold water .</li>
            <li> This is an illuminating shampoo and it make my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals product free to test, but this review is completely my thoughts.</li>
            <li> I have waist long hair and it was easy to distribute through out my hair without much effort.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did, with any new hair product I use, is to check and see how it smells.</li>
            <li> It washes away very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any unwanted residue behind.</li>
            <li> I have colored, long, fine and straight hair.</li>
            <li> A basic shampoo for cleaning, suds producing, and a fruity scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sold on the fact it will clean and protect my hair better than other brands.</li>
            <li> - you need very little to get good foaming and cleaning action.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smelling citrus-y, and with a deep clean.</li>
            <li> It did seem to clean my hair without actually stripping it which is a plus for someone with curly hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Both of these products do their basic job, clean and condition, but no one has called me a vixen despite the bottles claim it will bring this hitherto undiscovered personality trait out in me.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but did not love it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and is safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li> i notice that it did give my hair a healthy look but it weighted it down</li>
            <li> I received the Illuminating shampoo, conditioner and their dry oil spray for a free trial to test.</li>
            <li> also got the dry oil in the free kit as well</li>
            <li> The seeds are high in vitamin C with health benefits as yet been unproven by clinical research in humans.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Made my hair super light and fluffy and extraordinarily soft.</li>
            <li> It seems like I have to use just a little more</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair soft, unstripped, and clean.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, wild hair</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair clean and shiny, but not greasy, or dry.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the old Herbal Essences formula, frankly.  </li>
            <li> I really like how soft the shampoo made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but very citrusy.</li>
            <li> The lather was soft and it really did feel enriching</li>
            <li> Reminds me of growing up and using the powerful scent of Herbal Essences and every time I open the bottle of shampoo, I understand why the commercials were &amp;#34;yes..!</li>
            <li> Clairol&#x27;s \\&quot;refreshing seaberry essence\\&quot; logically comes from the fruit extract of Latin species name for common sea buckthorn listed 8th on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> These shampoos and their many varities have come along way since I was a kid in the 1970s and 80s, and Herbal Essence had just one fragrance and &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of shampoo the whole family used--and it was green!  </li>
            <li> It is a nice thick shampoo</li>
            <li> For my thick long curly hair conditioner is what is the most important.</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t require obnoxious amounts to clean my very thick hair &amp; rinsed out easily.  </li>
            <li> Now with this new line, I thought that I would give it another shot.</li>
            <li> you get when you use any new shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had to take several deep relaxing breaths to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how fragrant the shampoo is</li>
            <li> It made my hair very soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is safe for color treated hair</li>
            <li> so I am not sure I will be buying unless I am sure it is.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used Herbal Essences in years and was pleasantly surprised after washing my hair!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells; it made me look forward to shampooing my hair (which is something I usually dread).</li>
            <li> I used this product 2 days in a row in conjunction with the Herbal Essences Illuminating Conditioner and my hair was so soft!</li>
            <li> It cleaned well, lathered up well, and left my hair, not only shiny and clean, but also very soft.</li>
            <li> However, it is a little strong.</li>
            <li> What I might do to combat that is to switch up and use this one a couple times a week, and the Tea-Lightfully Clean the other times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so shiny and smooth and isn&#x27;t tangled for the first time in at least 9 months.</li>
            <li> One thing that I did notice though, as I put the shampoo on to my hair, it wouldn&#x27;t lather or budge unless my hair was super wet</li>
            <li> and I usually have to use a great deal of product, but a small amount covered my hair and got down to my roots easily.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner leave my hair shiny but not oily, soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> It takes very little shampoo to make a rich lather that thoroughly cleans even the dirtiest of hair makes it very frugal for any budget.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re apparently high in fat, which might be why my hair looks like it&#x27;s been lightly conditioned and has shine that I don&#x27;t usually get from just a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main</li>
            <li> and made my hair soft and</li>
            <li> and I felt a bit energized after using it early in the morning.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;ll have to use my old conditioner.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve always bought their shampoos and conditioners and use them frequently.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural and</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft after and</li>
            <li> I have to say that Herbal Essences Wild Naturals impresses me.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft too and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say if the Cassia seeds actually do anything to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li> The product is for &amp;#34;unleashing your hair&#x27;s natural shine&amp;#34; and that is what it did.</li>
            <li> So far I do like it, except on a couple of occasions</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to scents, you may want to pass on</li>
            <li> We have the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my natural but somewhat chemically treated/colored hair</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection, complementary for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother if your hair is dry, or if you really believe the claims to &amp;#34;illuminate&amp;#34; both you and your hair!</li>
            <li> I received a trial of this shampoo, conditioner, and dry oil spray in my first #voxbox from #influenster.  </li>
            <li> particular one actually DID make my hair shinier.</li>
            <li> The product gave my hair shine, fullness, and left my strands looking particularly vibrant after use.</li>
            <li> and I can actually smell it on my hair all day long unlike most other shampoos.</li>
            <li> It seems to be the only thing that gives me the high shine I am looking for.</li>
            <li> With my long curly hair, I found that Herbal Essences didn&#x27;t give me as much de-tangling or hydration that I needed.</li>
            <li> It definitely did not dull it or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten several people commenting on my new &amp;#34;perfume.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as most shampoos</li>
            <li> My hair was definately shiny and very soft the next day.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> Once I got over the smell, I had no other problems with it.</li>
            <li> so it usually looks shiny, but when used with the conditioner and dry oil of the same line, it definitely left my hair smelling nice and looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave my wet hair feeling dry like most other shampoos do.</li>
            <li> If I catch it on a good sale I might pick it up, but otherwise I would probably continue to use the less expensive brands I normally buy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it isn&#x27;t super appealing to me either.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I really did like it.</li>
            <li> But I inevitably went back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing this in the near future.</li>
            <li> The shampoo also lathers well and does not dry out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure the shine was a good thing for me, made my dark brown, curly hair look slightly oily</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels a little drying at first</li>
            <li> (my hair is usually pretty soft) and dryer than usual, even after my regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> For me, someone who is no longer 20, I found the product to be a little too sweet - inviting the attention of insects out here in the country, and it left my hair so dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more girly and flowery than what I usually like, but it&#x27;s not perfumey smelling.</li>
            <li> so I would definitely recommend using the two products and the dry oil all together to get soft and shiny hair!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice an &amp;#34;illuminating effects&amp;#34; but I suppose I didn&#x27;t expect much for a shampoo that is less than $5.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise by my 4th time using Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo, conditions and dry oil spray</li>
            <li> but there are other shampoos where I have had to wash 3 or 4, with this one just the normal 2.</li>
            <li> and I have them in my normal rotation along with 3-4 other brands.</li>
            <li> We have hard water here and getting a good lather is tough.</li>
            <li> (I have shoulder-length hair) and that seemed a little bit too much (made it a tad oily).  </li>
            <li> There is no noticeable difference in my hair for good or ill after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use other Herbal Essences products for styling my hair, and have used their different shampoos throughout the years, so I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Far thicker than other shampoos I use.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used this shampoo without any of the itchiness or rash that other shampoos can cause, so I do appreciate that.</li>
            <li> This may not bother other people as it does me since I tend to be fairly sensitive to fragrance and can get headaches from it, regardless of price point or type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> shampoo lathers REALLY well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and only wash it 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> the feeling had last all day long!  </li>
            <li> I usually only use shampoo once or twice a week because I have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> I used this with the conditioner and dry oil spray of the same line.</li>
            <li> I tried it last night on my hair along with the conditioner and dry oil spray</li>
            <li> Left it shiny and not too dry.</li>
            <li> I used the dry oil spray but didn&#x27;t notice a really big difference</li>
            <li> Especially the Illuminating Dry OIl Spray.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be repurchasing the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo for a few days before I had to stop and go back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used it as I would use a regular shampoo and noticed that my hair was left a little shinier than with usual shampoos, but other than that minor difference I wouldn&#x27;t say that anything else was particularly unique about it except, perhaps, the scent.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does contain sulfates that we are trying to not use as often but sulfate free hair products are expensive</li>
            <li> Just for kicks I tried to see how long I could go between washing&#x27;s and that is four days.</li>
            <li> (I guess that&#x27;s the Cassia seed oil, of which they claim every bottle contain 100 seeds...) and left it feeling rough</li>
            <li> I did not like how my hair gets no more shine than what it normally has</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would make my hair feel worse like other brands have.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is my new everyday shampoo!</li>
            <li> Definitely going to be buying a bottle of this as a gym bag/every day shampoo to give myself a break from my usual more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> The lather helps to get all your hair if you have long hair-another words it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you have to wash twice!  </li>
            <li> I will note that I have soft water, so it may act differently if you have hard water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the shampoo, conditioner and dry spray one time made a world of difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner and dry oil spray work well too.</li>
            <li> and it is shiny when it dries before I even enhance the shine with the matching dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> I tried it with the conditioner and the dry oil spray and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> I got this as sample along with the condition and dry oil spray from Influenster in a VoxBox on Tuesday to test and review.</li>
            <li> I will be buying the shampoo and conditioner but will not be buying the Dry Oil Spray in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it feels dry.</li>
            <li> I like that this shampoo didn&#x27;t dry out my hair</li>
            <li> I did follow up with the paired conditioner and the dry oil.</li>
            <li> I did allow my hair to air dry over night, but straightened  my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I used mine with the Illuminating Conditioner plus the Dry Oil Spray</li>
            <li> I imagine that you&#x27;re supposed to use the shampoo and conditioner from a single line, then follow it with the oil elixir, which I didn&#x27;t try.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that has lots of gray mixed.</li>
            <li> In fact, my personality traits seem oddly the same.</li>
            <li> she has natural curly thick long locks.</li>
            <li> It actually seemed to dull down my naturally shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> I get with some other shampoos where your hair feels really dry and just stripped of all hydration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear and quite thick shampoo</li>
            <li> Not really</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and noticed that my hair was smoother and had less frizzies.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if i didn&#x27;t use enough or if it doesn&#x27;t work how I expected.</li>
            <li> strawberry blond, long, and thick, and definitely on the dryer side, but I condition alongside washing every day.  </li>
            <li> It did seem to make my hair somewhat smoother and shinier, but other than that it didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> so we use this in addition to other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel stringy after shampooing like some shampoos do, it actually left my hair feeling slick.</li>
            <li> Does it make your hair shine anymore than any other shampoo?</li>
            <li> They are shrubs that are found in Europe and Asia in which the female shrubs product small orange berry-like fruit.</li>
            <li> : I have used it with the Illuminating conditioner and with other conditioners</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s awfully hard for blonde hair!</li>
            <li> The cassia plant has a common plant name that likely connects to thus product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m contemplating adding some essential oils to tone down the sweet, and a base oil like argan or shea butter oil to protect my scalp and porous hair.</li>
            <li> However now, it builds up.in my hair and makes it appear sort of weighed down.</li>
            <li> But however I will use the other two products and I recommend them to others!</li>
            <li> Usually the smell from the shampoo and conditioners aren’t noticeable after you blow dry your hair</li>
            <li> My hair is black</li>
            <li> It also smooths my hair slightly, and gives my hair slight volume, for reasons I can&#x27;t explain.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and thick and color treated.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy want to be curly dry hair after using the shampoo and conditioner and the oil spray</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> so I did a little research to find out what they are.  </li>
            <li> The smell was a little funky though.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo held up nicely to my very thick hair and I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I give this shampoo 4 stars because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and my head doesn&#x27;t itch.  </li>
            <li> In just a few days I already see and feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> and it also isn&#x27;t overly heavy.</li>
            <li> Its an everyday type shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip your hair to straw.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday this isn&#x27;t a problem for me</li>
            <li> Give me a bottle of that vintage green stuff any day over this.  </li>
            <li> If I want shine I use a serum on my dried hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been very coarse and dry from the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I would measure that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences products in the past</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and shine spray for the past week.</li>
            <li> Although no shinier than usual.</li>
            <li> maybe ill skip the spray next time</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit disappointed to find that it left my hair still feeling quite coarse.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every two days or so</li>
            <li> shampoo is thick.</li>
            <li> Winter is tough on hair and strong soaps are horrible.</li>
            <li> the smell is horrible the conditioner left my hair feeling relly dry &amp; brittle.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to lather up well, and feels very thick and luxurious in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I seriously recommend this!</li>
            <li> They are fruity, but not sweet smelling, so they don&#x27;t make me sick to my stomach.  </li>
            <li> But the condition that this stuff left my hair in was terrible.</li>
            <li> Now my hair smells like a weird fruit salad.  </li>
            <li> She went crazy for the scent when she opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair something horrible!  </li>
            <li> smells bad and it made my head itch</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this shampoo and would not recommend it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this shampoo smells lightly of flowers I didnt find the scent over powering. The lather is really good. and made my hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so did everything I want in a shampoo</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using it and the smell is fantastic.  I just got it so i need to see how it works over time.  Look for updates soon!</li>
            <li> I really really love the smell of the entire Illuminating collection. I just received a free sample of the shampoo, conditioner, and oil in exchange for an honest review of the products. I have to say the oil is heavenly, and the shampoo &amp; conditioner are really wonderful. The shampoo feels a little drying at first but if you really apply it liberally and lather really well, you will feel a huge difference. Another thing I like to do is apply it, lather, and rinse quickly, then repeat but with a longer lather time. It smells amazing and after rinsing it out I didn&#x27;t get that feeling I get with some other shampoos where your hair feels really dry and just stripped of all hydration. I felt like this shampoo was really fresh and hydrating, and of course I LOVE hair products that not only ave a wonderful scent, but that have a wonderful scent that LASTS! Definitely going to be buying a bottle of this as a gym bag/every day shampoo to give myself a break from my usual more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo through Influenster. My hair is very long and thick and color treated. I noticed it has a very light scent. It worked wonderfully. My hair has been very coarse and dry from the cold weather. Using the shampoo, conditioner and dry spray one time made a world of difference on my hair. It&#x27;s so shiny and smooth and isn&#x27;t tangled for the first time in at least 9 months. The only complaint I had was the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as most shampoos and so it made me use more than I normally would because I associate lather with the product working. But it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenter for reviewing. First of all, the smell is very nice. I have waist long hair and it was easy to distribute through out my hair without much effort. It suds fast. I did feel like cleansed my hair well. I have oily hair and sometimes it takes me several washes to finally get it cleaned in the shower. I always shampoo it twice but there are other shampoos where I have had to wash 3 or 4, with this one just the normal 2. What I really liked was that it actually left my hair smelling good a day after washing it whereas other shampoos it goes away hours after. I am not sure this is safe for color treated hair it didn&#x27;t say anything about that on the bottle I received so I am not sure I will be buying unless I am sure it is.  Other than that I really did like it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this shampoo, it smelt am amazing and made my hair so much shinier and softer. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for more shine.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test and review and I could not be happier. I felt like I was in a shampoo rut. This was such a nice surprise to use. The smell is great, very fruity. I like a strong smelling shampoo like this one.  After using this with the herbal essence wild naturals conditioner and oil spray, my hair felt very soft, smooth and healthy - it just glided through my hands.  I was worried about my hair looking too greasy with all the shine products, but it was not too shiny.  I loved the shine my hair had, like a professional look. I can not wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this shampoo to test and review from Influenster, so full disclosure I don&#x27;t usually use Herbal Essences. The shampoo works as well as you&#x27;d expect. Nice lather even with the hard water in Florida, smells like flowers, and just like I expect from Herbal Essences the smell is pretty strong and lasts. It&#x27;s a little more girly and flowery than what I usually like, but it&#x27;s not perfumey smelling. More of a clean, flowery scent.&lt;br /&gt;As for it adding shine to my hair, I can&#x27;t really say. My hair is black so it usually looks shiny, but when used with the conditioner and dry oil of the same line, it definitely left my hair smelling nice and looking shiny.</li>
            <li> i received this collection for free to review &amp; i do not like it. the smell is horrible the conditioner left my hair feeling relly dry &amp; brittle. the oil mist did nothing to hydrate my hair.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner leave my hair shiny but not oily, soft and manageable! The smell is wonderful and really lasts but doesn&#x27;t overpower! I seriously recommend this!</li>
            <li> Received this shampoo through Influenster.  Haven&#x27;t used Herbal Essences in years and was pleasantly surprised after washing my hair! I feel this acted close to how a cleansing rinse would act and loved the way the shower smelled while using it.  I like my shampoo to be sudsy (no matter how much Chaz Dean and Wen tell me it doesn&#x27;t need to do that).  This shampoo didn&#x27;t require obnoxious amounts to clean my very thick hair &amp; rinsed out easily.  My hair smelled really nice, but I used a blow dryer and flat iron, causing some of the fragrance to disappear. To me, I would describe this shampoo as with a nice smell, but not overly fragranced.  The shampoo made me happy ( I guess the smells?) and I felt a bit energized after using it early in the morning.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing and I can actually smell it on my hair all day long unlike most other shampoos. It did seem to make my hair somewhat smoother and shinier, but other than that it didn&#x27;t do anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample of this product to test and review.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me by Influenster to review and test.The Herbal Essence brand has always excelled in hydration and cleansing. I loved the cute and tropical packaging, and look forward to using the rest of the Illuminating line. This shampoo left my hair soft, unstripped, and clean. The only problem is that it is not sulfate free. Would recommend for those on vacation and seeking a light and easily accessible product. Left my hair smelling like a tropical breeze.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, I gave up on Herbal Essences when I was in high school, possibly middle school. With my long curly hair, I found that Herbal Essences didn&#x27;t give me as much de-tangling or hydration that I needed. When their hydration shampoo and conditioner came out, I tried it with some success. But I inevitably went back to my old brand. Now with this new line, I thought that I would give it another shot. Overall, I like it but I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the smell can be overpowering. At first I found it to be a bit too much. But after the second time that I used it, it really grew on me and now I love the smell! I really love the shine that it gives my hair and it&#x27;s good for all hair types which means that others in my household can use it (and when you have a big household, you know how many bottles can build up in the shower). My only issue with this shampoo is that it does nothing for the dryness of my hair. There is a conditioner pairing that I&#x27;m going to try to see if it helps with the dryness. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll have to use my old conditioner. I think that this is a side affect of the shampoo being for &amp;#34;all hair types.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s still a good product, it just doesn&#x27;t fill all of my needs.</li>
            <li> So far I love this shampoo. Three washing&#x27;s and I am still liking it. I usually wash my hair every other day. Just for kicks I tried to see how long I could go between washing&#x27;s and that is four days. The fragrance is yummy. The lather is perfect. We have hard water here and getting a good lather is tough. I&#x27;m really liking this shampoo and thinking about the conditioner now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essence products on and off for years. I have yet to run into one I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seaberry scent is nice and light. It smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t really linger after washing. The shampoo lathers up nicely and cleanses well. The Cassia seeds supposedly helps protect hair from damage and breakage. I am not sure how I would measure that. For now I&#x27;ll just say I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. The shampoo also advertises increased shine, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that either. Though I should note that I have healthy hair. This might be more evident in damaged hair or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a super amazing shampoo, but it is excellent for normal everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love Herbal Essence products. They always have great fragrances, and this is no different. It lathers up very well, and makes my hair feel very clean. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is for all types of hair, so when my daughter comes over and needs to take a shower, she uses it as well. She also likes the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best is that it not only leaves my hair feeling clean, but it makes my hair smell clean all day long. This is a shampoo I would use again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still in your teens or early twenties with oily hair, this product may be great for you. It smells sweet, lathers up in mountains, and thoroughly cleans your hair and scalp. For me, someone who is no longer 20, I found the product to be a little too sweet - inviting the attention of insects out here in the country, and it left my hair so dry I went racing for the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need mountains of lather, so I&#x27;m contemplating adding some essential oils to tone down the sweet, and a base oil like argan or shea butter oil to protect my scalp and porous hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I like Herbal Essences products. We&#x27;ve always bought their shampoos and conditioners and use them frequently. This is the same good shampoo as we&#x27;ve experienced and it has a good scent. This shampoo does contain sulfates that we are trying to not use as often but sulfate free hair products are expensive so we use this in addition to other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great with the Wild Naturals conditioner and dry oil spray. They all have the same fresh scent and they clean your hair and the conditioner makes it very manageable as well.</li>
            <li> This is that great smelling shampoo, like all the others in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular one actually DID make my hair shinier. Most of them claim to do this or that, and I take it with a grain of salt, assuming it&#x27;s marketing. But I used it WITH the conditioner. My hair did get shinier and silkier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And  it smells SO GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To pick the scent you like best you have to smell-test them in a store.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! While I didn&#x27;t notice extreme shine improvement, I did see some shine and my hair felt smooth and clean. The smell is fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li> I like to change between shampoos fairly often, so when I was given this shampoo to test and review, I was pleasantly surprised to find how much I enjoyed this shampoo. This is a great everyday shampoo that leaved your hair looking shiny. It is a thicker shampoo and it lathers and washes well. My favorite part of this shampoo, however, is the smell. This shampoo smells amazing and I have gotten several people commenting on my new &amp;#34;perfume.&amp;#34; I will definitely purchase this shampoo in the future.</li>
            <li> I received the Illuminating shampoo, conditioner and their dry oil spray for a free trial to test. I love this trio! The shampoo makes my hair feel like its really cleaned and smells great as well. The conditioner and dry oil spray work well too. I&#x27;ve been testing this for over a week and have received many compliments on how my hair looks soft and smooth along with smelling really good. I highly recommended this product!</li>
            <li> This made my hair smell like fruitttt!!!! So girly and nice, I love it. Plus it made my hair so soft and clean. This is great. THANJ YOU INFLUENSTER FOR THIS I LOVEE IT</li>
            <li> This shampoo is perfect for those of you with OILY hair that becomes weighed down with products and requires washing everyday. Unlike some reviewers, I have not found this shampoo to be drying on my scalp/ hair, even with daily use. The scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product free from Influenster to test out and it is great.  I like that it is natural and the ingredients are easily visible on the label.  It smells amazing and I enjoy using it on a daily basis.  I would definitely purchase this when I run out of my sample bottle.  I didn&#x27;t even know what sea berry was until I tried this product.  I give it five stars because it makes my hair smell great and it is shiny when it dries before I even enhance the shine with the matching dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> I received a free 100ml sample in my Voxbox and I used it right away after smelling it because it smells amazing! It has that perfect spring fruity scent to awaken your senses while using it and it lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I used a small amount of this product to wash my hair and I was impressed that the label promised my hair would be shiny and vibrant and that it actually was very bouncy and shiny when I was done styling. I would definitely recommend this shampoo due to the wonderful scent alone but the shine that it gives your hair as well! :)</li>
            <li> smells bad and it made my head itch</li>
            <li> I got this product in an Influenster box for free to review, and I have really enjoyed using this product! I use about a quarter sized amount, and lather it into my hair in the shower. It leaves my hair smelling citrus-y, and with a deep clean. It also smooths my hair slightly, and gives my hair slight volume, for reasons I can&#x27;t explain. I really like this product, I just with it was a two in one shampoo and conditioner, so I could have a clean silky head of hair. I also like this because it leaves your hair feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product to test from Influenster. So far, I am satisfied. I have very curly, wild hair and this does exactly what it claims to do, all while smelling great. I tried it with the conditioner and the dry oil spray and haven&#x27;t had any issues. I could see myself possibly buying this for my household in the future.</li>
            <li> **Disclaimer: I received this product for free to review**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle of shampoo in my shower was that it smelled AMAZING!! It was a great mixture of floral and fruity.  I also liked the fact that the shampoo is a clear liquid, almost made me feel clean already.  One thing that I did notice though, as I put the shampoo on to my hair, it wouldn&#x27;t lather or budge unless my hair was super wet otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t spread throughout my hair.  I give this shampoo 4 stars because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and my head doesn&#x27;t itch.  Reminds me of growing up and using the powerful scent of Herbal Essences and every time I open the bottle of shampoo, I understand why the commercials were &amp;#34;yes..! YES.. YES!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time after receiving a free sample to test and review. I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences products in the past so I&#x27;m familiar with the brand. The shampoo has a very clean scent to it. It reminds me of something that would be used at a hair salon. If you&#x27;re looking for something fruity, this is not the product for you. It&#x27;s very light and you don&#x27;t have to use a large amount to get your hair to feel clean. I am happy to report that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with a film (which is a problem I&#x27;ve faced in the past). I don&#x27;t think it did much for my hair in terms of illuminating it. It would be a good daily shampoo, but I would keep expectations reasonable.</li>
            <li> I got this as sample along with the condition and dry oil spray from Influenster in a VoxBox on Tuesday to test and review. In just a few days I already see and feel a difference in my hair. I would definitely buy this product in the future!  Great hair products!!!</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, &amp; highlighted hair, &amp; I was surprised by how much I liked this shampoo. I love the way it smells; it made me look forward to shampooing my hair (which is something I usually dread). I also like the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave my wet hair feeling dry like most other shampoos do. Finally, it was easy to rinse out. Because I have a lot of hair, it can sometimes take several minutes for me to get all the suds out, but not with this shampoo. It was lightweight &amp; didn&#x27;t fill my hair with sn unecessary amount of suds. Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend, &amp; I&#x27;ll purchase it in the future. I received these products for free from Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li> Smells good and made my hair shinier than usual. That&#x27;s awfully hard for blonde hair! My hair felt soft after and when used with the conditioner, the smell really lasts. I wish the conditioner was a bit heavier (for my sake) but the combo did work well. It smelled so good that I had strangers asking what it was.&lt;br /&gt;I also got the dry oil in the free kit as well and that was my favorite product! Used it top to toe and smells so good. If you get the shampoo/conditioner don&#x27;t miss out on it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and shine spray for the past week. The scent is great but I do wish it was stronger, same scent just more intensity. I have noticed a difference in my Hairs shine. I have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; non oily hair with highlights and it has been working well and manages well with these products! I received the product complimentary from influenster.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I received this product to test. The first thing I did, with any new hair product I use, is to check and see how it smells. It smells really good in the bottle, while washing my hair, and even after I blew dried by hair. Usually the smell from the shampoo and conditioners aren’t noticeable after you blow dry your hair but my hair still smelled good. I was able to see that the shampoo and conditioner did make a difference in terms of the shine when I just used the shampoo and conditioner alone. When I used them plus the Dry Oil Spray, it made my hair look more greasy and oily than clean and shiny. I will be buying the shampoo and conditioner but will not be buying the Dry Oil Spray in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free to test and review but the opinions are all mine.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo as a free sample. I like the way it smells and suds.</li>
            <li> I got this product with the conditioner and spray in a #VoxBox thanks to #influenster. This product was okay, great smell but it feels dry. Thanks @influenster</li>
            <li> I have to say that Herbal Essences Wild Naturals impresses me. I tested this without conditioner and surprisingly, while my curls are not as tame as they can be, they&#x27;re definitely better that generally are when I skip conditioner. The cassia seeds within are supposed to protect and strengthen hair, and I feel they do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is thick. Far thicker than other shampoos I use. It lathers nicely and rinses away quickly. I will note that I have soft water, so it may act differently if you have hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent (seaberry). It&#x27;s very reminiscent of a body oil I used to use that contained dewberry. There&#x27;s also a citrusy note, kind of grapefruity. It may seem strong in the shower, but it&#x27;s far more mild after you&#x27;ve rinsed it out and dried your  hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to look up seaberries as I&#x27;d never heard of them. They&#x27;re apparently high in fat, which might be why my hair looks like it&#x27;s been lightly conditioned and has shine that I don&#x27;t usually get from just a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with skin allergies or sensitivities, here are the key ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Sodium laureth sulfate&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl betaine&lt;br /&gt;Sodium lauryl sulfate&lt;br /&gt;Sodium chloride&lt;br /&gt;Sodium xylenesulfonate&lt;br /&gt;Cocamid MEA&lt;br /&gt;Hippophae rhamnoides fruit extract&lt;br /&gt;Citric acid&lt;br /&gt;Cassia hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Sodium citrate&lt;br /&gt;Sodium benzoate&lt;br /&gt;Disodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt;Methylchloroisothiazolinone&lt;br /&gt;Methylisothiazolinone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one big allergen in my family is quarternium, which isn&#x27;t in here, so it seems I&#x27;ll be okay. So far, I&#x27;ve used this shampoo without any of the itchiness or rash that other shampoos can cause, so I do appreciate that.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences has three lines of their Wild Naturals product, &amp;#34;Illuminating,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Detoxifying,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Rejuvenating.&amp;#34; The illuminating line is designed to make your hair shinier and has a strong fruity berry scent. The detoxifying line softens hair and has a lemon basil smell. Rejuvenating is meant to restore vitality to hair and has a turkish fig scent. I tried the Illuminating shampoo. It&#x27;s a clear and quite thick shampoo - you need very little to get good foaming and cleaning action. It washes out easily and while I&#x27;m uncertain as to whether my hair is actually shinier, it certainly feels clean. I imagine that you&#x27;re supposed to use the shampoo and conditioner from a single line, then follow it with the oil elixir, which I didn&#x27;t try. I actually followed the illuminating shampoo with the detoxifying conditioner. Although the scents are quite different, my hair is not confused and came out of the shampoo/conditioner process in great condition overall. You may wish to pick depending on the scent rather than on the branding line. I found the berry scent to be pleasing during my shower and will readily use this product again.</li>
            <li> A basic shampoo for cleaning, suds producing, and a fruity scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sold on the fact it will clean and protect my hair better than other brands. But it does cleanse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassia is basically cinnamon, an herb. I could smell no cinnamon scent in this shampoo. The cassia plant has a common plant name that likely connects to thus product. Clairol&#x27;s \\&quot;refreshing seaberry essence\\&quot; logically comes from the fruit extract of Latin species name for common sea buckthorn listed 8th on the ingredients. The seeds are high in vitamin C with health benefits as yet been unproven by clinical research in humans.&lt;br /&gt;Like most Clairol shampoo products, this will cleanse the hair as-good-or-better than lower priced shampoos, but the bottle is colorful.</li>
            <li> Okay shampoo. I liked the scent and did notice a bit more shine to my hair. Not sure the shine was a good thing for me, made my dark brown, curly hair look slightly oily and I don&#x27;t have oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that has lots of gray mixed. I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that would bring back the shine and bounce that I had years ago. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market.  This one did just that with a great soft citrus/floral smell. It lathered great with just a small amount. Wonderful for gray hair that tends to be wiry and that is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo for reviewing purposes through voxbox. I really loved the scent of this shampoo and felt it cleaned my hair very well and it was nice and soft after washing. Although no shinier than usual. It is a good shampoo that left my long and thick hair feeling very nice and smelling great.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked well for my curly hair. I tend to have to change shampoos often and this is definitely the type I would go for. My hair didn&#x27;t feel stringy after shampooing like some shampoos do, it actually left my hair feeling slick.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to test from the Influenster website. This product is an awesome product! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference between my regular product I use and this. I will be using this from now on! The shampoo and conditioner left my hair much more silkier, smoother, and left a great natural like smell with it! I did try the spray also I could see it gave me a bit more shine but it&#x27;s ok. But however I will use the other two products and I recommend them to others! I will be buying this product in the future! It has changed my outlook on herbal essences!</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo to test from Influenster. The first thing I noticed when I used this shampoo is how great it smells! It smells very tropical and pretty. I like that this shampoo didn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it also isn&#x27;t overly heavy. It gives a nice balance of moisture and cleans well. I didn&#x27;t notice an illuminating effect but I still recommend it as an all-around good shampoo. 4/5 stars</li>
            <li> It has an interesting smell. I now know what Seaberry is. Its an everyday type shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip your hair to straw. Does it make your hair shine anymore than any other shampoo? Not really but it does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and for once my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw . Winter is tough on hair and strong soaps are horrible.</li>
            <li> This is a mild shampoo with a very pleasant scent. It lathers up easily and rinses out well.  My hair feels nice and soft after I use it.  What more can you ask from a shampoo? You don&#x27;t really need fancy ingredients - this is perfect for everyday, non-color treated hair. If my hair was very dry and frizzy, I might need something stronger, but overall this is a very good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wildly potent, wildly good, and wildly illuminating according to the bottle!  It is a nice thick shampoo so it doesn&#x27;t come pouring out of the bottle too fast.  It has a pleasant scent and left my hair shiny and clean.  I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Seaberries so I did a little research to find out what they are.  So, I have clean hair and I learned something.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essence Wild Naturals has a very nice fragrance, a light floral aroma.  It lathers very well and I did not need a large amount either. I blow dry my hair and noticed that my hair was smoother and had less frizzies. My hair was soft too and shiny. I have sensitive skin and I did not have any reactions to this shampoo  My hair did not have as much body as a volumizing shampoo though.  Still this is a good shampoo for those looking for sleek, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences shampoos always come with a strong lovely floral scent. This one is no exception. It has a hint of sweetness. complimented with a tropical fruity scent. Maybe that&#x27;s the seaberry as the label says. The shampoo also lathers well and does not dry out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really say if the Cassia seeds actually do anything to strengthen hair. Plus, it&#x27;s in shampoo and it gets rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price range, it is a good shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Natural Illuminating Shampoo is a nice shampoo to bring more shine to your hair.  A pleasant scent, luxurious lather, easy rinsing are some of the things I like best about this shampoo.  It takes very little shampoo to make a rich lather that thoroughly cleans even the dirtiest of hair makes it very frugal for any budget.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for testing purposes from Influenster. I must first say that the scent of the shampoo was mild yet pleasant; it was very refreshing and more fruity than floral, which is just as I prefer. I used it as I would use a regular shampoo and noticed that my hair was left a little shinier than with usual shampoos, but other than that minor difference I wouldn&#x27;t say that anything else was particularly unique about it except, perhaps, the scent. This shampoo held up nicely to my very thick hair and I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals product free to test, but this review is completely my thoughts. First thought - I love the smell of these products! I have a lot of fine hair, but it&#x27;s naturally curly. The product is for &amp;#34;unleashing your hair&#x27;s natural shine&amp;#34; and that is what it did. I don&#x27;t think it gave a lot of body but if you&#x27;re looking for that shine this works very well! Plus it smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> I recieved the Illuminating shampoo for testing and review.  First off, the scent is wonderful! It literally smells like fresh blueberries.  Its a bright and sweet smell.  The shampoo seems to lather up well, and feels very thick and luxurious in my hair.  It rinses out clean, almost too clean, a bit squeaky clean.  I feel like I need to deeply condition after using it.  Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday this isn&#x27;t a problem for me but it may be for someone that must wash their hair daily.  I did follow up with the paired conditioner and the dry oil. My hair was definately shiny and very soft the next day.  I did allow my hair to air dry over night, but straightened  my hair in the morning.  I had no problems with straightening it and my hair stayed smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample set. With the conditioner and the shine spray. I will start first with saying it smells fantastic. And the first day using it was great. However now, it builds up.in my hair and makes it appear sort of weighed down. I would have been much better off with the detoxifying set. But I thank Influenster for giving me the opportunity to test this out. I have fine to medium blonde hair. If that helps any.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The smell of seaberry and tropical fruits is mild, but yet refreshing.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; hair products.  I have long hair and only wash it 3 times a week.  I was very impressed with the feel of my hair after the second day with this product.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product from Influenster. This shampoo smells amazing and cleansed my hair to perfection!</li>
            <li> Smells great but it strips my hair of everything. Every time I use it I feel like I have to do a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me this as a tester and it was wonderful! Made my hair super light and fluffy and extraordinarily soft. In. Love.</li>
            <li> For Shampoo I believe anything can work! For my thick long curly hair conditioner is what is the most important. I like the smell of this. I received product complimentary to test and review. Although it didn&#x27;t work much on my hair my mother loved it! She although has shorter thinner hair than I. I guess I will be purchasing this in the future for her.</li>
            <li> I usually only use shampoo once or twice a week because I have extremely dry hair but with this shampoo it is so hydrating that I can use it more often. I love how it makes my hair shiny smooth and silky! It is literally the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so far! And I love that the smell is mot over powering but stays in your hair the whole day plus some. I definitely recommend you give this a try!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Herbal Essences brand of shampoo and conditioner.  Recently I was able to try the Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo free through Influenster to test and review. I was very impressed with how soft and silky it had made my hair feel even before I had got out of the shower.  The scent is pleasant, my hair felt light not weighed down. My hair was silky and shiny the feeling had last all day long!  I plan on making this my main shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I think that Herbal Essences did a great job with the fragrance of this product. But the condition that this stuff left my hair in was terrible. I had to deep condition several time to fix the damage caused by using this line of products from Influenster. I cannot recommend and will not even finish the product sent to me. Will never purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this free to test and review. I only shampoo my hair once a week, so when I tested this, my hair needed washed. It cleaned well, lathered up well, and left my hair, not only shiny and clean, but also very soft. This is a shampoo I would consider repurchasing if only it smelled better. The smell just isn&#x27;t my cup of tea. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It leaves your hair clean, shiny and smelling fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and is safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  It lathers perfectly and a little goes a long way.  I love how clean my hair feels.</li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite shampoo! I love these fragrances.  They are fruity, but not sweet smelling, so they don&#x27;t make me sick to my stomach.  My favorite fragrance has been the turkish fig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand works great for regular to dry hair. It leaves your hair clean and shiny, but not greasy, or dry.  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I often switch up my shampoos, so I was excited to try this new Herbal Essence Wild Naturals shampoo.  These shampoos and their many varities have come along way since I was a kid in the 1970s and 80s, and Herbal Essence had just one fragrance and &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of shampoo the whole family used--and it was green!  But it smelled great back then.  I have mixed feelings about the &amp;#34;seaberry&amp;#34; fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it isn&#x27;t super appealing to me either.  I have untreated hair: strawberry blond, long, and thick, and definitely on the dryer side, but I condition alongside washing every day.  I found this shampoo both coated my hair (I guess that&#x27;s the Cassia seed oil, of which they claim every bottle contain 100 seeds...) and left it feeling rough (my hair is usually pretty soft) and dryer than usual, even after my regular conditioner.  I also felt this coating did anything but make my hair shinier.  It actually seemed to dull down my naturally shiny hair.  I much prefer the old Herbal Essences formula, frankly.  Give me a bottle of that vintage green stuff any day over this.  It&#x27;s good to have around in a pinch, and my husband likes it just fine.  Don&#x27;t bother if your hair is dry, or if you really believe the claims to &amp;#34;illuminate&amp;#34; both you and your hair!</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with the same conditioner. I liked it, but did not love it. I have colored, long, fine and straight hair. I also have some gray hairs that can be a bit fly away and the shampoo did not seem to help with taming those pesky hairs. Now this could be a good thing if I were looking for more body to my hair (but I am not because those pesky gray hairs give it all the body it needs). As for the shine part...I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference. It definitely did not dull it or make it look greasy. If I want shine I use a serum on my dried hair. It seems to be the only thing that gives me the high shine I am looking for. This is a nice shampoo I will give to my daughter to use. She went crazy for the scent when she opened the bottle. It seems to be a very good product for its price point.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent!  I love great smelling shampoo-not only does it make you feel clean, you get to continue to enjoy its scent the rest of the day.  The Seaberry is a light scent, maybe a bit citrusy and clean smelling.  The shampoo (I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences on and off for years) is a shampoo that lathers up and washes out clean.  The lather helps to get all your hair if you have long hair-another words it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you have to wash twice!  I didn&#x27;t notice an &amp;#34;illuminating effects&amp;#34; but I suppose I didn&#x27;t expect much for a shampoo that is less than $5.  I have always enjoyed using Herbal Essences and would recommend it for an economical shampoo!  And...you can&#x27;t beat the scent!</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo for a few days before I had to stop and go back to my old shampoo. It dried out my hair something horrible!  I use other Herbal Essences products for styling my hair, and have used their different shampoos throughout the years, so I was surprised. I didn&#x27;t care for the scent either. I was very disappointed in this shampoo and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo with a nice scent . left my hair feeling clean and smelling amazing . in complimentary of influenster I was able to sample this with some similar products from this line . I will recommend this product for someone that want a nice clean, crisp ending .</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this shampoo a lot! It did seem to clean my hair without actually stripping it which is a plus for someone with curly hair like mine. I love love love the smell and it did help with the shine but since I used it with the matching conditioner, which is really good as well, I don&#x27;t know how much shine was from the shampoo or the conditioner so I would definitely recommend using the two products and the dry oil all together to get soft and shiny hair! I got this product to review but these are my own honest opinions.</li>
            <li> I also have Herbal Essences Tea-Lightfully Clean shampoo so I was looking forward to trying this one. So far I do like it, except on a couple of occasions my hair seemed rather &amp;#34;flat,&amp;#34; as if the cassia just coated my hair and took all the body out of it, instead of making it shiny. What I might do to combat that is to switch up and use this one a couple times a week, and the Tea-Lightfully Clean the other times. My teenage daughters really like this shampoo, and their hair looks great after using it. It smells amazing, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Got the Herbal Essences Seaberry Shampoo and the Turkish Fig Conditioner to test from Vine. Now my hair smells like a weird fruit salad.  Both of these products do their basic job, clean and condition, but no one has called me a vixen despite the bottles claim it will bring this hitherto undiscovered personality trait out in me. In fact, my personality traits seem oddly the same. I really can&#x27;t recommend either product, nor condemn them.  If your father smelt of Elderberrys and you WANT to smell of Seaberrys to be different, dive in.  But this is not that green Herbal Essence of the days of yore that really had a punch to it. So, enjoy it in the shower (or wherever you scrub your crown). Its fine for what it does, but its nothing special.</li>
            <li> Just got this and absolutely loved it!!! I got it as a complimentary product for testing purposes from influenster and adored it!! Great on your hair!!!</li>
            <li> While I like the smell of the shampoo, I can&#x27;t say that it is anything exceptional to justify switching from less expensive brands. There is no noticeable difference in my hair for good or ill after using it for a few weeks. If I catch it on a good sale I might pick it up, but otherwise I would probably continue to use the less expensive brands I normally buy.</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo smells so incredible that washing my hair was the highlight of my day, honestly!  I was very surprised at how fragrant the shampoo is, it smells delightfully tropical; the fragrance made me feel as though I was truly pampering myself. I loved the creamy consistency of the product and how it had a rich full lather. The product gave my hair shine, fullness, and left my strands looking particularly vibrant after use. I received the full collection of the Illuminating products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in the Herbal Essences VoxBox and I am beyond pleased that I was introduced to this refreshing cleanser. I used mine with the Illuminating Conditioner plus the Dry Oil Spray and I was beyond pleased with the &amp;#34;tropical experience&amp;#34; as well as the results. :)</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from my VoxBox to test and review; I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out because the scent was wonderful!  I only had to use just about the size of a quarter (I have shoulder-length hair) and that seemed a little bit too much (made it a tad oily).  I did notice more shine to my hair. I will use it again!</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo as a free to test and review product. I would recommend this shampoo. It washes away very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any unwanted residue behind. The smell is very refreshing and clean. My hair feels very clean and natural.</li>
            <li> I really like how soft the shampoo made my hair feel. The shine it applied to it is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> What a pleasant shampoo to use. It lathered nicely, and my hair still had a nice shine and volume, despite two straight days in a fitted scrub cap for work. I used this with the conditioner and dry oil spray of the same line. My biggest point of contention and the deal breaker for why I&#x27;d probably never buy this product in the future: The scent. It&#x27;s too fruity/floral/sweet, and the scent is so strong, especially in a hot shower. This may not bother other people as it does me since I tend to be fairly sensitive to fragrance and can get headaches from it, regardless of price point or type of fragrance. It&#x27;s just not my thing. I have wavy virgin Asian hair, fyi, and I received a trial of this shampoo free through Influenster in order to review. I have not let this influence my opinion.</li>
            <li> Pros : Let me start with what I like with the product, I love the smell of the shampoo and conditioner smells great! Love how it lathers in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;Cons : i do not like the after feel, I don&#x27;t like how i feel like my hair is going to fall out, it gets a leathery feeling to it. I did not like how my hair gets no more shine than what it normally has and if anything gets no shine at all. Overall I would not purchase this product. And I didn&#x27;t I got this product free to test and review and I have done just that.</li>
            <li> I was selected to test and review this product. This shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to strip my hair of its natural oils like many shampoos do. After washing my hair, it was soft and smooth. The fragrance also smells great!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to try it out.  It smells great.  Not too over powering.  It seems like I have to use just a little more than I usually would to get a good lather, but it rinses out easily. My hair is shinier, softer and smells great!</li>
            <li> I liked this product alot.  It made my hair very soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test and review.  I was pleased with it.  It left my hair very soft.  I used it along with the conditioner and spray.  The smell was a little funky though.  If it had a better scent I would be more likely to buy these products on a regular basis.  Once I got over the smell, I had no other problems with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick coarse hair. I&#x27;ve tried many brands of shampoos and conditioners to make my hair feel not only soft but look healthy as well. I&#x27;ve also tried many serums and sprays. I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would make my hair feel worse like other brands have. To my surprise by my 4th time using Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo, conditions and dry oil spray my hair felt great! My hair is soft, I could run my fingers through my hair and it smells amazing! The dry oil spray doesn&#x27;t make my hair look super oily either which I love. I will definitely be purchasing this in the near future. I was given this product free to test and review. But my review and opinions were completely my own, I will recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is my new everyday shampoo! After the first use, I thought I was jist impressed with that nice feeling you get when you use any new shampoo. But it is like &amp;#34;new shampoo&amp;#34; every time I use it. My hair is super soft and shiny, but doesnt leave build-up like some shampoos. I received this in my Influenster box to review and will be ordering more. I have used it for a week now and I am still as in love with it as Day 1. I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! I tried it last night on my hair along with the conditioner and dry oil spray and I could already tell a difference today! My hair was softer AND shinier. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice and soft fruity smell. It lathers good and makes your hair feel fresh and clean instead of feeling like it&#x27;s still greasy. Would be more beneficial for me if I had dry hair. Thank you Influenster for sending me this product conplimentary to test.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me for free to review by influenster! The best thing about this shampoo is the scent! It smells divine and filled my whole bathroom with an intoxicating floral scent! It smells good enough to eat! I used this product 2 days in a row in conjunction with the Herbal Essences Illuminating Conditioner and my hair was so soft! The delicious smell made waking up and showering so much nicer! I received compliments on how good my hair smells. I was also told my hair looked shinier! This is a great product to try!</li>
            <li> Scent lingered in my hair, which I love. Left it shiny and not too dry. Could be softer though.</li>
            <li> Smelled good in the bottle but not so good on my hair. It did leave my hair silky and very clean but with a strange smell.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this shampoo!  The clean, fresh, citrus scent hit me immediately and my hair was left clean and shiny!  I also used the conditioner for the finishing touch!</li>
            <li> I have always been a huge fan of Herbal Essences. Their shampoos and conditioners work well for me and I have them in my normal rotation along with 3-4 other brands. So, I am always excited when they come out with new lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, what is a Seaberry? I thought they made it up at first, so I googled it. Seaberry is also known as Hippophae, Sea-buckthorn, Sandthorn and Sallowthorn. They are shrubs that are found in Europe and Asia in which the female shrubs product small orange berry-like fruit. That is the &amp;#34;Seaberry&amp;#34; that is pictured on the front of the bottle and where the scent originates from. The scent is very nice and is reminiscent of berries (I think it smells like a hybrid of Strawberry and something that I can not quite identify). However, it is a little strong. If you are sensitive to scents, you may want to pass on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo did a great job of cleansing my hair. I should warn you that the first two ingredients are water and Sodium Laureth Sulfate. I don&#x27;t mind since my hair is not colored, but some people might. My hair looks shiny and healthy after using this shampoo. Then again, it does with most shampoos. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference from the previous Herbal Essences shampoo that I was using before this arrived (one of the original &amp;#34;throwback&amp;#34; products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am not convinced that this shampoo is anything special. However, it is a great shampoo and I will buy it again. I would recommend it as a good every day shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have used it with the Illuminating conditioner and with other conditioners and I do like it best with the Illuminating conditioner to compliment it.</li>
            <li> We have the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I have used it on my natural but somewhat chemically treated/colored hair it couldn&#x27;t be my go to hair product but for occasional use it certainly smelled pleasant and gentle I had to take several deep relaxing breaths to enjoy it. It left my hair soft with some volume and fairly manageable. It did work very well for my daughters hair she has natural curly thick long locks. They were soft easy to detangle smelled great she loved the scent in the end it is a good product for a fair price.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy want to be curly dry hair after using the shampoo and conditioner and the oil spray i notice that it did give my hair a healthy look but it weighted it down maybe ill skip the spray next time i love the smell of it i received the product(s) complimentary to test.</li>
            <li> I received a trial of this shampoo, conditioner, and dry oil spray in my first #voxbox from #influenster.  First off they smell heavenly! :) I liked the way the shampoo and conditioner left my hair smelling and feeling. I used the dry oil spray but didn&#x27;t notice a really big difference so I&#x27;m not sure if i didn&#x27;t use enough or if it doesn&#x27;t work how I expected. Overall I really liked this product and I would absolutely continue to use it!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and made my hair soft and smoothe. Also didn&#x27;t tangle as much.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo - left my hair with an amazing shine! Also, smells terrific. I fi d that it&#x27;s best used with cold water . Using it in a hot shower doesn&#x27;t give you the full shine that you&#x27;d expect to get. Definitely need to use the conditioner as well! *received this for free for testing purposes*</li>
            <li> **I received this product free for purposes of testing and reviewing. All opinions are my own.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent of this shampoo. It&#x27;s soft, but very citrusy. Not at all overwhelming, which can sometimes happen in citrus scents. Not so with this shampoo, which made it really enjoyable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo lathers REALLY well and a little goes a long way. I have long, thick hair and I usually have to use a great deal of product, but a small amount covered my hair and got down to my roots easily. The lather was soft and it really did feel enriching and like it was good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed to find that it left my hair still feeling quite coarse. Ideally, shampoo cleans the hair, and conditioner actually conditions it, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it would have been nice for my hair to feel a bit softer after use of this shampoo. Despite that, it did feel REALLY clean and really strong when all was said and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the scent and lathering effect alone, I would buy this and keep it on hand on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included a photo of my hair lathered with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I received this great product as a free test sample from Influenster. I was please to find that it left my hair nice and clean. It also leaves a nice scent in hair even after rinsing away. I would buy this!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Shampoo for free to test and review from influenster. The shampoo itself felt heavy but it washed my hair good and rinsed away easy. After using the shampoo and conditioner my hair smelled so good. It has a citrus smell not too strong but perfect. When my hair was damped it already felt softer and lighter. Once my hair was dried it was definitely softer and looks great! This is a product for me and will buy it and recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> The sent of this line is great! This shampoo lathers up great and love the extra shine added to my hair.</li>
            <li> I recently had a chance to try this shampoo and I&#x27;m glad I did! The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle is the scent. It smells so, so amazingly good.  The bottle says it contains seaberry, which I&#x27;ve never heard of before. To me, it smells like fresh peaches...it brings me back to going peach picking in warmer weather and having a basket of peaches in the kitchen that made the house smell amazing. This is an illuminating shampoo and it make my hair very shiny. My hair has been dry throughout the winter but after just one use of this shampoo it&#x27;s shiny and healthy looking again. The shampoo is a creamy texture and lathers nicely. I have long and thick hair and I don&#x27;t need a lot of shampoo which I appreciate since I go through shampoo rather quickly. I usually wash my hair every two days or so and this keeps my hair shiny until the next wash.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection, complementary for reviewing purposes. I am a hairstylist, and am used to using high-end products. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the quality and performance of these products. Especially the Illuminating Dry OIl Spray. It is amazing. Perfect texture and amount of shine. I will definitely be repurchasing the dry oil spray. The shampoo and conditioner smell great and left my hair feeling silky and smooth. My hair looked gorgeous and shiny after drying and styling. Great job with this collection Herbal Essences! Thank You Influenster, so sending me these products to try!</li>
