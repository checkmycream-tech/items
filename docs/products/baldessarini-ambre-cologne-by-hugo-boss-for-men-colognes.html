            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I asked my friend about a great men perfume, and suggested that I should try Ambre.   </li>
            <li>but rather some kind of wonderful amber.</li>

            <li>Great price.</li>

            <li>He loved it and so did I.   Recommend it.</li>

            <li>Hey, ya know, this stuff does make one an &amp;#34;Ambre.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>If U Want A Smell Good</li>

            <li>but I would suggest if you were to go on a date or some kind of meeting - this will surely impress.</li>
            <li>And Old Spice just isn&#x27;t for everyone, despite the awesome commercials (it might work for you, and my grandpa pulled it off, but he could never sport Ambra).&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents when I comes to warm spices.</li>
            <li>Wow, it&#x27;s an excellent fragance for a man that looks something deep and impressive...</li>
            <li>love the smell...  </li>
            <li>It ok.</li>
            <li>you may like it more than I do.</li>
            <li>More people should know about this cologne.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, it is deep, sexy and seductive.</li>
            <li>undoubtedly the best smell, especially during winter.   </li>

            <li>undoubtedly the best smell, especially during winter.</li>
            <li>I love to spray it even when he isn&#x27;t around.  </li>
            <li>Most people I know have never heard of it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Most of this applies to the gals, too.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne to date.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne on my husband.</li>
            <li>Shattering glass was immediately followed by the spread of most intoxicating scent</li>
            <li>So glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it in amazon</li>
            <li>I just bought this cologne and honestly it is perhaps one of the greatest scents that has yet to be discovered by other men.</li>
            <li>Feels better when the weather is a bit cool.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I would kill for my Baldessarini Ambre.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed a delicious mystery unfolds from this impossibly gorgeous and murderously heavy bottle that encases one of the most entrancing, superiorly masculine fragrances I have come across.</li>
            <li>Someone From The Oppisite Sex Will Say \\&quot;Damn U Smell Fine,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavy to wear during daytime but perfect for wearing at night.</li>
            <li>use it mainly for the relaxation night smoke a nice fat stoogie watching a nutflix etc.  </li>
            <li>in a rich vanilla and leather with just a hint of violet.</li>
            <li>This is nothing like what it&#x27;s like when I wear it and it acclimates to my skin: it has a clean scent incorporating almond, driftwood, and champagne.</li>
            <li>Got as a birthday present and while it is very nice, it isn&#x27;t exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t nail it that day, note what worked best, try again with different scents a different day.</li>
            <li>Most guys have never even heard of it and it has a very masculine smell</li>
            <li>Like the reviewer before me, I am very sensitive to most colognes.</li>
            <li>That is exactly what you smell like hosing on the AXE!</li>
            <li>The scent is more on the fruity side but somehow masculine and goooood!</li>
            <li>This cologne not only smells amazing but does not give me headaches.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite scent on a man.</li>
            <li>It is by far our favorite mens cologne.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell,,, but it doesn&#x27;t last for longer than 1 hour....</li>
            <li>As such, it is an excellent perfume with a very deep and masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I found one in a store I loved the smell of, and it was half the price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this amazing long lasting smell!</li>
            <li>but at least if you go too far with it, in time your okay!!!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I constantly get compliments and have been enjoying purchasing it for a number of years.</li>
            <li>Product Description: Baldessarini Ambre Cologne by Hugo Boss, Built around a whisky accord and complemented by top notes of mandarin and red apple, leading to a heart of violet, offset by a leather accord.</li>
            <li>Created by hugo boss.&lt;br /&gt;Built around a whisky accord and complemented by top notes of mandarin and red apple, leading to a heart of violet, offset by a leather accord .</li>
            <li>Go to the maniacs who just want to sell cologne and perfume (those maniacs still pop up in department stores, though more likely to find them in specialty</li>
            <li>It is not merely brown, nor is it tea color</li>
            <li>you hose it on, you make other people not want to breathe no mater how nice the scent.</li>
            <li>I really like wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li>Work and pairs really well with cigars and whiskies or tequila.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works very well with my skin chemistry and isn&#x27;t beyond my means.</li>
            <li>And, in a world of &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34; I would recommend to anyone who wants to &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; their way up some ladder.  </li>
            <li>Then, just as suddenly as it was hurled into darkness the train exploded from the tunnel and the in the glaring light</li>
            <li>the show really begins when you put this glorious fragrance onto your skin.</li>
            <li>It is really threatening my signature scent Chanel Pour Monsieur with murder.</li>
            <li>I tend to be pretty sensitive to certain perfumes and colognes.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t extremely impress but it was ok.</li>
            <li>saying Ambre with my spanish accent sounds so cool.</li>
            <li>If used in cool weather, Ambre tends to last somewhere around 6-8 hours.  </li>
            <li>It Also Stays On Much Longer Than Normal Toilettes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The balance in the overall scent of this fragrance can be easily upset, and aspects of the fragrance can be detected, but without the sum of its parts it can at times smell of a bit too much of its compositional products such as hormone, or alcohol.  </li>
            <li>The bottle on the other hand is absolutely masculine, beautiful and heavy.</li>
            <li>Although I suppose if more men smelled like this I&#x27;d be in trouble</li>
            <li>only found out later that the approach here was looking for notes of fine cigars, scotch, etc.</li>
            <li>I say it so it sounds exactly like the word we use in Spanish for \\&quot;man\\&quot; which is \\&quot;hombre.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>When it got here it didn&#x27;t smell exactly how I remember, and the smell only lasted 2-3 hours.  </li>
            <li>Please be aware that the right scent on you does the same thing that the smell of barbeque does to us, but to other people, and not to eat us but to want to hang around us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when I wear Ambre I always get asked \\&quot;Wow.</li>
            <li>The tobacco overtone is immediately followed by a whiskey sweetening, and finally cools to a gentle amber.  </li>
            <li>My fiance ordered another bottle of this cologne, after his old one broke in his suitcase.</li>
            <li>Women almost certainly will recognize other well known brands such as Obsession, Cool Water, and Calvin Klein, which are used by so many men that I think even women probably get tired of the smells..</li>
            <li>it is not a super strong smell that stays all day, thats good and bad...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a nice cologne</li>
            <li>Hugo Boss in general made me smell like Irish Spring, but the Baldessarini approach works</li>
            <li>In other words if feels like the chemical composition of this scent falls apart when diluted by various forms of moisture leaving you with a feeling that the scent may be just a little cheap at times.  </li>
            <li>To keep this review short and simple - It projects quite well, only a few sprays in the right spots is needed.  </li>
            <li>Overall, in dry conditions this scent adds a refreshingly masculine quality to the wearer and all those in the wearer&#x27;s presence.</li>

            <li> My husband loves this perfume</li>
            <li> wife likes it, good price and showed up fast n in perfect condition... it is not a super strong smell that stays all day, thats good and bad... but at least if you go too far with it, in time your okay!!! love the smell...  man like, not like a girl...</li>
            <li> This perfume is something between BOSS No. 6 and Baldessarini by Hugo Boss. As such, it is an excellent perfume with a very deep and masculine scent. It&#x27;s a bit heavy to wear during daytime but perfect for wearing at night. Feels better when the weather is a bit cool. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just bought this cologne and honestly it is perhaps one of the greatest scents that has yet to be discovered by other men. Most guys have never even heard of it and it has a very masculine smell and you really only need one spray to last you for any event. I recommend putting it on during business hours and nights out in the city. I promise you will get compliments from the ladies. Women almost certainly will recognize other well known brands such as Obsession, Cool Water, and Calvin Klein, which are used by so many men that I think even women probably get tired of the smells..but when I wear Ambre I always get asked \\&quot;Wow. What is that you got on?\\&quot; And saying Ambre with my spanish accent sounds so cool. I say it so it sounds exactly like the word we use in Spanish for \\&quot;man\\&quot; which is \\&quot;hombre.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is unclear what the size of the bottle is.  The description says something different than the title</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and was just what I ordered. Very pleased and will reorder again and again.</li>
            <li> Just for my husband, he really liked it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved it and so did I.   Recommend it.</li>
            <li> It ok. Wasn&#x27;t extremely impress but it was ok. I tried it because of how ppl raved about it. Try it sometime you may like it more than I do.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent on a man. Period. Finding this cologne in a department store or at Sephora/Ulta is impossible. If they&#x27;re not sold out they don&#x27;t carry it all. Although I suppose if more men smelled like this I&#x27;d be in trouble ;)</li>
            <li> This scent is a fragrance designed for the distinguished gentleman.  Its for the man who is uninhibited when it comes to exhibiting his masculinity.  The tobacco overtone is immediately followed by a whiskey sweetening, and finally cools to a gentle amber.  But...  There are rules to wearing this fragrance in my opinion.  I feel that this is not necessarily a good active fragrance.  This fragrance does not mix well with oils, perspiration, and other forms of moisture that come in contact with the affected areas of fragrance on the skin.  The balance in the overall scent of this fragrance can be easily upset, and aspects of the fragrance can be detected, but without the sum of its parts it can at times smell of a bit too much of its compositional products such as hormone, or alcohol.  In other words if feels like the chemical composition of this scent falls apart when diluted by various forms of moisture leaving you with a feeling that the scent may be just a little cheap at times.  Overall, in dry conditions this scent adds a refreshingly masculine quality to the wearer and all those in the wearer&#x27;s presence.</li>
            <li> I really like wearing this cologne. I constantly get compliments and have been enjoying purchasing it for a number of years.</li>
            <li> Product Description: Baldessarini Ambre Cologne by Hugo Boss, Built around a whisky accord and complemented by top notes of mandarin and red apple, leading to a heart of violet, offset by a leather accord. With a base that blends notes of amber, oakwood, vanilla and labdanum.    To keep this review short and simple - It projects quite well, only a few sprays in the right spots is needed.  If used in cool weather, Ambre tends to last somewhere around 6-8 hours.  This is a rather mature cologne to use, can be for casual purposes but I would suggest if you were to go on a date or some kind of meeting - this will surely impress.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing!  Work and pairs really well with cigars and whiskies or tequila.&lt;br /&gt;I use it mainly for the relaxation night smoke a nice fat stoogie watching a nutflix etc.  Created by hugo boss.&lt;br /&gt;Built around a whisky accord and complemented by top notes of mandarin and red apple, leading to a heart of violet, offset by a leather accord . With a base that blends notes of amber, oakwood, vanilla and labdanum.</li>
            <li> More people should know about this cologne. Like the reviewer before me, I am very sensitive to most colognes. I get headaches from almost all scents, even the lighter ones. This cologne not only smells amazing but does not give me headaches. Buy it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I found one in a store I loved the smell of, and it was half the price on Amazon.  When it got here it didn&#x27;t smell exactly how I remember, and the smell only lasted 2-3 hours.  The sampler I tried in the store lasted all day.  I will be bringing my bottle in to the store and comparing it to the sampler and see if these is any difference or if it&#x27;s in my mind.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, it is deep, sexy and seductive. Price is good too. My only qualm is with the longevity, since this is an eau de toilette, it does not last long, typically 2-3 hours before its completely gone.</li>
            <li> undoubtedly the best smell, especially during winter.   undoubtedly the best smell, especially during winter.  undoubtedly the best smell, especially during winter.</li>
            <li> My fiance ordered another bottle of this cologne, after his old one broke in his suitcase. IÂ´m glad he bought it again, it smells so sexy on him!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband in 2007 for Fathers Day.  It is by far our favorite mens cologne.  I love to spray it even when he isn&#x27;t around.  I tend to be pretty sensitive to certain perfumes and colognes.  Many of them make me a little sick.  I think this cologne just hasn&#x27;t had a lot of publicity.  Most people I know have never heard of it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got this cologne for my bf because I loved it... He loves it and I actually want to buy a bottle for myself! Love it.</li>
            <li> It delivered what it promised.</li>
            <li> It took a long time for me to find what worked for me. This works very well with my skin chemistry and isn&#x27;t beyond my means. Hugo Boss in general made me smell like Irish Spring, but the Baldessarini approach works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only found out later that the approach here was looking for notes of fine cigars, scotch, etc. This is nothing like what it&#x27;s like when I wear it and it acclimates to my skin: it has a clean scent incorporating almond, driftwood, and champagne. Weird, but it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any &amp;#34;bro&amp;#34; who doesn&#x27;t know about choosing a scent, read on: my review is finished but you need help. Most of this applies to the gals, too. Anyone else, you know what you like, go about your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All guys who have never really thought about this before!! Please be aware that the right scent on you does the same thing that the smell of barbeque does to us, but to other people, and not to eat us but to want to hang around us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But chemistry is weird with smell, and scents smell different on your skin than they would on mine. The wrong scent makes you smell like an old lady, in the worst way possible: bad perfume with cat pee and muscle cream. That is exactly what you smell like hosing on the AXE! And Old Spice just isn&#x27;t for everyone, despite the awesome commercials (it might work for you, and my grandpa pulled it off, but he could never sport Ambra).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please, never solely go by a written review of any scent. That&#x27;s only a place to get started!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If it&#x27;s advertised, you should be cautious. If it&#x27;s advertised on TV, you should be suspicious. If it&#x27;s AXE, run away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stay away from department store counters who aggressively try to sell, you&#x27;ll smell like pee and disinfectant. Go to the maniacs who just want to sell cologne and perfume (those maniacs still pop up in department stores, though more likely to find them in specialty stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you hose it on, you make other people not want to breathe no mater how nice the scent. Their bodies stop them from inhaling, like in the presence of chlorine gas. It does not cover up working/body odor/smoking/drinking etc, just adds to the funk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Visit a place who will let you sample drops on blotter strips and who provide a palate-cleanser (a shaker of roasted coffee beans for you to smell between sniffs is popular).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Take your time: Choose two of your favorites from the blotters, and then daub a drop each, one on each wrist. Go about your business, occasionally raising a wrist in front of your nose (give each plenty of time before a sniff to cleanse your sinuses, and don&#x27;t snort it). If you don&#x27;t nail it that day, note what worked best, try again with different scents a different day. If it takes 4 visits, have a single-elimination tournament of your 4 favorites, one bracket a day, and buy one already (or admit temporary failure and give the person at the store a frikkin break for a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It takes two to tango. The scent from the cologne, it changes into the scent off your skin, which changes to the scent that happens in someone else&#x27;s nose. If the person (or people) you care about smells something in that cologne that&#x27;s awesome when *you* wear it...  if it&#x27;s not your favorite but doesn&#x27;t make you sick, suck it up, take one for the team.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne to date. I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of Hugo Boss fragrances, especially from Baldessarini. This is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne on my husband. Shipping was slower than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne !!!</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I asked my friend about a great men perfume, and suggested that I should try Ambre.   I liked the smell,,, but it doesn&#x27;t last for longer than 1 hour....</li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s an excellent fragance for a man that looks something deep and impressive... I liked a lot and it became into one of my favs...</li>
            <li> Hey, ya know, this stuff does make one an &amp;#34;Ambre.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s good.  It lasts.  And, in a world of &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34; I would recommend to anyone who wants to &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; their way up some ladder.  Or ...whatever.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The murder weapon Madame et Monsieur was..... a bottle of Ambre!\\&quot; Hercule Poirot thrust the sparkling heavy bottle of the oriental woody perfume at the horribly assembled group in the dining salon. At that precise moment the Orient Express lurched violently as it entered a tunnel and plunged the car and all within into a sudden inky darkness. A woman&#x27;s scream was devoured by the shriek of the train whistle. Shattering glass was immediately followed by the spread of most intoxicating scent any of them had ever smelled. \\&quot;MY AMBRE!!\\&quot; a man&#x27;s voice cried out. Then, just as suddenly as it was hurled into darkness the train exploded from the tunnel and the in the glaring light Prince Nicolai Poliakoff was discovered choking Hercule Poirot. \\&quot;I would kill for my Baldessarini Ambre.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed a delicious mystery unfolds from this impossibly gorgeous and murderously heavy bottle that encases one of the most entrancing, superiorly masculine fragrances I have come across. The bottle is a work of art that is surpassed by the color of the juice. It is not merely brown, nor is it tea color but rather some kind of wonderful amber. As if the best chocolatier in Paris came up with the perfect clear chocolate brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the show really begins when you put this glorious fragrance onto your skin. A wonderful warm whiskey soaked apple embraces you in pure intoxication. This in turn is&lt;br /&gt;encased in a rich vanilla and leather with just a hint of violet. As that fades into a long&lt;br /&gt;lingering and lush dry down up comes the labdanum, amber and oak. It all finally fades out&lt;br /&gt;on my skin at about 9 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could bathe in this scent, it is just that rich, wonderful, sensual and intoxicating. It is really threatening my signature scent Chanel Pour Monsieur with murder. Baldessarini might just win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Five Plus Platinum Stars ****</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling colognes.</li>
            <li> Guys...If U Want A Smell Good That Everytime U Wear It Someone From The Oppisite Sex Will Say \\&quot;Damn U Smell Fine,What Is That\\&quot; Then Buy This One. It Also Stays On Much Longer Than Normal Toilettes.</li>
            <li> Absoluetly love this cologne! So glad I can still get it. Every time I put it on, it reminds me of the good things in my life!</li>
            <li> The scent is more on the fruity side but somehow masculine and goooood! Dad loved it! It was boxed in Germany. Great packaging though, double boxed then placed in another shipping box so no chance of it breaking on the way. Could not find this in the stores in Los Angeles area not even in the giant department stores, checked every one of them and had to order online.</li>
            <li> My man smells scrumptious!!! Great price. Beats all those perfume websites I was buying from.</li>
            <li> great product at a great price</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents when I comes to warm spices. It is a Nordstrom exclusive from what I remember. Glad I found it in amazon</li>
            <li> Got as a birthday present and while it is very nice, it isn&#x27;t exactly as described.  While the amber is obvious, the tobacco isn&#x27;t and it is a little subdued.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a nice cologne and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about a week now and I do like it...it just isn&#x27;t as complex of a cologne as it is described.  The bottle on the other hand is absolutely masculine, beautiful and heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this amazing long lasting smell! Great purchase!</li>
