    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works Great!</li>
            <li>This deodorants is awesome</li>
            <li>best there is, keeps me from being stinky, doesn&#x27;t stain</li>
            <li>This one works the best for me.</li>
            <li>Excellent protection.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant.</li>
            <li>win win win!</li>
            <li>So Im happy.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>It works great and stops perspiration.</li>
            <li>but this is my own opinion!</li>
            <li>Works great and smells good too</li>
            <li>I am happy that amazon carries this at a good price with the subscribe and save discount.  </li>
            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand through bzzagent and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good deodorant without scent.</li>
            <li>I had the chance to sample this free through buzz agent but I am so happy I did!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, but it&#x27;s definitely lightly scented, not unscented.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is so popular that I never received my order.</li>
            <li>I smelled nice (well, as nice as no-shower and campfire smell can be) and never saw a bear.</li>
            <li>Although it did its job, when applied this deodorant has a very strong fragrance of baby powder and something else.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best and is what my daughter will be using.</li>
            <li>In any case, my husband found this in my cabinet and started using it (fortunately his own container!) and doesn&#x27;t want any of the men&#x27;s antiperspirants because he says this works better than anything he has found for men.</li>
            <li>Very good deoderant, and I really like the opeining on the top.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this off Amazon solely based on the fact that they were offering an awesome deal.</li>
            <li>It does not leave white on clothing and works great!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and was thrilled that it was available on Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
            <li>I love that its unscented.</li>
            <li>Surprise, NO scent!  :)</li>
            <li>Sweat tends to make perfumed deodorant scent too strong and most times not pleasing.</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to be able to order it online with a decent price.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth with a very light scent that is just right.</li>
            <li>And I believe you could put it on and sweat for 48 hours and still be stinch free.</li>
            <li>it keeps me sweat and odor free</li>
            <li>It did apply smoothly and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but has zero odor control.</li>
            <li>This product is NOT Fragrance Free.  </li>
            <li>My husband didn&#x27;t believe me until he read the ingredients and we confirmed the presence of fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit like light fabric softener.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but received a free sample from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>This has done the trick to calm my nervous!</li>
            <li>Keeps you smelling fresh!  </li>
            <li>I really love Secret and this Outlast Unscented Invisible was awesome.</li>
            <li>daughter loved this and at a low cost</li>
            <li>This is also a good price here on Amazon compared to the prices at the local stores.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant, it works very well and keeps you from smelling like sweat.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how effective it is without using scents.  </li>
            <li>part of it, because I am not exactly active, but it&#x27;s otherwise effective.</li>
            <li>I now have a new favorite.</li>
            <li>And last but not least, the applicator is great.</li>
            <li>i dont recall how much it cost but its better than some higher priced ones i have tried.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent and just seemed to smell more as the day went on rather than actually helping deodorize or provide anti-persperant.</li>
            <li>Works fine as a deodorant/antiperspirant, same as most.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite clear antiperspirant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This Secret antiperspirant/deodorant is one of the best deodorants I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am a true critic when it comes to things holding up to their advertisement-and this deodorant absolutely stands true to what it claims.</li>
            <li>I received this product from Secret to test and was very happy I was chosen.</li>
            <li>But regardless, I have used it before and am very happy with Secret</li>
            <li>And I love having the unscented version for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So it was a success.</li>
            <li>I feel if I forgot to put it on on a busy morning, I would be ok from yesterday&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li>Simply the best deodorant for active women.</li>
            <li>Amazon really needs to add a &amp;#34;no stars&amp;#34; feature, because this product doesn&#x27;t deserve even one star!</li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t move away from me covering their noses on a hot crowded metro - so it must work just as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant I love to use</li>
            <li>I wish Mitchum would bring back their original formula!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always easy to find an invisible solid, that is also unscented in the stores.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>Strong enough for a woman.</li>
            <li>This is not always easy to find in local stores, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It held up to a very sweaty day and there was no sign of odor, almost like I didn&#x27;t even need to shower.</li>
            <li>For me, it controls odor and perspiration much longer than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>They said &amp;#34;it lasts throughout the whole day.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I absolutely could not be happier.  </li>
            <li>I have never understood why someone wants to smell like a deoderant (isn&#x27;t that what perfumes/colognes are for?).  </li>
            <li>I also really like the protection.</li>
            <li>This keeps you dry w/o strong perfume.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries very fast unlike other gel deodorants I have tried.</li>
            <li>I actually switched from another good -and more expensive brand -  because I had to raise the product so high to avoid being scraped that it broke off during application.</li>
            <li>I like that it goes on smooth and dry, not at all sticky like gels.</li>
            <li>It is oval and the plastic top is curved inward slightly, ensuring that the edges don&#x27;t scrape the skin.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, the solid bar, and the way it keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Secret used to be a good brand, what the heck happened?</li>
            <li>I have sensitive pits and this stuff does not irritate!</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant I trust to keep me smelling fantastic all day long!</li>
            <li>This Secret Outlast Invisible Solid in great as it leave no white marks on my clothes</li>
            <li>Wanted this to work, as it is &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and am sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to chemicals or fragrances</li>
            <li>This has replaced my old deodorant.</li>
            <li>I work with the public, as a customer service representative, so I am very fussy about what I use.</li>
            <li>There is no scent to collide with my perfume, and I really don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks.</li>
            <li>I have a basket full of half used deodorants in my quest to find something to take care of sweat and odor.  </li>
            <li>, I smell fresh, I have a new sense of confidence in tight quarters or while rushing around completing the days&#x27; tasks.</li>
            <li>It used to be this huge blob of deoderant and now it comes out of a smaller hole so there is not so much waste.</li>
            <li>this stuff really does keep you dry.  </li>
            <li>As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li>I love tough workouts, but I don&#x27;t like to have to worry about sweat stains, wetness or odor.</li>
            <li>Although I think I still prefer an invisible solid antiperspirant, I do like this clear gel.</li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive sense of smell and this is the only product I have found that is truly unscented.</li>
            <li>Love Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li>Only minor complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t go up and down very easily.</li>

            <li> I have a really sensitive sense of smell and this is the only product I have found that is truly unscented.</li>
            <li> Love Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> Only minor complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t go up and down very easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much useless to me since I don&#x27;t have much of a sweating problem.</li>
            <li> No clumps and long lasting coverage for the entire day.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I prefer the dry feeling of the invisible solid.</li>
            <li> It was super frustrating to not make it through a morning at work without sweat and odor starting to creep up.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and is usually priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> It only feels wet for a couple of seconds during application.and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> I wear dark clothes a lot and usually save putting my shirt on until I&#x27;m ready for work, and not having to worry about, or wipe off, white deo marks saves me time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Secret Outlast, especially if you suffer from &amp;#34;Deo White Mark&amp;#34; anxiety.</li>
            <li> It is also the ONLY deodorant, other than prescription, that can hold off my over-reactive sweating.</li>
            <li> The antiperserant did keep me dry</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret for many years now, and this Secret Outlast in a solid unscented stick does the job for me.</li>
            <li> I do not have any white flaky mess when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> It finally dawned on me that all of the heavily perfumed deodorants could be the culprit.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping but ended up throwing it away and buying a scented Secret.</li>
            <li> Unlike another review, I do not detect any baby powder odor, nor any other odor.  </li>
            <li> Avoid if you are getting the unscented version due to sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I have to stick with the other one.</li>
            <li> Never in my life have I experienced a deordant fail so badly.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Unscented Invisible Solid doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on dark clothes as long as I wait a few minutes before I get dressed, and it doesn&#x27;t have a cloying scent to clash with scents from shampoos, soap, body washes, etc.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This is my favorite clear antiperspirant I have ever used.  I do not have any white flaky mess when I use this product.  It smells good and last quite a long time.  I would totally suggest you try this.  As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com but this is my own opinion!</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent and just seemed to smell more as the day went on rather than actually helping deodorize or provide anti-persperant.</li>
            <li> Works Great! I love secret!</li>
            <li> I used the same brand deodorant ( Mitchum) for over 20 years until they changed the formulation, since then I&#x27;ve tried different brands and none of them have worked. I am now using Secret unscented 48 hour deo. which is a joke. I apply the deodorant at night and again in the morning and by the evening I detect a odor.  I wish Mitchum would bring back their original formula!</li>
            <li> This Secret antiperspirant/deodorant is one of the best deodorants I have ever used. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand through bzzagent and loved it. It goes on smoothly and dries very fast unlike other gel deodorants I have tried. It didn&#x27;t feel sticky and it didn&#x27;t leave any residue on the armpits of my shirt. It held up to a very sweaty day and there was no sign of odor, almost like I didn&#x27;t even need to shower. I am a true critic when it comes to things holding up to their advertisement-and this deodorant absolutely stands true to what it claims. And I believe you could put it on and sweat for 48 hours and still be stinch free. This is the only deodorant I will ever buy from now on.</li>
            <li> This deodorants is awesome it keeps me sweat and odor free</li>
            <li> Peels off :/ also has a scent :/</li>
            <li> While all &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; deodorants have a masking scent, Unscented Secret Outlast has the least noticable fragrance of any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I purchased &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; when I couldn&#x27;t find unscented but the longer I wore it the stronger the fragrance. I&#x27;ve only kept it for emergencies when I can&#x27;t find unscented. For me, it controls odor and perspiration much longer than 24 hours. I like that it goes on smooth and dry, not at all sticky like gels. And last but not least, the applicator is great. It is oval and the plastic top is curved inward slightly, ensuring that the edges don&#x27;t scrape the skin. I actually switched from another good -and more expensive brand -  because I had to raise the product so high to avoid being scraped that it broke off during application. So glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I do keep buying it. It does the job and is usually priced reasonably. I cannot speak to the &amp;#34;Outlast&amp;#34; part of it, because I am not exactly active, but it&#x27;s otherwise effective.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but it sucks so bad I had to leave a review. &amp;#34;48 hour fresh&amp;#34;? &amp;#34;Outlast&amp;#34;? All lies! Absolutely the worst deodorant ever. I have never had odor issues, but while using this stuff, I smelled horrible less than an hour after getting out of the shower. I couldn&#x27;t go out in public because I was so paranoid about people smelling me. Secret used to be a good brand, what the heck happened? Amazon really needs to add a &amp;#34;no stars&amp;#34; feature, because this product doesn&#x27;t deserve even one star!</li>
            <li> She loves it. So Im happy.</li>
            <li> I know deordant is a personal thing and effects everyone differently, so this is just my two sense. I recently bought this off Amazon solely based on the fact that they were offering an awesome deal. After testing it out for two weeks now, I have to report that this product is going in the trash. I&#x27;ve tried unscented deordants in the past and never had any issues but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me. The antiperserant did keep me dry but no joke I could begin to smell body odor within 10 minutes or so after applying this. Never in my life have I experienced a deordant fail so badly. It&#x27;s pretty much useless to me since I don&#x27;t have much of a sweating problem. It did apply smoothly and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but has zero odor control.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive pits and this stuff does not irritate! It is also the ONLY deodorant, other than prescription, that can hold off my over-reactive sweating. It does not leave white on clothing and works great!!</li>
            <li> I did worry about this, that removing the fragrance would be removing some of the effectiveness, but I&#x27;ve found that it works just as well and won&#x27;t give me a perfume-migraine.</li>
            <li> daughter loved this and at a low cost</li>
            <li> I really love Secret and this Outlast Unscented Invisible was awesome. I now have a new favorite. I have since then, bought it.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant without scent.I received the product for a discount for a review</li>
            <li> Works great.  Only minor complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t go up and down very easily.</li>
            <li> Love Secret Outlast. It goes on smooth with a very light scent that is just right. No clumps and long lasting coverage for the entire day. This is the only deodorant I trust to keep me smelling fantastic all day long!</li>
            <li> doesnt work as well as clinical strength</li>
            <li> My wife loves this deodorant.  It masks any body odor and leaves behind a soft scent.  They don&#x27;t use an overpowering scent agent that will take over your perfume.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good too</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find unscented deodorant, especially locally.  This Secret Outlast Invisible Solid in great as it leave no white marks on my clothes and there it literally no smell.  This is also a good price here on Amazon compared to the prices at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Writing this review on behalf of another family member who uses this product. They said &amp;#34;it lasts throughout the whole day.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Same product at the store, but I don&#x27;t have to take the kids in to go get it, and with Amazon s&amp;s I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t move away from me covering their noses on a hot crowded metro - so it must work just as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> When one has to work closely with others one does not need perfumes. This keeps you dry w/o strong perfume.</li>
            <li> Strong enough for a woman.</li>
            <li> Wanted this to work, as it is &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and am sensitive to fragrance. But in about 30-60 minutes after applying after showering, was like I hadn&#x27;t put any antiperspirant on at all. Came through this every time. Bottle says it works 48 hours but I didn&#x27;t even get an hour out of this stuff. Too bad as it came as a duo and was well priced; going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I would have given this zero stars if that were an option. It is labeled &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, but has a definite perfume and fragrance is listed as one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> this stuff really does keep you dry.  i dont recall how much it cost but its better than some higher priced ones i have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always easy to find an invisible solid, that is also unscented in the stores.  I am happy that amazon carries this at a good price with the subscribe and save discount.  Secret Outlast Unscented Invisible Solid doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on dark clothes as long as I wait a few minutes before I get dressed, and it doesn&#x27;t have a cloying scent to clash with scents from shampoos, soap, body washes, etc. etc.  Unlike another review, I do not detect any baby powder odor, nor any other odor.  The ingredients are designed to decrease the amount of sweat produced, preventing body odor, rather than cover up body odor with a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have a really sensitive sense of smell and this is the only product I have found that is truly unscented. It works great and stops perspiration.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT Fragrance Free.  In the ingredients it specifically lists *Fragrance and *Masking Fragrance.  If you are sensitive to chemicals or fragrances this is not the one for you.  I was recently diagnosed with MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity).  My husband picked this up for me and before I even opened it I could already smell it&#x27;s &amp;#34;unscentedness&amp;#34;.  My husband didn&#x27;t believe me until he read the ingredients and we confirmed the presence of fragrance. Made me very nauseated and gave me a headache without ever opening.  Avoid if you are getting the unscented version due to sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Very good deoderant, and I really like the opeining on the top. It used to be this huge blob of deoderant and now it comes out of a smaller hole so there is not so much waste.</li>
            <li> This has replaced my old deodorant. I received this product from Secret to test and was very happy I was chosen. This is by far the best and is what my daughter will be using.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this works or not, because I had to take a shower and wash it off immediately.  Secret&#x27;s unscented is not unscented.  It had an awful floral scent that gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try not to be too melodramatic, but this was a game changer for me.  I have a basket full of half used deodorants in my quest to find something to take care of sweat and odor.  I tried various solids, &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; strength deodorants, Chlorofresh gel caps - you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  It was super frustrating to not make it through a morning at work without sweat and odor starting to creep up.  It finally dawned on me that all of the heavily perfumed deodorants could be the culprit.  I finally made the switch and I absolutely could not be happier.  I&#x27;ve been doing the sniff test in total disbelief, I smell fresh, I have a new sense of confidence in tight quarters or while rushing around completing the days&#x27; tasks.</li>
            <li> Between this and the dove bodywash(see my review) I couldn&#x27;t tell what was making me smell soooo bad. Turns out it was both! This,or any of the secret deodorants don&#x27;t work with my body chemistry. After application my body temp seems to go up &amp; I end up smelling like onions. No thank you.Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s scented or unscented.</li>
            <li> best there is, keeps me from being stinky, doesn&#x27;t stain/bleach my clothes - even my black work-shirts, or make me smell like scented tampons all day like scented deodorant does. win win win!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would cut some BO, but it did nothing! BO is actually worse when using this. I will never buy it again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, but it&#x27;s definitely lightly scented, not unscented. It smells a bit like light fabric softener. Very pleasant. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is not always easy to find in local stores, and I really like it.  Was thrilled to be able to order it online with a decent price.  Will continue to buy from this source.  I perspire a lot, and have tried every brand.  This one works the best for me.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant, it works very well and keeps you from smelling like sweat. Unfortunately, it is so popular that I never received my order. But regardless, I have used it before and am very happy with Secret</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I was really hoping but ended up throwing it away and buying a scented Secret.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is unscented.  I had some surgery that called for using no scented products at all.  I was surprised how effective it is without using scents.  I will continue to use this up but will admit, was having difficulty finding it in my regular drugstore.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works fine as a deodorant/antiperspirant, same as most. But it&#x27;s definitely not invisible. Still end up with it all over my shirt after I put on a dark colored tee, and can&#x27;t get it off. Don&#x27;t call it invisible when it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> I had the chance to sample this free through buzz agent but I am so happy I did! I love tough workouts, but I don&#x27;t like to have to worry about sweat stains, wetness or odor. This has done the trick to calm my nervous!</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret for many years now, and this Secret Outlast in a solid unscented stick does the job for me. I work with the public, as a customer service representative, so I am very fussy about what I use. I prefer something with no scent that does not compete with my perfume. Keeps me dry all day. Excellent protection.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x60;t stain but doesn&#x60;t help with my sweating</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and was thrilled that it was available on Subscribe &amp; Save.  I have never understood why someone wants to smell like a deoderant (isn&#x27;t that what perfumes/colognes are for?).  In any case, my husband found this in my cabinet and started using it (fortunately his own container!) and doesn&#x27;t want any of the men&#x27;s antiperspirants because he says this works better than anything he has found for men.</li>
            <li> Although it did its job, when applied this deodorant has a very strong fragrance of baby powder and something else.  Not only did it leave a rash on my skin, it caused an asthma attack to boot. I had to shower twice before I got all the scent off my skin.</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  Keeps you smelling fresh!  And I love having the unscented version for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used this while camping. I smelled nice (well, as nice as no-shower and campfire smell can be) and never saw a bear. So it was a success.</li>
            <li> Simply the best deodorant for active women.</li>
            <li> Look at the picture that shows the ingredients - it lists fragrance! How can it have a masking fragrance and be unscented?  This is false advertising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but this doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as the other Secret Unscented solid. I have to stick with the other one.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I love to use but it&#x27;s always out of stock in stores. Plus this is the cheapest price which is a plus. Lasts all day I love that its unscented. Sweat tends to make perfumed deodorant scent too strong and most times not pleasing.</li>
            <li> Surprise, NO scent!  :)</li>
            <li> Seems to work quite well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but received a free sample from BzzAgent. Although I think I still prefer an invisible solid antiperspirant, I do like this clear gel. It only feels wet for a couple of seconds during application.and isn&#x27;t sticky. There is no scent to collide with my perfume, and I really don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks. I wear dark clothes a lot and usually save putting my shirt on until I&#x27;m ready for work, and not having to worry about, or wipe off, white deo marks saves me time. I also really like the protection. I put it on and forget about sweat and odor. I feel if I forgot to put it on on a busy morning, I would be ok from yesterday&#x27;s application. I have yet to notice any wetness or odor during the day or night. I highly recommend Secret Outlast, especially if you suffer from &amp;#34;Deo White Mark&amp;#34; anxiety. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I prefer the dry feeling of the invisible solid.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, the solid bar, and the way it keeps me fresh all day.</li>
