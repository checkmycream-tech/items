    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Not the best product</li>
            <li>Have had a butane curling iron for years so thought this would be a great addition!</li>
            <li>Go camping often and it&#x27;s the perfect item to pack.</li>
            <li>Perfect for hair touch up in between clients or before going out at night.  </li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a lukewarm hair-squeezer, this may be the best one out there.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be an awesome investment.</li>
            <li>It was a great idea that didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>Got this for a missions trip where most times the electricity is snotty at best.  </li>
            <li>Good idea.</li>
            <li>Loved it very satisfied</li>
            <li>Love it great for traveling</li>
            <li>For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and thought I might be the exception.</li>
            <li>The idea is great, but the product needs much  improvement!</li>
            <li>Gets good n hot!</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to purchase this straightener.</li>
            <li>i hope to use it more</li>
            <li>Save your $20 or better yet buy another product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as my chi, but it&#x27;s ok for the price and portability.</li>
            <li>Been satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li>but I thought it would work better than it did.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very nice, high quality item.</li>
            <li>i had one in high school and loved it.</li>
            <li>And when you light it it smells like a barbecue grill</li>
            <li>, I thought i was going to light my hair on fire</li>
            <li>Works great for my daughter who likes to flat iron her hair on the way to school (our commute is 30 minutes!)</li>
            <li>It packed well in our small bags and worked perfectly on site.</li>
            <li>I have used the Conair regular cordless iron with great success.  </li>
            <li>Worked right away!</li>
            <li>I can hold my hand between the blades of this straightener after its been on for 5-10 mins without getting anywhere near warm.</li>
            <li>It was ready to use more quickly than my plug-in travel straightener</li>
            <li>If you have $20 to get rid of - donate it to a worthy cause.</li>
            <li>It might be cheap and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li>This is the second one I purchased because I liked my original.</li>
            <li>Barely gets Luke warm.</li>
            <li>Barely gets warm.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited about this when I got it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for travel!</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>In addition, the seller got right on my order &amp; had it shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>After the first use it never got hot again when I turned it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok - could definitely get hotter...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It not completely horrible, it just dosent quite get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>This thing works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Not as hot as I would like but still works.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t even get hot.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I&#x27;d rather go with wet hair then use this straightener.  </li>
            <li>It does not get hot and the irons do not meet.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot and I can not return it.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t get as as hot.</li>
            <li>I have pretty straight hair as it is, so if your hair generally requires more effort to straighten it, this may not work as well for you.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t really strong enough to hold your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with what I purchased, as it&#x27;s pretty much what I expected for the $20 price tag.</li>
            <li>Nice for traveling but doesn&#x27;t grip hair tightly.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>so i dont use it very often.</li>
            <li>It was better than nothing but not much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I own 4 different devices  1/4&amp;#34;, 1/2&amp;#34; &amp; 1&amp;#34; Curling Iron &amp; this flat Iron</li>
            <li>It was like I had bought a special \\&quot;cordless blender\\&quot; that turned out to be just a giant cup.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that has not meet my full expectations.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to pinch the ends together as you slide it down the hair.</li>
            <li>Less cords is a better way to go, and if you travel like I do, at some point you are going to be applying makeup in traffic, so why not do your hair there as well?</li>
            <li>It would be better to invest in a regular flat iron.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really flatiron hair.</li>
            <li>Doesnt get hot enough to straighten hair well</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>Many years back we purchased a Conair Butane Powered Curling Iron, The butane heat source could not keep up the heat demand necessary to work properly.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not willing to pay $7 extra dollars for more cartridges.</li>
            <li>This thing does not get hot enough to straighten hair.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough to do touch ups around my face, when I&#x27;m camping or on the go.</li>
            <li>This straightener does not get hot, which the pros will tell you, is a crucial flaw in a straightener.</li>
            <li>Overall, this cordless straightener got the weird wisps and kinks out of my hair, making me photo-ready, and will fit my needs nicely.</li>
            <li>It works well when you need a touch up, but it won&#x27;t get hot enough to do all your hair from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>As with the curling iron, the butane burner can not supply adequate heat to maintain the necessary heat to function properly during use continuously.     </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>i forget i have it and get so busy at work</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get hot enough and wasn&#x27;t heavy enough to straighten hair, leaving my hair with lots of static and not straight (and I already have fairly straight hair!)</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>But that dosent mean that I wont buy any more of these products, because for me the pro&#x27;s out weight the Con&#x27;s..</li>
            <li>The flat iron does not get hot enough and takes forever to get any effect with my hair no matter</li>
            <li>It claims to get as hot as my regular flat iron, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>and I can only say that the flst iron is the only one thst DOSE NOT get hot enough to do the trick.</li>
            <li>It barely heated, didn&#x27;t straighten my hair because it doesn&#x27;t clamp the hair.</li>
            <li>but barely, don&#x27;t be fooled by the 419 degree on the box.  </li>
            <li>This product can barely do anything.</li>
            <li>But it is very upsetting when they don&#x27;t tell you that it cannot be return due to the material matter.</li>
            <li>(Turboion Baby Croc Professional Dual Voltage Mini Travel Flat Iron-love it!)</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough for my hair, but the heat is inconsistent and it doesn&#x27;t close tight enough on the hair to truly straighten it.</li>
            <li>Based on the other reviews, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>It heats up well and fast, but the clip is not very strong.  </li>
            <li>I have thin, normally easy to straighten hair.</li>

            <li> This flat iron does not have the heating capabilities to use continuously.</li>
            <li> The wait is required to allow the flat iron to re-heat between passes.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, we took our generator on our camping trip and my wife used her electric flat iron without any issues.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this flat Iron</li>
            <li> So please again do not order this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat.</li>
            <li> At this point I&#x27;m in foreign third world country, could not buy cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dissatisfied in the quality of the product, due to the fact that the cartridges of thermal cell energy ran out in only 2, 5 minuet uses.</li>
            <li> Not hot enough to work!  </li>
            <li> Also the clamp is too loose - you have to press up while holding it after you have the hair in it</li>
            <li> It did get hot initially after putting the battery in and turning it on, but it didn&#x27;t staighten my hair, was difficult to grip hair.</li>
            <li> it only warms up slightly, so it won&#x27;t do anything to your hair.</li>
            <li> Hardly heats up honestly and by the time you let it heat up the flame turns off and the straightener is cold again.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on how to turn it on and heat the plates, I used very thin sections of my hair, I pinched the plates more tightly closed while straightening, and I straightened each section of hair slowly.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to press those clamps tightly together, while moving the flat iron slowly down.</li>
            <li> other words</li>
            <li> I just tried to return this item and found that you cannot due to safety.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I will be traveling to a country where any plug-in heated appliance (hot plates, blow dryers, hair straighteners) will blow the electricity for the entire building, but I want to ensure that I&#x27;m not going to have a bad hair day when I&#x27;m in these once-in-a-lifetime pictures.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The conclusion is in my opinion, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> 1-Doesn&#x27;t hold the hair at all, even if you want to hold down the clamp part it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> this iron is not good enough to use</li>
            <li> The worst part is I cannot even return it due to hazardous waste policy, which should be advertised when purchasing.</li>
            <li> It has such a weak grip that your hair will slide out as well.</li>
            <li> It does not hold the hair firmly between its handles.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Does not work, a waste of money</li>
            <li> It works for a few days.</li>
            <li> Disliked this product.</li>
            <li> This product is not worthy of the gas you are putting in it!  </li>
            <li> how small an area I attempt to flatten.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money I am so upset!</li>
            <li> Also quite scary to use because your literally using fire to heat up the flat iron.</li>
            <li> but it does the job when I am being prissy and need a touch up when camping.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a flat iron in london for 15 pounds because this thing sucks so bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much useless, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I tried it once but never used it for my intended purpose because it worked so poorly.</li>
            <li> I will usually take it with me to work too for my crazy hair days(:</li>
            <li> Meaning I only had it for 15 minutes and am stuck with a useless tool!!!  </li>

            <li> It does not hold the hair firmly between its handles. Does not straighten well. waste of money. Amazon does not accept returns on this product.</li>
            <li> I love this. It might be cheap and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot but it does the job when I am being prissy and need a touch up when camping. It does have a smell to it but you can&#x27;t complain too much. I will usually take it with me to work too for my crazy hair days(:</li>
            <li> The flat iron does not get hot enough and takes forever to get any effect with my hair no matter how small an area I attempt to flatten.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless. It has no grip whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Doesnt close well enoigh to hold hair to straighten. Needs stronger grip. Doesnt get hot enough to straighten hair well</li>
            <li> Nice for traveling but doesn&#x27;t grip hair tightly. We used it for my daughter&#x27;s dance competition. It did work but not as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Love it great for traveling</li>
            <li> We purchased this straightener to take camping.    I should have known better than to purchase this straightener. Many years back we purchased a Conair Butane Powered Curling Iron, The butane heat source could not keep up the heat demand necessary to work properly. Well, after 20 years, I thought maybe Conair have improved on their design as they were still selling butane powered devices. Well, how wrong I was. This flat iron does not have the heating capabilities to use continuously. You make a pass through your hair, then have to wait another minute or two to make the next pass. The wait is required to allow the flat iron to re-heat between passes. As with the curling iron, the butane burner can not supply adequate heat to maintain the necessary heat to function properly during use continuously.     Thankfully, we took our generator on our camping trip and my wife used her electric flat iron without any issues.</li>
            <li> I have used the Conair regular cordless iron with great success.  This product is not worthy of the gas you are putting in it!  Only one side heats with the idea that the heat will transmit through the ceramic plates....doesn&#x27;t happen!  I tried everything to make it work; even using the iron upside-down...only having my hair get caught in the hinge!  I attempted to return the item and it is &amp;#34;unreturnable&amp;#34;...? IE:  don&#x27;t waist your money..:(</li>
            <li> This is the second one I purchased because I liked my original.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t work. It did get hot initially after putting the battery in and turning it on, but it didn&#x27;t staighten my hair, was difficult to grip hair. After the first use it never got hot again when I turned it on. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughter who likes to flat iron her hair on the way to school (our commute is 30 minutes!)</li>
            <li> Only gave one star because it wouldn&#x27;t let me give zero. I can hold my hand between the blades of this straightener after its been on for 5-10 mins without getting anywhere near warm. Barely gets Luke warm. Complete waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work but bought it anyway for my camping trip. I have very fine hair and thought I might be the exception. Nope, it doesn&#x27;t work. Barely gets warm. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Does not work, a waste of money</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use this product.  I purchased it for a trip out of the country. I should have looked it over thoroughly before traveling,  I did not. I went to use product,  NO CARTRIDGE. USELESS. At this point I&#x27;m in foreign third world country, could not buy cartridge.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - could definitely get hotter... Also the clamp is too loose - you have to press up while holding it after you have the hair in it so it doesn&#x27;t just slide through. Not the best product but it&#x27;ll do in a pinch and when there&#x27;s no electricity...</li>
            <li> i had one in high school and loved it. i forget i have it and get so busy at work so i dont use it very often. i hope to use it more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dissatisfied in the quality of the product, due to the fact that the cartridges of thermal cell energy ran out in only 2, 5 minuet uses. And I&#x27;m not willing to pay $7 extra dollars for more cartridges. The conclusion is in my opinion, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worst iron ever. I wanted a portable iron that I could use just to touch up by bangs, this doesn&#x27;t even do that. The worst part is I cannot even return it due to hazardous waste policy, which should be advertised when purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for! Have had a butane curling iron for years so thought this would be a great addition! Gets good n hot! Worked right away! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited about this when I got it. Less cords is a better way to go, and if you travel like I do, at some point you are going to be applying makeup in traffic, so why not do your hair there as well? It was a great idea that didn&#x27;t work out. This thing does not get hot enough to straighten hair. It has such a weak grip that your hair will slide out as well. Even taking the smallest sections of hair won&#x27;t help. Good idea. Bad product.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this flat Iron It doesn&#x27;t heat up it only warms up slightly, so it won&#x27;t do anything to your hair. It&#x27;s pretty much useless, very disappointing. And when I went to return this is the message I received on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;  For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&lt;br /&gt;In other words you cannot get your money back or exchange for a different product I know it was only $20 and almost anyone can afford to lose $20 just as I can. But it is very upsetting when they don&#x27;t tell you that it cannot be return due to the material matter. Plus now it&#x27;s going to be a very difficult to even dispose of it as well. So please again do not order this flat iron.  Save your $20 or better yet buy another product.</li>
            <li> Loved it very satisfied</li>
            <li> It works for a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on a cruise.  It heats up well and fast, but the clip is not very strong.  You have to use both hands to squeeze the 2 sides together enough to get the hair to straighten.  It doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as my chi, but it&#x27;s ok for the price and portability.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to take on an adventure trip to Panama. It arrived on time as promised. It packed well in our small bags and worked perfectly on site.</li>
            <li> I have bought several butane items in the last 15 yrs. Been satisfied with all of them. This is the only one that has not meet my full expectations.  It not completely horrible, it just dosent quite get hot enough.  I own 4 different devices  1/4&amp;#34;, 1/2&amp;#34; &amp; 1&amp;#34; Curling Iron &amp; this flat Iron and I can only say that the flst iron is the only one thst DOSE NOT get hot enough to do the trick. But that dosent mean that I wont buy any more of these products, because for me the pro&#x27;s out weight the Con&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to work as well as my home one but I thought it would work better than it did. I tried it once but never used it for my intended purpose because it worked so poorly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Africa with no electricity. It was better than nothing but not much. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really flatiron hair.</li>
            <li> Disliked this product. It barely heated, didn&#x27;t straighten my hair because it doesn&#x27;t clamp the hair. Also quite scary to use because your literally using fire to heat up the flat iron.</li>
            <li> The wife bought this for our boondock RV trips. Not as efficient as the at home plug in model but it does the job when there&#x27;s no shore power.</li>
            <li> This thing works pretty well. Not as hot as I would like but still works.  Be sure to pinch the ends together as you slide it down the hair. It helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with what I purchased, as it&#x27;s pretty much what I expected for the $20 price tag. It gets hot enough to do touch ups around my face, when I&#x27;m camping or on the go. The trick is to press those clamps tightly together, while moving the flat iron slowly down. In addition, the seller got right on my order &amp; had it shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Go camping often and it&#x27;s the perfect item to pack.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t really strong enough to hold your hair. Takes a long time to heat. I don&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Any woman on the constant go like me should have this straightner, ESPECIALLY if you have bangs that flip out while commuting.  Perfect for hair touch up in between clients or before going out at night.  Would recommend  to all.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even get hot. I had to buy a flat iron in london for 15 pounds because this thing sucks so bad. And when you light it it smells like a barbecue grill, I thought i was going to light my hair on fire</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, I&#x27;d rather go with wet hair then use this straightener.  It didn&#x27;t get hot enough and wasn&#x27;t heavy enough to straighten hair, leaving my hair with lots of static and not straight (and I already have fairly straight hair!)</li>
            <li> Got this for a missions trip where most times the electricity is snotty at best.  It claims to get as hot as my regular flat iron, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely terrible and a waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. It literally heated up to maybe a hundred degrees. Totally useless.</li>
            <li> Hardly heats up honestly and by the time you let it heat up the flame turns off and the straightener is cold again. I was hoping to make it work but couldn&#x27;t. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This straightener does not get hot, which the pros will tell you, is a crucial flaw in a straightener. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as the straighteners you plug into the wall, but this was really useless. It was like I had bought a special \\&quot;cordless blender\\&quot; that turned out to be just a giant cup. If you would like a straightening iron, don&#x27;t buy this product. If you are in the market for a lukewarm hair-squeezer, this may be the best one out there.</li>
            <li> I just tried to return this item and found that you cannot due to safety.  It came with a cartridge similar to those used in lighters. It does not get hot and the irons do not meet. It is horrible and a waste of money. DO NOT buy this. If you have $20 to get rid of - donate it to a worthy cause.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trip and it just arrived but I wished now that I never even bought it!! 1-Doesn&#x27;t hold the hair at all, even if you want to hold down the clamp part it doesn&#x27;t work.  This makes it not functional as a hair straightener.  2-Heats up-but barely, don&#x27;t be fooled by the 419 degree on the box.  3-Since it&#x27;s got the butane cartridge it can&#x27;t be returned!  Meaning I only had it for 15 minutes and am stuck with a useless tool!!!  It would be better to invest in a regular flat iron.</li>
            <li> Not hot enough to work!  Buy something else and save some money for yourself  this iron is not good enough to use</li>
            <li> Thought this would be an awesome investment. However, I was wrong. I have thin, normally easy to straighten hair. This product can barely do anything. It gets hot enough for my hair, but the heat is inconsistent and it doesn&#x27;t close tight enough on the hair to truly straighten it. I have to to squeeze it together on my hair while straightening at the same time, and hope I don&#x27;t burn my fingers in the process. The idea is great, but the product needs much  improvement!</li>
            <li> It does not get hot and I can not return it. This was a waste of money I am so upset!</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product. I will be traveling to a country where any plug-in heated appliance (hot plates, blow dryers, hair straighteners) will blow the electricity for the entire building, but I want to ensure that I&#x27;m not going to have a bad hair day when I&#x27;m in these once-in-a-lifetime pictures.  I followed the directions on how to turn it on and heat the plates, I used very thin sections of my hair, I pinched the plates more tightly closed while straightening, and I straightened each section of hair slowly.  It was ready to use more quickly than my plug-in travel straightener (Turboion Baby Croc Professional Dual Voltage Mini Travel Flat Iron-love it!) but it didn&#x27;t get as as hot. I have pretty straight hair as it is, so if your hair generally requires more effort to straighten it, this may not work as well for you.  Overall, this cordless straightener got the weird wisps and kinks out of my hair, making me photo-ready, and will fit my needs nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my step daughter.  It works well when you need a touch up, but it won&#x27;t get hot enough to do all your hair from the beginning.  Overall it&#x27;s a very nice, high quality item.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for travel!</li>
            <li> Terrible, returned this item.</li>
