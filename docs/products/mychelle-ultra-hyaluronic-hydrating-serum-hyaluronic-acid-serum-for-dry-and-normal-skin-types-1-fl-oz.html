            <li>This product is great and the nourishment is not only felt but improves appearance.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I love this serum because it does seem to plump my skin right up after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I own another Hyaluronic serum and it works completely different, better than this one.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin smoother and more beautiful without irritation in the least, which for me, is saying something.</li>
            <li>I also recently bought Amara  organics Hyaluronic serum because of the good reviews, but believe I prefer MyChelle, which also seems to be a bit thicker serum.  </li>
            <li>Light, quick to absorb, smells nice, very moisturizing, no skin reactions at all, and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Within a week, fine lines were softened and my skin felt so much more comfortable (had been feeling &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; and dry).</li>
            <li>Great product, really works well for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>its instantly absorbed into my skin and help keep it hydrated.  </li>
            <li>(very slight fragrance - I am chemically sensitive &amp; this does not bother me at all) but works great!  </li>
            <li>Have tried to go without, but helps my dry skin look more youthful and moisturized!</li>
            <li>Very nice on my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>but I think very high quality without lots of added chemicals!</li>
            <li>My skin looked clear &amp; felt smooth within 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I saw an instant difference in the radiance (not &amp;#34;shinyness&amp;#34; ) of my skin and plumper more hydrated, smoother looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I just moved to central TX, and worry more about aging skin here, the sun is the culprit.</li>
            <li>Its not a miracle-worker, but it certain helps.  </li>
            <li>I had fine lines coming back.  </li>
            <li>I use this liberally, about 3 pumps, twice a day, on my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>This  Works very well</li>
            <li>Very hydrating without being too dewy.  </li>
            <li>It can be pricey, but totally worth it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I apply before my moisturizer both day and night, and it really helps your moisturizer sink into your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really miss it when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>In summer I even can just use the other serum without any other moisterizer and my skin would be great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love this product because even though I have oily skin, I want to moisturize after I wash without a heavy cream feeling.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert (Phoenix)</li>
            <li>But I have adult acne too</li>
            <li>so far people still think I&#x27;m 30 not 42.</li>
            <li>My skin is realyl oily with some dry areas and for something to dry it so completely out is rare...</li>
            <li>I like the whole dry line and am seeing continual improvement.  </li>

            <li> so even though I don&#x27;t naturally have dry skin - the climate here is so drying that every hair and skin product has to be for dry skin or else it won&#x27;t work for me here.  </li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Tried this because of dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I purchashed the hydrating serum for the winter months because my skin gets very dry during that time.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of running out once and in a few months I could definitely tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would moisturize, but instead it dried my skin out causing it to become red and blotchy.  </li>
            <li> and I wish I had listened to the other one and two star reviews.</li>
            <li> My skin feels plump und dewy without being oily when I use the other serum.</li>
            <li> It also got less greasy and shinny.</li>
            <li> It also helps to give your face a slight glow with repeated use.  </li>
            <li> this product really dried out my skin, and it took a few weeks before it recovered.</li>
            <li> I use this serum everyday under my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Its expensive</li>

            <li> Great product, really works well for my dry skin. I use it with the MyChelle pumpkin renew cream, and I noticed my skin is more hydrated and softer. It also got less greasy and shinny.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mychelle products for over 2 years now.  I purchashed the hydrating serum for the winter months because my skin gets very dry during that time.  It worked great at keeping my skin moisturized.  I would apply the serum and then the pumpkin renew cream.  i would definitely recommend this product for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product because even though I have oily skin, I want to moisturize after I wash without a heavy cream feeling.  This is perfect for that purpose!  Its expensive but I think very high quality without lots of added chemicals!</li>
            <li> I just bought the serum and I wish I had listened to the other one and two star reviews. It totally dries my skin out instead of moisturizing it. It smells pleasant but that is all I can say about it. I own another Hyaluronic serum and it works completely different, better than this one. My skin feels plump und dewy without being oily when I use the other serum. In summer I even can just use the other serum without any other moisterizer and my skin would be great. My skin is realyl oily with some dry areas and for something to dry it so completely out is rare...&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this serum, look for another brand!</li>
            <li> This product is one of a kind.  My skin looked clear &amp; felt smooth within 2 days.  I just love this product and will keep using it!!!</li>
            <li> this product really dried out my skin, and it took a few weeks before it recovered.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the winter!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now.  I made the mistake of running out once and in a few months I could definitely tell the difference.  I had fine lines coming back.  I use this liberally, about 3 pumps, twice a day, on my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> hydrate well&lt;br /&gt;But I recommend you to use this serum under your regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this serum only, it will not enough to keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> This  Works very well</li>
            <li> I love this product as it helps to keep one&#x27;s face moisturized.  The only drawback to the 2 bottles I recently received is that the tops don&#x27;t stayed screwed on properly.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum.  It not only smells wonderful (very slight fragrance - I am chemically sensitive &amp; this does not bother me at all) but works great!  I suffer from excema &amp; it has yet to bother me.  I bought it for my mom &amp; she loves it, too.  Buy this serum, you will love it, too!!</li>
            <li> Very hydrating without being too dewy.  I live in the desert (Phoenix) so even though I don&#x27;t naturally have dry skin - the climate here is so drying that every hair and skin product has to be for dry skin or else it won&#x27;t work for me here.  Even coconut oil does not work for me here while it was excellent in California.  I highly recommend.  I saw an instant difference in the radiance (not &amp;#34;shinyness&amp;#34; ) of my skin and plumper more hydrated, smoother looking skin.  I like the whole dry line and am seeing continual improvement.  Worth the price!</li>

            <li> Been using this serum for years now.  Light, quick to absorb, smells nice, very moisturizing, no skin reactions at all, and I have sensitive skin.  Good stuff !</li>
            <li> This product is great and the nourishment is not only felt but improves appearance. I love all of MyChelle products.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that I&#x27;ve been using for years. It can be pricey, but totally worth it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would moisturize, but instead it dried my skin out causing it to become red and blotchy.  On the 2nd day, my skin started peeling.</li>
            <li> Within a week, fine lines were softened and my skin felt so much more comfortable (had been feeling &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; and dry). Will continue.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Thanks</li>
            <li> love this product.  its instantly absorbed into my skin and help keep it hydrated.  wonderful buy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Tried this because of dry winter skin. But I have adult acne too so I was concerned this would break me out. It didn&#x27;t. It does just what it says, moisture retention without break out. I will use this every winter now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for years.  I apply before my moisturizer both day and night, and it really helps your moisturizer sink into your skin.  It also helps to give your face a slight glow with repeated use.  Its not a miracle-worker, but it certain helps.  LOVE, LOVE, and I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> this is the best for hydrating my fifty four year old skin. I am always told I look much younger than my years</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I use it under moisturizer or alone on my face.  I feel it seals in moisture and minimizes wrinkles.  I really miss it when I don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s affordable too!</li>
            <li> I love this serum because it does seem to plump my skin right up after washing my face.  I also recently bought Amara  organics Hyaluronic serum because of the good reviews, but believe I prefer MyChelle, which also seems to be a bit thicker serum.  Very nice on my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very great product, cheap price.</li>
            <li> I use this serum everyday under my moisturizer.  I love it.  I find it plumps up my skin making me look younger.</li>
            <li> Excellent for super dry skin. Use it under your moisturizer. Does not make me break out or look greasy. I use it every morning.</li>
            <li> Necessary part of my daily &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; routine.  Have tried to go without, but helps my dry skin look more youthful and moisturized!</li>
            <li> The proverbial trifecta for wrinkle development, but so far people still think I&#x27;m 30 not 42. I just moved to central TX, and worry more about aging skin here, the sun is the culprit. This product makes my skin smoother and more beautiful without irritation in the least, which for me, is saying something.</li>
