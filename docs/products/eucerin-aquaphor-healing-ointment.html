            <li>Love the use of this product and size!</li>

            <li>stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Aquaphor which means its amazing.</li>
            <li>Handy size for pocket.</li>
            <li>It does work well however, a bit to greasy for me and a roller ball for application would be nice as well.</li>
            <li>I even use this on my cat, who gets a chapped nose in winter, and she doesn&#x27;t seem to detect any kind of objectionable odor, either.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, nice size for my purse.</li>
            <li>These are great for outdoor activity as caps rarely unscrew in pockets compared with lip gel sticks.</li>
            <li>Excellent lip balm, also good on cuts, scrapes, cuticles and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>They have chubby cheeks that get chapped easily!</li>
            <li>I have tried many lip moisturizer products and this one is far and away the best.</li>
            <li>worked great very fast</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than chapstick.</li>
            <li>My lips love it and so do my feet</li>
            <li>This is the only thing I use as &amp;#34;Chapstick&amp;#34; on my lips, it&#x27;s so wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love the size, it fits just about anywhere</li>
            <li>One for home, one to go :)</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>And magically there were at leat six (6) people referring to Aquaphor healing ointment.  </li>
            <li>Much better than any chap lip stick you can buy.  </li>
            <li>I tried many lotions and none worked.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li>Having used the Aquaphor product for a couple of weeks during the winter of 2014, I can say the product is okay.</li>
            <li>A couple of postings and various message boards called this out as best moisturizer they had ever used.</li>
            <li>Better then vaseline.</li>
            <li>I love having these to put in my purse.</li>
            <li>So glad it also comes in a &amp;#34;to-go&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li>I use this every night before bed and my lips are completely better.</li>
            <li>I know this works for most people, but this literally just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>this stuff is now my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>I recommend spending more time reading the details versus assuming what you may be buying.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t LOVE any inanimate object</li>
            <li>Love this ointment.</li>
            <li>This works better than carmex or chapstick.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with both service and product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE~</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to love aquaphor on my lips better than their lip stuff, which I used to love.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Baby version is much better.</li>
            <li>I learn more with each order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the ability to subscribe to something like this</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it before you go to Europe in case</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, you will love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers spoke of its efficacy</li>
            <li>This is my go to medicine for most things that ail me.  </li>
            <li>So smooth, nice shine, and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Love the size of this item.</li>
            <li>but they are even more chapped in wintertime.</li>
            <li>Works way better on lips than the &amp;#34;lip therapy&amp;#34; version of Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will prove to be better after a fw weeks.</li>
            <li>Only one word needed, Excellent.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor has been the best proactive measure I&#x27;ve taken against dry, cracked lips.</li>
            <li>This Aquaphor is the best for dry cracked lips.  </li>
            <li>Though this product has the one with more comfortable top as well.</li>
            <li>My daughters skin is very sensitive so this is great for keeping her skin protected from any irritation.</li>
            <li>This ointment works great for keeping my lips moist and soft.</li>
            <li>This has been my first winter using it, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results-</li>
            <li>easy to carry for anytime to use.</li>
            <li>Loved the idea of handy Aquaphor, but man, these tubes are tiny.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is very gentle yet exceptionally effective.</li>
            <li>Very convenient, no mess, perfect travel size ointment for my lips or ashy part of my body.</li>
            <li>Very good healing ointment, had many problems with hand and foot syndrome due to chemo</li>
            <li>not only is this great for skin conditions, but if you have a new tattoo it is amazing for the healing process!</li>
            <li>The add makes them look large and they are the size of chapstick!!!</li>
            <li>This product was needed quickly and the supplier more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have used aquaphore for years for sunburns (it works amazing on sunburn, better than aloe, but the walmart store brand works just as good, especially if you have a large sunburn and am buying in bulk).</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of aquaphor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I wanted to try the item before committing to the huge tub.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the texture of my lips has actually improved greatly:</li>
            <li>Yes I do spend money on Quality products, but this is my go to cheap product that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>The Aquaphor ointment hasn&#x27;t needed to be reapplied, goes on smoothly, and has no taste or odor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available via the Subscribe and Save program at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>This product really is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I love Aquaphor and this is the right size for tucking into a cocktail purse or coat pocket.  </li>
            <li>this stuff works great for dry skin, the tubes are a perfect size, very  small and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>Great for dry chapped lips and skin.</li>
            <li>Works great on dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for little dabs here and there, but if you think you might want to slather every once in a while, then this is not the right size for you.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>The pure petrolatum just sat on top of my lips and never soaked in.</li>
            <li>However, it does not produce the same good results as Neutrogena Hand Cream (Amazon has it).</li>
            <li>Two days of Aquaphor and my lips are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Product does the job without any irritation that I&#x27;ve experienced with other products.</li>
            <li>Most importantly for me is that I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to it, while being extremely sensitive to skin care products.</li>
            <li>More importantly Aquaphor has made my skin feel better and reduced the discomfort caused by cracked, dry skin.</li>
            <li>It works quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to straight petroleum jelly and it absorbs well and quickly into skin.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with chapped lips for around 5 months and the first day I used this ointment I have had smooth lips ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Put it on morning I got tattoo and most people didn&#x27;t know it was a new tattoo when they saw it</li>
            <li>my dentist said this is good for dry lips...</li>
            <li>I used to use the big tube, which was nice because it never ran out</li>
            <li>Holy Grail of lip products, and I own about a gazillion different ones.</li>
            <li>The best &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; in the game</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put anything else on my sensitive lips and eyes when my eczema affects my skin. :)</li>
            <li>This product is very similar to Vaseline, but in a handy size to take with you on the go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t see a big difference.</li>
            <li>This has become -- far and away -- my favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad there is a Subscribe &amp; Save option, as I will be getting more of this instead of cuticle oil, Carmex, and other lip stuff.</li>
            <li>Literally one treatment of this stuff right before bed</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first night, they are soft for most of the day.</li>
            <li>As someone who is always trying new beauty and skin care products, I was so surprised that my boyfriend recommended me this and that I didn&#x27;t discover this on my own sooner.</li>
            <li>Nothing else clears it up as quickly, making them smooth and soft again.</li>
            <li>It was inevitable that dryness and dehydration would get the best of me: I&#x27;m 4 months into my accutane treatment, have flown on multiple cross-country and overseas flights, and flew directly into one of the harshest winters I&#x27;ve had in five years.</li>
            <li>But this works great as a Chapstick when on the go and just want to toss it in a small purse.  </li>
            <li>These small tubes are great for sticking inside the purse, diaper bag, stroller etc.</li>
            <li>Other products have to be reapplied and don&#x27;t seem to improve my dry lips but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>It, by no means, offers a cure for the condition, but compared to all the other lotions and creams I have tried, it has worked the best so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, but very soft and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Instead, my skin is much more plump and hydrated not only right</li>
            <li>Have tried so many different products for chapped lips -</li>
            <li>at first but boy has this made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended aquaphor to me and I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve finally found something that ALWAYS works!</li>
            <li>This is my first winter in the east</li>
            <li>This is much better than their lip balm which actually irritates my lips ....</li>
            <li>so shower first then rub it in.</li>
            <li>Aquafor is gentle and effective for preventing and treating minor skin irritations, which I have a lot of because of autoimmune disease.</li>
            <li>can also use it as a first aid salve, and of course, it&#x27;s also used for baby bottoms!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also for a regular lotion in the winter when most lotions just don&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li>I buy this one for my lips because the package designed for lip application does not seem to have the same consistency and is a bit more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>When you have an open wound on your face, of all places, you are most concerned about scarring.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a big tub of this stuff but wanted a size for travel and was so pleased to find this 2 pack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty greasy product, but Aquaphor works.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m consistent at using Aquaphor (which a doctor recommended to me, saying it \\&quot;wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Must have for year round happiness.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of skin-care products making miracle claims based on some \\&quot;new science\\&quot; or special ingredient.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with this product for sure!!!</li>
            <li>Great product, but very small</li>
            <li>The only other lip product that I&#x27;ve used that is this good is Clinique&#x27;s Super Balm --</li>
            <li>I love this product too, just ordered it to reach my total for free shipping, but no that was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;Another third party order.</li>
            <li>Works great for chapped or dry lips or dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything, and nothing works better for really dry areas than this.</li>
            <li>you have issues similar, I highly recommend this product, as it has helped my wife more than any thing else (even perscription) that she has tried.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night before bed and my lips are super soft when I wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My son gets irritated red spots on his cheeks easily (from acidic foods, etc).</li>
            <li>My son gets irritated red spots on his cheeks easily ( from acidic foods) .</li>
            <li>The larger tubes are also good for dry scabs to soften</li>
            <li>I was a little reticent since its kind of &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very convenient size-</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing but not too oily.</li>
            <li>and I found it didn&#x27;t do much for healing.</li>
            <li>I will be repurchasing and highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Intense burning let me tell you.</li>
            <li>THIS OINTMENT IS VERY VERASTILE.</li>
            <li>Some of this ointment really helps it.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>, I see real progress.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor really helps my chapped lips, which I always have</li>
            <li>I liked the smaller travel size of these versus the giant tubs of it that cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>With that kind of heavy use, I can recommend for any chapped, or irritated skin.</li>
            <li>No scent or flavor, no waxy residue, no menthol or other ingredients that feel good at first but probably dont help much in the long run.  </li>
            <li>It does soothes chapped skin and might be the great one for the ones with average dry skin.</li>
            <li>The top of my hands started cracking due to the weather conditions here.</li>
            <li>I had already tried all the other brands when I found this and that day they were dramatically better.</li>
            <li>It has been below 0 where I live, and this really keeps my skin from cracking.  </li>
            <li>I tried multiple chapsticks but this is the only thing that was able to help.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>very nice emollient - thick and deeply moisturizing</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully &amp; highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This was highly recommended by a friend</li>
            <li>I also like that it gives me a little bit of a shine, more so than Chapstick.</li>
            <li>I love the little tubes of Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li>I use Aquaphor on my tattoos, particularly brand new tattoos.</li>
            <li>Best chapstick - the only thing that won&#x27;t make your lips addicted and actually works to heal chapped lips every time.</li>
            <li>I have these in my car because the normal twist-tube type can melt in the summer heat and leak.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m outside in harsh weather on a daily basis, and most of the lip balms I&#x27;ve used have been OK, but have required frequent reapplications in order to protect my lips.  </li>
            <li>Another thing was the top of the tube which is not very comfortable to put the balm on lip and need to be allocated with fingers, but was my mistake as it&#x27;s clearly seen from the picture.</li>
            <li>Basically, it really moisturizes, whereas most other lip products seem to mask the problem, while actually drying your lips out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very dry / chapped lips, and I&#x27;ve tried to treat them with many different balms and chapsticks.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I could live without this product.</li>
            <li>This product inspires new hope for my lips, I swear.</li>
            <li>Love these little travel guys!</li>
            <li>Not exposed to direct sunlight or high temperatures</li>
            <li>Simply helps to keep my lips from becoming dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li>I love the small tubes because they are so portable.</li>
            <li>TO use just dab a little on your finger and tap around the corners of your eyes to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tend to dry lip skin very much and was hoping to reduce the frequency of using lip balsam during the day though it&#x27;s very much the same as others.</li>
            <li>I love these little guys!!</li>
            <li>The only method that really works for me is the old \\&quot;barrier</li>
            <li>and I woke up completely healed.</li>
            <li>makes skin soft and greaseless...</li>
            <li>I use this product on my four year old&#x27;s chapped skin--</li>
            <li>I love these travel sizes - they will actually last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough for a baby as well!</li>
            <li>Too masculine for balm, son uses this for chapped lips and hand callouses.</li>
            <li>All it seems to be is a souped up version of the old fashioned petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li>far as the product I already knew of Aquaphor as I was given it in the Doctor&#x27;s office when I was undergoing&lt;br /&gt;radiation treatment for treating the burned areas of my chest.</li>
            <li>It has kept me looking young for years.  </li>
            <li>I use this at night and in the morning they are so soft.</li>
            <li>CVS charges five dollar per tube for this item and it is much superior to any other lip balm and works well for scratches and other minor injuries to promote healing.</li>
            <li>this is good for traveling only b/c they only give you two very small travel size tubes.  </li>
            <li>Love it for small burns especially the ones I get from my curling iron.</li>
            <li>Very good for dry cracking/spitting skin during cold winters.</li>
            <li>and i noticed instant relief in the mornings and after three nights use i am almost back to normal!!</li>
            <li>It inflates my tiny lips to normal size.</li>
            <li>This cream hasn&#x27;t been a fast &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream, but it has slowly been healing the cracks and cuts in her hands, and helping to smooth them at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It is odorless, tasteless, and won&#x27;t have you perpetually going back for more and more lip balms.</li>
            <li>The winter causes me very chapped and dry lips.</li>
            <li>No balm or gloss ever really worked for my perpetually dry lips.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use this on my elbows and dry patches on my face and it really helps the cracking and dryness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Sephora junkie, spending an embarrassingly large amount of our disposable income chasing products that make a bunch of empty promises.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why people rave about this product when they could save so much money by using petroleum jelly which you can also buy in small tubes for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>After the second night, cracks are almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>Found it much cheaper in generic version at my local drugstore, will stick with that in the future.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky though, so be careful about getting it on things if you can&#x27;t wash them.</li>
            <li>Met my needs for a portable tube of Aquaphor, but kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product - I use it after every diaper change &amp; just apply a thin layer to help prevent any diaper rash or irritation.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccommend this for any dry skin.  </li>
            <li>12 YR OLD DAUGHTER AND 6 YR OLD SON USE IT ON THEIR DRY LIPS....</li>
            <li>I spent money on a wide variety of products to soothe my super sore chapped lips.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference between this and plain old Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>only real downside to this is that it&#x27;s extremely greasy.</li>
            <li>I could barely eat at one point because every time I ate I tore open the sides of my mouth again.</li>
            <li>My lips get super dry year round</li>
            <li>If you are someone who, like me, has a tendency toward dry lips and uses a lip balm frequently, give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li>I am frequently applying lotion and balm to my sensitive dry skin, and I am definitely going to add this to my dry skin arsenal.</li>
            <li>It has a few other &amp;#34;inactive ingredients&amp;#34; and isn&#x27;t as greasy but not anything special in my view</li>
            <li>I keep these little ones in my purse and my daughter&#x27;s backpack because her face and hands get really chapped in the winter.  </li>
            <li>The other ingredients appear to be mostly things to change the consistency and make matters a little less greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know any other product that would save and heal my dry skin so fast and so well.</li>

            <li> Love the use of this product and size!</li>
            <li> After that, my lips are great -- nice and smooth, and lipstick looks good.  </li>
            <li> Im in love!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes lips amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Great, cheap and effective lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Aquaphor which means its amazing.</li>
            <li> Handy size for pocket.</li>
            <li> It does work well however, a bit to greasy for me and a roller ball for application would be nice as well.</li>
            <li> I even use this on my cat, who gets a chapped nose in winter, and she doesn&#x27;t seem to detect any kind of objectionable odor, either.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nice size for my purse.</li>
            <li> These are great for outdoor activity as caps rarely unscrew in pockets compared with lip gel sticks.</li>
            <li> Excellent lip balm, also good on cuts, scrapes, cuticles and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> They have chubby cheeks that get chapped easily!</li>
            <li> I have tried many lip moisturizer products and this one is far and away the best.</li>
            <li> worked great very fast</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than chapstick.</li>
            <li> My lips love it and so do my feet</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I use as &amp;#34;Chapstick&amp;#34; on my lips, it&#x27;s so wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love the size, it fits just about anywhere</li>
            <li> One for home, one to go :)</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> And magically there were at leat six (6) people referring to Aquaphor healing ointment.  </li>
            <li> Much better than any chap lip stick you can buy.  </li>
            <li> I tried many lotions and none worked.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li> Having used the Aquaphor product for a couple of weeks during the winter of 2014, I can say the product is okay.</li>
            <li> A couple of postings and various message boards called this out as best moisturizer they had ever used.</li>
            <li> Better then vaseline.</li>
            <li> I love having these to put in my purse.</li>
            <li> So glad it also comes in a &amp;#34;to-go&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> I use this every night before bed and my lips are completely better.</li>
            <li> I know this works for most people, but this literally just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> this stuff is now my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> I recommend spending more time reading the details versus assuming what you may be buying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE any inanimate object</li>
            <li> Love this ointment.</li>
            <li> This works better than carmex or chapstick.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with both service and product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE~</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to love aquaphor on my lips better than their lip stuff, which I used to love.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Baby version is much better.</li>
            <li> I learn more with each order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the ability to subscribe to something like this</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it before you go to Europe in case</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, you will love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers spoke of its efficacy</li>
            <li> This is my go to medicine for most things that ail me.  </li>
            <li> So smooth, nice shine, and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Love the size of this item.</li>
            <li> but they are even more chapped in wintertime.</li>
            <li> Works way better on lips than the &amp;#34;lip therapy&amp;#34; version of Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will prove to be better after a fw weeks.</li>
            <li> Only one word needed, Excellent.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor has been the best proactive measure I&#x27;ve taken against dry, cracked lips.</li>
            <li> This Aquaphor is the best for dry cracked lips.  </li>
            <li> Though this product has the one with more comfortable top as well.</li>
            <li> My daughters skin is very sensitive so this is great for keeping her skin protected from any irritation.</li>
            <li> This ointment works great for keeping my lips moist and soft.</li>
            <li> This has been my first winter using it, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results-</li>
            <li> easy to carry for anytime to use.</li>
            <li> Loved the idea of handy Aquaphor, but man, these tubes are tiny.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is very gentle yet exceptionally effective.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, no mess, perfect travel size ointment for my lips or ashy part of my body.</li>
            <li> Very good healing ointment, had many problems with hand and foot syndrome due to chemo</li>
            <li> not only is this great for skin conditions, but if you have a new tattoo it is amazing for the healing process!</li>
            <li> The add makes them look large and they are the size of chapstick!!!</li>
            <li> This product was needed quickly and the supplier more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have used aquaphore for years for sunburns (it works amazing on sunburn, better than aloe, but the walmart store brand works just as good, especially if you have a large sunburn and am buying in bulk).</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of aquaphor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted to try the item before committing to the huge tub.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the texture of my lips has actually improved greatly:</li>
            <li> Yes I do spend money on Quality products, but this is my go to cheap product that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> The Aquaphor ointment hasn&#x27;t needed to be reapplied, goes on smoothly, and has no taste or odor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s available via the Subscribe and Save program at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This product really is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I love Aquaphor and this is the right size for tucking into a cocktail purse or coat pocket.  </li>
            <li> this stuff works great for dry skin, the tubes are a perfect size, very  small and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> Great for dry chapped lips and skin.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for little dabs here and there, but if you think you might want to slather every once in a while, then this is not the right size for you.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> The pure petrolatum just sat on top of my lips and never soaked in.</li>
            <li> However, it does not produce the same good results as Neutrogena Hand Cream (Amazon has it).</li>
            <li> Two days of Aquaphor and my lips are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Product does the job without any irritation that I&#x27;ve experienced with other products.</li>
            <li> Most importantly for me is that I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to it, while being extremely sensitive to skin care products.</li>
            <li> More importantly Aquaphor has made my skin feel better and reduced the discomfort caused by cracked, dry skin.</li>
            <li> It works quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior to straight petroleum jelly and it absorbs well and quickly into skin.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with chapped lips for around 5 months and the first day I used this ointment I have had smooth lips ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Put it on morning I got tattoo and most people didn&#x27;t know it was a new tattoo when they saw it</li>
            <li> my dentist said this is good for dry lips...</li>
            <li> I used to use the big tube, which was nice because it never ran out</li>
            <li> Holy Grail of lip products, and I own about a gazillion different ones.</li>
            <li> The best &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; in the game</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put anything else on my sensitive lips and eyes when my eczema affects my skin. :)</li>
            <li> This product is very similar to Vaseline, but in a handy size to take with you on the go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see a big difference.</li>
            <li> This has become -- far and away -- my favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad there is a Subscribe &amp; Save option, as I will be getting more of this instead of cuticle oil, Carmex, and other lip stuff.</li>
            <li> Literally one treatment of this stuff right before bed</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first night, they are soft for most of the day.</li>
            <li> As someone who is always trying new beauty and skin care products, I was so surprised that my boyfriend recommended me this and that I didn&#x27;t discover this on my own sooner.</li>
            <li> Nothing else clears it up as quickly, making them smooth and soft again.</li>
            <li> It was inevitable that dryness and dehydration would get the best of me: I&#x27;m 4 months into my accutane treatment, have flown on multiple cross-country and overseas flights, and flew directly into one of the harshest winters I&#x27;ve had in five years.</li>
            <li> But this works great as a Chapstick when on the go and just want to toss it in a small purse.  </li>
            <li> These small tubes are great for sticking inside the purse, diaper bag, stroller etc.</li>
            <li> Other products have to be reapplied and don&#x27;t seem to improve my dry lips but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> It, by no means, offers a cure for the condition, but compared to all the other lotions and creams I have tried, it has worked the best so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, but very soft and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Instead, my skin is much more plump and hydrated not only right</li>
            <li> Have tried so many different products for chapped lips -</li>
            <li> at first but boy has this made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended aquaphor to me and I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve finally found something that ALWAYS works!</li>
            <li> This is my first winter in the east</li>
            <li> This is much better than their lip balm which actually irritates my lips ....</li>
            <li> so shower first then rub it in.</li>
            <li> Aquafor is gentle and effective for preventing and treating minor skin irritations, which I have a lot of because of autoimmune disease.</li>
            <li> can also use it as a first aid salve, and of course, it&#x27;s also used for baby bottoms!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also for a regular lotion in the winter when most lotions just don&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li> I buy this one for my lips because the package designed for lip application does not seem to have the same consistency and is a bit more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> When you have an open wound on your face, of all places, you are most concerned about scarring.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a big tub of this stuff but wanted a size for travel and was so pleased to find this 2 pack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a pretty greasy product, but Aquaphor works.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m consistent at using Aquaphor (which a doctor recommended to me, saying it \\&quot;wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Must have for year round happiness.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of skin-care products making miracle claims based on some \\&quot;new science\\&quot; or special ingredient.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product for sure!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, but very small</li>
            <li> The only other lip product that I&#x27;ve used that is this good is Clinique&#x27;s Super Balm --</li>
            <li> I love this product too, just ordered it to reach my total for free shipping, but no that was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;Another third party order.</li>
            <li> Works great for chapped or dry lips or dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything, and nothing works better for really dry areas than this.</li>
            <li> you have issues similar, I highly recommend this product, as it has helped my wife more than any thing else (even perscription) that she has tried.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night before bed and my lips are super soft when I wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My son gets irritated red spots on his cheeks easily (from acidic foods, etc).</li>
            <li> My son gets irritated red spots on his cheeks easily ( from acidic foods) .</li>
            <li> The larger tubes are also good for dry scabs to soften</li>
            <li> I was a little reticent since its kind of &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very convenient size-</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing but not too oily.</li>
            <li> and I found it didn&#x27;t do much for healing.</li>
            <li> I will be repurchasing and highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Intense burning let me tell you.</li>
            <li> THIS OINTMENT IS VERY VERASTILE.</li>
            <li> Some of this ointment really helps it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> , I see real progress.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor really helps my chapped lips, which I always have</li>
            <li> I liked the smaller travel size of these versus the giant tubs of it that cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> With that kind of heavy use, I can recommend for any chapped, or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> No scent or flavor, no waxy residue, no menthol or other ingredients that feel good at first but probably dont help much in the long run.  </li>
            <li> It does soothes chapped skin and might be the great one for the ones with average dry skin.</li>
            <li> The top of my hands started cracking due to the weather conditions here.</li>
            <li> I had already tried all the other brands when I found this and that day they were dramatically better.</li>
            <li> It has been below 0 where I live, and this really keeps my skin from cracking.  </li>
            <li> I tried multiple chapsticks but this is the only thing that was able to help.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very nice emollient - thick and deeply moisturizing</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully &amp; highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by a friend</li>
            <li> I also like that it gives me a little bit of a shine, more so than Chapstick.</li>
            <li> I love the little tubes of Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li> I use Aquaphor on my tattoos, particularly brand new tattoos.</li>
            <li> Best chapstick - the only thing that won&#x27;t make your lips addicted and actually works to heal chapped lips every time.</li>
            <li> I have these in my car because the normal twist-tube type can melt in the summer heat and leak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside in harsh weather on a daily basis, and most of the lip balms I&#x27;ve used have been OK, but have required frequent reapplications in order to protect my lips.  </li>
            <li> Another thing was the top of the tube which is not very comfortable to put the balm on lip and need to be allocated with fingers, but was my mistake as it&#x27;s clearly seen from the picture.</li>
            <li> Basically, it really moisturizes, whereas most other lip products seem to mask the problem, while actually drying your lips out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very dry / chapped lips, and I&#x27;ve tried to treat them with many different balms and chapsticks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I could live without this product.</li>
            <li> This product inspires new hope for my lips, I swear.</li>
            <li> Love these little travel guys!</li>
            <li> Not exposed to direct sunlight or high temperatures</li>
            <li> Simply helps to keep my lips from becoming dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I love the small tubes because they are so portable.</li>
            <li> TO use just dab a little on your finger and tap around the corners of your eyes to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tend to dry lip skin very much and was hoping to reduce the frequency of using lip balsam during the day though it&#x27;s very much the same as others.</li>
            <li> I love these little guys!!</li>
            <li> The only method that really works for me is the old \\&quot;barrier</li>
            <li> and I woke up completely healed.</li>
            <li> makes skin soft and greaseless...</li>
            <li> I use this product on my four year old&#x27;s chapped skin--</li>
            <li> I love these travel sizes - they will actually last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough for a baby as well!</li>
            <li> Too masculine for balm, son uses this for chapped lips and hand callouses.</li>
            <li> All it seems to be is a souped up version of the old fashioned petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> far as the product I already knew of Aquaphor as I was given it in the Doctor&#x27;s office when I was undergoing&lt;br /&gt;radiation treatment for treating the burned areas of my chest.</li>
            <li> It has kept me looking young for years.  </li>
            <li> I use this at night and in the morning they are so soft.</li>
            <li> CVS charges five dollar per tube for this item and it is much superior to any other lip balm and works well for scratches and other minor injuries to promote healing.</li>
            <li> this is good for traveling only b/c they only give you two very small travel size tubes.  </li>
            <li> Love it for small burns especially the ones I get from my curling iron.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry cracking/spitting skin during cold winters.</li>
            <li> and i noticed instant relief in the mornings and after three nights use i am almost back to normal!!</li>
            <li> It inflates my tiny lips to normal size.</li>
            <li> This cream hasn&#x27;t been a fast &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream, but it has slowly been healing the cracks and cuts in her hands, and helping to smooth them at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It is odorless, tasteless, and won&#x27;t have you perpetually going back for more and more lip balms.</li>
            <li> The winter causes me very chapped and dry lips.</li>
            <li> No balm or gloss ever really worked for my perpetually dry lips.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use this on my elbows and dry patches on my face and it really helps the cracking and dryness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Sephora junkie, spending an embarrassingly large amount of our disposable income chasing products that make a bunch of empty promises.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people rave about this product when they could save so much money by using petroleum jelly which you can also buy in small tubes for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> After the second night, cracks are almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> Found it much cheaper in generic version at my local drugstore, will stick with that in the future.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky though, so be careful about getting it on things if you can&#x27;t wash them.</li>
            <li> Met my needs for a portable tube of Aquaphor, but kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product - I use it after every diaper change &amp; just apply a thin layer to help prevent any diaper rash or irritation.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccommend this for any dry skin.  </li>
            <li> 12 YR OLD DAUGHTER AND 6 YR OLD SON USE IT ON THEIR DRY LIPS....</li>
            <li> I spent money on a wide variety of products to soothe my super sore chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference between this and plain old Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> only real downside to this is that it&#x27;s extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> I could barely eat at one point because every time I ate I tore open the sides of my mouth again.</li>
            <li> My lips get super dry year round</li>
            <li> If you are someone who, like me, has a tendency toward dry lips and uses a lip balm frequently, give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li> I am frequently applying lotion and balm to my sensitive dry skin, and I am definitely going to add this to my dry skin arsenal.</li>
            <li> It has a few other &amp;#34;inactive ingredients&amp;#34; and isn&#x27;t as greasy but not anything special in my view</li>
            <li> I keep these little ones in my purse and my daughter&#x27;s backpack because her face and hands get really chapped in the winter.  </li>
            <li> The other ingredients appear to be mostly things to change the consistency and make matters a little less greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know any other product that would save and heal my dry skin so fast and so well.</li>
            <li> He has Eczema and often scratches his skin raw, so I like to have a little tube available to put some on his wrists and feet.</li>
            <li> and I never expected such dry skin!  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t burn his sensitive skin as other products do.</li>
            <li> It is slightly greasy so be careful of that, but you don&#x27;t have to use much at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference at all between this more expensive product and plain old petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Cures dry and chapped lips instantly.</li>
            <li> The package says you can use it on dry skin anywhere on your body; but I&#x27;ve only used it on my lips.  </li>
            <li> Aquaphor instantly plumps up my lips and gets rid of that dry, crackly feeling.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin from a medical condition.</li>
            <li> This is the only ointment I can use on dry, peeling lips in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li> The reason petroleum jelly works is simple: it&#x27;s watertight, meaning your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m off on a work injury, but my hands still get red and dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> Im on accutane, the only thing that works for my dry lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that nearly all of them are useless for dry skin (I have a mild case of eczema on my hands).</li>
            <li> After using this for a few days they are now squishy and soft as they should be!</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips, and this is the only thing that works for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like petroleum jelly, but without the bad smell and greasy</li>
            <li> Id put lotion on all day long to no avail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor annoyance but one nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I use it on my lips all day long and then use Dr. Dan&#x27;s Cortibalm at night.  </li>
            <li> Totally sooths dry cracked lips!!</li>
            <li> When I use this product, my lips get baby soft and the dry, dead skin comes off.  </li>
            <li> I kept using Burt&#x27;s Bees (which actually dries out any skin it touches other than your lips), moisturizers, etc.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has relieved my lips during the extreme dryness they have..</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, but a relative&#x27;s husband had very bad skin cancer and used this product exclusively by prescription before it was available over the counter.</li>
            <li> My lips are always dry</li>
            <li> It works on anything -- skin blemishes, skin irritation, dry skin, anything.</li>
            <li> I was given this by a dermatologist after going in for a recurring dry spot on my lip.</li>
            <li> I use it every day now and have never had the dry spot return.</li>
            <li> My lips were soo.. chapped &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> The inside of my nose and my lips and the sides of my mouth were all dry, cracked, and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suffering from dry lips and this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I use it on any sore, rash, cut, scrape or dry skin I have.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine using it except on just the really dry spots like heels and cuticles.</li>
            <li> It works so well for chapped or dry skin/lips.</li>
            <li> My son and wife both suffer from dry skin - particularly dry lips - and</li>
            <li> However, after those balms wore off, my lips would still be dry and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So I jotted down the brand name seached the net</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful because I know what a nuisance dry, cracked lips can be!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much bigger and it&#x27;ll cost less.</li>
            <li> I also like the small size because if it&#x27;s cold out I can easily warm it in my hands to get it out.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in such a small size here locally at the stores.</li>
            <li> By the end of the winter season, my hands/fingers are very dry and the skin cracks a bit.  </li>
            <li> so I try anything for my very dry skin....</li>
            <li> Bitter cold and running the stove definitely dries out the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, especially in the winter, I need to reapply a little dab after lunch.  </li>
            <li> Okay, the product isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s being sold in the smallest imaginable containers.</li>
            <li> I only have to apply this every few hours.</li>
            <li> Did not feel as I expected.</li>
            <li> This year winter has been rough here.</li>
            <li> This is partially due to allergic reactions, partially due to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate and work in the hospital as a physical therapist, so i am constantly washing my hands, in and out of the pool, and wearing latex gloves.</li>
            <li> That being said a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry skin and it just made my skin a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> The product couldn&#x27;t be better for cracked lips though I am disappointed in the design of the applicator.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor was specifically named by my dermatologist over all other lip balms while I was on accutane.</li>
            <li> Still need to try other purpose.</li>
            <li> It hydrates so well and doesn&#x27;t just evaporate off my lips like any other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with chap stick in the past and having allergic-type reactions and this was the only product that healed my lips.  </li>
            <li> There is a larger tube that I would recommend for carrying in a purse because these tiny ones are expensive for the amount of product and they are the sample size that my dermatologist gives out, but I bought these anyway because they are such a convenient size.</li>
            <li> the odor is not obnoxious like other winter lip treatments.  </li>
            <li> My wife has extremely cracked/irritated skin on her hands.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this on recommendations from Reddit and other communities in discussions about allergy reactions and split</li>
            <li> Saw this on a health show touting its benefits and superiority to other ointments.  </li>
            <li> This version seems a little dry.</li>
            <li> I really hate using cuticle oil at work and hand lotion doesn&#x27;t cut it; Aquaphor isn&#x27;t oily like Carmex, heavy like plain petroleum jelly, or messy to apply and gets absorbed rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I had tried straight Vaseline (petrolatum) and various types of Blistex, but the results were disappointing.</li>
            <li> In the morning, sometimes (if I haven&#x27;t used it in the last few days), I&#x27;ll do that exfoliating trick of running my toothbrush over my lips, to take off the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and when dry seasons and/or allergy seasons it gets worse and breaks out especially my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does seem to work but its not worth the expense and it is not an all over cream.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff lasts a very long time, I think she usually loses the tube even before it is empty A++++</li>
            <li> Hands down.  </li>
            <li> A bit expensive for what really is thick Vaseline, but I guess part of that ensures it&#x27;s got no dangerous impurities.</li>
            <li> Chose the small size since its pretty expensive, just in case</li>
            <li> and -- no more dry skin!</li>
            <li> , Aquaphor is about half petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d heard about this lip balm being something of a &amp;#34;cult favorite&amp;#34; secret weapon, and after using it for a few weeks, I completely agree.  </li>
            <li> It works but is a little greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> got a little Aquaphor sample from my dermatologist and it worked well</li>
            <li> I stash them in the diaper bag, medicine bag, daycare, and in my little guys room.  </li>
            <li> Then I reapply a little dab.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Both the inside of my nose and the sides of my mouth healed up within a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They would help for a few hours and then wear off and end up almost drier than before.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my allergist, since he noticed that my lips were dried and cracked.</li>
            <li> My lips were chronically  chapped for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Heals within a few days.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to have a few to take along in my diaper bag.  </li>
            <li> Kept my lips moisturized during the harsh Canadian winter</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper given how small the tubes are.</li>
            <li> The price tag is a little expensive for the tiny tubes you receive, but it is the price you pay for convenience.</li>
            <li> The Aquaphor product is greasy and sticky, and not very nice to touch, which is a problem for a hand cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they still make</li>
            <li> This product cured my hands in two days, no more cracks, no more pain.</li>
            <li> One day at work I forgot my usual moisturizer and had a sample of this from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> No more cracked lips and</li>
            <li> USE THIS ON MY 5 YEAR OLD SON, WHO SUFFERS FROM EZCEMA</li>
            <li> This one cannot leak past the cap.</li>
            <li> My usual EOS balm brought me to tears after it stung my lips.  </li>
            <li> (dang harsh winter winds!), or lip gloss when in a jam</li>
            <li> The price is a little ridiculous for something that&#x27;s a close cousin to Vaseline, but goodness, I was desperate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ordinary Vaseline with its common feathers.</li>
            <li> If you have a dog with a dry, crusty-looking nose,(some breeds tend toward this, like bulldogs-) apply this every day and within a few days the difference will be startling!</li>
            <li> Have used this product as a skin soother for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> it does the job, even if it is incredibly thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t go a day without using it at least at bedtime.</li>
            <li> The only thing that got rid of a nasty dry patch on my elbow!  </li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s cheeks were so HARD you could tap on them!</li>
            <li> No more peeling or cracks!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all.</li>
            <li> They are as big/small as a lipstick and just as thick, so needless to say there is not a lot of Aquaphor in there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably addicted to this stuff, it&#x27;s a must have wherever I am.</li>
            <li> Just put on a thin layer immediately after bathing or washing to create that barrier</li>
            <li> and I have tried everything from Chapstick to Burt&#x27;s Bees to expensive &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As a lotion I was not impressed, it is too greasy</li>
            <li> Winter use is a bit difficult though until the product heats up.</li>
            <li> And the product is the only one I can use on my terribly allergic lips.</li>
            <li> No reason to pay for expensive lip products.</li>
            <li> These are too expensive for what they are--convenient petroleum jelly tubes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s about five times as expensive as one of these tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lips were dry, cracked, and bleeding horribly.  </li>
            <li> I was on a heavy dose of accutane for 6 months during the winter and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> Fixes my severely chapped lips (and nose, when I have a bad cold) overnight, like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A miracle for badly chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have chapped lips often, but when I do they crack, bleed, and are painful.</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed - size of the product and shipping cost</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I keep these little ones in my purse and my daughter&#x27;s backpack because her face and hands get really chapped in the winter.  I put this on to keep her skin from getting windburn in the winter and fall.  It also heals her chapped skin overnight and she doesn&#x27;t cry that it hurts her skin, like with products that have fragrance, etc., in them.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love these little travel guys! I keep one in my purse and one in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nice size for my purse.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and in good working order. It was a good value for the money at time of purchase as well. I liked the smaller travel size of these versus the giant tubs of it that cost a fortune. That being said a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t have chapped lips often, but when I do they crack, bleed, and are painful. Literally one treatment of this stuff right before bed and I woke up completely healed. It is odorless, tasteless, and won&#x27;t have you perpetually going back for more and more lip balms. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the stuff you want for your lips/sensitive skin. It&#x27;s way better than chapstick.</li>
            <li> This ointment saved my hands. I live in a cold climate and work in the hospital as a physical therapist, so i am constantly washing my hands, in and out of the pool, and wearing latex gloves. Id put lotion on all day long to no avail. I started using this on my hands at night and i noticed instant relief in the mornings and after three nights use i am almost back to normal!!</li>
            <li> very nice emollient - thick and deeply moisturizing</li>
            <li> Fixes my severely chapped lips (and nose, when I have a bad cold) overnight, like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first night, they are soft for most of the day. After the second night, cracks are almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of aquaphor. I use it on my boys&#x27;s cheeks ever night! They have chubby cheeks that get chapped easily!</li>
            <li> Great product. Moisturizes without leaving hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Handy size for pocket.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading multiple reviews on skin care sites.  The product couldn&#x27;t be better for cracked lips though I am disappointed in the design of the applicator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my lip.</li>
            <li> My lips love it and so do my feet</li>
            <li> easy to carry for anytime to use.</li>
            <li> Great for dry chapped lips and skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for problem areas on my grandson&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference between this and plain old Vaseline.  It works but is a little greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> Very convenient size- I have one in my purse at all times</li>
            <li> great size for your pocket or purse</li>
            <li> this is good for traveling only b/c they only give you two very small travel size tubes.  they are as big as the size of the hotel toothpaste tubes.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Cures dry and chapped lips instantly.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I use as &amp;#34;Chapstick&amp;#34; on my lips, it&#x27;s so wonderful. I don&#x27;t know how I could live without this product. I love the size, it fits just about anywhere &amp; you get 2 in the box. It&#x27;s like a bonus! I used to use the big tube, which was nice because it never ran out but it was cumbersome to carry in my purse. I love these little guys!! One for home, one to go :)</li>
            <li> Holy Grail of lip products, and I own about a gazillion different ones.</li>
            <li> WORKS WONDERS ON CRACKED SKIN</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional deal compared to CVS on this product. CVS charges five dollar per tube for this item and it is much superior to any other lip balm and works well for scratches and other minor injuries to promote healing. Aquaphor was specifically named by my dermatologist over all other lip balms while I was on accutane.</li>
            <li> I like the size and the price.  I carry it with me wherever I go.</li>
            <li> Recommended by others so I bought it in case I am scalded.  Still need to try other purpose.</li>
            <li> makes skin soft and greaseless...love it</li>
            <li> These are so much better than the Aquaphor lip therapy stuff, it&#x27;s absurd.  I&#x27;m not sure why they still make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy the lip stuff.  Buy these!  They&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li> These are great for outdoor activity as caps rarely unscrew in pockets compared with lip gel sticks. A bit expensive for what really is thick Vaseline, but I guess part of that ensures it&#x27;s got no dangerous impurities.</li>
            <li> Have tried so many different products for chapped lips - I have chapped lips all year around. Saw this as recommend product for chapped from a yahoo article and decided to give it a try. This actually works!!!</li>
            <li> I have had problems with chapped lips for around 5 months and the first day I used this ointment I have had smooth lips ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Also it lasts for hours!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will get the big jar sooner or later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars *****</li>
            <li> Was in the chat room on QVC&#x27;s community beauty topics and one of the topics was what is the best lip chap stick.  And magically there were at leat six (6) people referring to Aquaphor healing ointment.  So I jotted down the brand name seached the net and I found it here at Amazon. I have cracked , sore chapped lips.  Much better than any chap lip stick you can buy.  People suggested at the QVC Community to use it on elbows and heels of feet.    Haven&#x27;t attempted feet yet but I will definitely be a returning buyer.</li>
            <li> This has been a wonder product for winter. My lips are always dry and I use this at night when I take my makeup off and before bed.</li>
            <li> Met my needs for a portable tube of Aquaphor, but kind of expensive. Found it much cheaper in generic version at my local drugstore, will stick with that in the future.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel!  Never leave the US without it and of course your AMEX card.</li>
            <li> I moved to Minnesota four months ago. The top of my hands started cracking due to the weather conditions here. I tried many lotions and none worked. Until I found Aquaphor. This product cured my hands in two days, no more cracks, no more pain. Now I use it everyday. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li> Having used the Aquaphor product for a couple of weeks during the winter of 2014, I can say the product is okay. However, it does not produce the same good results as Neutrogena Hand Cream (Amazon has it). The Aquaphor product is greasy and sticky, and not very nice to touch, which is a problem for a hand cream. If you are a Neutogena user, do not bother. If you have never used either product, this may be the product for you. I am going back to the Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Fixes my cracked lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, these are chap-stick sized tubes, not hand-cream sized.  (I was expecting something bigger!)  If you&#x27;re looking for terrific lip balm, this seems to be it.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time for severely chapped lips. Love this product and will never use Chapstick again!</li>
            <li> Very good for dry cracking/spitting skin during cold winters.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, but a relative&#x27;s husband had very bad skin cancer and used this product exclusively by prescription before it was available over the counter. With the consistency of Vaseline, you don&#x27;t want to wear it out; use it at home or at night. It works on anything -- skin blemishes, skin irritation, dry skin, anything. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Sephora junkie, spending an embarrassingly large amount of our disposable income chasing products that make a bunch of empty promises. I got a facial chemical peel recently and started peeling so I started researching the best moisturizer to help the process. A couple of postings and various message boards called this out as best moisturizer they had ever used. I was a little reticent since its kind of &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; at first but boy has this made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all. Instead, my skin is much more plump and hydrated not only right after I use it but through the end of the day, which is something I&#x27;ve always struggled with. Best of all, it&#x27;s CHEAP.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST lip balm I have ever used.  Thank God I finally found it.  My lips get super dry year round and I have tried everything from Chapstick to Burt&#x27;s Bees to expensive &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; fixes and this is the only thing that helped.  The package says you can use it on dry skin anywhere on your body; but I&#x27;ve only used it on my lips.  I apply it at night before bed and my lips are super soft when I wake up in the morning.  No more peeling or cracks!!</li>
            <li> Totally sooths dry cracked lips!! I spent money on a wide variety of products to soothe my super sore chapped lips. This was the ONLY product that worked that didn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, no mess, perfect travel size ointment for my lips or ashy part of my body. Better then vaseline.</li>
            <li> I was given this by a dermatologist after going in for a recurring dry spot on my lip. I tried all types of different chapsticks thinking I was possibly allergic to whatever ingredient was in them. Whatever the case was, this worked within days. I use it every day now and have never had the dry spot return. And if you accidentally send it through the wash and dryer, it won&#x27;t melt and you can still use it. Plus guys, it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re putting on lipstick.</li>
            <li> My lips were soo.. chapped &amp; dry. I tried every lip balm, moisturizer, ointment. This is the only product that works. Will buy again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor to go!  Great idea.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my four year old&#x27;s chapped skin-- it does the job, even if it is incredibly thick and greasy.  However, it seems to be the only thing that works for him and it doesn&#x27;t burn his sensitive skin as other products do.</li>
            <li> The best &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; in the game</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> My son gets irritated red spots on his cheeks easily (from acidic foods, etc). I put this on and the red spots are gone in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love having these to put in my purse. Works great for chapped or dry lips or dry skin</li>
            <li> The winter causes me very chapped and dry lips. This product is not too greasy and definitely gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Aquaphor has been the best proactive measure I&#x27;ve taken against dry, cracked lips. It was inevitable that dryness and dehydration would get the best of me: I&#x27;m 4 months into my accutane treatment, have flown on multiple cross-country and overseas flights, and flew directly into one of the harshest winters I&#x27;ve had in five years. Before I began my treatment, I heard about Aquaphor and stocked up. Applying it continuously (as often as humanly possible) I&#x27;ve actually avoided any cracking or peeling! I&#x27;m so thankful because I know what a nuisance dry, cracked lips can be!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great. I was on a heavy dose of accutane for 6 months during the winter and it was horrible. The inside of my nose and my lips and the sides of my mouth were all dry, cracked, and bleeding. I kept using Burt&#x27;s Bees (which actually dries out any skin it touches other than your lips), moisturizers, etc. on the sides of my mouth but nothing worked. I could barely eat at one point because every time I ate I tore open the sides of my mouth again. One day at work I forgot my usual moisturizer and had a sample of this from my dermatologist. I tried it as a last resort and it was instant relief. I also swabbed it inside my nose. Both the inside of my nose and the sides of my mouth healed up within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downside to this is that it&#x27;s extremely greasy. Also if you use it on your lips and mouth, it looks like u just ate something greasy. It&#x27;s a minor annoyance but one nonetheless. Also I&#x27;ve never tried this in comparison to Vaseline, which is one of its components. I don&#x27;t know about its efficacy compared to Vaseline which is cheaper, but in any case, this works great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent lip balm, also good on cuts, scrapes, cuticles and dry skin.  A must for every purse.</li>
            <li> I have used aquaphore for years for sunburns (it works amazing on sunburn, better than aloe, but the walmart store brand works just as good, especially if you have a large sunburn and am buying in bulk). But this works great as a Chapstick when on the go and just want to toss it in a small purse.  It&#x27;s long lasting and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know any other product that would save and heal my dry skin so fast and so well. Most importantly for me is that I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to it, while being extremely sensitive to skin care products. So glad it also comes in a &amp;#34;to-go&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> It does work well however, a bit to greasy for me and a roller ball for application would be nice as well.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended aquaphor to me and I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve finally found something that ALWAYS works! I seriously can&#x27;t go a day without using it at least at bedtime. Very moisturizing but not too oily. I also like that it gives me a little bit of a shine, more so than Chapstick.</li>
            <li> Great product, but very small</li>
            <li> not only is this great for skin conditions, but if you have a new tattoo it is amazing for the healing process! Put it on morning I got tattoo and most people didn&#x27;t know it was a new tattoo when they saw it, it took all the redness away</li>
            <li> great for lips when on acutane</li>
            <li> Used it for the winter</li>
            <li> No balm or gloss ever really worked for my perpetually dry lips. They would help for a few hours and then wear off and end up almost drier than before. But not Aquaphor! This product inspires new hope for my lips, I swear. It hydrates so well and doesn&#x27;t just evaporate off my lips like any other products I&#x27;ve tried. I might have to just start buying this by the tub.</li>
            <li> Good, I use it as gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lip moisturizer products and this one is far and away the best. No scent or flavor, no waxy residue, no menthol or other ingredients that feel good at first but probably dont help much in the long run.  Simply helps to keep my lips from becoming dry and cracked.  If you are someone who, like me, has a tendency toward dry lips and uses a lip balm frequently, give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my allergist, since he noticed that my lips were dried and cracked. Aquaphor instantly plumps up my lips and gets rid of that dry, crackly feeling. It inflates my tiny lips to normal size. I always carry it in my purse. It is very sticky though, so be careful about getting it on things if you can&#x27;t wash them.</li>
            <li> I use this as a lip protectant and for that it is perfect. As a lotion I was not impressed, it is too greasy and I found it didn&#x27;t do much for healing.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended for lips and now I don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> This is my first winter in the east and I never expected such dry skin!  My lips were dry, cracked, and bleeding horribly.  I tried multiple chapsticks but this is the only thing that was able to help.  I use this every night before bed and my lips are completely better.</li>
            <li> Best chapstick - the only thing that won&#x27;t make your lips addicted and actually works to heal chapped lips every time.</li>
            <li> Eh. I know this works for most people, but this literally just didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry skin and it just made my skin a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> recommended by my wife&#x27;s dermatologist, worked well for her.</li>
            <li> this stuff is now my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> The only chap stick I use.  I have had issues with chap stick in the past and having allergic-type reactions and this was the only product that healed my lips.  I tried antibiotics, prescribed chap stick, all sorts of things and this is the only thing that worked.</li>
            <li> Okay, the product isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s being sold in the smallest imaginable containers. Go to your nearest drugstore and get them. They&#x27;re much bigger and it&#x27;ll cost less.</li>
            <li> I recently became allergic to chapstic and now this is the only thing I can use. Moisturizes lips amazingly well. I used to have to apply chapstic every 30-60 minutes. I only have to apply this every few hours.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful healing ointment and reduces scaring</li>
            <li> Good product, but I was thinking we were going to get a hand lotion versus a lip balm.  I recommend spending more time reading the details versus assuming what you may be buying.</li>
            <li> As someone who is always trying new beauty and skin care products, I was so surprised that my boyfriend recommended me this and that I didn&#x27;t discover this on my own sooner. I am frequently applying lotion and balm to my sensitive dry skin, and I am definitely going to add this to my dry skin arsenal. I use this regularly on both my lips and cuticles. I have found that the texture of my lips has actually improved greatly: if I miss one night without Aquaphor, I will wake up with scaly lips. I really hate using cuticle oil at work and hand lotion doesn&#x27;t cut it; Aquaphor isn&#x27;t oily like Carmex, heavy like plain petroleum jelly, or messy to apply and gets absorbed rather quickly. I&#x27;m glad there is a Subscribe &amp; Save option, as I will be getting more of this instead of cuticle oil, Carmex, and other lip stuff. For around $5 for the 2 pack, it is a bit pricy for 0.7 oz of product, but I can&#x27;t deny the quality. I will be repurchasing and highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Can&#x27;t get it here in Australia so had to order online.  Thought I&#x27;d give it go after reading all the excellent reviews, and I must concur - this is great.  I love these travel sizes - they will actually last a long, long time.  I think I will purchase the larger tubes when the time comes.</li>
            <li> This beats Carmex, EOS, Vaseline, Blistex, ChapStick.. You name it. My lips were chronically  chapped for a few weeks and then I went to windy San Francisco and they about fell off my face. Intense burning let me tell you. I had already tried all the other brands when I found this and that day they were dramatically better. Now I put it on every morning after I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great for dry skin, the tubes are a perfect size, very  small and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> Have used this product as a skin soother for at least 20 years. Excellent.</li>
            <li> love Aquaphor for lips! I&#x27;ve always used it for my kids &amp; myself! anytime our lps are chapped- apply this at night or during the day &amp; it makes everything better!!  sooths burning chapped lips too!!  it&#x27;s the only thing we use for chapped lips!!</li>
            <li> This tubes are .35 ounces. I thought they were 3.5 ounces. The add makes them look large and they are the size of chapstick!!! Buy the jar it is a much better value!!!</li>
            <li> I love Aquaphor and this is the right size for tucking into a cocktail purse or coat pocket.  There is a larger tube that I would recommend for carrying in a purse because these tiny ones are expensive for the amount of product and they are the sample size that my dermatologist gives out, but I bought these anyway because they are such a convenient size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE any inanimate object but I do LIKE this one. The larger tubes are also good for dry scabs to soften</li>
            <li> Love this ointment. I&#x27;m suffering from dry lips and this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> These small tubes are great for sticking inside the purse, diaper bag, stroller etc. it is great for baby&#x27;s face for winter time and for putting it on chapped lips. Never had any problems with skin breakout or rash from this product. Gentle enough for a baby as well! Maybe too oily for summer time though. I wish it was a little cheaper given how small the tubes are.</li>
            <li> Hands down.  I can&#x27;t put anything else on my sensitive lips and eyes when my eczema affects my skin. :)</li>
            <li> Must have for year round happiness. This is great for hands, feet, mouth, lips, face. I cannot get enough. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Loved the idea of handy Aquaphor, but man, these tubes are tiny. They are as big/small as a lipstick and just as thick, so needless to say there is not a lot of Aquaphor in there. The size is perfect for little dabs here and there, but if you think you might want to slather every once in a while, then this is not the right size for you.</li>
            <li> Best protection for your lips</li>
            <li> Saved my daughters lips</li>
            <li> This works better than carmex or chapstick. I keep one in my car and another one beside my bed. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin from a medical condition. Aquaphor is very gentle yet exceptionally effective. I use it after I shower and at bedtime. My skin looks better. More importantly Aquaphor has made my skin feel better and reduced the discomfort caused by cracked, dry skin. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can put on my lips. For some reason all chapsticks make my lips burn and turn red. This ointment works great for keeping my lips moist and soft. It works quickly. Also convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li> Great to have for the winter</li>
            <li> My son gets irritated red spots on his cheeks easily ( from acidic foods) . I put this on and the red spots are gone in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with both service and product.  This product was needed quickly and the supplier more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The only thing that got rid of a nasty dry patch on my elbow!  Nothing else worked.. Highly reccommend this for any dry skin.  Hands, etc...</li>
            <li> Love Aquaphor!  These are great to keep in your purse.  LOVE~</li>
            <li> The best stuff out there. I use it on any sore, rash, cut, scrape or dry skin I have. Heals within a few days.</li>
            <li> I use it as a lip balm. This is much better than their lip balm which actually irritates my lips ....</li>
            <li> This Aquaphor is the best for dry cracked lips.  I only have to use it once or twice a day and my lips feel great.  Other products have to be reapplied and don&#x27;t seem to improve my dry lips but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff lasts a very long time, I think she usually loses the tube even before it is empty A++++</li>
            <li> If you have a dog with a dry, crusty-looking nose,(some breeds tend toward this, like bulldogs-) apply this every day and within a few days the difference will be startling!</li>
            <li> Good size for good product</li>
            <li> During winter, I keep these in every pocket, drawer or car cup holder I can find.  No more cracked lips and the odor is not obnoxious like other winter lip treatments.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way!</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s chapped lips before bed and they are much better in the morning! She has food allergies and has flared up with chapsticks and flavored balms, but no problems at all with the Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ordinary Vaseline with its common feathers. Nothing special. I&#x27;m tend to dry lip skin very much and was hoping to reduce the frequency of using lip balsam during the day though it&#x27;s very much the same as others. It does soothes chapped skin and might be the great one for the ones with average dry skin. Another thing was the top of the tube which is not very comfortable to put the balm on lip and need to be allocated with fingers, but was my mistake as it&#x27;s clearly seen from the picture. Though this product has the one with more comfortable top as well.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS FOR BASICALLY EVERYONE IN MY HOUSEHOLD....  I USE THIS ON MY CRACKED HEEL, WHICH I GET FROM WEARING FLIP FLOPS....AND I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I USE THIS ON MY 5 YEAR OLD SON, WHO SUFFERS FROM EZCEMA AND IT WORKS WELL ON HIM....&lt;br /&gt;MY 12 YR OLD DAUGHTER AND 6 YR OLD SON USE IT ON THEIR DRY LIPS....&lt;br /&gt;SO AS YOU CAN SEE.... THIS OINTMENT IS VERY VERASTILE.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine suggested I get some of this (although I cannot remember why now) and I decided to try it. I am a big fan of Neosporin (and I do still like it) but tried this.  I now keep a supply of both.  By the end of the winter season, my hands/fingers are very dry and the skin cracks a bit.  Some of this ointment really helps it.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has relieved my lips during the extreme dryness they have..without it my lips crack and bleed all winter.</li>
            <li> This product works well. I have these in my car because the normal twist-tube type can melt in the summer heat and leak. This one cannot leak past the cap. Winter use is a bit difficult though until the product heats up.</li>
            <li> Too masculine for balm, son uses this for chapped lips and hand callouses. Works great after shower to prevent hand tears from rings and high-bar in men&#x27;s gymnastics. With that kind of heavy use, I can recommend for any chapped, or irritated skin. Works best to seal in moisture so shower first then rub it in.</li>
            <li> Very good healing ointment, had many problems with hand and foot syndrome due to chemo</li>
            <li> Did not feel as I expected. Not something I would use again.</li>
            <li> i kept one and gave one to my daughter this winter weather won&#x27;t chap our lips or skin</li>
            <li> My wife has extremely cracked/irritated skin on her hands.  This is partially due to allergic reactions, partially due to dry skin.  In any case, she&#x27;s tried multiple creams/lotions, to no avail.  They soothe her hands, but don&#x27;t do anything to remedy the issue (even Lubriderm medicated, hypoallergenic antibiotic creams, etc.).  This cream hasn&#x27;t been a fast &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream, but it has slowly been healing the cracks and cuts in her hands, and helping to smooth them at the same time.  I purchased this on recommendations from Reddit and other communities in discussions about allergy reactions and split/cut skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have issues similar, I highly recommend this product, as it has helped my wife more than any thing else (even perscription) that she has tried.</li>
            <li> I like this to keep in my pocket. I&#x27;ve come to love aquaphor on my lips better than their lip stuff, which I used to love.  I also like the small size because if it&#x27;s cold out I can easily warm it in my hands to get it out. I wish I could buy these in 10 packs.</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s cheeks were so HARD you could tap on them! After using this for a few days they are now squishy and soft as they should be!</li>
            <li> Saw this on a health show touting its benefits and superiority to other ointments.  Chose the small size since its pretty expensive, just in case I didn&#x27;t like it.  Glad I did.  All it seems to be is a souped up version of the old fashioned petroleum jelly.  It has a few other &amp;#34;inactive ingredients&amp;#34; and isn&#x27;t as greasy but not anything special in my view and I can&#x27;t imagine using it except on just the really dry spots like heels and cuticles. It does seem to work but its not worth the expense and it is not an all over cream.</li>
            <li> Great, cheap and effective lip moisturizer. At this price, I keep one hand in my car, on my nightstand, in my purse, in my backpack. Great stuff, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened when I started running but my lips started to hurt and crack severely recently and Aquaphor is the only thing that helps.  My usual EOS balm brought me to tears after it stung my lips.  Aquaphor is the best and it&#x27;s easy to keep these in your pockets when you run or in every purse/wallet.</li>
            <li> I s/d buy the baby version. This version seems a little dry. Baby version is much better.</li>
            <li> I love this product too, just ordered it to reach my total for free shipping, but no that was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;Another third party order. I learn more with each order.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product I already knew of Aquaphor as I was given it in the Doctor&#x27;s office when I was undergoing&lt;br /&gt;radiation treatment for treating the burned areas of my chest. A great product and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Many Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Louise</li>
            <li> use on chapped lips/skin a couple times a day, for a day or so and -- no more dry skin! yah!!</li>
            <li> smallest tubes of aquaphor ever.</li>
            <li> Love the ability to subscribe to something like this and it arrives periodically without having to go to the store.  Great idea.  And the product is the only one I can use on my terribly allergic lips.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd order of Aquaphor from Amazon.  I am currently taking Accutane and this has been a lifesaver!  I use it on my lips all day long and then use Dr. Dan&#x27;s Cortibalm at night.  I sometimes use this on my elbows and dry patches on my face and it really helps the cracking and dryness.  I have tried every lip product out there and this is the best for me.</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed - size of the product and shipping cost</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product - I use it after every diaper change &amp; just apply a thin layer to help prevent any diaper rash or irritation.  It works wonderfully &amp; highly recommend it.  I keep a big tub of it next to the changing table &amp; use these to carry in the diaper bag.  My daughters skin is very sensitive so this is great for keeping her skin protected from any irritation.</li>
            <li> Aquafor is gentle and effective for preventing and treating minor skin irritations, which I have a lot of because of autoimmune disease.</li>
            <li> No skin cracks this winter. This stuff really does what it says it will do. Be sure to use it before you go to Europe in case the gentlemen there still kiss ladies&#x27; hands.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried Aquaphor, this is a great way to sample it.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s kind of like petroleum jelly, but without the bad smell and greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;I can use this on my cuticles, and overnight they are soft.&lt;br /&gt;I can use on my feet and same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Great for lips too.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it as a first aid salve, and of course, it&#x27;s also used for baby bottoms!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, you will love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted to try the item before committing to the huge tub.  I also wanted to have a few to take along in my diaper bag.  This product is great for babies with eczema.  It, by no means, offers a cure for the condition, but compared to all the other lotions and creams I have tried, it has worked the best so far.  The price tag is a little expensive for the tiny tubes you receive, but it is the price you pay for convenience.</li>
            <li> I use Aquaphor on my tattoos, particularly brand new tattoos. Also for a regular lotion in the winter when most lotions just don&#x27;t cut it (dang harsh winter winds!), or lip gloss when in a jam and I don&#x27;t have anything else. It is slightly greasy so be careful of that, but you don&#x27;t have to use much at all. Honestly one of the best things out there to use on tattoos besides Tattoo Goo!!! A little goes a long way with this product for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips, and this is the only thing that works for me. I put it on every night, and it stays on and heals and protects from cracking and peeling. It&#x27;s not sticky, but very soft and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> The best product for my lips!!</li>
            <li> Kept my lips moisturized during the harsh Canadian winter</li>
            <li> my husband was burned several years ago and has to constantly put something on his lips several times a day.  he tried lots of things and this one works the best for him.</li>
            <li> GREAT stuff. I buy this one for my lips because the package designed for lip application does not seem to have the same consistency and is a bit more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Best skin product available!</li>
            <li> When you have an open wound on your face, of all places, you are most concerned about scarring. I read that keeping a wound moist is the best way to prevent scarring. Many reviewers spoke of its efficacy so I&#x27;ve tried it. My only wish is that it remained moist overnight.</li>
            <li> Love the use of this product and size!</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and when dry seasons and/or allergy seasons it gets worse and breaks out especially my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I got a little Aquaphor sample from my dermatologist and it worked well so I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;It is greasy...so I apply it when I watch TV after dinner and rubbed into...and apply it before go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Also I carry in my purse when I go out.</li>
            <li> This is my go to medicine for most things that ail me.  Love it for small burns especially the ones I get from my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably addicted to this stuff, it&#x27;s a must have wherever I am. Product does the job without any irritation that I&#x27;ve experienced with other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything, and nothing works better for really dry areas than this. It&#x27;s far superior to straight petroleum jelly and it absorbs well and quickly into skin. A miracle for badly chapped lips. Truly has zero taste or fragrance. I even use this on my cat, who gets a chapped nose in winter, and she doesn&#x27;t seem to detect any kind of objectionable odor, either.</li>
            <li> I use Aquaphor as lip balm/gloss and it is the best! So smooth, nice shine, and moisturizes. No reason to pay for expensive lip products. I love the small tubes because they are so portable.</li>
            <li> This is the only ointment I can use on dry, peeling lips in the wintertime.  Nothing else clears it up as quickly, making them smooth and soft again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference at all between this more expensive product and plain old petroleum jelly. I know there are additional ingredients but it&#x27;s the petroleum jelly that makes it work for me. These are too expensive for what they are--convenient petroleum jelly tubes. I don&#x27;t understand why people rave about this product when they could save so much money by using petroleum jelly which you can also buy in small tubes for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I Thing by Now every know about the Miracle Ointment (AQUAPHOR) it is the best,just try it,if you did not yet.</li>
            <li> Not exposed to direct sunlight or high temperatures</li>
            <li> Great price.Given out at hospital.  Cheaper then Walmart.</li>
            <li> I love the little tubes of Aquaphor.  I stash them in the diaper bag, medicine bag, daycare, and in my little guys room.  He has Eczema and often scratches his skin raw, so I like to have a little tube available to put some on his wrists and feet.</li>
            <li> This is my go to every night for moisture around my eyes.  I have yet to find any product out there that can lock in moisture the way Aquaphor does.  TO use just dab a little on your finger and tap around the corners of your eyes to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  It has kept me looking young for years.  Yes I do spend money on Quality products, but this is my go to cheap product that gets the job done.  Also great on the lips to reduce lines around your lips.</li>
            <li> I use it every night to moisturize my lips before I go to bed.  This helps heal my lips while I sleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside in harsh weather on a daily basis, and most of the lip balms I&#x27;ve used have been OK, but have required frequent reapplications in order to protect my lips.  The Aquaphor ointment hasn&#x27;t needed to be reapplied, goes on smoothly, and has no taste or odor.  This has been my first winter using it, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results- no chafing or cracking of my lips. I&#x27;ve also used it on my cuticles with the same satisfactory results. It&#x27;s available via the Subscribe and Save program at an affordable price. It&#x27;s a good value and an excellent quality product.</li>
            <li> I use it for just about everything...especially for chapped lips</li>
            <li> Love the size of this item. It works so well for chapped or dry skin/lips. This year winter has been rough here. Bitter cold and running the stove definitely dries out the skin quickly. I had purchased a big tub of this stuff but wanted a size for travel and was so pleased to find this 2 pack. I couldn&#x27;t find this product in such a small size here locally at the stores. I was elated to find it at Amazon and got it in two days.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of skin-care products making miracle claims based on some \\&quot;new science\\&quot; or special ingredient. I&#x27;ve found that nearly all of them are useless for dry skin (I have a mild case of eczema on my hands). The only method that really works for me is the old \\&quot;barrier method\\&quot; where I put petroleum jelly on my hands, then cover with gloves so it doesn&#x27;t smear over the bedclothes at night (ick, but it works). The reason petroleum jelly works is simple: it&#x27;s watertight, meaning your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out. and when it&#x27;s not drying out, it&#x27;s getting healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Aquaphor is about half petroleum jelly. The other ingredients appear to be mostly things to change the consistency and make matters a little less greasy. It&#x27;s still a pretty greasy product, but Aquaphor works. Just put on a thin layer immediately after bathing or washing to create that barrier and you should see results. When I&#x27;m consistent at using Aquaphor (which a doctor recommended to me, saying it \\&quot;wasn&#x27;t greasy\\&quot;), I see real progress. The price is a little ridiculous for something that&#x27;s a close cousin to Vaseline, but goodness, I was desperate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: uses barrier method to allow skin to heal, stopping dessication&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: price, somewhat greasy</li>
            <li> My son and wife both suffer from dry skin - particularly dry lips - and Aquaphor is an excellent product to aid them.  This product is very similar to Vaseline, but in a handy size to take with you on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is well designed to control the flow of the product when squeezed, but like any petroleum jelly product, it does become greasy and watery toward the end of the product life (toward the end of the tube).</li>
            <li> worked great very fast</li>
            <li> Aquaphor really helps my chapped lips, which I always have but they are even more chapped in wintertime. I had tried straight Vaseline (petrolatum) and various types of Blistex, but the results were disappointing. The pure petrolatum just sat on top of my lips and never soaked in. Two days of Aquaphor and my lips are nice and soft. I can finally wear lip color again.</li>
            <li> my dentist said this is good for dry lips...which I have and use something all the time....I honestly don&#x27;t see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Works way better on lips than the &amp;#34;lip therapy&amp;#34; version of Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> good stuff used it for years</li>
            <li> This has become -- far and away -- my favorite lip balm.  I have very dry / chapped lips, and I&#x27;ve tried to treat them with many different balms and chapsticks.  However, after those balms wore off, my lips would still be dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d heard about this lip balm being something of a &amp;#34;cult favorite&amp;#34; secret weapon, and after using it for a few weeks, I completely agree.  When I use this product, my lips get baby soft and the dry, dead skin comes off.  Basically, it really moisturizes, whereas most other lip products seem to mask the problem, while actually drying your lips out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this at bedtime.  Just a tiny dab.  In the morning, sometimes (if I haven&#x27;t used it in the last few days), I&#x27;ll do that exfoliating trick of running my toothbrush over my lips, to take off the dead skin.  Then I reapply a little dab.  After that, my lips are great -- nice and smooth, and lipstick looks good.  Sometimes, especially in the winter, I need to reapply a little dab after lunch.  But that&#x27;s it.  This product really is fantastic.  The only other lip product that I&#x27;ve used that is this good is Clinique&#x27;s Super Balm -- but it&#x27;s about five times as expensive as one of these tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND FOR CHAPPED LIPS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Aquaphor which means its amazing. Name says it all.</li>
            <li> As a nurse we use a ton of this. I&#x27;m off on a work injury, but my hands still get red and dry in the winter. I use this at night and in the morning they are so soft. This is a great product</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  It has been below 0 where I live, and this really keeps my skin from cracking.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a very good product for me.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by a friend so I try anything for my very dry skin....Maybe it will prove to be better after a fw weeks.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for purse.  I use it on everything.  Soothes and aids healing of everything from tatoos to cuts and abrasions.</li>
            <li> This ointment keeps my lips well moisturized throughout the day and night.</li>
            <li> Im on accutane, the only thing that works for my dry lips. Im in love!</li>
            <li> Only one word needed, Excellent.</li>
    </ol>
