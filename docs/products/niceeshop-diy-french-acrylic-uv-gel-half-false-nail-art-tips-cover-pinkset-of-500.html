            <li> Pretty in pink.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the clear and pink tips.</li>
            <li> they are thinner where you apply the glue so you don&#x27;t have to file them flat.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use them because the edges of it looks to big and not professional</li>

            <li> I had a few request for pink tips from my teenage clients!</li>
            <li> i spent my money on them!</li>
            <li> Took little bit to get them in the mail</li>
            <li> It was just a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the delivery was a bit slow</li>
            <li> Also, the ends that you are suppose to adhere to your cuticles are pointed and if done wrong, can damage the surrounding skin.</li>

            <li> I bought these along with the black and red tips. They are really fun and cute to wear. I love the fact that you get such a large quantity for the price. Good deal!</li>
            <li> Very Cute :) I got them for my sister and she love it the pink tips for her b-day was just so cute on her she want more cause she use them all lol</li>
            <li> When I got these I was expecting cute short nails ( like the ones sold at drugstores ) not long,  pointy, ghetto nails. I suppose I can use a nail cutter, However, that is another expense I don&#x27;t want to make. The seller shipped the item right away in neat packages. It is a good price just don&#x27;t expect wearable nail tips. Also, the ends that you are suppose to adhere to your cuticles are pointed and if done wrong, can damage the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> I like buying from them order came fast . And price was very cheap thank you</li>

I ordered the clear and pink tips. So happy with my purchase &amp;&amp; I completely recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> But they turned out to be pretty good nail tips. I did a full acrylic set on myself with these nail tips and pink acrylic powder. I&#x27;ll attach a picture to show how they turned out. They of course came square shape but I filed mine to almond. Will recommend.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of these nails because they weren&#x27;t cala nails given the fact that times are tough I didn&#x27;t expect the nails to last for more than 5 days boy was I surprised they lasted 3 weeks and I have only been doing the gelish nails gor 1 years I got great compliments from all my coworkers thanks I will be buying these again</li>
            <li> They are very whatever. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> Nice tips, wonderful color. Arrived as stated, in good condition, in individual bags. Happy with tips. Recommend if you want to do your own nails, they&#x27;re easy to use and many sizes to use. Good seller!</li>

            <li> I Gave It A 5 Star Based On The Product &amp; The Product Alone. Not On Time Or Anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**They come as shown. Same color same size.&lt;br /&gt;** So many different sizes!&lt;br /&gt;**Fits and buffers PERFECTLY!&lt;br /&gt;**So pretty to wear with acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;**Perfect smile line.&lt;br /&gt;****GREAT PRICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I WILL buy again. Only thing the time to get it was long (a month). But for less than $3 bucks its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> very durable nails and the color is very pretty and spot on. these nails are great for every day use!</li>
            <li> I had just bought them a while back but haven&#x27;t had the chance to do them since today, and let me tell you something .. these are it ! they don&#x27;t bend easily, aren&#x27;t flimsy, and they don&#x27;t snap  off if that makes any sense . these are like those nails at a salon . They are professional nail tips and are perfect !!!!! I LOVE THEM ! I had no trouble with these nail tips. Absolutely no problem . best believe I will keep ordering these ! ❤ I love how my nails look! it&#x27;s like I went to the salon and had them done (: the color pink tips fits my needs and especially for the price for them, omg! who wouldn&#x27;t get these!? i love them !! thank you!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look great I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t tried them to see if the stay on or chip off.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good buy for 4$.</li>
            <li> Took about a month to ship, they are okay</li>
            <li> The product was the same color and the same shape as I expected it to be. It was just a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> if youre looing for some fun, low cost tips, these are it! They have a good length because they aren&#x27;t too long like most others but can still give you a fun length if you choose it that way&lt;br /&gt;the delivery was a bit slow but I was in no hurry anyways. I recommend them, especially if you are just starting to do your own nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. They don&#x27;t easily break. I&#x27;m wearing them right now and I love the feel. They feel like my own fingernails, they used to be just as strong and pleasant when touching. I will definitely buy more later.</li>
            <li> I purchased these along with the black tips and for the price the quality is pretty decent. 500 tips for 1.00. you cannot beat that. They come in a bunch of different colors i will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Love these what is shown in pictures is what you get the price is reasonable and the pink is a little bit lighter</li>
            <li> Great product, Thank you</li>

            <li> I am so very pleased with these tips. They are a little darker pink than what i expected but that pleased me very much! I couldn&#x27;t pass these up especially for the price!</li>

Thank you for getting them delivered so fast. You have a great selection on colors. I love the way these work with the gel or acrylic. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> These are great to wear on their own, or with polish. Glues on very easily. Good variety of different nail sizes too. Took a while to arrive, but well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I got this item before the expected date, and my daughter loves them. I am actually wearing a set right now.
