            <li>Rayovac has always been an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Rayovac is the best in batteries.</li>
            <li>Best battery to be bought.  </li>
            <li>That is the best any batteries have done.</li>
            <li>These are probably be best batteries to buy for my hearing aids.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing a hearing aid since summer of 2007 and these are the very best batteries I have used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The folks that sell these are hearing service professionals and the batteries are the best made!</li>
            <li>Excellent buy and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I have been using them since 1994 and this was also a very good price.</li>
            <li>and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li>Great price, always delivered on time..</li>
            <li>These batteries are a great value.</li>
            <li>Quality has been equally great.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Great Product, would recommend to all.</li>
            <li>This product works great and with over halve the order now used, I have not found a dud in the group.  </li>
            <li>But they work great while they have a charge.</li>
            <li>I received the number that I ordered at a great savings.</li>
            <li>great product and service</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad I bought it on that count!!</li>

            <li>Always good service and good product.</li>
            <li>Good batteries for the price</li>

            <li>tried.--and at a good price to boot.</li>
            <li>good price for a bunch of batteries.  </li>

            <li>Good purchase experience.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy that they are mercury free.  </li>
            <li>I have the kind of Aid that requires replacing the batteries about every 10 days of so.</li>
            <li>AND I WAS LOVING IT</li>
            <li>I never had this kind of issue at all.</li>
            <li>Good price and delivery - will buy more.</li>
            <li>Loved being able to do a large-quantity purchase.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best hearing aid batteries</li>
            <li>great price and quick shipping</li>
            <li>AND IT WORKED VERY FINE BEFORE</li>
            <li>so it is better for the environment.   </li>
            <li>- and I see this is a zinc air battery - just like most hearing aid batteries.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 - but probably it deserves more.</li>
            <li>So in this case, cheaper is probably better.</li>
            <li>Also, they cost much more than the $.50 apiece for the use</li>
            <li>Thank you Rayovac for your company&#x27;s environmental commitment and being able to offer this option vs more environmentally toxic/harmful equivalent.</li>
            <li>This would have been ok</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of batteries, but I believe Rayovac are the most dependable.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more convenient</li>
            <li>Great quality, priced very well.</li>
            <li>II use them weekly and have be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>at more than twice the price, of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have been satisfied with the life of the batteries.  </li>
            <li>Many people said that a lot of the batteries didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I have ne er had any issues with Rayovac Pproline advanced until now!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to know they are mercury free.</li>
            <li>however, the sound quality was better with Rayovac.</li>
            <li>Well packaged and easy to use from the dispenser packs</li>
            <li>The rest of the packs were fine &amp; I ordered them again.  </li>
            <li>;, that I would get that buzz but that the batter would work fine.  </li>
            <li>how quickly they go through batteries - in a matter of days depending on usage!  </li>
            <li>This hearing aid battery outlasts the others and is mercury free</li>
            <li>Fortunately, these batteries keep my hearing aids working well.</li>
            <li>They do work in my hearing aids, but don&#x27;t fit as well as the size 10 .  </li>
            <li>Good price on these batteries, will be buying more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I buy these for my mother and she&#x27;s thrilled to get high quality batteries at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>My new hearing aid was not working properly but with these batteries recommended by my audiologist, it is working perfectly</li>
            <li>A significant number do not work.</li>
            <li>The better quality sound is particularly noticeable on the TV.</li>
            <li>and they last a good five days.</li>
            <li>In this size batteries do not always &#x27;boot up&#x27; quickly.  </li>
            <li>This was the second time that I ordered these batteries through Amazon.com and have been very pleased with their quality(they</li>
            <li>At that time, it was rare for one of batteries not to work.</li>
            <li>The batteries are worth about 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, just two more deaf old farts sailing away..</li>
            <li>Great value and very few duds.</li>
            <li>Proline Advanced are available only form audiologists, or on-line.  </li>
            <li>The size 10A batteries last one to two days longer than the Starkey&#x27;s Love them</li>
            <li>When I first used these batteries I got the &amp;#34;low battery warning buzz&amp;#34; warning after about 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the batteries I buy in the store -- last much longer.</li>
            <li>We believe that having the option to be able to purchase a mercury free battery helps us keep our personal commitment to going more green!  </li>
            <li>The first batch of another brand I bought on the Internet were delightfully cheap but lasted only 4 or 5 days (I wear my hearing aids 12 hours a day).  </li>
            <li>I have tried a number of different brands of batteries, and Ray-O-vac win hands down.  </li>
            <li>more powerful than the other battery brands!</li>
            <li>Will certainly order from here again.</li>
            <li>this battery is available at very competitive prices, and their long shelf life assures they will stay fresh until needed.</li>
            <li>These work great and last much longer than the previous 10&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It is consistent with every pack, so much so that once these freebies are finished, I doubt I will purchase this particular brand again.</li>
            <li>Nice not having to replace batteries every other day!!</li>
            <li>The batteries gave my aid a strong signal and last lom\nger than most other batteries.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really give it a rating yet as I just ordered it, and haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li>So much easier to dispose of now.</li>
            <li>Hope these are still available next time to order.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference in the cost per battery.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast also.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare these to</li>
            <li>I have tried other batteries, And I think these are some of the better ones.</li>
            <li>STandard Rayovac #10 batteries available in retail stores are somehow different, and don&#x27;t (a) last more than two hours, or (b) don&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>I have used this batteries before and this time each pack I opened up were only good for less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always arrive fast, new in box, and give him the same or better life as compared to those bought locally.</li>
            <li>: I recommend this particular battery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very thankful to be able to purchase such a large quantity of batteries at such a low price.  </li>
            <li>I am new to hearing aides, but these are all I have used since I began wearing them.</li>
            <li>As much as I wish there would be a \\&quot;much longer lasting\\&quot; or rechargeable battery for my hearing aids, these do seem to last the longest at about 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li>Still looking for the \\&quot;longest lasting\\&quot; battery for my hearing aids, but these last exactly a week like all the others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These batteries last longer than many of the other name brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>These last much better than other batteries I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>my cousin uses only these batteries, even if they are slightly more costly than other non made in USA batteries.</li>
            <li>but I did order a new one directly from Rayovac.</li>
            <li>Item was as expected and shipping was as quick.</li>
            <li>He was right, for some of the batteries I do get a buzz a couple of times shortly after I changed them, but they would last about a week which is the normal time for me.  </li>
            <li>I realize that more than half the batteries are dead as if this package was mixed with dead and good batteries.</li>
            <li>These batteries far out-last  </li>
            <li>I can put a new one in in on Sunday and it will last all week.</li>
            <li>Somewhat more expensive but very reliable, so I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li>Apparently this is because their supplier is in Phoenix and rather than shipping via 2-day UPS from Phoenix to us, they shipped from Phoenix to Louisville (by carrier pigeon?).  </li>
            <li>These batteries, on the other hand last much longer.</li>
            <li>BUT THE LAST TIME I ORDERED IT, MOST OF THE BATTERIES WORKED ONLY FEW SECONDS OR FEW MINUTES ONLY.</li>

            <li> Apparently this is because their supplier is in Phoenix and rather than shipping via 2-day UPS from Phoenix to us, they shipped from Phoenix to Louisville (by carrier pigeon?).  </li>
            <li> These batteries, on the other hand last much longer.</li>
            <li> BUT THE LAST TIME I ORDERED IT, MOST OF THE BATTERIES WORKED ONLY FEW SECONDS OR FEW MINUTES ONLY.</li>
            <li> Last actually twice as long as some brands.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t yet found #10 batteries that last very long in any brand.&lt;br /&gt;This 1 star review is based on Amazon&#x27;s Prime delivery service for this specific item.  </li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> This last order of these hearing aid batteries only last half the time they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> and she said they do not last as long as the other same brand batteries.  </li>
            <li> Wished they lasted a little longer, but I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much from such a small item.</li>
            <li> These batteries last longer than other batteries on by one or two days.</li>
            <li> EVERY 8PK, ONLY 1 OR 2 BATTERIES WORKED NORMALLY THE REST WORKED FOR FEW SECONDS OR FEW MINUTES.</li>
            <li> I found it didn&#x27;t necessarily last longer than other brands ...</li>
            <li> When I purchased four packs, then when I finally started using the last pack a few of the batteries only lasted an hour or less.</li>
            <li> The batteries in this pack are lasting an average of 2-3 days, and one died after 14 hours yesterday.  </li>
            <li> He finds they last longer than any other brand!</li>
            <li> These last longer and cost less.</li>
            <li> I have bought these Battery&#x27;s several times before, the last Order over half were dead.</li>
            <li> So we are now on our cruise sans batteries and they are winging their way to our empty home.  </li>
            <li> So far, my 48 &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; pack has had a 19% failure rate (6 out of 32).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new hearing aid person and possibly have too high expectations, but when 40% of these batteries failed to last for 48 hours, something is wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other batteries</li>
            <li> other brands.</li>
            <li> the other cheaper size 10a batteries do in my mothers hearing aids.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even consider buying any other brand.</li>
            <li> all the other brands</li>
            <li> I have also had duds and inconsistent amount of use time (anywhere from 2 hours to a week) in other brands.  </li>
            <li> I buy these online in bulk for my Dad as the price beats every other site I have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my hearing aids about 6 months, so I am new to the game.  </li>
            <li> This is the same product the technician gave me with my new hearing aids but so much less expensive than at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> The batteries that do work tend to last me 5 days, however, there are at least 2 \\&quot;duds\\&quot; in every pack that never work.</li>
            <li> Will amend the rating I gave it, up or down, depending on the quality of batteries - over time - and the batteries life span.</li>
            <li> The previous batteries that I was using had varied life spans</li>
            <li> These batteries are mostly dead.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding the 10A batteries for my hearing aids.  </li>
            <li> At least half of the batteries are either completely dead or die less than an hour after I install them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just did a little research (AFTER ordering!)</li>
            <li> The last one I opened almost all the batteries failed within hours of installation.  </li>
            <li> The failed batteries last about 1 hour before I get the &amp;#34;battery low&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem was with this order.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this batch was defective</li>
            <li> I have been using these a few months now and no longer have those problems!</li>
            <li> Either the hearing aid manufacturers or the battery makers have changed their product requirements/performance in the last 4 years; I am unhappy about the amount of communication on the issue, from both suppliers.  </li>
            <li> they work and less expensive than in the retail store.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m just annoyed by the claims.          </li>
            <li> - They keep my hearing aids working for approximately one week.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, they do not.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong size battery</li>
            <li> I would like to return the bad batteries to the manufacturer so they can determine a cause.  </li>
            <li> Zinc is also bad for the environment - so I think the environmental claims are unjustified.         </li>
            <li> Wondering if bad batch or maybe a knock off product..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My second order of this item.  Great price!</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of batteries for my hearing aids. They seem to quit daily. These batteries, on the other hand last much longer. I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I have tried other batteries and I find Rayovav to last longer. My audiologist also recommends them&lt;br /&gt;Over other brands.</li>
            <li> These batteries last longer than other batteries on by one or two days. The better quality sound is particularly noticeable on the TV.</li>
            <li> Rayovac 10A from the battery club work well for me, and they are often fresher than store-bought hearing aid batteries.</li>
            <li> These Hearing Aid Batteries fulfilled my expectations. I have the kind of Aid that requires replacing the batteries about every 10 days of so.</li>
            <li> Still looking for the \\&quot;longest lasting\\&quot; battery for my hearing aids, but these last exactly a week like all the others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great price, always delivered on time..more powerful than the other battery brands!</li>
            <li> This hearing aid battery outlasts the others and is mercury free so it is better for the environment.   Well packaged and easy to use from the dispenser packs: I recommend this particular battery.  Purchased through Amazon in larger quantities this battery is available at very competitive prices, and their long shelf life assures they will stay fresh until needed. Received promptly in good condition - will order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered several packs of this battery.  The last one I opened almost all the batteries failed within hours of installation.  The rest of the packs were fine &amp; I ordered them again.  I would like to return the bad batteries to the manufacturer so they can determine a cause.  I do not exect replacement.  At this  point I would give the last 32 batteries a 1 star.</li>
            <li> I just did a little research (AFTER ordering!) - and I see this is a zinc air battery - just like most hearing aid batteries. Zinc is also bad for the environment - so I think the environmental claims are unjustified.         I can&#x27;t really give it a rating yet as I just ordered it, and haven&#x27;t used it. I gave it 3 - but probably it deserves more. - I&#x27;m just annoyed by the claims.          A PLUS: It seems to be the only hearing aid battery made in America. So I&#x27;m glad I bought it on that count!!</li>
            <li> As much as I wish there would be a \\&quot;much longer lasting\\&quot; or rechargeable battery for my hearing aids, these do seem to last the longest at about 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> These batteries last longer than many of the other name brands I have tried.  Nice not having to replace batteries every other day!!</li>
            <li> I bought the Rayovac Proline batteries with the hopes that they would last longer than the 3 days or so the other cheaper size 10a batteries do in my mothers hearing aids.  Sorry to say, they do not. They last about same. So in this case, cheaper is probably better.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different brands of batteries, and Ray-O-vac win hands down.  Last actually twice as long as some brands.  I wouldn&#x27;t even consider buying any other brand.</li>
            <li> Product arrived VERY shortly after purchase, and was packaged QUITE well  Rayovac has always been an excellent product. I&#x27;ve ordered from this  vendor before. Always good service and good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that they are mercury free.  So much easier to dispose of now.</li>
            <li> I have tried other batteries, And I think these are some of the better ones. And I will buy again when I need to make a purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer and have found that I receive the same quality battery.  I will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> At least half of the batteries are either completely dead or die less than an hour after I install them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy these again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the Rayovac 10A batteries from my audiologist, and they last 4 days.  The batteries in this pack are lasting an average of 2-3 days, and one died after 14 hours yesterday.  I called the Rayovac company and was told to remove the yellow sticker and leave it exposed to air for a few minutes before inserting, and it really has made a difference.</li>
            <li> Good batteries for the price</li>
            <li> The price is a savings, and I change the batteries every six days. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is with shelf-life. I suggest purchasing two packs at a time. When I purchased four packs, then when I finally started using the last pack a few of the batteries only lasted an hour or less. I&#x27;ve state-of-the-art hearing aids.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good shape within the quoted time frame.  Will amend the rating I gave it, up or down, depending on the quality of batteries - over time - and the batteries life span.</li>
            <li> The previous batteries that I was using had varied life spans and sometimes some of them didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;A friend suggested I order from Amazon.  I did and find them acceptable and have never had one that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte</li>
            <li> Rayovac is the best in batteries. I can put a new one in in on Sunday and it will last all week.</li>
            <li> I started using these type of batteries for my hearing aid over six years ago. At that time, it was rare for one of batteries not to work. Not so anymore. Rayovac makes a lower quality version of these. Do not buy them. A significant number do not work. Also, they cost much more than the $.50 apiece for the use</li>
            <li> So far, my 48 &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; pack has had a 19% failure rate (6 out of 32). I do let the battery air out before installing as recommended. The failed batteries last about 1 hour before I get the &amp;#34;battery low&amp;#34; message.. The use-by date is Dec, 2016.</li>
            <li> This last order of these hearing aid batteries only last half the time they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> The longest lasting hearing aid I have tried.</li>
            <li> These batteries are mostly dead.  Eight come in a pack, and maybe two work, and then only for a day.  Yes, I&#x27;m removing the tab and letting them sit for 7 minutes.  Yes, they are stored properly.  Yes, I threw away $50+ on them.</li>
            <li> Best battery to be bought.  I have been using them since 1994 and this was also a very good price. Will certainly order from here again.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected and shipping was as quick.</li>
            <li> I have bought these Battery&#x27;s several times before, the last Order over half were dead. Not sure what the problem was with this order.</li>
            <li> These batteries far out-last  all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.--and at a good price to boot. Why bother with the others?</li>
            <li> These batteries are a great value. I have been using them in my Starkey Nuear completely-in-canal hearing aids and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS BATTERY 2 TIMES BEFORE AND IT WORKED VERY FINE BEFORE AND I WAS LOVING IT BUT THE LAST TIME I ORDERED IT, MOST OF THE BATTERIES WORKED ONLY FEW SECONDS OR FEW MINUTES ONLY. EVERY 8PK, ONLY 1 OR 2 BATTERIES WORKED NORMALLY THE REST WORKED FOR FEW SECONDS OR FEW MINUTES. I THINK THE COMPANY SENT ME BATTRIES FROM A DEFECTIVE LOT. I BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD REFUND MY LOST MONEY.</li>
            <li> Received promptly and well packaged. I bought these for my mom&#x27;s hearing aid and to our surprise these batteries last longer than another brandname we purchase locally. Hope these are still available next time to order.</li>
            <li> In the second set of 48 Box. I had failures of 8 in the 32 used. I never had this kind of issue at all.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my mother&#x27;s hearing aids and she said they do not last as long as the other same brand batteries.  Wondering if bad batch or maybe a knock off product..</li>
            <li> good price for a bunch of batteries.  figure it&#x27;s about 2/3 of what you would pay for these in a regular store.</li>
            <li> great price and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Good price and delivery - will buy more.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Very satisfied with product.  I buy these for a friend and am told that they work well.  I will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why 10A  instead of 10 but they seem to hold up for a week.  That is the best any batteries have done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very thankful to be able to purchase such a large quantity of batteries at such a low price.  Quality has been equally great.</li>
            <li> This was the second time that I ordered these batteries through Amazon.com and have been very pleased with their quality(they usually last a week).&lt;br /&gt;Both orders were received before the projected arrival date.</li>
            <li> Great product - They keep my hearing aids working for approximately one week. I&#x27;ve had digital hearing aids for about 6 months now and I can hear sounds I haven&#x27;t heard in 10-15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li> Much better than the batteries I buy in the store -- last much longer.</li>
            <li> The size 10A batteries last one to two days longer than the Starkey&#x27;s Love them</li>
            <li> These are probably be best batteries to buy for my hearing aids.  I&#x27;m glad to know they are mercury free.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my mother and she&#x27;s thrilled to get high quality batteries at such a great price.  I think she&#x27;s turned all her friends onto Amazon as a result of this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new hearing aid person and possibly have too high expectations, but when 40% of these batteries failed to last for 48 hours, something is wrong.  I&#x27;m going to try another brand next time.</li>
            <li> My parents have been buying their batteries from the drug store for around $16 for 10 batteries. These last longer and cost less.</li>
            <li> I have used this batteries before and this time each pack I opened up were only good for less than 24 hours. I am not sure if this batch was defective but I did order a new one directly from Rayovac. I also ordered sizable 10 and received 10A</li>
            <li> My mom has hearing aides and we therefore cannot avoid having to use them.  We believe that having the option to be able to purchase a mercury free battery helps us keep our personal commitment to going more green!  Thank you Rayovac for your company&#x27;s environmental commitment and being able to offer this option vs more environmentally toxic/harmful equivalent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that you can&#x27;t rate the product and the delivery separately but you can&#x27;t.  The batteries are worth about 3 stars.  Haven&#x27;t yet found #10 batteries that last very long in any brand.&lt;br /&gt;This 1 star review is based on Amazon&#x27;s Prime delivery service for this specific item.  Amazon&#x27;s notes indicate 2-day air delivery via UPS but it actually took FOUR days before the TWO days began.  Apparently this is because their supplier is in Phoenix and rather than shipping via 2-day UPS from Phoenix to us, they shipped from Phoenix to Louisville (by carrier pigeon?).  Only then did UPS 2-day air kick in to head our way.  This would have been ok had we been told up front to expect six-day non-Prime delivery, but we weren&#x27;t.  So we are now on our cruise sans batteries and they are winging their way to our empty home.  Oh well, just two more deaf old farts sailing away..</li>
            <li> Loved being able to do a large-quantity purchase. It really does make a difference in the cost per battery. These are used for my friends hearing aids.</li>
            <li> My new hearing aid was not working properly but with these batteries recommended by my audiologist, it is working perfectly and they last a good five days.</li>
            <li> Great Product, would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> These last much better than other batteries I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve had my hearing aids about 6 months, so I am new to the game.  The first batch of another brand I bought on the Internet were delightfully cheap but lasted only 4 or 5 days (I wear my hearing aids 12 hours a day).  I bought these Rayovac batteries because of a review and agree that they last almost a week.  Somewhat more expensive but very reliable, so I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> my cousin uses only these batteries, even if they are slightly more costly than other non made in USA batteries.</li>
            <li> My hearing aids require #10 batteries.  STandard Rayovac #10 batteries available in retail stores are somehow different, and don&#x27;t (a) last more than two hours, or (b) don&#x27;t work at all.  Proline Advanced are available only form audiologists, or on-line.  These work.  Either the hearing aid manufacturers or the battery makers have changed their product requirements/performance in the last 4 years; I am unhappy about the amount of communication on the issue, from both suppliers.  Fortunately, these batteries keep my hearing aids working well.</li>
            <li> Great value and very few duds. I am new to hearing aides, but these are all I have used since I began wearing them. My audiologist gives them out as well so stick to what the pros use!</li>
            <li> I realize that more than half the batteries are dead as if this package was mixed with dead and good batteries. I cannot say if its the seller&#x27;s fault or the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong.  I ordered the wrong size battery</li>
            <li> This product works great and with over halve the order now used, I have not found a dud in the group.  I have tried many brands of batteries, but I believe Rayovac are the most dependable.  Delivery was fast also.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this hearing aid battery.  I found it didn&#x27;t necessarily last longer than other brands ... however, the sound quality was better with Rayovac.</li>
            <li> I just got hearing aids, so I had no idea how quickly they go through batteries - in a matter of days depending on usage!  This is the same product the technician gave me with my new hearing aids but so much less expensive than at the drug store.  And it comes in the mail.  Couldn&#x27;t be more convenient</li>
            <li> Wished they lasted a little longer, but I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much from such a small item. But they work great while they have a charge.</li>
            <li> Good price on these batteries, will be buying more in the future.  They just don&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing a hearing aid since summer of 2007 and these are the very best batteries I have used.  In this size batteries do not always &#x27;boot up&#x27; quickly.  My audiologist told me to give them 10 to 30 seconds, well the Rayovac&#x27;s don&#x27;t seem to have that problem.  I have also had duds and inconsistent amount of use time (anywhere from 2 hours to a week) in other brands.  I have been using these a few months now and no longer have those problems!</li>
            <li> I received these batteries as part of my hearing aid benefits package.  The batteries that do work tend to last me 5 days, however, there are at least 2 \\&quot;duds\\&quot; in every pack that never work. It is consistent with every pack, so much so that once these freebies are finished, I doubt I will purchase this particular brand again.</li>
            <li> The batteries are as represented. I received the number that I ordered at a great savings. I recommend them without exception.</li>
            <li> I ordered size 10 batteries and received size 10A .  They do work in my hearing aids, but don&#x27;t fit as well as the size 10 .  I don&#x27;t expect to reorder this item from Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are the only batteries my husband buys. He finds they last longer than any other brand!</li>
            <li> Batteries were received on a timely bases.  They were well packaged.  The batteries gave my aid a strong signal and last lom\nger than most other batteries.</li>
            <li> Great quality, priced very well. I had purchased these before and will reorder when needed in the future as needed.</li>
            <li> II use them weekly and have be satisfied.  Will order again.  Only wish is that hearing aids would have rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I buy these online in bulk for my Dad as the price beats every other site I have searched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive fast, new in box, and give him the same or better life as compared to those bought locally. His &amp;#34;hearing professional&amp;#34; encourages him to buy &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; batteries at their business...at more than twice the price, of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The folks that sell these are hearing service professionals and the batteries are the best made!</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding the 10A batteries for my hearing aids.  These work great and last much longer than the previous 10&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had.  I will buy them from this vender again.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for my husband who has hearing aids in both ears....great product and service and he&#x27;s continuing to hear although doesn&#x27;t always listen!</li>
            <li> they work and less expensive than in the retail store.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Just got my hearing aids so I don&#x27;t have much to compare these to but I have been satisfied with the life of the batteries.  They last about 5 days and I wear my aids 12+ hours a day.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hearing aid batteries I&#x27;ve ever bought (actually, the only ones). Ask me about them in a year.</li>
            <li> I was leery about buying this based on the reviews.  Many people said that a lot of the batteries didn&#x27;t work.  When I first used these batteries I got the &amp;#34;low battery warning buzz&amp;#34; warning after about 4 hours.  I called Rayovac to complain and was told that the battery needed to &amp;#34;warm up&amp;#34;, that I would get that buzz but that the batter would work fine.  He was right, for some of the batteries I do get a buzz a couple of times shortly after I changed them, but they would last about a week which is the normal time for me.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> The packet of batteries, with expiration date of July 2017 TJHPA 0657 and 0658, had exactly one (1) #10A battery that worked, and it only worked for 6 hours and then went dead!  I have ne er had any issues with Rayovac Pproline advanced until now!  Tennessee Valley Audiology was the supplier/seller.</li>
            <li> Good price. If you need these batteries, I have found no place with a lower cost.</li>
            <li> Have ordered several times.  Good value aand good service.</li>
            <li> Good purchase experience.</li>
