            <li>I&#x27;ve found that they smell great and leave my skin looking and feeling like heaven.</li>
            <li>I however will not be purchasing it again since I have cheaper products that also give a great braid-out result.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Triple Moisture&#x27;s leave in conditioner is great.</li>
            <li>It works great on my kid&#x27;s hair, though they have finer curls.</li>
            <li>and they did leave it smelling good.</li>
            <li>Because of its light, water-based consistency, it&#x27;s great for moisturizing between washings without leaving residue or being greasy.</li>
            <li>When I want amazing tresses</li>
            <li>(IC, Optimum Care, Organic Root Stimulator lines--ANYTHING ELSE will probably work better).</li>
            <li>I will say that the products did give my hair a nice sheen</li>
            <li>i will always come to this site for honest opinions..</li>
            <li>it smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves their hair shiny, detangles and is a great quick refresher in between weekly shampoos.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and curly.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something to give my hair more control...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this can be called a conditioner because it&#x27;s nothing more than water.</li>
            <li>I like the Khoret Amen line much better.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the herbaceous, floral, and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>This product smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>glad i was warned about the rosemary shampoo, so</li>
            <li>I have used 1.99 conditioners that work better.  </li>
            <li>Something that is creamy would probably have been better.  </li>
            <li>This product is not what I expected - it&#x27;s like water, but smells great!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for fine dry hair in between shampoos.</li>
            <li>so you must rub it in your hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>His hair is much coarser than mine and this conditioner gives his locks a nice healthy sheen.    </li>
            <li>The results were smooth, soft, manageable, and great smelling hair.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing special about this leave-in conditioner, besides the fact that it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>My hair texture is fine and it is relaxed.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing against the Carol brand, but I do believe that you can find cheaper, more effective products for caring for natural hair.</li>
            <li>It makes it easier to style and it leaves my hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>I have dredlocks, and have found this to be a very effective daily treatment.</li>
            <li>While I love the scent it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>now i just have a full bottle sitting around that i&#x27;ll never use...</li>
            <li>i have read so many good reviews elsewhere, they must have been endorsed, this mess is a joke...</li>
            <li>With this product my hair quickly turns fuzzy, wooly and unshiny.     </li>
            <li>I also found the shampoo SUPER drying.  </li>
            <li>I would have expected more from the company who&#x27;s product states &#x27;Made with Love, Peace&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Like so many of the other reviewers I love scent of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>After it has been applied, dried and the hair styled, you can see the results - keeps the hair smelling good and if you&#x27;re looking for something that will not weigh your hair down this is great.  </li>
            <li>Well I used this conditioner right after the mint shampoo</li>
            <li>However in order to not waste my purchase, I have been experimenting with using it with other products and found that if I use it after a good creamy leave-in I can do a braid-out that lasts for up to 3 day!</li>
            <li>This conditioner has helped me with detangling the oldests hair, there are no more fights and because of the texture of their hair, it leaves a great shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was left tangled and the smell is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>When i first tried to buy it, it was out of stock everywhere</li>
            <li>The shampoos also did a good job of cleaning my scalp, which is not something I can say about a lot of other shampoos for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I doubt this company will be around much longer after seeing so many negative reviews on so many of its products.  </li>
            <li>but it leaves my curls shiny, full and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It is purely hair perfume...</li>
            <li>If you want a real leave-in conditioner, try something else</li>
            <li>I will also say that this conditioner works very well on my hubby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend them.    </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It is very watery and has no conditioning properties, that I could detect.  </li>
            <li>I have 4A fine relaxed hair and found the black vanilla leave-in to be very oily for my hair.</li>
            <li>It did nothing to moisturize my hair, and is only useful as a perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so used to thick creamy conditioners like Pantene, etc, that this light spray conditioner didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li>Not a great value, in my opinion, and I am willing to pay more for products that work well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner and like any other line, you have to use all the products together to get the full effect of the line and what it&#x27;s promoting.</li>
            <li>It leaves my AA daughter&#x27;s hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner because my hair is completely natural and I was looking for something to help it retain its moisture.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as coarse as most, but it&#x27;s not fine by any means.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spend quite a bit of money trying all of their different shampoos, conditioners, and hair styling products, and while they do give my hair a nice sheen, I found that they either don&#x27;t work, or, if they do work, only in combination with several of their other products.     </li>
            <li>personally cannot use it as a conditioner because it contains vodka and that simply dries my hair out, but I do love to give my hair a little spritz before blow drying so that the smell</li>
            <li>Being excited about a hair line made for black women BY a black woman, I purchased several products (I posted reviews individually for each relevant product).  </li>
            <li>It now comes with a pump, at least mine did, which makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is my hair ritual: deep cleasing shampoo, Khoret Amen shampoo, Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not the best detangler for my hair, (thick curly and crazy).</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell but leaves my hair stiff and hard.</li>
            <li>lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I have two daughters of mixed heritage; one has baby fine curls and the other has spiral curls down to the middle of her back.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li> i try to support black manufactured products, from here on i will remain with the high end stuff...</li>
            <li> Even after trying several combinations of the product line, my hair was left dry.    </li>
            <li> If your hair type doesn&#x27;t work well with the conditioner or any of the other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, then it&#x27;s obviously not for your hair type (there is NO specific line of hair products that works with EVERY hair type)...</li>
            <li> Because I have a natural do, products that are too heavy don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product if you have dry hair in need of a moisturing or restorative conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner keeps my thick, coarse hair soft and managable.       </li>
            <li> As for the vanilla smell it&#x27;s too strong for me, but not altogether too unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I then spray the black vanilla conditioner on when my hair is almost dry so that the scent stays in my hair.  </li>
            <li> the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla leave in with the Rosemary Mint shampoo for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain.</li>
            <li> so maybe I will look into other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.</li>
            <li> After reading these reviews, you people must keep in mind that, as with any other hair product(s), this product does not cater to all hair types.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I&#x27;m a total sucker when it comes to advertising.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is watered down</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it will run down your face and neck (wish it came with a spray pump instead).  </li>
            <li> I typically use IC Leave-in Conditioner with Aloe to detangle and condition my hair after washing and before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> The Black Vanilla leave-in</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviews it is watery and that makes it difficut to evenly distribute the product onto your hair.</li>
            <li> I like the previous suggestion of using a spray bottle, perhaps I would have given this product a 5 star rating if it came packacked that way.</li>
            <li> I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain.</li>
            <li> I put it in a spray bottle, and spritz it on to prevent my locs from getting dried out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Unlike the results from the black vanilla leave-in conditioner, my hair was no more thangled than ususal</li>
            <li> It stripped my hair which is not good for hair that&#x27;s already dry.</li>
            <li> What a mess!  </li>
            <li> I also use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair after I wash it, but again, the product is so watery, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping or not.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;m disappointed, not only with this product, but with the entire Carol&#x27;s daughter hair care line.</li>
            <li> DUH</li>
            <li> I was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well-known and has a lot of star/ celebrity power behind it.  </li>
            <li> this merely helped to style.  </li>
            <li> The fact that celebrities endorse this product is irrelevant.</li>
            <li> I put up with the bad hair when my sense of scent is revved up.</li>
            <li> Since I have already opened it and was disappointed by its lack of conditioning for my hair, I use the IC product to condition my hair for blow-drying.  </li>
            <li> If you want to spend &gt;$10 for hair perfume, you won&#x27;t be disappointed by the smell.  </li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed, and I was thoroughly disappointed with this CD product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with both products.  </li>

            <li> This product is not what I expected - it&#x27;s like water, but smells great!  After it has been applied, dried and the hair styled, you can see the results - keeps the hair smelling good and if you&#x27;re looking for something that will not weigh your hair down this is great.  I was looking for something to give my hair more control...this merely helped to style.  I also use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair after I wash it, but again, the product is so watery, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping or not.</li>
            <li> I just received my conditioner today and it&#x27;s going back to Sephora. I don&#x27;t know how this can be called a conditioner because it&#x27;s nothing more than water. It also smells nothing like vanilla. The only scent I could smell was coconut and I don&#x27;t want my hair smelling like that.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  The smell is WONDERFUL!!!  Plus, the product works GREAT!!!  It now comes with a pump, at least mine did, which makes it easy to use.  It leaves my AA daughter&#x27;s hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing special about this leave-in conditioner, besides the fact that it smells really good.  However, I didn&#x27;t see any changes in my daughter&#x27;s hair after using this conditioner.  NONE.  It is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly. Otherwise, it will run down your face and neck (wish it came with a spray pump instead).  I was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well-known and has a lot of star/ celebrity power behind it.  However, I found this conditioner to be all hype.</li>
            <li> My hair texture is fine and it is relaxed.  I typically use IC Leave-in Conditioner with Aloe to detangle and condition my hair after washing and before blow drying.  Being excited about a hair line made for black women BY a black woman, I purchased several products (I posted reviews individually for each relevant product).  The Black Vanilla leave-in conditioner smells wonderfully but it is NOT a conditioner.  It is purely hair perfume...your hair cannot be conditioned with just flower/plant extracts (except maybe aloe).  Since I have already opened it and was disappointed by its lack of conditioning for my hair, I use the IC product to condition my hair for blow-drying.  I then spray the black vanilla conditioner on when my hair is almost dry so that the scent stays in my hair.  If you want to spend &gt;$10 for hair perfume, you won&#x27;t be disappointed by the smell.  If you want a real leave-in conditioner, try something else (IC, Optimum Care, Organic Root Stimulator lines--ANYTHING ELSE will probably work better).</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because my hair is completely natural and I was looking for something to help it retain its moisture. My hair isn&#x27;t as coarse as most, but it&#x27;s not fine by any means. I have to admit, I&#x27;m disappointed, not only with this product, but with the entire Carol&#x27;s daughter hair care line. I&#x27;ve spend quite a bit of money trying all of their different shampoos, conditioners, and hair styling products, and while they do give my hair a nice sheen, I found that they either don&#x27;t work, or, if they do work, only in combination with several of their other products.     This product is no exception. While I love the scent it did absolutely nothing for my hair. I used it in conjunction with both the Tui Herbal shampoo, and the Khoret Amen herbal shampoo as well the Hair Milk and the Healty Hair Butter. Even after trying several combinations of the product line, my hair was left dry.    I will say that the products did give my hair a nice sheen and they did leave it smelling good. The shampoos also did a good job of cleaning my scalp, which is not something I can say about a lot of other shampoos for natural hair. I will also say that this conditioner works very well on my hubby&#x27;s hair. He has dreadlocks and he uses it daily as a conditioning spray between washes and retwists. His hair is much coarser than mine and this conditioner gives his locks a nice healthy sheen.    I&#x27;d also like to offer a note of praise for Carol&#x27;s bath and body products. I&#x27;ve found that they smell great and leave my skin looking and feeling like heaven. I would absolutely recommend them.    I have nothing against the Carol brand, but I do believe that you can find cheaper, more effective products for caring for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have 4A fine relaxed hair and found the black vanilla leave-in to be very oily for my hair. Has a nice smell but leaves my hair stiff and hard. However in order to not waste my purchase, I have been experimenting with using it with other products and found that if I use it after a good creamy leave-in I can do a braid-out that lasts for up to 3 day! I however will not be purchasing it again since I have cheaper products that also give a great braid-out result.</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed, and I was thoroughly disappointed with this CD product. My hair was left tangled and the smell is overwhelming.  I like the Khoret Amen line much better. Unlike the results from the black vanilla leave-in conditioner, my hair was no more thangled than ususal and I was not overwhelmed by the scent. I enjoyed the herbaceous, floral, and refreshing scent. This is my hair ritual: deep cleasing shampoo, Khoret Amen shampoo, Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk. The results were smooth, soft, manageable, and great smelling hair.</li>
            <li> I have dredlocks, and have found this to be a very effective daily treatment. Because of its light, water-based consistency, it&#x27;s great for moisturizing between washings without leaving residue or being greasy. I put it in a spray bottle, and spritz it on to prevent my locs from getting dried out. Plus, the smell is delicious.</li>
            <li> This product smells fantastic! I agree with the previous reviews it is watery and that makes it difficut to evenly distribute the product onto your hair. I like the previous suggestion of using a spray bottle, perhaps I would have given this product a 5 star rating if it came packacked that way. Perfect for fine dry hair in between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Because I have a natural do, products that are too heavy don&#x27;t work.  This is perfect for my hair.  It makes it easier to style and it leaves my hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> Wish i could get a refund after reading the reviews on here...purchased from a local store, since i tore off the plastic, they said no refund....however i tried this on my hair last nite, even after using Ojon ultra hydrating cream, nothing worked, i have kinky/coarse/Leelajames hair. i have read so many good reviews elsewhere, they must have been endorsed, this mess is a joke...glad i was warned about the rosemary shampoo, so now i just have a full bottle sitting around that i&#x27;ll never use...i will always come to this site for honest opinions..i try to support black manufactured products, from here on i will remain with the high end stuff...will never purchase her stuff again, even if someone gives me the money to</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair greasy and frizzy all at the same time!  What a mess!  I have used 1.99 conditioners that work better.  I doubt this company will be around much longer after seeing so many negative reviews on so many of its products.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I&#x27;m a total sucker when it comes to advertising. That&#x27;s why I fell for this product. When i first tried to buy it, it was out of stock everywhere I looked. As soon as it came back in stock on the Carol&#x27;s Daughter website, I jumped at the chance to buy this.     TOTAL RIP OFF! All it basically is, is water with great-smelling essential oils. Not worth the money. It did nothing to moisturize my hair, and is only useful as a perfume. Whatever, I can use the hair balm for that.     Save your money and spend it on something that actually does condition the hair. Neutrogena Triple Moisture&#x27;s leave in conditioner is great. Paul Mitchell, Reddken, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa&#x27;s Hair Regimen on the Carol&#x27;s daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol&#x27;s Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who&#x27;s product states &#x27;Made with Love, Peace&#x27;.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Like so many of the other reviewers I love scent of this conditioner.  When I use it my partner notices and buries her head in my hair.  The \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; leaves something to be desired though.  My hair is very fine and curly.  With this product my hair quickly turns fuzzy, wooly and unshiny.     When I want amazing tresses I turn to a gel product by Grassroots. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything but it leaves my curls shiny, full and soft to the touch.  I put up with the bad hair when my sense of scent is revved up.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla leave in with the Rosemary Mint shampoo for dry hair.  Very disappointed with both products.  This one doesn&#x27;t condition my hair which needs a lot of taming before leaving the house.  Something that is creamy would probably have been better.  I also found the shampoo SUPER drying.  It stripped my hair which is not good for hair that&#x27;s already dry.</li>
            <li> Well I used this conditioner right after the mint shampoo and it&#x27;s not the best detangler for my hair, (thick curly and crazy). I&#x27;m so used to thick creamy conditioners like Pantene, etc, that this light spray conditioner didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for me. I need something thicker so maybe I will look into other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products. As for the vanilla smell it&#x27;s too strong for me, but not altogether too unpleasant. It works great on my kid&#x27;s hair, though they have finer curls.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product if you have dry hair in need of a moisturing or restorative conditioner.  Granted it smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it.  It is very watery and has no conditioning properties, that I could detect.  Not a great value, in my opinion, and I am willing to pay more for products that work well.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner keeps my thick, coarse hair soft and managable.       After reading these reviews, you people must keep in mind that, as with any other hair product(s), this product does not cater to all hair types. The fact that celebrities endorse this product is irrelevant. If your hair type doesn&#x27;t work well with the conditioner or any of the other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, then it&#x27;s obviously not for your hair type (there is NO specific line of hair products that works with EVERY hair type)...DUH</li>
            <li> I received this product and several others for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I personally cannot use it as a conditioner because it contains vodka and that simply dries my hair out, but I do love to give my hair a little spritz before blow drying so that the smell lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I have two daughters of mixed heritage; one has baby fine curls and the other has spiral curls down to the middle of her back.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the perfect leave in conditioner for their hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;The smell garners compliments from their child care providers, the parents and from their school teachers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves their hair shiny, detangles and is a great quick refresher in between weekly shampoos.  This conditioner has helped me with detangling the oldests hair, there are no more fights and because of the texture of their hair, it leaves a great shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please know that this is not a stand alone product.  It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner and like any other line, you have to use all the products together to get the full effect of the line and what it&#x27;s promoting.</li>
