            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>shiny- HEALTHY shiny!</li>
            <li>And after waiting my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li>Cones are great for that slippery smooth feel, but they seal moisture out, so if you use them at all, keep that in mind.)&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>I kind of like the smell, but you may not.</li>
            <li>It blended nicely with the henna.</li>
            <li>which kind of bums me out</li>
            <li>Love the shine and healthy look and feel this goves my hair!</li>
            <li>Love the results, will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li>I may even get to mixing it 70 Cassia 30 Henna and see if I get more of a strawberry blond</li>
            <li>but once I had it, it stayed nice and smooth-</li>
            <li>it was out for the most part.</li>
            <li>However, my hair feels stronger and thicker, and more shiny-</li>
            <li>my greys were there, they just blended in better.</li>
            <li>But I wash it if I need my hair to be gorgeous right</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d advise you to make sure you have a nice rich conditioner on hand to revitalize your locks afterwards.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d advise you to make sure you have a nice rich conditioner on hand to revitalize your locks afterwards.</li>
            <li>It truly is colorless because it doesn&#x27;t turn my silver streaks funky colors, but it does make the colour of my hair that isn&#x27;t silver yet look very rich.  </li>
            <li>Easy to mix,faster then I remember to use start to finish.</li>
            <li>SURE your hair is 100% clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong.</li>
            <li>This Herbal Hair Conditioner (colorless henna aka Cassia Obovata) is easy to use and makes my hair look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My baby fine hair looks thicker when I use this once a month.</li>
            <li>I rinsed with some silicone free conditioner to help get it out and after about 20 minutes in the shower</li>
            <li>This is not bad, just don&#x27;t expect to put this on, rinse your hair in 20 mins and go like you do with chemicals.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and use only this to touch up my roots on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>The cassia seemed to be of very high quality and was finely sifted.</li>
            <li>I really do think it helped to smooth my hair</li>
            <li>Like fresh cut hay.</li>
            <li>I love being a redhead and want my hair color to appear natural.</li>
            <li>I also use it with henna to dye my hair a warm red color.</li>
            <li>hair feels soft and I love the color I get from the mix.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The powder came out well when mixed with warm water-</li>
            <li>BUT it did make my naturally straight hair more straight</li>
            <li>I was told that fresh batches are considered at most 12 months old-</li>
            <li>I was told that fresh batches are considered at most 12 months old-</li>
            <li>it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>it took a while to get it to the right pudding consistency</li>
            <li>Not bad, but the reason I purchased this particular Henna was because of the fresh</li>
            <li>So,  My sister did a treatment on my hair which was supposed to give it curls but ended up making it super straight.</li>
            <li>for the actual powder, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Treat this like a salon visit for a big event meaning make sure you have time to invest before thinking you can just do it and go.</li>
            <li>I love my results and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>The resulting blonde is lovely honey gold from this treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still a bit dry, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll go away with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still a bit dry, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll go away with time.   </li>
            <li>brewed some chamomile tea and mixed it with the Casia with a coated whisk until it was a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>it out was very troublesome-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it again if it did, unless I really wanted to straighten it.</li>
            <li>It gets wavy from time to time which I don&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it again if it did, unless I really wanted to straighten it.</li>
            <li>It gets wavy from time to time which I don&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li>I was doomed to have  straight hair for life.</li>
            <li>I mixed 2:1 with henna, camamile tea, lemon juice, and lavender oil for a nice smelling strawberry blonde color.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience using cassia, which I combined 1:1 with the 100% Pure &amp; Natural Henna Powder, also from The Henna Guys.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not interested in coloring my hair (medium brunette, no gray), but I love the conditioning/thickening benefits of henna.</li>
            <li>I have white outgrowth (roots) on the top and crown of my head, and grayish brown roots in the back.  </li>
            <li>it reminded me of strong overly hot smelling green tea.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 90 minutes and the result was rich, natural haircolor.</li>
            <li>I shampooed a bit and conditioned like normally-</li>
            <li>Gave it 4 stars due to the accurate description and prompt service.</li>
            <li>(For the last 1/2 hour I add Coconut oil to the mess and just gently try to get it on most of the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This powder will not dye your hair unless you already have white or very light gray or blonde hair - if so, you&#x27;ll see some yellow pigment in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my hair super shiny in a mix with other herbs and by itself.</li>
            <li>was packaged in November of 2014- its 9 months old.</li>
            <li>Far from &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>The opposite of what i really wanted.</li>
            <li>(I have SOFT water) Consistency of yogurt, and I add 1/2 teaspoon cloves to the 1 cup of cassia, for the smell.</li>
            <li>Just blop on a big handful, work it in gently, and rinse.</li>
            <li>Then I make narrow parts on the top of my head, then apply the cassia henna to the roots on top and crown of my head with a thin paint brush.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to all the chemical colourings.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am constantly trying out new products to cover my greys naturally.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, coarse hair, and this really helped smooth and condition it.</li>
            <li>My goal is to get a natural color without any of the purple hue that people get when they attempt to dye their hair red.</li>
            <li>First, i make 1/4 inch parts all over the back and lower sides of my head (NOT where I have white outgrowth), then apply blonde tint to the outgrowth only, and leave it on 30 minutes or so according to directions.  </li>
            <li>After an hour passes, I paint the remaining henna over my entire outer layers of hair, roots to end, let it sit for another hour,  and wash completely.  </li>
            <li>If/when I get highlighting done, it only looks natural with a yellow highlight vs a white highlight (if that makes any sense whatsoever).</li>
            <li>I have naturally auburn hair that is starting to grey around the temples.</li>

            <li> a plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and did a deep condition treatment yesterday (after letting my hair get dirty for a couple of days on purpose) with much success, my hair looks pretty darn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used blonde tint on my dark dishwater blonde hair all my life so that my long thick hair is medium to light blonde.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It covers my white and grey hair.</li>
            <li> I should have deep conditioned instead because the next day my hair was very dry and straw like.</li>
            <li> If you can wash your hair with soft water previous to treatment do it.</li>
            <li> P.s,my hair is almost 4 feet long.</li>
            <li> It took a year to get carrot orange out of a section of my hair that was not completely clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually, my hair is a bit frizzy immediately after the cassia conditioning, but, the next day, it&#x27;s thick, full of body and with tons of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mixed with only lemon juice to a thin yogurt consistency, leaving it on my roots for 2 hours, it completely changes my white roots to blonde...completely.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a bit dry</li>
            <li> Then I wash and dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t damage my hair, but it dried it out and the back was nest like before the deep condition treatment.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t damage my hair, but it dried it out and the back was nest like before the deep condition treatment.</li>
            <li> I literally only thought about the tattoos that last for a few weeks but comes off.</li>
            <li> was somehow disabled because my hair was white, so I have used Cassia on my white hair for about 2 years, every 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> So I mixed it with a little water.</li>
            <li> I have limp brittle hair from a medical condition.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that both the cassia and henna come in bags that are not resealable.</li>
            <li> I was just using the Henna powder and lemon juice, but that was getting too dark.  </li>
            <li> I have dark blonde/light brown hair.</li>
            <li> it dripped everywhere, even when my head was covered it dripped down my neck.</li>
            <li> Apply to slightly damp hair, wrap with a plastic cap, and leave on for an hour or so before rinsing out and shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix the Cassie with lemon juice and let it sit about a half hour.  </li>
            <li> The application of it was messy of course-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m not interested in coloring my hair (medium brunette, no gray), but I love the conditioning/thickening benefits of henna. Enter cassia, also called &amp;#34;neutral henna&amp;#34;, even though it&#x27;s not henna at all. This powder will not dye your hair unless you already have white or very light gray or blonde hair - if so, you&#x27;ll see some yellow pigment in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can mix this into a paste with water, until it has the consistency of yogurt or thick pancake batter, but I like to use canned coconut milk (preferably a brand without added thickeners). Apply to slightly damp hair, wrap with a plastic cap, and leave on for an hour or so before rinsing out and shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: You WILL smell somewhat pasture-y afterwards. Like fresh cut hay. I kind of like the smell, but you may not. Usually, my hair is a bit frizzy immediately after the cassia conditioning, but, the next day, it&#x27;s thick, full of body and with tons of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for this because the price is VERY good (plus Prime shipping!) for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally auburn hair that is starting to grey around the temples. I feel like I am constantly trying out new products to cover my greys naturally. This is my first experience using cassia, which I combined 1:1 with the 100% Pure &amp; Natural Henna Powder, also from The Henna Guys. My goal is to get a natural color without any of the purple hue that people get when they attempt to dye their hair red. I love being a redhead and want my hair color to appear natural. That being said, I have a lot of yellow in my hair and like it that way. If/when I get highlighting done, it only looks natural with a yellow highlight vs a white highlight (if that makes any sense whatsoever). The cassia seemed to be of very high quality and was finely sifted. It blended nicely with the henna. I left it on for about 90 minutes and the result was rich, natural haircolor. I did find that I had to go back and touch up the temple area two weeks later and about 3 weeks out the greys are still in hiding. I will order this again to combine with my henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that both the cassia and henna come in bags that are not resealable. I end up putting them in sealable sandwich bags.</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars due to the accurate description and prompt service. Trying it tonight, we&#x27;ll see what happens.</li>
            <li> I forgot how great henna makes your hair feel ,and the shine....whoa,get me out of the sunlight ! Easy to mix,faster then I remember to use start to finish. I read your test instructions,just so my hair didn&#x27;t fall out! Great stuff! I need MORE!  P.s,my hair is almost 4 feet long.THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair, and this really helped smooth and condition it. I even think it even slightly lightened/added subtle highlights to my hair (I have medium brown hair- you will tell a bigger color difference on blonde/gray hair).&lt;br /&gt;How I Applied&lt;br /&gt;I brewed some chamomile tea and mixed it with the Casia with a coated whisk until it was a smooth consistency. Then I put on gloves and applied the mixture immediately (if you are trying to use this as a dye on blonde or gray hair, let the mixture sit for 12 hours so that the dye will release) to my hair, section by section. I covered it with plastic and let it sit for 2 hours and then rinsed it out and shampooed. Love the results, will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I mix it with amla powder and hibiscus tea to make a hair conditioner. I also use it with henna to dye my hair a warm red color. The recipe I use is posted here: http://alwayshealing.org/herbal-hair-dye-recipies/</li>
            <li> I have been mixing this 50/50 with Organic Henna Leaf powder that I buy from Frontier, and Organic lemon juice.  Let it sit overnight and then put it on my roots outward.  Bag my head and let sit for an hour or more.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels soft and I love the color I get from the mix.  I was just using the Henna powder and lemon juice, but that was getting too dark.  This color is lighter.  I may even get to mixing it 70 Cassia 30 Henna and see if I get more of a strawberry blond color.&lt;br /&gt;It covers my white and grey hair.</li>
            <li> This Herbal Hair Conditioner (colorless henna aka Cassia Obovata) is easy to use and makes my hair look fantastic.  I mix with water to the consistency of yogurt, rub in in until my hair is covered with it, then put a shower cap (terrarium) over my hair for 30 minutes. My baby fine hair looks thicker when I use this once a month. It doesn&#x27;t stain my skin, my towel or my sink.  It truly is colorless because it doesn&#x27;t turn my silver streaks funky colors, but it does make the colour of my hair that isn&#x27;t silver yet look very rich.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Fresh Batch&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Mine was packaged in November of 2014- its 9 months old. Far from &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual powder, it&#x27;s OK. Smells like it should. Not bad, but the reason I purchased this particular Henna was because of the fresh factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will revise this review after I have actually used it this week- I hope the age doesn&#x27;t effect it&#x27;s usability. :/&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;*REVISION*&lt;br /&gt;The powder came out well when mixed with warm water- it took a while to get it to the right pudding consistency but once I had it, it stayed nice and smooth- the grassy smell didn&#x27;t bother me either. The application of it was messy of course- it dripped everywhere, even when my head was covered it dripped down my neck. But, I know it would be messy so nothing was stained or damaged because I was well armed with ugly towels and rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting it out was very troublesome- but I had added hibiscus powder which I believe made rinsing it out a pain- I don&#x27;t blame the Cassia itself. I rinsed with some silicone free conditioner to help get it out and after about 20 minutes in the shower it was out for the most part. I shampooed a bit and conditioned like normally- I should have deep conditioned instead because the next day my hair was very dry and straw like. :/ BUT it did make my naturally straight hair more straight so that was a plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and did a deep condition treatment yesterday (after letting my hair get dirty for a couple of days on purpose) with much success, my hair looks pretty darn good- but it&#x27;s still a bit dry which kind of bums me out&lt;br /&gt;I also used a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the remnants of the cassia and hibiscus so that helped too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it all over again I&#x27;d nix the hibiscus and just use the Cassia itself, then follow up with a really deep conditioner and avocado oil and just not touch my hair for a while. I really do think it helped to smooth my hair out- but I&#x27;d advise you to make sure you have a nice rich conditioner on hand to revitalize your locks afterwards. It didn&#x27;t damage my hair, but it dried it out and the back was nest like before the deep condition treatment. Still a bit dry, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll go away with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I use this (I have some left over) I&#x27;ll do it the way I described above and add to this review to see if the Cassia still dries out my hair- I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it again if it did, unless I really wanted to straighten it. It gets wavy from time to time which I don&#x27;t really like so we&#x27;ll just have to see how the next treatment goes (if and when).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also regarding the freshness, I apologize for any misinformation I received regarding the freshness of Cassia. I was told that fresh batches are considered at most 12 months old- so that&#x27;s why I thought that I received a dated one.ut- but I&#x27;d advise you to make sure you have a nice rich conditioner on hand to revitalize your locks afterwards.

            <li> .....i can literally cry. So,  My sister did a treatment on my hair which was supposed to give it curls but ended up making it super straight. The opposite of what i really wanted. I cried and tried what I thought was everything. I did a beer wash. Mayonnaise treatment. I just gave up hope.  I was doomed to have  straight hair for life. But then my cousin recommended henna. Call me naive of dumb I literally only thought about the tattoos that last for a few weeks but comes off. But I decided to give it a try. Hey,  what&#x27;s the worst that can happen I thought. So I mixed it with a little water. Some ginger and lemon tea. Coconut oil and almond oil. I prayed for the best. And after waiting my hair looked amazing. The only issue i had was waiting for hours to let the product sit in my hair but with my results...it was worth the wait. My suggestions. Treat this like a salon visit for a big event meaning make sure you have time to invest before thinking you can just do it and go. I love my results and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  I mixed 2:1 with henna, camamile tea, lemon juice, and lavender oil for a nice smelling strawberry blonde color.  Happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It conditions beautifully!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and packaging of item was great, no damage.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I guess I should weigh in on this. I got tired of people acting like I was somehow disabled because my hair was white, so I have used Cassia on my white hair for about 2 years, every 4-6 weeks. The resulting blonde is lovely honey gold from this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;BE SURE your hair is 100% clean. If you can wash your hair with soft water previous to treatment do it. Don&#x27;t use any products that have &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34; in the ingredients before you do the treatment. Trust me. If there is anything in/on your hair when you do this, you will have unreliable results. It took a year to get carrot orange out of a section of my hair that was not completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;So wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo, and rinse with vinegar. Simple. just do it.&lt;br /&gt;I mix cassia with warm/hot tap water. (I have SOFT water) Consistency of yogurt, and I add 1/2 teaspoon cloves to the 1 cup of cassia, for the smell. I don&#x27;t wait for developing, cassia doesn&#x27;t need it, but you can. Both ways give me color. Leave it on for 1 1/2 hours all together (longer time makes no difference in my experience). (For the last 1/2 hour I add Coconut oil to the mess and just gently try to get it on most of the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;You will need about 1/2 bottle of NO &amp;#34;CONE&amp;#34; conditioner to rinse it out. Just blop on a big handful, work it in gently, and rinse. You will need to do this at least 3 times to get it all out. Sometimes I shampoo, sometimes I just rinse. But I use oil, and I don&#x27;t shampoo if I can leave my hair greasy for a day of conditioning. But I wash it if I need my hair to be gorgeous right away.(Read all the ingredients on the conditioner. If you see ANYWHERE the suffix &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34; don&#x27;t use it during the application or removal of cassia. Cones are great for that slippery smooth feel, but they seal moisture out, so if you use them at all, keep that in mind.)&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Love the shine and healthy look and feel this goves my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used blonde tint on my dark dishwater blonde hair all my life so that my long thick hair is medium to light blonde.  I worry about irritation to my scalp and possible hair loss, so decided to try a henna product.  I have white outgrowth (roots) on the top and crown of my head, and grayish brown roots in the back.  I LOVE this product and use only this to touch up my roots on the top of my head.  Mixed with only lemon juice to a thin yogurt consistency, leaving it on my roots for 2 hours, it completely changes my white roots to blonde...completely.  The last hour I cover the rest of my hair (outer layer) with the cassia to enhance the color and condition my already blonde (from processing over the years )hair so it blends.  HOWEVER, this product will not lighten or change the color of my gray/brown outgrowth; so I still have to use a regular blonde tint on the roots of the rest of my head.  So, My hair project takes a few hours each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  First, i make 1/4 inch parts all over the back and lower sides of my head (NOT where I have white outgrowth), then apply blonde tint to the outgrowth only, and leave it on 30 minutes or so according to directions.  Then I wash and dry my hair.  Next I mix the Cassie with lemon juice and let it sit about a half hour.  Then I make narrow parts on the top of my head, then apply the cassia henna to the roots on top and crown of my head with a thin paint brush.  Letting it sit for an hour, the mixture cools my scalp.  After an hour passes, I paint the remaining henna over my entire outer layers of hair, roots to end, let it sit for another hour,  and wash completely.  It&#x27;s time consuming but perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Made my hair super shiny in a mix with other herbs and by itself.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde/light brown hair. I wanted to help &#x27;fade&#x27; my greys, not change my haircolour. I am sensitive to all the chemical colourings. I read about this, and decided to try it. DO YOUR HOMEWORK! I didn&#x27;t realize that there is a prep time of hours! This is not bad, just don&#x27;t expect to put this on, rinse your hair in 20 mins and go like you do with chemicals. I left mine on for 3 hours, and my greys somewhat turned blonde. However, my hair feels stronger and thicker, and more shiny- not greasy shiny- HEALTHY shiny! I have limp brittle hair from a medical condition. I usually wear a ponytail so I don&#x27;t have to deal witht he dull lifeless scraggly hair. This one treatment solved that! I cannot wait to treat it again, this time with knowledge that I gleaned from the interwebs. The smell is strong. it reminded me of strong overly hot smelling green tea. It also had me reminiscing of my childhood, playing in barns and hay. It ( scent) did not bother me, my kids noticed it, and commented. my greys were there, they just blended in better. Hopefully no one will notice becasue of my awesome healthy shiny hair now ! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for dandruff! I used it on my son &amp; the stuff totally cured his dandruff Imediately</li>
            <li> Helped my wife cure her dandruff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair look great after she started using it!</li>
