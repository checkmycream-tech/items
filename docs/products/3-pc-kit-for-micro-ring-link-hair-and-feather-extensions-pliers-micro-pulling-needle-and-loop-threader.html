            <li>I get that I paid less than 20$ for all three, but is it too much to ask for good quality and good pricing?</li>
            <li>, it is for wires not for micro rings, there are a special Pliers for the micro rings</li>

            <li>This product is easy to use, makes the hair look adorable in a quick simple stylish way.</li>
            <li>This is the full kit.</li>
            <li>and luckily I ordered another set of pliers (designed for micro-ring hair links) elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>The package came quickly, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but this order merits one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, all you need is any pliers to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>They did come very fast but the quality is garbage.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s exactly what I ordered in the pic.</li>
            <li>OK changed my mindon the three stars i give it a one the pliers broke the first day and the hook broke the next time i used it.</li>
            <li>The metal part just came straight out!</li>
            <li>This is a great product considering the cost &amp; It shipped earlier then expected.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>the loop broke fast.</li>
            <li>This set really helps when using micro extensions.</li>
            <li>I dont really need the pulling needle.</li>
            <li>other than that everything was ok</li>
            <li>other stuff included was ok</li>
            <li>The look was sooooooooooo bent that its pretty much completely unusable and the needle does not grip the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I seriously DO NOT recommend anyone buying this kit now because the only thing worth using is the pliers</li>
            <li>not only do the pliers look nothing like the ones in the picture except for the handles.. which where super glued on what looks like cheap regular pliers from a local home depot</li>
            <li>The pliers cut through the aluminums links unintentionally when I clamp too hard, and the threader broker while I was touching up my links.</li>
            <li>and I doubt I will even try to use them anywhere near my head.</li>
            <li>and I fixed it with hot-glue.</li>
            <li>Loop tool broke after second use, it doesn&#x27;t take much resistance to have it come out of the stick.</li>
            <li>finally i built up enough courage to just rip it right out</li>
            <li>The pliers nearly crushed the rings with a gentle clamping action.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive had these for a little over a month now and the only thing useful to me at this point is the pliers.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this is the clamp , which looks like the plyers however the the wooden tool to pull your hair through sucks and broke as soon as inusednitnitsnnot made well at all !!!</li>
            <li>The looper threading tool is made of a thin piece of metal that can be easily bent out of shape and get caught in your hair.</li>

            <li> now i cannot open them up when they are closed together unless i use both hands..</li>

            <li> At the end of the looping part that is hidden in the handle are the two ends of the long metal piece</li>
            <li> Idk what to do with the other tool it had no instructions</li>
            <li> The other pieces worked well.</li>
            <li> i get a message from amazon saying that the feedback has been removed due to it being considered a \\&quot;product review\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> the end, the purchase was not worth it</li>
            <li> so definitely beware of them, i find that very very shady.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had feedback removed simply because i decided to add on that the sellers product i received was not good quality.</li>
            <li> and when I received them, they were the dark brown ones!</li>
            <li> I did feedback for them and mentioned in it that although the purchase went fine, that the product is poor quality and dangerous to others and surprise surprise</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain much though because it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> This was not a good product.</li>
            <li> Its BROKEN GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> and it came out in a bloody mess.</li>
            <li> Terrible spend the extra money and get something that doesnt fall apart</li>
            <li> and this is just something set together and will cost you no more than 6 dollars when purchased separate .. not for the money , disappointed</li>
            <li> and it hurt so bad</li>
            <li> But if you rather not listen to my comment and buy it anyways, prepare to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I believe that if you&#x27;re selling a potentially dangerous product to people, THAT IS PART OF YOUR FEEDBACK as well as the products itself!</li>
            <li> but they were also broken!!!</li>
            <li> thats how worthless it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Pliers were dirty and smeared in some type of greasy WD40 type of liquid and had a terrible odor that lingered in my room for hours.</li>
            <li> terrible for your hair!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this so I could put feathers in my hair.  It is just what I needed and wanted.  It is easy to use and came quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the full kit. Everything u need except for the beads. I would recommend this to any stylist. But for professionals only.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Beader is to flexible needs to be more sturdy.  But all in all 👌👌</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 piece kit and what i got in the mail today just pisses me off. Its BROKEN GARBAGE. not only do the pliers look nothing like the ones in the picture except for the handles.. which where super glued on what looks like cheap regular pliers from a local home depot but they were also broken!!! once i took them out the little spring in the middle just fell into my lap.. now i cannot open them up when they are closed together unless i use both hands.. and what use is that. The look was sooooooooooo bent that its pretty much completely unusable and the needle does not grip the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i cant believe it but its like  KNOCK OFF!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please save yourself the headache and save your money and DO NOT purchase from this seller... i wouldnt buy this kit for a penny .. thats how worthless it is.</li>
            <li> This is a great product considering the cost &amp; It shipped earlier then expected. I wanted to try this method called the braidless sew in (got the idea from youtube) and i was able to achive this look with the help of this product:)</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!!!!!! The only good thing about this is the clamp , which looks like the plyers however the the wooden tool to pull your hair through sucks and broke as soon as inusednitnitsnnot made well at all !!!</li>
            <li> So cheap and the wire would not bend to be able to put a bead on...returned it..and the tool to squish the beads has no grip to grab the bead..slippery</li>
            <li> Excellent. Great Product. Fast delivery. This product is easy to use, makes the hair look adorable in a quick simple stylish way. The girls love it! We do recommend.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but this order merits one.&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;-fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;-pulling needle and threader are decent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;-Pliers are not designed for my micro rings (which are copper silicone 4mm).  The pliers nearly crushed the rings with a gentle clamping action.&lt;br /&gt;-Pliers were dirty and smeared in some type of greasy WD40 type of liquid and had a terrible odor that lingered in my room for hours. They looked used because there were scuff and scratch marks on the pliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the purchase was not worth it and luckily I ordered another set of pliers (designed for micro-ring hair links) elsewhere.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, can&#x27;t complain. I have not used it yet but it&#x27;s exactly what I ordered in the pic.</li>
            <li> the loop broke fast. other than that everything was ok</li>
            <li> The transaction and delivery were smooth but the items looked used and the crimper breaks the beads because they are pliers, I thought it was the actual bead crimper.</li>
            <li> these are not microbead pliers. jus some regular pliers put into a different package. terrible for your hair! other stuff included was ok</li>
            <li> This 3 piece Micro Ring link pliers are good quality, strong and easy to use, good price for all three. Would recommend for a beginner.</li>
            <li> This was not a good product. Every piece broke.I end up going to the store to get the same items. A wwaste of money.</li>
            <li> The hook is easiest to use. the pliers you could find in your hubbies tool chest. the loop worked also but not as easy a the hook</li>
            <li> OK changed my mindon the three stars i give it a one the pliers broke the first day and the hook broke the next time i used it. Terrible spend the extra money and get something that doesnt fall apart</li>
            <li> The pliers are nice Idk what to do with the other tool it had no instructions</li>
            <li> The package came quickly, nothing fancy. I ended up using just the pulling needle and the pliers. The pliers cut through the aluminums links unintentionally when I clamp too hard, and the threader broker while I was touching up my links. The metal part just came straight out! I get that I paid less than 20$ for all three, but is it too much to ask for good quality and good pricing?</li>
            <li> This set really helps when using micro extensions. It makes the process quicker. My suggestion is to wear gloves when you use them, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with blisters on your hands after awhile.</li>
            <li> This item is great. All the tools necessary to install hair extensions were in the kit. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This package comes with CHEAP tools that felt like I could brake in with my pinky. They did come very fast but the quality is garbage. I thought oh it&#x27;s a good pice and it looks like all I need but once I got them I couldn&#x27;t believe I just spend almost 20$ on these and I doubt I will even try to use them anywhere near my head. The looper threading tool is made of a thin piece of metal that can be easily bent out of shape and get caught in your hair. If you are looking for a threading tool you should just go the Sally&#x27;s beauty supplies or some beauty store to just buy some quality ones there. I would recommend a plastic loop instead of metal. But if you rather not listen to my comment and buy it anyways, prepare to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered these when I bought the loop extensions for breast cancer awareness month. Honestly, all you need is any pliers to do the same thing. They are clean and new which looks good to the customers but werent a neccessity.</li>
            <li> the micro ring Pliers is not what it should be since my hubby have it in the garage already , it is for wires not for micro rings, there are a special Pliers for the micro rings and this is just something set together and will cost you no more than 6 dollars when purchased separate .. not for the money , disappointed</li>
            <li> the tools broke when we tried to use them. granted they where cheap, so I guess you pay for what you get.. will I order these again NEVER!</li>
            <li> I needed links ASAP but I ordered light brown and when I received them, they were the dark brown ones! I decided to keep them but just make sure you know what you&#x27;re ordering. They work just fine. It&#x27;s just the color of them that is messed up because I believe I read another review on here saying the same thing?</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit to add feathers to my own hair and it did the trick but before I even got to use it one of the tools came apart and I fixed it with hot-glue. I can&#x27;t complain much though because it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> These are a must have if you are putting on micro bead extensions. I recommend these to anyone the quality is great and shipping is quick.</li>
            <li> Ordered the kit because it included the 3 pieces. Experienced a problem with the loop. It bent very easy but was still able to use. The other pieces worked well.</li>
            <li> product is cheap and flimsy the best thing from buying this are the pliars other than that the tools pretty much suck! dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> Loop tool broke after second use, it doesn&#x27;t take much resistance to have it come out of the stick.</li>
            <li> Ive had these for a little over a month now and the only thing useful to me at this point is the pliers. I dont really need the pulling needle. The looper, was great and worked well until recently when the looping part tore right out of the handle while i was trying to loop hair through a bead and it got stuck IN MY THUMB! I was literally panicking for like 20 minutes because i kept trying to pull it out of my thumb and it hurt so bad i couldnt! And it was only my 3rd time using it! At the end of the looping part that is hidden in the handle are the two ends of the long metal piece and they are curved in a U shape so when it came apart from the handle that is the part that sliced into my thumb and got stuck in there. finally i built up enough courage to just rip it right out and it came out in a bloody mess. I seriously DO NOT recommend anyone buying this kit now because the only thing worth using is the pliers and you can buy those separately anyways. But i seriously do not suggest anyone actually use or continue using the other 2 pieces because you just might get seriously hurt since it obviously isnt made very well at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! 5-20-13&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that if you DO decide to purchase this product, DO NOT BUY FROM SELLER SMART-CHOICE! I did feedback for them and mentioned in it that although the purchase went fine, that the product is poor quality and dangerous to others and surprise surprise i get a message from amazon saying that the feedback has been removed due to it being considered a \\&quot;product review\\&quot;. I believe that if you&#x27;re selling a potentially dangerous product to people, THAT IS PART OF YOUR FEEDBACK as well as the products itself! I now believe that seller is manipulating their feedback by getting rid of bad ones so they look better. so definitely beware of them, i find that very very shady. I have NEVER had feedback removed simply because i decided to add on that the sellers product i received was not good quality.
