            <li>It did incredible job whith the skin of my mum!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>I am soo happy with this product! :)</li>
            <li>BUT IT WORKS AND SMELLS GOOD.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product for more than a week now</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am more comfortable without make up.  </li>
            <li>but so far nothing I wish ppl would come up with a better solution for this problem</li>
            <li>I am overall satisfied.  </li>
            <li>No noticeable difference for the first 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Not sure what happened to my skin, but about 3 years ago it changed from perfect to less than pretty!</li>
            <li>IT TAKES 4-6 WEEKS TO SEE REAL RESULTS</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; is really watery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my product was expired or not, but the packaging looked very old and had a fair amount of dust.</li>
            <li>I seem to need less cover up; skin seems to have a more real skin color.</li>
            <li>I feel that my order may have been an expired or older batch, so that may have impacted any results I would have seen.</li>
            <li>I have broken capillaries on my nose and cheeks and was really hoping for good results but have seen none.</li>
            <li>I am very self conscious of it</li>
            <li>Hopefully the product is fresh and not old.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by that because it was coming from Europe, supposedly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing, Skin Doctor.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that&#x27;s changed is the bottom line of my bank account.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried so many different products and seen multiple dermatologists and was starting to think that the only option was laser surgery.</li>
            <li>was counting on better results with an even worse condition what I would have felt like?  </li>
            <li>it was irritating my skin even more.  </li>

            <li> it was irritating my skin even more.  </li>
            <li> My cheeks are far less red</li>
            <li> They appear to have become smaller and less red.  </li>
            <li> Last week I started to notice less redness in the overall skin tone on this side</li>
            <li> I think it will be a long time before I finish the jar because you only need a little bit</li>
            <li> The product arrived only a few days after I&#x27;d ordered it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a few red capillary veins that are showing.  </li>

            <li> I have a tiny cluster of broken capillaries below my eye, that would flare up and get very red often.</li>
            <li> It now has twenty bucks less in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin!&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow after just a few days.. I have less redness (lines are fading away) and smoother skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have little red lines (broken capillaries) on my cheeks &amp; around my nose</li>
            <li> After using this twice daily for one month I have noticed a difference in the broken capillaries in my face.  </li>
            <li> But I realize that I will have to keep using the cream, as broken capillaries can only be temporarily mended/strengthened, not removed (unless you go the surgery route, which may or may not even work).  </li>
            <li> I have used it consistently, everyday, and have seen no change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> am still using the cream regardless and seems to be doing the job for my broken facial capillaries.</li>
            <li> I feel that at this point in time I should have noticed at least a minor reduction in redness at the very least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they will eventually disappear</li>
            <li> And I was started to think my only alternative was&lt;br /&gt;going to be expensive laser surgery!  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but after using this product for 2 days I have already noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> I now bought it for a second time, because when she finished it and after a while the spot began to show up again, not as bad as it was, but still.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was really skeptical since I tried Vitamin K cream in the past, which I had to stop using&lt;br /&gt;since</li>
            <li> I have had broken capillaries on my cheeks and nose for years now, and have tried everthing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product does not work at all.</li>
            <li> So disappointing because I don&#x27;t have the money for laser treatment.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>

            <li> After using this twice daily for one month I have noticed a difference in the broken capillaries in my face.  They appear to have become smaller and less red.  I&#x27;m not sure if they will eventually disappear but I would reorder this when I run out because any help it gives I need!  I think it will be a long time before I finish the jar because you only need a little bit and there&#x27;s alot inside.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for me, and i have tried them all. Do not want them to discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> IT TAKES 4-6 WEEKS TO SEE REAL RESULTS BUT IT WORKS AND SMELLS GOOD. I HAVE USED IT AS A MOISTURIZER UNDER MY FOUNDATION. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE. I LIKE SKIN DOCTORS PRODUCTS AND IF USED AS DIRECTED RESULTS WILL BE SEEN.</li>
            <li> It takes time but it works!</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month.  Did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product and it is not doing anything at all for the capillaries as it proclaims</li>
            <li> The product arrived only a few days after I&#x27;d ordered it.  I was surprised by that because it was coming from Europe, supposedly.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway....I&#x27;ve been using this product as recommended, twice a day for the last four to five weeks and nothing&#x27;s changed.  Nada.&lt;br /&gt;Zilch.&lt;br /&gt;My condition isn&#x27;t even that problematic.  It&#x27;s just a few red capillary veins that are showing.  I can&#x27;t even imagine if&lt;br /&gt;I was counting on better results with an even worse condition what I would have felt like?  I guess the only way to get rid of this simple problem&lt;br /&gt;is do the laser bit.  Too bad. Thanks for nothing, Skin Doctor.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that&#x27;s changed is the bottom line of my bank account.  It now has twenty bucks less in it.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream just a few days ago and already starting to see some improvement!&lt;br /&gt;I have little red lines (broken capillaries) on my cheeks &amp; around my nose area.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have very fair skin I&#x27;m prone to getting these from heat, sun, age &amp; genetics.&lt;br /&gt;Wish somebody would have warned me about this when I was younger with Porcelain skin!&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow after just a few days.. I have less redness (lines are fading away) and smoother skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was really skeptical since I tried Vitamin K cream in the past, which I had to stop using&lt;br /&gt;since it was irritating my skin even more.  And I was started to think my only alternative was&lt;br /&gt;going to be expensive laser surgery!  So I&#x27;m hoping this will be the answer to my prayers!&lt;br /&gt;If so, I will continue to buy it.  I will keep you updated on results as I continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my product was expired or not, but the packaging looked very old and had a fair amount of dust. The tape around the package cracked when I tried to open it. The \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; is really watery. It makes my skin tingle a bit when I use it. I&#x27;ve been using it for one month now, and have yet to see any change whatsoever. I feel that my order may have been an expired or older batch, so that may have impacted any results I would have seen. Or maybe it takes longer than a month to notice any changes? I feel that at this point in time I should have noticed at least a minor reduction in redness at the very least.</li>
            <li> I just ordered another jar of this cream.  I have had broken capillaries on my cheeks and nose for years now, and have tried everthing.  I do think this cream works!  My cheeks are far less red and I am more comfortable without make up.  The capillaries on the sides of my nose are a bit stubborn, but the cream seems to help.  I am overall satisfied.  But I realize that I will have to keep using the cream, as broken capillaries can only be temporarily mended/strengthened, not removed (unless you go the surgery route, which may or may not even work).  Also, try to consume vitamin K by adding swiss chard into your diet.  This may help the process and cream routine as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product does not work at all. I have used it consistently, everyday, and have seen no change whatsoever. I have broken capillaries on my nose and cheeks and was really hoping for good results but have seen none. So disappointing because I don&#x27;t have the money for laser treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for more than a week now and I already can see the difference on my nose.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but after using this product for 2 days I have already noticed a difference! I have a tiny cluster of broken capillaries below my eye, that would flare up and get very red often. I am very self conscious of it and I have tried so many different products and seen multiple dermatologists and was starting to think that the only option was laser surgery. I am soo happy with this product! :)</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference for the first 3 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 on one side of my face only to see if it works. Last week I started to notice less redness in the overall skin tone on this side but the capillaries are still red and streaky. The directions say to use it for 6 weeks so we shall see...</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened to my skin, but about 3 years ago it changed from perfect to less than pretty! This product was recommended by a knowing pharmacist and I feel like my skin is going back to the way it was...</li>
            <li> the cream is very yellow in color compared to the last one I received whether that has any thing to do with the age  or the item&#x27;s shelf life. am still using the cream regardless and seems to be doing the job for my broken facial capillaries.Hopefully the product is fresh and not old.</li>
            <li> I bought the cream for my mother who had a big capillary spot on the face, and it did a miracle. I now bought it for a second time, because when she finished it and after a while the spot began to show up again, not as bad as it was, but still.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. It did incredible job whith the skin of my mum!</li>
            <li> Seems to work, but not dramatically.  I seem to need less cover up; skin seems to have a more real skin color.</li>
            <li> I been using this product and don&#x27;t see any improvements I was hoping for some but so far nothing I wish ppl would come up with a better solution for this problem</li>
