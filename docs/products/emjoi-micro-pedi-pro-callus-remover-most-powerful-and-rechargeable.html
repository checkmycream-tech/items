            <li>amazing really amazing</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>, It Is Amazing</li>
            <li>Happened to find mine at Costco with 3 rollers for a really good price :)</li>
            <li>Nice storage bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a very finicky shopper and this is the best product for smoothing the heel of your feet.  </li>
            <li>I wish this had a swivel head and could be used so one did not have to have handle being almost against area to work.&lt;br /&gt;Having a skin disorder and being in a chair it also would be nice to have a longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did work great after a bit of  a learning curve and produced nice smooth feet</li>
            <li>My husband needs this because of his line of work and it works the absolute best and quickest and you dont have to do to anything</li>
            <li>but it is something you can do at home, at your own time...</li>
            <li>Had the battery powered one and loved it, this one is even better.  </li>
            <li>NICE NOT TO THROW OUT</li>
            <li>Very well made and does excellent job.</li>
            <li>Its also cost effective, as it saves you on pedi.</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE THIS!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt my feet this smooth before&#x27; extremely satisfied!!</li>
            <li>I always tried to clean off my calluses; but this does a great job and it is approved by podiatrist....  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the first time I used it I was extremely impressed.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended product, works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Also  the best thing too about the pedi is that  its power operated and never loses power.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t use any kind of metal and has proven to be way more effective than a pumice stone.</li>
            <li>Great except for the rollers they wear off too quickly, expect to spend a lot on replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>Great value and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to pop the rollers in and out.</li>
            <li>makes it very easy for a partner to use.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi Micro-Pedi Foot Buffer is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my heels aren&#x27;t perfect yet -</li>
            <li>Liked the results from battery operated but love the results from corded version.</li>
            <li>this is the best one i&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I guess the best so far for my feet is the pedi egg.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad I went with this one</li>
            <li>Being in a warm climate, I wear sandals most of the year</li>
            <li>This proved to be the most productive instrument of this kind that I have used.  </li>
            <li>If you have any sort of calluses or any kind of buildup on your heels or even your toes, try this Emjoi out, I think you will love it just like I do.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and does an extremely good job.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, leaves feet feeling smooth and works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, just roll it across!</li>
            <li>I could pull layers of skin off my feet easily!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt your feet!</li>
            <li>The Micro-Pedi successfully, and fairly quickly, removes callused skin from the bottom of the foot.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Try it then decide, but if you do, keep the original packing stuff so you can return if needs be Good luck.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my feet were great again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly a great product that does exactly what it says that it&#x27;s going to.</li>
            <li>Great product highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>She still uses the hand buffer first but this buffer finishes it off great.  </li>
            <li>I was SO happy with this product at first, but after 2-3 months, it&#x27;s headed to the garbage.</li>
            <li>I just used my Micro-Pedi for the first time and it works great.</li>
            <li>I will use this even more, it is so easy!  </li>
            <li>This product is super!!  </li>
            <li>My feet are very smooth.</li>
            <li>My feet are now very smooth and better looking.</li>
            <li>love it wish I had got it sooner</li>
            <li>The more pressure you apply the greater results.</li>
            <li>Men will have to buy the more course sanding wheel.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>My heels have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I am REALLY glad I took the plunge and bought this tool.  </li>
            <li>i bought both battery and corded Emjoi machines as i wasn&#x27;t sure if there would be a power difference.</li>
            <li>either way i love them both.</li>
            <li>maybe a four-star rating is better deserved</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite foot tool.</li>
            <li>it is mostly plastic.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite gadgets ever.</li>
            <li>It works but it doesn&#x27;t produce any king of phenomenal results.  </li>
            <li>This pedi is amazing I love it, my feet stay so soft and its great for stubborn  calluses .</li>
            <li>and it is better</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I think this one is probably more ergonomical.</li>
            <li>When I saw this on T.v.; I wasn&#x27;t quite sure I would like it; but I ordered this one because it doesn&#x27;t use batteries; it has a plug in to plug in to a wall.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic Product!</li>
            <li>my feet were baby smooth!</li>
            <li>Take alot more than this wimp to take care of my feet .</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Does the job, but have discovered an even better and inexpesive product -- the pedi-planer tool, which is outstanding and reviewed separately.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad that I bought the &amp;#34;extreme coarse&amp;#34; refills.  </li>
            <li>Love the callus remover.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE THIS GADGET AND</li>
            <li>I  love this product .</li>
            <li>I have tried many things.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews, thought about it for a month.</li>
            <li>Love this product a lot</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I am looking forward to enjoying this product in the coming months.</li>
            <li>We love them all.</li>
            <li>I had the battery operated Emjoi Micro-Pedi and thought this would have even more oomph.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Each time I use it, I feel more confident.  </li>
            <li>Works way better than all others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Glad I got this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results I get and am recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially nice for the callous on the side of the big toe.</li>
            <li>The plug in one works much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than getting a pedicare.</li>
            <li>I love to rub my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I do not have to go to a salon any more</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries.</li>
            <li>This is a thousand times better and a hundred times cheaper.</li>
            <li>Love this device...</li>
            <li>this is my favorite find for 2014.  </li>
            <li>But I had not gotten a pedicure for a couple of months and love to go barefooted.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely glad I went with the power cord version vs. the battery one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done better with the foot files you can find in the dollar store.</li>
            <li>There has to be a better way.</li>
            <li>I got the corded ones, I read that they were better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it is electric.  </li>
            <li>I find myself using it weekly and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Now I can walk much better and my feet look much better, too.</li>
            <li>I use it 2-3 times per week because I like to stay on top of the skin build-up because I am on my feet 8+ hours a day at work.  </li>
            <li>but this is 1000 times better.  </li>
            <li>I think this is one of the all time best personal foot grooming products on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the pedi egg which was okay, but it took me forever to get my feet</li>
            <li>Plus I love the battery cover concept.</li>
            <li>They have made a PHENOMENAL product.</li>
            <li>makes my feet nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>One of the ten best tools I ever bought in my life.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that replacement sanders were included.</li>
            <li>I plan on gifting many of these this season.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love the lastest Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li>and I also felt the corded one probably had more power.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Great product ..works great fast delivery Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I sprung for the corded model because it is still a time consuming process, but</li>
            <li>Every time I use this, I can tell that I&#x27;m getting closer and closer to softer, better looking feet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I showed it to my sister-in-law, told her how pleased I was with it, and she immediately ordered herself one.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d put my pajamas on, and the &amp;#34;scales&amp;#34; on my feet would cling to the pants and sound like velcro!</li>
            <li>Flexitol works, but with the Emjoi, it will work even better.</li>
            <li>and they love it too</li>
            <li>Best personal beauty item ever!!!</li>
            <li>I thought with an egg-shaped one and battery-operated rotating head, it was ok, but I had reached to top of the heap.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I make sure to follow directions and use it without pressure.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it really works great</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am truly enjoying my Emhoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li>So often a product doesn&#x27;t perform as described but this item is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>What a fantastic purchase!</li>
            <li>I have tried many options to remove callouses from my feet</li>
            <li>I am sure to purchase another one soon.</li>
            <li>So pleased with the item I bought one for my daught</li>
            <li>There is no comparison - thisnis infintely better.  </li>
            <li>love this machine.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I needed more help than the pumice stone, and grater.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job than foot files</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love it and purchased one for my son.  </li>
            <li>, this product is all and more that it was advertised to be.</li>
            <li>and they love theirs too.  </li>
            <li>Was expecting a lot more.</li>
            <li>i love my feet now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I splurged</li>
            <li>&amp; I think the plug in is a much better option than battery operated.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I selected the corded model as I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries.  </li>
            <li>You or they will be pleased.</li>
            <li>Glad they came out with the corded variety since you never know when batteries are going to run out.  </li>
            <li>but I received it from the seller in a very timely manner and the packaging was in great shape.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to master the evenness of using it yet.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought the cord option.</li>
            <li>A 10-min walk barefoot on sandy ground would have worked better.</li>
            <li>I purchased from Amazon because I love the PRIME 2-day shipping.</li>
            <li>I am able to stretch out my visits to the salon for a pedicure and use this in between.  </li>
            <li>If you buy it you will love it.  </li>
            <li>The person who does your pedicures will love you for it.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to understand how best to hold it, but once you&#x27;re comfortable with it, you&#x27;ll find it very effective.</li>
            <li>It sands right through the calluses without a nic to the good skin.  </li>
            <li>Best thing i have bought in a long while, love them.</li>
            <li>so I could look at and feel my handy work and clean the debrided skin from the roller.</li>
            <li>This is great I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>Quick to use and better results than when I go to get a pedicure!</li>
            <li>I have been able to get some dry skin off toes and balls of the feet too, but it works best for heels.</li>
            <li>I love this product; it is amazing and does such a great job....</li>
            <li>I think for normal use this is great.  </li>
            <li>I bought the battery powered one first and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>My soles and heels look good for the first time in ages.</li>
            <li>Best product I have purchased in a long time I wish I had found it years ago..</li>
            <li>I have loved this gadget from the first time I used it</li>
            <li>It does what it says and does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>works pretty good...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good experience with Emjoi products, so I was willing to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>works very good would like roller to be a more coarse sandpaper roller</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and the results are significant.  </li>
            <li>EMJOI Micro-Pedi is easy to use, and does a better job since it has a battery, rather than rubbing by hand.  </li>
            <li>In the winter-time, my feet get so dry and flaky, and I use this before applying lotion, and my feet feel so awesome.  </li>
            <li>It is easy and safe.</li>
            <li>It would have taken my pedicurist a good 30 minutes to get that much skin off, and most of the time, they do not even do a job as well as this machine does.</li>
            <li>I still like it but for those of us with limited outlets (and space), I&#x27;d say the battery operated product is the best bet.</li>
            <li>She had used my wife&#x27;s so it pleased her fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with my calluses on my heels for ever, and purchased many other tools before, but this is the best!</li>
            <li>This thing should be renamed to OMGoi, after some time spent, my feet felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>it keeps my feet smooth and healthy looking between going out for pedicures.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised at all the great reviews this item is getting.</li>
            <li>Glad I have it available when I need it.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi Micro-Pedi was able to smooth my heels in MINUTES.  </li>
            <li>powerful and effective.  </li>
            <li>The gentle buzz of the roller was almost as good as a foot massage</li>
            <li>My wife loved this product very much,so she wanted to get another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I really like the foot pedi buffer and it does a really good job.</li>
            <li>Wow this thing is very handy.  </li>
            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for rough heels!</li>
            <li>This buffer is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Helps with stubborn calluses and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>With judicious pressure and time the callus is removed easily.</li>
            <li>The sanding cylinder is about the size of 4 miniature marshmallows and is easy to take off and put on.</li>
            <li>It is so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting more power for a plug in unit that advertise the as being the most powerful.  </li>
            <li>It is very quick and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Replacing the rotating cutter is exceptionally easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>I like this unit as the battery operated unit, from this company, stops too easily when applying pressure.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The rollers are easy to swap out.  </li>
            <li>How often have you been able to clean sandpaper?  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>this machine its really easy to do it and its faster.</li>
            <li>For someone with Arthritis this product made it easy to do my pedicure</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not too strong</li>
            <li>It is very fast and effective.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, but it is time for the price to come down.</li>
            <li>Easy to purchase refills are available in sets of two.  </li>
            <li>Really a fine airborne powder that looks like smoke.</li>
            <li>The roller grit that came with the item worked just fine for that (one on the gadget, one back-up, totaling 2 in the package).</li>
            <li>but it works fine.</li>
            <li>This is easy and comfortable to use, no pressure needed.  </li>
            <li>I feel that this should be viewed as a fine sander.</li>
            <li>Bought this product and it is absolutely fantastic, so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The sanding disc was a fine grade</li>
            <li>i love it very much!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and such great results.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased that I gave this a chance, it really helps keep on top of my callouses which grow very quickly.</li>
            <li>This little baby is one of the best products out there.  </li>
            <li>It worked wonders the very first time!</li>
            <li>This little thing is Awesome!</li>
            <li>this is awesome, my calluses are why I get a pedicure every 2-3 weeks, now I can stretch it out a bit longer and save a little cash.</li>
            <li>It works so very fast and easy!  </li>
            <li>One use can make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It does leave the feet looking smooth and afterward putting lotion on the feet leaves them even smoother.  </li>
            <li>but it is so much more powerful than the battery operated ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light and doesn&#x27;t require any sort of sturdy grip to hold onto it.</li>
            <li>My heels are smooth</li>
            <li>Great product and comes with a extra roller.</li>
            <li>anything more powerful would make you bleed.</li>
            <li>This one is definitely more powerful.  </li>
            <li>IT IS FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>And if you have smooth feet why are you ordering this?</li>
            <li>I probably use it once every 2 weeks just to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li>I have arthritic hands and the Pedi is light and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>I have used everything you can think of to try to keep my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light weight that it doesn&#x27;t need balancing.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>Within a 3 minute use on each foot, my ankles were smooth.</li>
            <li>Customers inferred that, because it had a power chord it would be more powerful.</li>
            <li>His feet never looked so smooth or felt it either.  </li>
            <li>Great Christmas present too!!</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Still like it&#x27;s continued power and the smooth heels;</li>
            <li>do such a great job.</li>
            <li>My feet feel smooth and I didn&#x27;t have to use a cheese grater type instrument.</li>

            <li>This corded version is so much better abd worth the price.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully for a few months then just stopped.</li>
            <li>It really does a nice job.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I gave my sister one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and even easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>home, more than worth the cost.</li>
            <li>My feet are extremely smooth and callus free with twice weekly use.</li>
            <li>I already own the battery operated model and I don&#x27;t like it, it goes through battery fast.</li>
            <li>This mighty machine leaves my heals smooth in no time.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>If you want ultra smooth feet</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more powerful being that it uses power from an outlet.  </li>
            <li>It works great but like with all these type things consistency is key.</li>
            <li>Fantastic item</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using some kind of mini metal grater on my feet and this is so much easier and nicer.  </li>
            <li>My feet will be smooth for about two days then they start peeling.</li>
            <li>I think this corded one is much more powerful than the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i do recommend this for smooth feet&lt;</li>
            <li>What a fantastic purchase!hen retire to bed.</li>
            <li>This device is fabulous--</li>
            <li>I now have smooth feet all the time, without lotions and socks at bedtime.  </li>
            <li>theyre so smooth.</li>
            <li>Rather, it is meant for someone who already has smooth feet and intends to maintain the smoothness.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to pick this up for anyone who likes smooth feet.</li>
            <li>More powerful than the battery operated model</li>
            <li>Use a really good moisturizing lotion for your feet and heels to keep the skin soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a great deal, on price as well as the ranking; then after buying one, I started reading reviews on the &amp;#34;Amop√© Pedi Perfect Electronic Pedicure Foot File&amp;#34; not only are there almost 4x  as many reviews, but they average higher in their ranking,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right now I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as described!!  </li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>I am 100 percent satisfied with this product and the fast, easy results of using it to get really smooth callous free feet.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Quick and painless, and easy  to use.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy and painless removal of calluses.  </li>
            <li>This product gets rid of callouses quick and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, efficient and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love this, got very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>I ever &amp;#34;buffed&amp;#34; them but I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t thrown out the original packing paper and box, I would have returned it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun to use!  </li>
            <li>Unlike the Ped-Egg that often left my feet sore, this product is excellent and it is completely pain free.  </li>
            <li>This model being sold was originally a CORDLESS model.</li>
            <li>I love it when a product works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to work.</li>
            <li>My feet would laugh at a pumice stone!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the expense!</li>
            <li>Love this product it does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>Mine looked 100% better after just the first use</li>
            <li>I originally saw this on HSN or QVC (can&#x27;t remember) and I was sold based off of that broadcast.  </li>
            <li>I read some of the positive reviewers commenting that you need to use a very light touch and believe me</li>
            <li>Loving this new power remover.</li>
            <li>feel super smooth.</li>
            <li>My feet are amazing smooth and soft now.  </li>
            <li>it is quite amazing at making your feet soft and smooth without causing pain and irritation while using.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, to the person who wrote about inability to clean.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect it to do something like clean itself.  </li>
            <li>Since Google is everyone&#x27;s friend and I was growing tired of spending more time on my feet than I do on vacuuming, I researched \\&quot;best callus remover\\&quot; which led me to Amazon and the Emjoi Callus Remover.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, she has used several types of foot care products, she said that this is by far the best item that she has tried on her feet!</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use and is super gentle.  </li>
            <li>Loving it so far!</li>
            <li>The Emjoi made my feet and heels soft and supple in one use..  Love it!</li>
            <li>I now have very smooth feet without much fuss.  </li>
            <li>Great to smooth those rough calluses on your feet but not for diabetics!  </li>
            <li>Plugged it in right away and smoothed my footsies!</li>
            <li>If you clean the rollers they will last a good while before replacing them.</li>
            <li>When I first took it out of the box, it felt light and somewhat cheap.  </li>
            <li>What people said about batteries is true -they</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for a full month with no issues</li>
            <li>I found a true friend...</li>
            <li>I heard good things about Emjoi from several people who bought another model that works with batteries.</li>
            <li>The company was very professsional and I intend to gift more of this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>something more substantial with reasonably priced refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good at smoothing nails and such, but my callouses are still there.  </li>
            <li>works more like a gentle buffer than a callous remover.</li>
            <li>good way to care for your feet properly at home and not run the risk of foot infection in a salon.</li>
            <li>This really makes your feet smooth after just one use!</li>
            <li>This is almost better than apple pie..not really....</li>
            <li>I love this thing so much, I got one for my mom.</li>
            <li>I work full time</li>
            <li>I loved this gizmo, BUT it only worked twice!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does the job better than any professional pedicure or product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Best thing ilve found so far for removing callouses and dry cracked feet and heels.</li>
            <li>It is super safe and gentle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;m saying:- your feet must be already looking clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Could use a little more power but works good and does the job.</li>
            <li>Works ok, but a a detail sander works much better and costs about the same.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.  </li>
            <li>QUICK SHIPPING..</li>
            <li>The sanding wheels are durable as well and do not wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be super to trade off using this on a friend and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it would be super to trade off using this on a friend and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most just do not work well-- pumice stones and the like are just messy and take a lot of rubbing to do any good at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied and would recommend both this product and the seller.</li>
            <li>It also cleans up really well and easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Living in Florida and pretty much always either wearing sandals or being barefoot, this is a must have device to keep your feet in tip top shape.  </li>
            <li>Good product takes all dry skin off</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use (even for seniors).</li>
            <li>It really works wonders and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is fast and easy and I won&#x27;t ever have to cut again.  </li>
            <li>hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my feet thus far.</li>
            <li>First buy this SofFeet CallusReducer, then buy this 3M-99440 Pro-Pak Drywall 100 Grit and for $20 you will have an awesome callus removing tool with enough refills to last 10 years!</li>
            <li>Much better than any professional pedicure!  </li>
            <li>I knew one of those battery operated sanders would never be strong enough, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance on this corded model.  </li>
            <li>The more pressure used, the less effective the Emjoi is at smoothing the heel.  </li>
            <li>it works fine and really smotthed out the skin in my feet...</li>
            <li>Love love thought the fowl would feel a little rougher but it works fine</li>
            <li>It does a great job with little effort.</li>
            <li>This really is a great little tool.  </li>
            <li>One of the best inventions ever for those of us who fight tough callus&#x27;s on our feet.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this product since the reviews I read BEFORE ordering it were positive and encouraging.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic,  it really does work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week but the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you had really rough feet, I&#x27;m sure it would take a few uses to see perfect results.</li>
            <li>It must be powerful, because I have rubbed that lady&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li>All you need is this and some foot cream for soft, callus free feet!</li>
            <li>Finally something that does the job nice</li>
            <li>Powerful and thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t run on batteries.</li>
            <li>It works great and is so fast at smoothing over the rough places on my feet.  </li>
            <li>Much better, easier, safer and cheaper than professional pedicures.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>I tried it once and after 30 minutes of use and wearing out 2 wheels I could see it was not going to be worth it</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says and just what I needed!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to anyone who loves a smooth foot bottom ;-)</li>
            <li>However, it is well worth the cost for me.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for anyone who does their own pedicures @</li>
            <li>Not too too powerful.</li>
            <li>If you think you will use this often then get the corded version it is very much worth it.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of different items from the brand EMJOI and they are all nice and work well.</li>
            <li>to quality, it&#x27;s at least as good as I&#x27;d expect in this price range, perhaps better.</li>
            <li>Fun thing to have.</li>
            <li>Works great, really gets rid of the rough skin.</li>
            <li>well worth the time.  </li>
            <li>This device is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Nice, but was constantly replacing batteries.  </li>
            <li>Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>Emjoi Micro-Pedi POWER-Callus Remover is nicely packaged with an extra roller, a cleaning brush and a drawstring travel bag.</li>
            <li>This item is worth buying.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this one by far out preforms anything I have used.</li>
            <li>If it does, it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I thought it would be for a corded unit.</li>
            <li>All well and good, but the pumicing and filing and shaving keep the soles and heels soft for 2-3 days at most, and then the calluses build up, thicken and get rough again.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and does such a fantastic job that I have recommended the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Power Callus Remover  to other family members who have purchased it for their very own..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip-the shavings are very fine,  be sure to lay down a towel to catch them.</li>
            <li>I went easy the first day, used it again for 3 days straight.</li>
            <li>However, it uses up batteries pretty quick</li>
            <li>The product arrived exactly as described, and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and makes my rough feet smooth as silk in no time.</li>
            <li>I use the extreme course on my heels followed by the roller that came in the package and the results are fair.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be the right choice because there is not loss of power that others have stated from the battery version.  </li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this on moist feet, after soaking your feet or right out of the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>so I wanted to put this to work right away.</li>
            <li>I am going to order replacement rollers right now</li>
            <li>What a great little product for helping keep feet smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Works very well, nice fit in the hand and takes a lot of dry skin off.</li>
            <li>By far, the best purchase I&#x27;ve made at Amazon (and I&#x27;ve made quite a few...)!  </li>
            <li>BEST THINK I HAVE SPENT MONEY ON IN A LONG WHILE.  </li>
            <li>This does EXACTLY what it says it does - and works far better than I&#x27;d anticipated.  </li>
            <li>It is written that you only get so many uses out of a roller, but I have found that to not be true.  </li>
            <li>Great product so far now I just need to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>A definite must have for all women who love to pamper their feet and keep them soft and smooth just in time for the warmer weather!</li>
            <li>It is far better than the amope pedicure machine and it cost only $5 more.  </li>
            <li>The coarse roller would be better for my heels, but now that I&#x27;ve tried this, the old way I&#x27;ve been doing this seems better for me.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this product my feet were so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Nice long cord, a snap to use.</li>
            <li>It left my heels feel smoother, but it did not eliminate the full layer of the calluses like a razor would, and my feet are not that callused to begin with!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with a little more practice and I will.  </li>
            <li>I have ticklish feet and getting a pedicure at a salon is pure torture!</li>
            <li>I have baby soft feet and its so easy to use.</li>
            <li>My verdict - it is OK for in between really well done pedis, where your calluses are removed completely.</li>
            <li>It leaves my heels silky smooth and soft !</li>
            <li>it took about 4  two for each foot,,,,,, the results are fantastic but you have to be very patient, it takes a while and it takes several inserts as they were out fast,,,,,, but if you&#x27;re okay by inserts</li>
            <li>VERY MUCH ..</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the price as it is heads above the rest, easy to hold onto and use at any angle, and powerful even on just two batteries....not changed them yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When instructions tells you skin contact 2-3 seconds that is exactly what it means you can be in tender skin very fast.  </li>
            <li>Dead skin comes off easily leaving your feet very smooth.  </li>
            <li>took forever to get here but exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>and this is the first time</li>
            <li>and this is the first tool that has made a difference.  </li>
            <li>I gave this  thing to my girlfriend and on her first use she made it known, she wasn&#x27;t giving up going to the salon.</li>
            <li>I still have to use it frequently to keep my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>Get your feet ready for sandal-wear!</li>
            <li>I needed a quicker way to keep my feet pretty &amp; sandal ready.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to watch about it getting hot &amp; burning</li>
            <li>, it sucks, this version works great but hope it&#x27;s a bit stronger</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I wasn&#x27;t experiencing it first hand.  </li>
            <li>They were so  smooth and soft when I finished using it.</li>
            <li>I used the Micro Pedi and instantly fell in Love with it ..</li>
            <li>Thanks Emjoi!</li>
            <li>Take it from me, your feet will be sandal ready after using this product!</li>
            <li>Works exactly like advertised.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a week to keep my feet pretty.</li>
            <li>We all must keep our feet pretty for summer sandals.</li>
            <li>Keeps them smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I will need to buy the more coarse rollers.  </li>
            <li>I have used this device 3 times so far, and each time I am amazed at how smooth it leaves my feet.</li>
            <li>for soft smooth feet.</li>
            <li>A bit expensive, but very impressed with performance.</li>
            <li>you will go through them fast!</li>
            <li>I first saw this on QVC and I thought I bet I can get it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>After I used it for the first time I was hooked.</li>
            <li>It is completely pain free.</li>
            <li>Read instructions first, not complicated</li>
            <li>I am not one bit impressed with this expensive $30 item.  </li>
            <li>Received it fast!</li>
            <li>but when this item has a fresh pair of batteries in it you really know the difference.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>At first, I thouought I installed the replacement head incorrectly, but even with nothing, it&#x27;s noisy.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>I have purchased several callus removing tools before, some better than others.  </li>
            <li>Leaves feet feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I think I lost 10 punds after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Bought the cordless one first.  </li>
            <li>I need a higher powered item.</li>
            <li>Plug it in and smooth soft heels again.  </li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>Feet can look good all year round.</li>
            <li>This electrical unit works great and doesn&#x27;t lose power like my old one did when the batteries were wearing down.  </li>
            <li>You have to use light pressure and move it around, and it isn&#x27;t as quick and using something with metal shaver blade (such as the &amp;#34;ped egg.&amp;#34;) It does leave the skin smoother and it is gentler, so no &amp;#34;gouging&amp;#34; the skin.  </li>
            <li>It really does get through the layers very quickly, and leaves it soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s more gentle than other electric exfoliators, &amp; it makes the feet feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>Very glad that I got the corded one so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of power half way thru a treatment</li>
            <li>The roller it comes with is good enough on its own, but i need some serious help.  </li>
            <li>Over three days I experienced only minimal results.  </li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT ON ROUGH SKIN ON MY FEET, AND ITS HAS ENOUGH POWER FOR MY BF&#x27;S FEET TOO.  </li>
            <li>I will suggest using an old toothbrush to clean the roller.</li>
            <li>Now second daughter wants one for her birthday in July, so I&#x27;ll be ordering one more.  </li>
            <li>and I will be back for more thanks julie</li>
            <li>tip, spend the extra money to get the Corded Model, the battery powered one probably would only be good for light-duty &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My soles look healthy for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>It delivery the right amount of power, if you press too hard it stop the moving roll, (a good thing as you shouldn&#x27;t press so</li>
            <li>When I ordered it, I probably debated whether I should spend 10 bucks more to get the newest pink model or the original, and decided to just go ahead and get the original blue one.</li>
            <li>I often sacrifice a really great pedicure in terms of the nail care because I really need a nail tech who will scrub, scrape, and exfoliate away the two large calluses on my big toes and the dry skin on my heels.  </li>
            <li>You need a consistent power supply to make this really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may finally have smooth heels for the first time in decades.</li>
            <li>To maintain the smoothness, the second time around was easy.</li>
            <li>Such a convenient and easy way to keep calluses from feet.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in years I finally have smooth feet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BE SURE TO START WITH DRY FEET.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put a towel or paper towel under your foot when using because the dry skin becomes a powder that falls to the floor, yuk.</li>
            <li>I think the ideal treatment, time permitting, would be to use the Emjoi as long as desired on dry feet, followed by a soak in warm, scented water, followed by an application of a thick lotion and then retire to bed.</li>
            <li>they were to pay my return shipping which they did not new one is working better</li>
            <li>I love that this does not need batteries and it has a pretty powerful little motor.</li>
            <li>Using this tool took a while, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t as laborious as using a buffing pad in the shower or in the tub.  </li>
            <li>I also had large calluses on my feet and a corn on my toe.  </li>
            <li>Last Wednesday, I spent 45 minutes with first the Ped Egg, then the 4 files and a good slathering of Eucerin cream for feet.</li>
            <li>The 3M sanding screens are exactly the same as the original, you just take some scissors and cut them to size.</li>
            <li>Not very powerful and the rollers are not going to help unless you have very smooth feet.</li>
            <li>Because I saw others compare it to electric razors, I thought it would be heavy and cumbersome but this thing feels amazing in the hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most useful as a foot smoother but don&#x27;t expect it to do heavy duty work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s just as described , fast shipping...</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>and i have to tell you this thing works very well,</li>
            <li>This thing works really well.</li>
            <li>She had been using sandpaper and a scrub brush type device, this is much nicer and easier on her heals and gives her the heals that she is looking for.</li>
            <li>Smooth feet finally and no cracks in my heels.</li>
            <li>And detail replacement sand paper is much much cheaper and lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>Because the replacement rollers are affordable,this isn&#x27;t a real concern.</li>
            <li>I think the rollers run out fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>the ones you get with batteries run out too fast, but not this one.</li>
            <li>For this price, i expected something that has more torque.</li>
            <li>Does&#x27;nt have much power&#x27; it stops.</li>
            <li>MY FEET ACTUALLY FEEL SMOOTH AFTER</li>
            <li>However, that is much faster and easier than the old-fashioned way.  </li>
            <li>It worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Skip the AA&#x27;s and the rechargeable batteries and go straight to the corded callus remover.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than filing my feet.  </li>
            <li>It works fast and well.</li>
            <li>VERY well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The power light is on in the device but totally dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to return now......</li>
            <li>Frankly, I expected more.</li>
            <li>Very disapointing in removing callouses.</li>
            <li>When it arrived my whole family decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li>but this might be very spendy to use.</li>
            <li>They are so much softer</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>A light touch is all that needed - well, that and a towel as it produces a lot of white powdery skin.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and will be recommending to all my friends who have rough feet.</li>
            <li>Much easier than using a stone to do.</li>
            <li>I received my micro pedi today, which the shipping was quite fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my feet</li>
            <li>really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I really like  the micro-pedi</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting my feet ready for summer and getting rid of the cracked heels that I seem to always get in winter.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li>I have one callus that was a real problem.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go through them that fast</li>
            <li>In no time at all my feet were silky smooth just like the commercial!  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that is too much to ask.</li>
            <li>This works very well eliminating calloused heels and bunions.</li>
            <li>I am so pleasantly surprised that I am using it nightly for the fun of it....</li>
            <li>and it was fast.</li>
            <li>Very effecient removal of calluses on my heels.</li>
            <li>feet felt fresh, soft, pampered and revived when I was through.</li>
            <li>It did the job really well.</li>
            <li>REALLY Bummed out!&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled, this product does not have much power at all.</li>
            <li>Works very well...</li>
            <li>It removed callus and left a smooth foot in its place.</li>
            <li>Surely professional salons must have a more commercial grade machine than this thing, that&#x27;s what I would look for,</li>
            <li>I use it at least once a month after a good 20 minute foot soak.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to clean&lt;br /&gt;the old skin off after each use and the roller will last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>There is no weak power from dying batteries</li>
            <li>It got my feet looking like normal peoples feet!</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what is wrong with some people - seems like no matter how great a product is, some people need to tear it down.  </li>
            <li>Simple to pop out the roller and clean.  </li>
            <li>I will be upgrading to the new electric version for that reason but it really does work very well.</li>
            <li>and apparently I was not taking care of the callouses right, though this might not be the case for everyone, as soon as I used the emjoi that whole business stopped.</li>
            <li>Finally someone got it right!  </li>
            <li>and this really helps keep my feet free of any dry skin.  </li>
            <li>gently sands away the dry skin and leaves your feet so smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe with the first use how soft my feet are.  </li>
            <li>I promise you, even if your feet look like elephant hoofs, you can have them looking, feeling, and smelling like brand new in no time!  </li>
            <li>even half way okay.</li>
            <li>I wanted a callus remover with a cord,as opposed to a battery,so power would be steady from start to finish.</li>
            <li>I just got this, there is seriously no reason not to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I used to do footcare for older adults.</li>
            <li>However, this is a slight inconvenience and a small price to pay for a very good product.</li>
            <li>I used to go to the doctor to have them removed, but they would come right back because I walk so much.  </li>
            <li>When I noticed that MY feet were starting to get a little less than perfect, I ordered this micro pedi.</li>
            <li>If it works for you then it&#x27;s great, but breaking down after just a short time is simply unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Since I was not gouging skin off my feet or digging down with a razor tool into tender new skin, rather just barely touching the roller to the foot</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the corded version.</li>
            <li>I bought a 20 dollar palm sander and some high grit paper.  </li>
            <li>HIGH QUALITY TOO.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product for anyone with either of these issues with their feet.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Made them very smooth in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with dry, scratchy skin on my feet my whole adult life and in about 10 minutes and I have soles as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>My feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum!!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s helpful to be able to choose to contour around the ares I need a little tougher as opposed to exfoliating cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but after a couple months use has completely died!!  </li>
            <li>I love this little machine...</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this little machine</li>
            <li>I have used this on the ever-dreaded soft corns very gently and have them completely gone when I was done.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this thing really works.</li>
            <li>Well, where has this been my whole adult life.  </li>
            <li>As a result of being a true \\&quot;barefoot girl\\&quot;, I have suffered with very unsightly rough heels and callouses.</li>
            <li>This product works very well and your feet are supper soft afterward.</li>
            <li>i ordered the green set of rollers because they are really course and to start the green ones work great.</li>
            <li>Makes my heels extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t take much work.</li>
            <li>Even if the rollers need regular replacement, I think this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>this one is well worth the extra $5.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definitely worth the extra money to have the corded version.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those who say this device doesn&#x27;t do a good job on extremely rough feet or feet that have been neglected for a while, you might need a bit of extra help, initially.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend the corded one that I bought as it remains powerful through it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>Finally a product worth buying...</li>
            <li>After the initial treatment, I think it will be quite easy to achieve and maintain desirable results by using this tool regularly.  </li>
            <li>:) They are calloused, dry and the cracks appear to be almost 1/4\\&quot; deep.</li>
            <li>and you will have baby soft feet worthy of any sandal or open shoe.</li>
            <li>When it arrived last night I tried it right out.</li>
            <li>and this is the first tool I have found to grind down that dry hard skin to where it is smooth and looks good.</li>
            <li>Bogs down easy.  </li>
            <li>and I have to change new batteries often.  </li>
            <li>I find myself inspecting my heel every day, hoping for new callouses</li>
            <li>I had the battery powered Emoji that works well when there are brand new batteries.</li>
            <li>did because now the exposed new skin is thinner.  </li>
            <li>the new skin</li>
            <li>I can put on a new pair of socks, and by the end of the day, they develop holes.</li>
            <li>cost me $10.+ to get new one</li>
            <li>yes, I did try putting in new batteries)</li>
            <li>Even though I get pedicures my heels and sides of my feet always feel rough, sometimes they crack.&lt;br /&gt;After using this just one time they are unbelievably soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>But after just one use my heels were smooth and presentable enough to wear sandals in public without embarrassment.</li>
            <li>Also, the supplier was very reasonably pricing the item and shipped it same day (Sunday)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, leaves you soft heels.</li>
            <li>I sure couldn&#x27;t have dead skin on my feet!</li>
            <li>I initially bought the other shape corded one but returned because I like the way this one feels better.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Just wow!  </li>
            <li>In fact, if you&#x27;re not careful, you can take too much off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>wish the rollers would last longer,but on the whole it eliminates getting a pedicure!</li>
            <li>In 1 use, soft as a baby&#x27;s bum!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I thought this product was terrific when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Makes my feet so soft!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to operate and simple to clean.</li>
            <li>This new version has a cord but is completely reliable and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>It took me less that 10 minutes to smooth both of my feet.</li>
            <li>Without bursting a blood vessel shouting obscenities at the screen while typing this, let me just say, this product is for actresses who had a rough movie shoot outside barefoot and wants to tidy up a bit for the red carpet later in the evening.</li>
            <li>This really takes off the dead skin quickly leaving feet very soft.  </li>
            <li>Love the electric aspect of it, very powerful and doesn&#x27;t slow down when it touches up against skin.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I bought the corded version as it seems the reviews were a little more mixed with the battery operated or rechargeable version.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this outstanding little gadget.</li>
            <li>The only issue is it&#x27;s a little messy, best to use it outside if possible.</li>
            <li>Works great, gets the calluses off without cutting my feet.</li>
            <li>They are gentle if used properly, and before i knew it my feet were soft, i do continue to put a foot cream on my feet at night to aid in the process.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised when it worked as well as it did thus the five-star rating.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to be put back into my pedi bag!</li>
            <li>My feet are now free of dried skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just got back to using a hand tool rather than ordering replacements since there isn&#x27;t much difference.</li>
            <li>(I gave my old one to my Mom.)</li>
            <li>I do prefer the shape of this one over the shape of the old one.</li>
            <li>Now that summer is near</li>
            <li>It removed dead skin within minutes and leaves your feet smooth.</li>
            <li>Then i use Avon lotion and my feet feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times so far.</li>
            <li>My feet are ready for next year though!</li>
            <li>Bought this thinking it would not work but got surprised....</li>
            <li>My feet are soooo soft after using this twice in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I will forever have soft feet.</li>
            <li>Work your way up to a comfortable amount of dead skin removal.  </li>
            <li>lotion can only penetrate so much and getting rid of the callouses</li>
            <li>and I cant get it fixed</li>
            <li>This model is considerably cheaper than the electric corded one.  </li>
            <li>I tell you this because they were no longer available for a few months</li>
            <li>Feet are extremely soft now.</li>
            <li>Also, you can get really course files for this one for around the heel and outside of the foot.  </li>
            <li>I only have the buffer and got so much junk off.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I get a professional pedicure every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I gently moved the roller all over my left heel for about 3 minutes, then stopped</li>
            <li>but I have never had such smooth feet as I have now in such a short time.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, and left my heels and the balls of my feet looking smoother and pinker than they have looked in years!  </li>
            <li>My feet actually feel &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; not tired.  </li>
            <li>This is so worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li>I had so much fun rejuvenating my feet that I spent about an hour on them.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I have used the same roller three times and it still has a few more uses in it.</li>
            <li>I applied a thick coat of my favorite lotion then put on socks to hold in the moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, durable, and it looks like the roller head will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many product to cure my cracking food heal due to heavy hiking, this product works really well, don&#x27;t buy the battery version</li>
            <li>you definitely want new batteries for this, but I have started using rechargeable ones, so they are always new.</li>
            <li>plug is not tight, it falls out...</li>
            <li>I now and for always will have nice soft feet and no more rough chapped heels in my summer sandals.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, especially for people like me that are too busy to make it in for pedicure appointments.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and small enough to store with my other foot products.</li>
            <li>then I would definitely purchase the super coarse rollers at the same time.</li>
            <li>Since it takes a while to grind down my feet calluses, the fact that the grinder power is constant is a huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the way - the blue roller is course and if you&#x27;re into being prepared, you can also purchase a twin pack of one course and one super course (pink) replacement rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid golfer and my feet (and hands) get quite rough.</li>
            <li>If you love feeling pampered, have hard to vanquish calluses, wear lots of backless or revealing shoes, are just a hedonist (or all of the aforementioned), this belongs in your foot care bag of tricks!</li>
            <li>If you love feeling pampered, have hard to vanquish calluses, wear lots of backless or revealing shoes, are just a hedonist (or all of the aforementioned), this belongs in your foot care bag of tricks!</li>
            <li>Put an old towel down on the floor while you&#x27;re using it; it&#x27;s kind of gross to see all that dead skin accumulating.  </li>
            <li>This is safer and less expensive than going to a salon and having it done for you and paying them a fortune over time to take care of something that you can do yourself and save all that cash for a new pair of shoes to show off how great your feet will  look just after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>It removes dry skin so much quicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long the rollers last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive that battery operated unit, but it&#x27;s always ready</li>
            <li>This is a must have that makes the job of removing rough spots, soft corns and callouses much easier than a foot file or pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>if you have rough feet, better order a few refills...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had rough, calloused and cracked heels my whole adult life.</li>
            <li>(pumice stones, kredo knives and even medicated disks), but nothing ever left the skin on my feet as soft as this machine did!</li>
            <li>It comes with two (2) blue rollers that are good, but maybe not coarse enough for very thick calluses.  </li>
            <li>I had tried from a friend but bought the other one because it was cheaper, but I believe it is worth paying the extra cash for this one.</li>
            <li>Powerful enough to remove the hardest callus.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your heel about 400 grit smooooooooth.&lt;br /&gt;Believe the other 5 star</li>
            <li>The machine feels weak and cheap in my opinion, I could not imagine it lasting any reasonable length of time and</li>
            <li>Can remove dry dead skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My feet were beyond bad, this greatly helped clear up the deep hurting cracks in my heels!</li>
            <li>the corn is just barely there.  </li>
            <li>I threw this thing so far outside, I swear someone in China got hit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I had it years ago all the walking in thongs and bare feet</li>
            <li>:-O  </li>
            <li>So when I opened the package and saw they had sent me the pink one I was absolutely overjoyed.</li>
            <li>But no pain, all gain....and baby soft skin that actually absorbs the lotion again.  </li>
            <li>It barely does anything to the callus on my feet.</li>
            <li>Not really, but this was so gentle and soothing</li>
            <li>it cleans dead skin and caluses in no time, and its truely worth buying,</li>
            <li>The motor will bog down if you apply too much pressure, but it takes a lot to completely stop the Emjoi from spinning.</li>
            <li>It did an OK job, but frequently bogged down as it ran out of battery power.  </li>
            <li>Not only was this easy, but I was astounded at the amount of dry, rough skin that was coming off so soon after my 45 minute routine of last week and the recent pedicure.</li>
            <li>It is quick and doing small amounts keeps you from overdoing a callus that can be cared for in this manner.</li>
            <li>Then you use this for final touch ups as those rough files can take off too much without enough warning leaving you with a too sensitive foot.</li>
            <li>This has the power to really take care of your feet without the damage you could sustain from some other products on the market.  </li>
            <li>Amazon seems to be selling for a much lower price then other sellers  </li>
            <li>Shipping took a long time, nine days, but it probably felt long because I was really anticipating its arrival.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products on my feet, including the expensive Diamancel foot files -- this is far better.  </li>
            <li>It is okay perhaps for those who have just a little bit of dry heels, in which case a regular $3 buffer would do, but not if you have very dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>Since I am sick of battery operated things, I went for the \\&quot;Most Powerful &amp; Corded\\&quot; model and it arrived today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Emjoi Micro-Pedi corded callus remover is easy to use, lightweight, and does an admirable job removing layers of hard, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m not sure that this is anymore powerful than the corded version it replaces.</li>
            <li>Once I use, I rinse my feet off with hot water and put some heavy duty lotion on.  </li>
            <li>This really does work, and it works well until the grinder and or the battery wear down.  </li>
            <li>It really gets down into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this every night and my feet remain soft, no calluses or dry cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>I spend so much less getting pedicures now because I don&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li>A pleasant surprise was that I used to be plagued by burning, painful feet at night</li>
            <li>My skin is super thick.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 of 5 stars is because if your feet are really rough like mind get, then you need to purchase the extreme coarse rollers as this unit comes with rollers that are good but not quite tough enough!</li>
            <li>the wheels are much too expensive for how quickly they wear out.</li>

            <li> Amazing wooooowwwwww‚ù§</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> amazing really amazing</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> , It Is Amazing</li>
            <li> Happened to find mine at Costco with 3 rollers for a really good price :)</li>
            <li> Nice storage bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a very finicky shopper and this is the best product for smoothing the heel of your feet.  </li>
            <li> I wish this had a swivel head and could be used so one did not have to have handle being almost against area to work.&lt;br /&gt;Having a skin disorder and being in a chair it also would be nice to have a longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did work great after a bit of  a learning curve and produced nice smooth feet</li>
            <li> My husband needs this because of his line of work and it works the absolute best and quickest and you dont have to do to anything</li>
            <li> but it is something you can do at home, at your own time...</li>
            <li> Had the battery powered one and loved it, this one is even better.  </li>
            <li> NICE NOT TO THROW OUT</li>
            <li> Very well made and does excellent job.</li>
            <li> Its also cost effective, as it saves you on pedi.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE THIS!!  </li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt my feet this smooth before&#x27; extremely satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I always tried to clean off my calluses; but this does a great job and it is approved by podiatrist....  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the first time I used it I was extremely impressed.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended product, works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Also  the best thing too about the pedi is that  its power operated and never loses power.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t use any kind of metal and has proven to be way more effective than a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Great except for the rollers they wear off too quickly, expect to spend a lot on replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Great value and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to pop the rollers in and out.</li>
            <li> makes it very easy for a partner to use.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro-Pedi Foot Buffer is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my heels aren&#x27;t perfect yet -</li>
            <li> Liked the results from battery operated but love the results from corded version.</li>
            <li> this is the best one i&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I guess the best so far for my feet is the pedi egg.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad I went with this one</li>
            <li> Being in a warm climate, I wear sandals most of the year</li>
            <li> This proved to be the most productive instrument of this kind that I have used.  </li>
            <li> If you have any sort of calluses or any kind of buildup on your heels or even your toes, try this Emjoi out, I think you will love it just like I do.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and does an extremely good job.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, leaves feet feeling smooth and works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, just roll it across!</li>
            <li> I could pull layers of skin off my feet easily!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt your feet!</li>
            <li> The Micro-Pedi successfully, and fairly quickly, removes callused skin from the bottom of the foot.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Try it then decide, but if you do, keep the original packing stuff so you can return if needs be Good luck.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my feet were great again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly a great product that does exactly what it says that it&#x27;s going to.</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> She still uses the hand buffer first but this buffer finishes it off great.  </li>
            <li> I was SO happy with this product at first, but after 2-3 months, it&#x27;s headed to the garbage.</li>
            <li> I just used my Micro-Pedi for the first time and it works great.</li>
            <li> I will use this even more, it is so easy!  </li>
            <li> This product is super!!  </li>
            <li> My feet are very smooth.</li>
            <li> My feet are now very smooth and better looking.</li>
            <li> love it wish I had got it sooner</li>
            <li> The more pressure you apply the greater results.</li>
            <li> Men will have to buy the more course sanding wheel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> My heels have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I am REALLY glad I took the plunge and bought this tool.  </li>
            <li> i bought both battery and corded Emjoi machines as i wasn&#x27;t sure if there would be a power difference.</li>
            <li> either way i love them both.</li>
            <li> maybe a four-star rating is better deserved</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite foot tool.</li>
            <li> it is mostly plastic.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite gadgets ever.</li>
            <li> It works but it doesn&#x27;t produce any king of phenomenal results.  </li>
            <li> This pedi is amazing I love it, my feet stay so soft and its great for stubborn  calluses .</li>
            <li> and it is better</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I think this one is probably more ergonomical.</li>
            <li> When I saw this on T.v.; I wasn&#x27;t quite sure I would like it; but I ordered this one because it doesn&#x27;t use batteries; it has a plug in to plug in to a wall.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!</li>
            <li> my feet were baby smooth!</li>
            <li> Take alot more than this wimp to take care of my feet .</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but have discovered an even better and inexpesive product -- the pedi-planer tool, which is outstanding and reviewed separately.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also glad that I bought the &amp;#34;extreme coarse&amp;#34; refills.  </li>
            <li> Love the callus remover.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS GADGET AND</li>
            <li> I  love this product .</li>
            <li> I have tried many things.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews, thought about it for a month.</li>
            <li> Love this product a lot</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to enjoying this product in the coming months.</li>
            <li> We love them all.</li>
            <li> I had the battery operated Emjoi Micro-Pedi and thought this would have even more oomph.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Each time I use it, I feel more confident.  </li>
            <li> Works way better than all others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results I get and am recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially nice for the callous on the side of the big toe.</li>
            <li> The plug in one works much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than getting a pedicare.</li>
            <li> I love to rub my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I do not have to go to a salon any more</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries.</li>
            <li> This is a thousand times better and a hundred times cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love this device...</li>
            <li> this is my favorite find for 2014.  </li>
            <li> But I had not gotten a pedicure for a couple of months and love to go barefooted.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely glad I went with the power cord version vs. the battery one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done better with the foot files you can find in the dollar store.</li>
            <li> There has to be a better way.</li>
            <li> I got the corded ones, I read that they were better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it is electric.  </li>
            <li> I find myself using it weekly and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Now I can walk much better and my feet look much better, too.</li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times per week because I like to stay on top of the skin build-up because I am on my feet 8+ hours a day at work.  </li>
            <li> but this is 1000 times better.  </li>
            <li> I think this is one of the all time best personal foot grooming products on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the pedi egg which was okay, but it took me forever to get my feet</li>
            <li> Plus I love the battery cover concept.</li>
            <li> They have made a PHENOMENAL product.</li>
            <li> makes my feet nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> One of the ten best tools I ever bought in my life.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that replacement sanders were included.</li>
            <li> I plan on gifting many of these this season.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Love the lastest Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> and I also felt the corded one probably had more power.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product ..works great fast delivery Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I sprung for the corded model because it is still a time consuming process, but</li>
            <li> Every time I use this, I can tell that I&#x27;m getting closer and closer to softer, better looking feet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I showed it to my sister-in-law, told her how pleased I was with it, and she immediately ordered herself one.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put my pajamas on, and the &amp;#34;scales&amp;#34; on my feet would cling to the pants and sound like velcro!</li>
            <li> Flexitol works, but with the Emjoi, it will work even better.</li>
            <li> and they love it too</li>
            <li> Best personal beauty item ever!!!</li>
            <li> I thought with an egg-shaped one and battery-operated rotating head, it was ok, but I had reached to top of the heap.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I make sure to follow directions and use it without pressure.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it really works great</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am truly enjoying my Emhoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> So often a product doesn&#x27;t perform as described but this item is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> What a fantastic purchase!</li>
            <li> I have tried many options to remove callouses from my feet</li>
            <li> I am sure to purchase another one soon.</li>
            <li> So pleased with the item I bought one for my daught</li>
            <li> There is no comparison - thisnis infintely better.  </li>
            <li> love this machine.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I needed more help than the pumice stone, and grater.  </li>
            <li> It does a better job than foot files</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love it and purchased one for my son.  </li>
            <li> , this product is all and more that it was advertised to be.</li>
            <li> and they love theirs too.  </li>
            <li> Was expecting a lot more.</li>
            <li> i love my feet now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I splurged</li>
            <li> &amp; I think the plug in is a much better option than battery operated.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I selected the corded model as I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries.  </li>
            <li> You or they will be pleased.</li>
            <li> Glad they came out with the corded variety since you never know when batteries are going to run out.  </li>
            <li> but I received it from the seller in a very timely manner and the packaging was in great shape.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to master the evenness of using it yet.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought the cord option.</li>
            <li> A 10-min walk barefoot on sandy ground would have worked better.</li>
            <li> I purchased from Amazon because I love the PRIME 2-day shipping.</li>
            <li> I am able to stretch out my visits to the salon for a pedicure and use this in between.  </li>
            <li> If you buy it you will love it.  </li>
            <li> The person who does your pedicures will love you for it.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to understand how best to hold it, but once you&#x27;re comfortable with it, you&#x27;ll find it very effective.</li>
            <li> It sands right through the calluses without a nic to the good skin.  </li>
            <li> Best thing i have bought in a long while, love them.</li>
            <li> so I could look at and feel my handy work and clean the debrided skin from the roller.</li>
            <li> This is great I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Quick to use and better results than when I go to get a pedicure!</li>
            <li> I have been able to get some dry skin off toes and balls of the feet too, but it works best for heels.</li>
            <li> I love this product; it is amazing and does such a great job....</li>
            <li> I think for normal use this is great.  </li>
            <li> I bought the battery powered one first and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> My soles and heels look good for the first time in ages.</li>
            <li> Best product I have purchased in a long time I wish I had found it years ago..</li>
            <li> I have loved this gadget from the first time I used it</li>
            <li> It does what it says and does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> works pretty good...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good experience with Emjoi products, so I was willing to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> works very good would like roller to be a more coarse sandpaper roller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, and the results are significant.  </li>
            <li> EMJOI Micro-Pedi is easy to use, and does a better job since it has a battery, rather than rubbing by hand.  </li>
            <li> In the winter-time, my feet get so dry and flaky, and I use this before applying lotion, and my feet feel so awesome.  </li>
            <li> It is easy and safe.</li>
            <li> It would have taken my pedicurist a good 30 minutes to get that much skin off, and most of the time, they do not even do a job as well as this machine does.</li>
            <li> I still like it but for those of us with limited outlets (and space), I&#x27;d say the battery operated product is the best bet.</li>
            <li> She had used my wife&#x27;s so it pleased her fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with my calluses on my heels for ever, and purchased many other tools before, but this is the best!</li>
            <li> This thing should be renamed to OMGoi, after some time spent, my feet felt wonderful.</li>
            <li> it keeps my feet smooth and healthy looking between going out for pedicures.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised at all the great reviews this item is getting.</li>
            <li> Glad I have it available when I need it.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro-Pedi was able to smooth my heels in MINUTES.  </li>
            <li> powerful and effective.  </li>
            <li> The gentle buzz of the roller was almost as good as a foot massage</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product very much,so she wanted to get another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I really like the foot pedi buffer and it does a really good job.</li>
            <li> Wow this thing is very handy.  </li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for rough heels!</li>
            <li> This buffer is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Helps with stubborn calluses and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> With judicious pressure and time the callus is removed easily.</li>
            <li> The sanding cylinder is about the size of 4 miniature marshmallows and is easy to take off and put on.</li>
            <li> It is so easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting more power for a plug in unit that advertise the as being the most powerful.  </li>
            <li> It is very quick and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Replacing the rotating cutter is exceptionally easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> I like this unit as the battery operated unit, from this company, stops too easily when applying pressure.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The rollers are easy to swap out.  </li>
            <li> How often have you been able to clean sandpaper?  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> this machine its really easy to do it and its faster.</li>
            <li> For someone with Arthritis this product made it easy to do my pedicure</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too strong</li>
            <li> It is very fast and effective.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, but it is time for the price to come down.</li>
            <li> Easy to purchase refills are available in sets of two.  </li>
            <li> Really a fine airborne powder that looks like smoke.</li>
            <li> The roller grit that came with the item worked just fine for that (one on the gadget, one back-up, totaling 2 in the package).</li>
            <li> but it works fine.</li>
            <li> This is easy and comfortable to use, no pressure needed.  </li>
            <li> I feel that this should be viewed as a fine sander.</li>
            <li> Bought this product and it is absolutely fantastic, so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The sanding disc was a fine grade</li>
            <li> i love it very much!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and such great results.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased that I gave this a chance, it really helps keep on top of my callouses which grow very quickly.</li>
            <li> This little baby is one of the best products out there.  </li>
            <li> It worked wonders the very first time!</li>
            <li> This little thing is Awesome!</li>
            <li> this is awesome, my calluses are why I get a pedicure every 2-3 weeks, now I can stretch it out a bit longer and save a little cash.</li>
            <li> It works so very fast and easy!  </li>
            <li> One use can make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It does leave the feet looking smooth and afterward putting lotion on the feet leaves them even smoother.  </li>
            <li> but it is so much more powerful than the battery operated ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely light and doesn&#x27;t require any sort of sturdy grip to hold onto it.</li>
            <li> My heels are smooth</li>
            <li> Great product and comes with a extra roller.</li>
            <li> anything more powerful would make you bleed.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely more powerful.  </li>
            <li> IT IS FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> And if you have smooth feet why are you ordering this?</li>
            <li> I probably use it once every 2 weeks just to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> I have arthritic hands and the Pedi is light and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> I have used everything you can think of to try to keep my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light weight that it doesn&#x27;t need balancing.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> Within a 3 minute use on each foot, my ankles were smooth.</li>
            <li> Customers inferred that, because it had a power chord it would be more powerful.</li>
            <li> His feet never looked so smooth or felt it either.  </li>
            <li> Great Christmas present too!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Still like it&#x27;s continued power and the smooth heels;</li>
            <li> do such a great job.</li>
            <li> My feet feel smooth and I didn&#x27;t have to use a cheese grater type instrument.</li>
            <li> Never has getting smooth feet</li>
            <li> My feet are smooth and the cracks are almost gone.  </li>
            <li> smooth feet.</li>
            <li> This corded version is so much better abd worth the price.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully for a few months then just stopped.</li>
            <li> It really does a nice job.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I gave my sister one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and even easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> home, more than worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My feet are extremely smooth and callus free with twice weekly use.</li>
            <li> I already own the battery operated model and I don&#x27;t like it, it goes through battery fast.</li>
            <li> This mighty machine leaves my heals smooth in no time.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.  </li>
            <li> If you want ultra smooth feet</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more powerful being that it uses power from an outlet.  </li>
            <li> It works great but like with all these type things consistency is key.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using some kind of mini metal grater on my feet and this is so much easier and nicer.  </li>
            <li> My feet will be smooth for about two days then they start peeling.</li>
            <li> I think this corded one is much more powerful than the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i do recommend this for smooth feet&lt;</li>
            <li> What a fantastic purchase!hen retire to bed.</li>
            <li> This device is fabulous--</li>
            <li> I now have smooth feet all the time, without lotions and socks at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> theyre so smooth.</li>
            <li> Rather, it is meant for someone who already has smooth feet and intends to maintain the smoothness.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to pick this up for anyone who likes smooth feet.</li>
            <li> More powerful than the battery operated model</li>
            <li> Use a really good moisturizing lotion for your feet and heels to keep the skin soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great deal, on price as well as the ranking; then after buying one, I started reading reviews on the &amp;#34;Amop√© Pedi Perfect Electronic Pedicure Foot File&amp;#34; not only are there almost 4x  as many reviews, but they average higher in their ranking,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> right now I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as described!!  </li>
            <li> It really works!!!</li>
            <li> I am 100 percent satisfied with this product and the fast, easy results of using it to get really smooth callous free feet.</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Quick and painless, and easy  to use.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy and painless removal of calluses.  </li>
            <li> This product gets rid of callouses quick and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, efficient and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this, got very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> I ever &amp;#34;buffed&amp;#34; them but I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t thrown out the original packing paper and box, I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fun to use!  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Ped-Egg that often left my feet sore, this product is excellent and it is completely pain free.  </li>
            <li> This model being sold was originally a CORDLESS model.</li>
            <li> I love it when a product works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to work.</li>
            <li> My feet would laugh at a pumice stone!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Well worth the expense!</li>
            <li> Love this product it does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> Mine looked 100% better after just the first use</li>
            <li> I originally saw this on HSN or QVC (can&#x27;t remember) and I was sold based off of that broadcast.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the positive reviewers commenting that you need to use a very light touch and believe me</li>
            <li> Loving this new power remover.</li>
            <li> feel super smooth.</li>
            <li> My feet are amazing smooth and soft now.  </li>
            <li> it is quite amazing at making your feet soft and smooth without causing pain and irritation while using.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, to the person who wrote about inability to clean.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect it to do something like clean itself.  </li>
            <li> Since Google is everyone&#x27;s friend and I was growing tired of spending more time on my feet than I do on vacuuming, I researched \\&quot;best callus remover\\&quot; which led me to Amazon and the Emjoi Callus Remover.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she has used several types of foot care products, she said that this is by far the best item that she has tried on her feet!</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and is super gentle.  </li>
            <li> Loving it so far!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi made my feet and heels soft and supple in one use..  Love it!</li>
            <li> I now have very smooth feet without much fuss.  </li>
            <li> Great to smooth those rough calluses on your feet but not for diabetics!  </li>
            <li> Plugged it in right away and smoothed my footsies!</li>
            <li> If you clean the rollers they will last a good while before replacing them.</li>
            <li> When I first took it out of the box, it felt light and somewhat cheap.  </li>
            <li> What people said about batteries is true -they</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a full month with no issues</li>
            <li> I found a true friend...</li>
            <li> I heard good things about Emjoi from several people who bought another model that works with batteries.</li>
            <li> The company was very professsional and I intend to gift more of this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> something more substantial with reasonably priced refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good at smoothing nails and such, but my callouses are still there.  </li>
            <li> works more like a gentle buffer than a callous remover.</li>
            <li> good way to care for your feet properly at home and not run the risk of foot infection in a salon.</li>
            <li> This really makes your feet smooth after just one use!</li>
            <li> This is almost better than apple pie..not really....</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much, I got one for my mom.</li>
            <li> I work full time</li>
            <li> I loved this gizmo, BUT it only worked twice!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the job better than any professional pedicure or product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Best thing ilve found so far for removing callouses and dry cracked feet and heels.</li>
            <li> It is super safe and gentle.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;m saying:- your feet must be already looking clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Could use a little more power but works good and does the job.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but a a detail sander works much better and costs about the same.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.  </li>
            <li> QUICK SHIPPING..</li>
            <li> The sanding wheels are durable as well and do not wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be super to trade off using this on a friend and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it would be super to trade off using this on a friend and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most just do not work well-- pumice stones and the like are just messy and take a lot of rubbing to do any good at all.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied and would recommend both this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> It also cleans up really well and easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in Florida and pretty much always either wearing sandals or being barefoot, this is a must have device to keep your feet in tip top shape.  </li>
            <li> Good product takes all dry skin off</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use (even for seniors).</li>
            <li> It really works wonders and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is fast and easy and I won&#x27;t ever have to cut again.  </li>
            <li> hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my feet thus far.</li>
            <li> First buy this SofFeet CallusReducer, then buy this 3M-99440 Pro-Pak Drywall 100 Grit and for $20 you will have an awesome callus removing tool with enough refills to last 10 years!</li>
            <li> Much better than any professional pedicure!  </li>
            <li> I knew one of those battery operated sanders would never be strong enough, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance on this corded model.  </li>
            <li> The more pressure used, the less effective the Emjoi is at smoothing the heel.  </li>
            <li> it works fine and really smotthed out the skin in my feet...</li>
            <li> Love love thought the fowl would feel a little rougher but it works fine</li>
            <li> It does a great job with little effort.</li>
            <li> This really is a great little tool.  </li>
            <li> One of the best inventions ever for those of us who fight tough callus&#x27;s on our feet.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product since the reviews I read BEFORE ordering it were positive and encouraging.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic,  it really does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week but the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you had really rough feet, I&#x27;m sure it would take a few uses to see perfect results.</li>
            <li> It must be powerful, because I have rubbed that lady&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li> All you need is this and some foot cream for soft, callus free feet!</li>
            <li> Finally something that does the job nice</li>
            <li> Powerful and thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t run on batteries.</li>
            <li> It works great and is so fast at smoothing over the rough places on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Much better, easier, safer and cheaper than professional pedicures.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I tried it once and after 30 minutes of use and wearing out 2 wheels I could see it was not going to be worth it</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says and just what I needed!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to anyone who loves a smooth foot bottom ;-)</li>
            <li> However, it is well worth the cost for me.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for anyone who does their own pedicures @</li>
            <li> Not too too powerful.</li>
            <li> If you think you will use this often then get the corded version it is very much worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of different items from the brand EMJOI and they are all nice and work well.</li>
            <li> to quality, it&#x27;s at least as good as I&#x27;d expect in this price range, perhaps better.</li>
            <li> Fun thing to have.</li>
            <li> Works great, really gets rid of the rough skin.</li>
            <li> well worth the time.  </li>
            <li> This device is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice, but was constantly replacing batteries.  </li>
            <li> Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> Emjoi Micro-Pedi POWER-Callus Remover is nicely packaged with an extra roller, a cleaning brush and a drawstring travel bag.</li>
            <li> This item is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this one by far out preforms anything I have used.</li>
            <li> If it does, it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be for a corded unit.</li>
            <li> All well and good, but the pumicing and filing and shaving keep the soles and heels soft for 2-3 days at most, and then the calluses build up, thicken and get rough again.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and does such a fantastic job that I have recommended the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Power Callus Remover  to other family members who have purchased it for their very own..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip-the shavings are very fine,  be sure to lay down a towel to catch them.</li>
            <li> I went easy the first day, used it again for 3 days straight.</li>
            <li> However, it uses up batteries pretty quick</li>
            <li> The product arrived exactly as described, and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and makes my rough feet smooth as silk in no time.</li>
            <li> I use the extreme course on my heels followed by the roller that came in the package and the results are fair.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be the right choice because there is not loss of power that others have stated from the battery version.  </li>
            <li> I was right.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this on moist feet, after soaking your feet or right out of the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so I wanted to put this to work right away.</li>
            <li> I am going to order replacement rollers right now</li>
            <li> What a great little product for helping keep feet smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Works very well, nice fit in the hand and takes a lot of dry skin off.</li>
            <li> By far, the best purchase I&#x27;ve made at Amazon (and I&#x27;ve made quite a few...)!  </li>
            <li> BEST THINK I HAVE SPENT MONEY ON IN A LONG WHILE.  </li>
            <li> This does EXACTLY what it says it does - and works far better than I&#x27;d anticipated.  </li>
            <li> It is written that you only get so many uses out of a roller, but I have found that to not be true.  </li>
            <li> Great product so far now I just need to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> A definite must have for all women who love to pamper their feet and keep them soft and smooth just in time for the warmer weather!</li>
            <li> It is far better than the amope pedicure machine and it cost only $5 more.  </li>
            <li> The coarse roller would be better for my heels, but now that I&#x27;ve tried this, the old way I&#x27;ve been doing this seems better for me.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this product my feet were so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Nice long cord, a snap to use.</li>
            <li> It left my heels feel smoother, but it did not eliminate the full layer of the calluses like a razor would, and my feet are not that callused to begin with!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with a little more practice and I will.  </li>
            <li> I have ticklish feet and getting a pedicure at a salon is pure torture!</li>
            <li> I have baby soft feet and its so easy to use.</li>
            <li> My verdict - it is OK for in between really well done pedis, where your calluses are removed completely.</li>
            <li> It leaves my heels silky smooth and soft !</li>
            <li> it took about 4  two for each foot,,,,,, the results are fantastic but you have to be very patient, it takes a while and it takes several inserts as they were out fast,,,,,, but if you&#x27;re okay by inserts</li>
            <li> VERY MUCH ..</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the price as it is heads above the rest, easy to hold onto and use at any angle, and powerful even on just two batteries....not changed them yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When instructions tells you skin contact 2-3 seconds that is exactly what it means you can be in tender skin very fast.  </li>
            <li> Dead skin comes off easily leaving your feet very smooth.  </li>
            <li> took forever to get here but exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> and this is the first time</li>
            <li> and this is the first tool that has made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I gave this  thing to my girlfriend and on her first use she made it known, she wasn&#x27;t giving up going to the salon.</li>
            <li> I still have to use it frequently to keep my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> Get your feet ready for sandal-wear!</li>
            <li> I needed a quicker way to keep my feet pretty &amp; sandal ready.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to watch about it getting hot &amp; burning</li>
            <li> , it sucks, this version works great but hope it&#x27;s a bit stronger</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I wasn&#x27;t experiencing it first hand.  </li>
            <li> They were so  smooth and soft when I finished using it.</li>
            <li> I used the Micro Pedi and instantly fell in Love with it ..</li>
            <li> Thanks Emjoi!</li>
            <li> Take it from me, your feet will be sandal ready after using this product!</li>
            <li> Works exactly like advertised.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a week to keep my feet pretty.</li>
            <li> We all must keep our feet pretty for summer sandals.</li>
            <li> Keeps them smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I will need to buy the more coarse rollers.  </li>
            <li> I have used this device 3 times so far, and each time I am amazed at how smooth it leaves my feet.</li>
            <li> for soft smooth feet.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but very impressed with performance.</li>
            <li> you will go through them fast!</li>
            <li> I first saw this on QVC and I thought I bet I can get it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After I used it for the first time I was hooked.</li>
            <li> It is completely pain free.</li>
            <li> Read instructions first, not complicated</li>
            <li> I am not one bit impressed with this expensive $30 item.  </li>
            <li> Received it fast!</li>
            <li> but when this item has a fresh pair of batteries in it you really know the difference.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> At first, I thouought I installed the replacement head incorrectly, but even with nothing, it&#x27;s noisy.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several callus removing tools before, some better than others.  </li>
            <li> Leaves feet feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I think I lost 10 punds after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Bought the cordless one first.  </li>
            <li> I need a higher powered item.</li>
            <li> Plug it in and smooth soft heels again.  </li>
            <li> Really!  </li>
            <li> Feet can look good all year round.</li>
            <li> This electrical unit works great and doesn&#x27;t lose power like my old one did when the batteries were wearing down.  </li>
            <li> You have to use light pressure and move it around, and it isn&#x27;t as quick and using something with metal shaver blade (such as the &amp;#34;ped egg.&amp;#34;) It does leave the skin smoother and it is gentler, so no &amp;#34;gouging&amp;#34; the skin.  </li>
            <li> It really does get through the layers very quickly, and leaves it soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s more gentle than other electric exfoliators, &amp; it makes the feet feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> Very glad that I got the corded one so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of power half way thru a treatment</li>
            <li> The roller it comes with is good enough on its own, but i need some serious help.  </li>
            <li> Over three days I experienced only minimal results.  </li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT ON ROUGH SKIN ON MY FEET, AND ITS HAS ENOUGH POWER FOR MY BF&#x27;S FEET TOO.  </li>
            <li> I will suggest using an old toothbrush to clean the roller.</li>
            <li> Now second daughter wants one for her birthday in July, so I&#x27;ll be ordering one more.  </li>
            <li> and I will be back for more thanks julie</li>
            <li> tip, spend the extra money to get the Corded Model, the battery powered one probably would only be good for light-duty &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My soles look healthy for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> It delivery the right amount of power, if you press too hard it stop the moving roll, (a good thing as you shouldn&#x27;t press so</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, I probably debated whether I should spend 10 bucks more to get the newest pink model or the original, and decided to just go ahead and get the original blue one.</li>
            <li> I often sacrifice a really great pedicure in terms of the nail care because I really need a nail tech who will scrub, scrape, and exfoliate away the two large calluses on my big toes and the dry skin on my heels.  </li>
            <li> You need a consistent power supply to make this really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may finally have smooth heels for the first time in decades.</li>
            <li> To maintain the smoothness, the second time around was easy.</li>
            <li> Such a convenient and easy way to keep calluses from feet.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in years I finally have smooth feet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE SURE TO START WITH DRY FEET.</li>
            <li> Be sure to put a towel or paper towel under your foot when using because the dry skin becomes a powder that falls to the floor, yuk.</li>
            <li> I think the ideal treatment, time permitting, would be to use the Emjoi as long as desired on dry feet, followed by a soak in warm, scented water, followed by an application of a thick lotion and then retire to bed.</li>
            <li> they were to pay my return shipping which they did not new one is working better</li>
            <li> I love that this does not need batteries and it has a pretty powerful little motor.</li>
            <li> Using this tool took a while, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t as laborious as using a buffing pad in the shower or in the tub.  </li>
            <li> I also had large calluses on my feet and a corn on my toe.  </li>
            <li> Last Wednesday, I spent 45 minutes with first the Ped Egg, then the 4 files and a good slathering of Eucerin cream for feet.</li>
            <li> The 3M sanding screens are exactly the same as the original, you just take some scissors and cut them to size.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful and the rollers are not going to help unless you have very smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Because I saw others compare it to electric razors, I thought it would be heavy and cumbersome but this thing feels amazing in the hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most useful as a foot smoother but don&#x27;t expect it to do heavy duty work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s just as described , fast shipping...</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> and i have to tell you this thing works very well,</li>
            <li> This thing works really well.</li>
            <li> She had been using sandpaper and a scrub brush type device, this is much nicer and easier on her heals and gives her the heals that she is looking for.</li>
            <li> Smooth feet finally and no cracks in my heels.</li>
            <li> And detail replacement sand paper is much much cheaper and lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> Because the replacement rollers are affordable,this isn&#x27;t a real concern.</li>
            <li> I think the rollers run out fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> the ones you get with batteries run out too fast, but not this one.</li>
            <li> For this price, i expected something that has more torque.</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;nt have much power&#x27; it stops.</li>
            <li> MY FEET ACTUALLY FEEL SMOOTH AFTER</li>
            <li> However, that is much faster and easier than the old-fashioned way.  </li>
            <li> It worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Skip the AA&#x27;s and the rechargeable batteries and go straight to the corded callus remover.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than filing my feet.  </li>
            <li> It works fast and well.</li>
            <li> VERY well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power light is on in the device but totally dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to return now......</li>
            <li> Frankly, I expected more.</li>
            <li> Very disapointing in removing callouses.</li>
            <li> When it arrived my whole family decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li> but this might be very spendy to use.</li>
            <li> They are so much softer</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> A light touch is all that needed - well, that and a towel as it produces a lot of white powdery skin.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and will be recommending to all my friends who have rough feet.</li>
            <li> Much easier than using a stone to do.</li>
            <li> I received my micro pedi today, which the shipping was quite fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my feet</li>
            <li> really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I really like  the micro-pedi</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting my feet ready for summer and getting rid of the cracked heels that I seem to always get in winter.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li> I have one callus that was a real problem.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go through them that fast</li>
            <li> In no time at all my feet were silky smooth just like the commercial!  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that is too much to ask.</li>
            <li> This works very well eliminating calloused heels and bunions.</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised that I am using it nightly for the fun of it....</li>
            <li> and it was fast.</li>
            <li> Very effecient removal of calluses on my heels.</li>
            <li> feet felt fresh, soft, pampered and revived when I was through.</li>
            <li> It did the job really well.</li>
            <li> REALLY Bummed out!&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, this product does not have much power at all.</li>
            <li> Works very well...</li>
            <li> It removed callus and left a smooth foot in its place.</li>
            <li> Surely professional salons must have a more commercial grade machine than this thing, that&#x27;s what I would look for,</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a month after a good 20 minute foot soak.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to clean&lt;br /&gt;the old skin off after each use and the roller will last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> There is no weak power from dying batteries</li>
            <li> It got my feet looking like normal peoples feet!</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what is wrong with some people - seems like no matter how great a product is, some people need to tear it down.  </li>
            <li> Simple to pop out the roller and clean.  </li>
            <li> I will be upgrading to the new electric version for that reason but it really does work very well.</li>
            <li> and apparently I was not taking care of the callouses right, though this might not be the case for everyone, as soon as I used the emjoi that whole business stopped.</li>
            <li> Finally someone got it right!  </li>
            <li> and this really helps keep my feet free of any dry skin.  </li>
            <li> gently sands away the dry skin and leaves your feet so smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe with the first use how soft my feet are.  </li>
            <li> I promise you, even if your feet look like elephant hoofs, you can have them looking, feeling, and smelling like brand new in no time!  </li>
            <li> even half way okay.</li>
            <li> I wanted a callus remover with a cord,as opposed to a battery,so power would be steady from start to finish.</li>
            <li> I just got this, there is seriously no reason not to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I used to do footcare for older adults.</li>
            <li> However, this is a slight inconvenience and a small price to pay for a very good product.</li>
            <li> I used to go to the doctor to have them removed, but they would come right back because I walk so much.  </li>
            <li> When I noticed that MY feet were starting to get a little less than perfect, I ordered this micro pedi.</li>
            <li> If it works for you then it&#x27;s great, but breaking down after just a short time is simply unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Since I was not gouging skin off my feet or digging down with a razor tool into tender new skin, rather just barely touching the roller to the foot</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the corded version.</li>
            <li> I bought a 20 dollar palm sander and some high grit paper.  </li>
            <li> HIGH QUALITY TOO.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product for anyone with either of these issues with their feet.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Made them very smooth in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with dry, scratchy skin on my feet my whole adult life and in about 10 minutes and I have soles as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> My feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum!!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s helpful to be able to choose to contour around the ares I need a little tougher as opposed to exfoliating cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but after a couple months use has completely died!!  </li>
            <li> I love this little machine...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this little machine</li>
            <li> I have used this on the ever-dreaded soft corns very gently and have them completely gone when I was done.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this thing really works.</li>
            <li> Well, where has this been my whole adult life.  </li>
            <li> As a result of being a true \\&quot;barefoot girl\\&quot;, I have suffered with very unsightly rough heels and callouses.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and your feet are supper soft afterward.</li>
            <li> i ordered the green set of rollers because they are really course and to start the green ones work great.</li>
            <li> Makes my heels extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t take much work.</li>
            <li> Even if the rollers need regular replacement, I think this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> this one is well worth the extra $5.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely worth the extra money to have the corded version.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those who say this device doesn&#x27;t do a good job on extremely rough feet or feet that have been neglected for a while, you might need a bit of extra help, initially.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend the corded one that I bought as it remains powerful through it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Finally a product worth buying...</li>
            <li> After the initial treatment, I think it will be quite easy to achieve and maintain desirable results by using this tool regularly.  </li>
            <li> :) They are calloused, dry and the cracks appear to be almost 1/4\\&quot; deep.</li>
            <li> and you will have baby soft feet worthy of any sandal or open shoe.</li>
            <li> When it arrived last night I tried it right out.</li>
            <li> and this is the first tool I have found to grind down that dry hard skin to where it is smooth and looks good.</li>
            <li> Bogs down easy.  </li>
            <li> and I have to change new batteries often.  </li>
            <li> I find myself inspecting my heel every day, hoping for new callouses</li>
            <li> I had the battery powered Emoji that works well when there are brand new batteries.</li>
            <li> did because now the exposed new skin is thinner.  </li>
            <li> the new skin</li>
            <li> I can put on a new pair of socks, and by the end of the day, they develop holes.</li>
            <li> cost me $10.+ to get new one</li>
            <li> yes, I did try putting in new batteries)</li>
            <li> Even though I get pedicures my heels and sides of my feet always feel rough, sometimes they crack.&lt;br /&gt;After using this just one time they are unbelievably soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> But after just one use my heels were smooth and presentable enough to wear sandals in public without embarrassment.</li>
            <li> Also, the supplier was very reasonably pricing the item and shipped it same day (Sunday)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, leaves you soft heels.</li>
            <li> I sure couldn&#x27;t have dead skin on my feet!</li>
            <li> I initially bought the other shape corded one but returned because I like the way this one feels better.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Just wow!  </li>
            <li> In fact, if you&#x27;re not careful, you can take too much off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> wish the rollers would last longer,but on the whole it eliminates getting a pedicure!</li>
            <li> In 1 use, soft as a baby&#x27;s bum!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was terrific when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet so soft!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to operate and simple to clean.</li>
            <li> This new version has a cord but is completely reliable and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It took me less that 10 minutes to smooth both of my feet.</li>
            <li> Without bursting a blood vessel shouting obscenities at the screen while typing this, let me just say, this product is for actresses who had a rough movie shoot outside barefoot and wants to tidy up a bit for the red carpet later in the evening.</li>
            <li> This really takes off the dead skin quickly leaving feet very soft.  </li>
            <li> Love the electric aspect of it, very powerful and doesn&#x27;t slow down when it touches up against skin.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I bought the corded version as it seems the reviews were a little more mixed with the battery operated or rechargeable version.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this outstanding little gadget.</li>
            <li> The only issue is it&#x27;s a little messy, best to use it outside if possible.</li>
            <li> Works great, gets the calluses off without cutting my feet.</li>
            <li> They are gentle if used properly, and before i knew it my feet were soft, i do continue to put a foot cream on my feet at night to aid in the process.</li>
            <li> but I was surprised when it worked as well as it did thus the five-star rating.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to be put back into my pedi bag!</li>
            <li> My feet are now free of dried skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just got back to using a hand tool rather than ordering replacements since there isn&#x27;t much difference.</li>
            <li> (I gave my old one to my Mom.)</li>
            <li> I do prefer the shape of this one over the shape of the old one.</li>
            <li> Now that summer is near</li>
            <li> It removed dead skin within minutes and leaves your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> Then i use Avon lotion and my feet feel really soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times so far.</li>
            <li> My feet are ready for next year though!</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it would not work but got surprised....</li>
            <li> My feet are soooo soft after using this twice in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I will forever have soft feet.</li>
            <li> Work your way up to a comfortable amount of dead skin removal.  </li>
            <li> lotion can only penetrate so much and getting rid of the callouses</li>
            <li> and I cant get it fixed</li>
            <li> This model is considerably cheaper than the electric corded one.  </li>
            <li> I tell you this because they were no longer available for a few months</li>
            <li> Feet are extremely soft now.</li>
            <li> Also, you can get really course files for this one for around the heel and outside of the foot.  </li>
            <li> I only have the buffer and got so much junk off.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I get a professional pedicure every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I gently moved the roller all over my left heel for about 3 minutes, then stopped</li>
            <li> but I have never had such smooth feet as I have now in such a short time.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle, and left my heels and the balls of my feet looking smoother and pinker than they have looked in years!  </li>
            <li> My feet actually feel &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; not tired.  </li>
            <li> This is so worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li> I had so much fun rejuvenating my feet that I spent about an hour on them.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I have used the same roller three times and it still has a few more uses in it.</li>
            <li> I applied a thick coat of my favorite lotion then put on socks to hold in the moisture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, durable, and it looks like the roller head will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many product to cure my cracking food heal due to heavy hiking, this product works really well, don&#x27;t buy the battery version</li>
            <li> you definitely want new batteries for this, but I have started using rechargeable ones, so they are always new.</li>
            <li> plug is not tight, it falls out...</li>
            <li> I now and for always will have nice soft feet and no more rough chapped heels in my summer sandals.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, especially for people like me that are too busy to make it in for pedicure appointments.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and small enough to store with my other foot products.</li>
            <li> then I would definitely purchase the super coarse rollers at the same time.</li>
            <li> Since it takes a while to grind down my feet calluses, the fact that the grinder power is constant is a huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the way - the blue roller is course and if you&#x27;re into being prepared, you can also purchase a twin pack of one course and one super course (pink) replacement rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid golfer and my feet (and hands) get quite rough.</li>
            <li> If you love feeling pampered, have hard to vanquish calluses, wear lots of backless or revealing shoes, are just a hedonist (or all of the aforementioned), this belongs in your foot care bag of tricks!</li>
            <li> If you love feeling pampered, have hard to vanquish calluses, wear lots of backless or revealing shoes, are just a hedonist (or all of the aforementioned), this belongs in your foot care bag of tricks!</li>
            <li> Put an old towel down on the floor while you&#x27;re using it; it&#x27;s kind of gross to see all that dead skin accumulating.  </li>
            <li> This is safer and less expensive than going to a salon and having it done for you and paying them a fortune over time to take care of something that you can do yourself and save all that cash for a new pair of shoes to show off how great your feet will  look just after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It removes dry skin so much quicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long the rollers last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive that battery operated unit, but it&#x27;s always ready</li>
            <li> This is a must have that makes the job of removing rough spots, soft corns and callouses much easier than a foot file or pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> if you have rough feet, better order a few refills...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had rough, calloused and cracked heels my whole adult life.</li>
            <li> (pumice stones, kredo knives and even medicated disks), but nothing ever left the skin on my feet as soft as this machine did!</li>
            <li> It comes with two (2) blue rollers that are good, but maybe not coarse enough for very thick calluses.  </li>
            <li> I had tried from a friend but bought the other one because it was cheaper, but I believe it is worth paying the extra cash for this one.</li>
            <li> Powerful enough to remove the hardest callus.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your heel about 400 grit smooooooooth.&lt;br /&gt;Believe the other 5 star</li>
            <li> The machine feels weak and cheap in my opinion, I could not imagine it lasting any reasonable length of time and</li>
            <li> Can remove dry dead skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My feet were beyond bad, this greatly helped clear up the deep hurting cracks in my heels!</li>
            <li> the corn is just barely there.  </li>
            <li> I threw this thing so far outside, I swear someone in China got hit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I had it years ago all the walking in thongs and bare feet</li>
            <li> :-O  </li>
            <li> So when I opened the package and saw they had sent me the pink one I was absolutely overjoyed.</li>
            <li> But no pain, all gain....and baby soft skin that actually absorbs the lotion again.  </li>
            <li> It barely does anything to the callus on my feet.</li>
            <li> Not really, but this was so gentle and soothing</li>
            <li> it cleans dead skin and caluses in no time, and its truely worth buying,</li>
            <li> The motor will bog down if you apply too much pressure, but it takes a lot to completely stop the Emjoi from spinning.</li>
            <li> It did an OK job, but frequently bogged down as it ran out of battery power.  </li>
            <li> Not only was this easy, but I was astounded at the amount of dry, rough skin that was coming off so soon after my 45 minute routine of last week and the recent pedicure.</li>
            <li> It is quick and doing small amounts keeps you from overdoing a callus that can be cared for in this manner.</li>
            <li> Then you use this for final touch ups as those rough files can take off too much without enough warning leaving you with a too sensitive foot.</li>
            <li> This has the power to really take care of your feet without the damage you could sustain from some other products on the market.  </li>
            <li> Amazon seems to be selling for a much lower price then other sellers  </li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time, nine days, but it probably felt long because I was really anticipating its arrival.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products on my feet, including the expensive Diamancel foot files -- this is far better.  </li>
            <li> It is okay perhaps for those who have just a little bit of dry heels, in which case a regular $3 buffer would do, but not if you have very dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> Since I am sick of battery operated things, I went for the \\&quot;Most Powerful &amp; Corded\\&quot; model and it arrived today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Emjoi Micro-Pedi corded callus remover is easy to use, lightweight, and does an admirable job removing layers of hard, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not sure that this is anymore powerful than the corded version it replaces.</li>
            <li> Once I use, I rinse my feet off with hot water and put some heavy duty lotion on.  </li>
            <li> This really does work, and it works well until the grinder and or the battery wear down.  </li>
            <li> It really gets down into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this every night and my feet remain soft, no calluses or dry cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> I spend so much less getting pedicures now because I don&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li> A pleasant surprise was that I used to be plagued by burning, painful feet at night</li>
            <li> My skin is super thick.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 of 5 stars is because if your feet are really rough like mind get, then you need to purchase the extreme coarse rollers as this unit comes with rollers that are good but not quite tough enough!</li>
            <li> the wheels are much too expensive for how quickly they wear out.</li>
            <li> Do not waste you time with other lotions.</li>
            <li> This tool is used on DRY feet, and you should work over a large beach towel or bath sheet to collect the white powdery residue it creates (dead skin).  </li>
            <li> This little gadget really removes calluses and dry cracked skin,a must have.</li>
            <li> This comes with two Extra Coarse rollers, but I purchased separately some EXTREME COARSE rollers, and used the included Extra Coarse rollers for smoothing.  </li>
            <li> It was a simple matter of running the thing back and forth over the calluses and dry areas of my feet.  </li>
            <li> I have flat feet, I am an overpronator, and I suffer from plantar fasciitis AND a heel spur.  </li>
            <li> and hopefully it will last for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been soaking my feet in hot water, then using a razor-blade callus remover to shave off the thick</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that i wish it wasn&#x27;t as gentle.</li>
            <li> My heels get really dry especially during the summer walking around the pool with no shoes on.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it goes through batteries fast.</li>
            <li> Very rough foot callouses should be filed down first with a rough manual callous scraping tool.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m single and there are no foot fetishists in my life who are longing to buff and file my feet on a daily basis and quite frankly, I am not up to doing it myself every day,</li>
            <li> have thick, tough calluses constantly forming on my big toes and this small tool does a good job of removing them.</li>
            <li> Nothing had worked in the past (short of a professional pedicure, which would last about a week before my heels were cracked and dry again).</li>
            <li> After a disastrous experience with the egg-shaped pedicure tool that left me unable to walk normally for a solid week, I&#x27;m loving this new tool.  </li>
            <li> Takes too long to get results.  </li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to try it.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have found before I spent countless dollars on pedi-eggs, spins, creams,gels, files, stones, etc.</li>
            <li> It took a long time coming, for what customs.</li>
            <li> (I think they are grey)  </li>
            <li> I bought the coarse rollers, but still this is not very helpful.</li>
            <li> and it softly sands away the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I do take the roller out after each use and rinse it off so that may explain why it&#x27;s lasted this long.</li>
            <li> Just start out slow because it really works.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product, having tried many many things on my horrible dry and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I have used the machine three times and only for about ten minutes or less each time.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I found annoying is how the manufacturer has labeled all their replacement wheels with some level of coarse, what&#x27;s wrong with fine, medium and coarse instead of coarse, extra coarse, extreme coarse and super coarse?</li>
            <li> I am embarrassed to admit I barely touched my feet throughout the winter and they were a mess.</li>
            <li> do get weak pretty soon</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how come it took me so long to find this thing!</li>
            <li> and I was extremely relaxed when I finished my feet and cleaned the roller for the last time before putting everything away in the travel bag.</li>
            <li> I use with the extreme coarse rollers.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product, for sure!</li>
            <li> DOESN‚ÄôT TAKE VERY LONG TO DO BOTH FEET.</li>
            <li> The motor labored, even when gently held against my heels; it wasn&#x27;t bad batteries as they were freshly charged Eneloops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even getting a pedi twice a month doesn&#x27;t take care of the dry areas like this Micro-Pedi does.  </li>
            <li> It does remove the skin as a dry, super-thin powder so you might want to use it with your feet in a plastic tub.</li>
            <li> After a callus removing session, I invariably still had dry bits of skin poking up.  </li>
            <li> I do prefer to use this on dry feet , not damp feet.</li>
            <li> My husband has DRY feet like an elephant, and this product worked wonders....</li>
            <li> It removes calluses and dry skin</li>
            <li> Dry?</li>
            <li> so I have dry skin on my extremities.</li>
            <li> so my feet are subjected to the elements year round and sometimes need some extra TLC for dry skin especially on my heels.</li>
            <li> I was addicted to the callous remover with the blade on it, but the bottoms of my feet get really uneven when I use them, so I still use that thing, but I use this to smooth my feet out after I use the blade.  </li>
            <li> spent, in total, about 10 minutes on each foot-heel, ball of the foot, outer edge of the big toe, outer edge of the little toe, instep.</li>
            <li> This works well but the blue sanding wheels included is not strong enough for men&#x27;s callus.</li>
            <li> I even spent extra money to purchase some of the &#x27;extreme&#x27; course refills.</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna turn this thing loose on it.</li>
            <li> You definitely want to use this on dry feet and you will need to use it over a towel or garbage can to catch the mess.  </li>
            <li> the product is corded , but it is not very strong,  also you need to order anywhere from 4 to 6 extra rotors of sandpaper just to do your feet,  </li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t remove dry skin let alone a callus!</li>
            <li> Plus it never really smoothed my dry feet.  </li>
            <li> A Corn Huskers type of product should be applied to feet that are chronically rough and dry.</li>
            <li> I previously had the battery operated model and it just wasn&#x27;t enough power and did eat batteries</li>
            <li> I have very dry heels from walking around barefoot in my home and</li>
            <li> Order replacements right away and for very hard callused  feet order the slightly coarser rollers.</li>
            <li> Where the cord plugs into the unit I have to be careful not to knock it loose</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different things to get rid of the callouses and dry dead skin on my heels.</li>
            <li> I am taking my time and using it a little bit every day and after a few days usage, wow...</li>
            <li> I chose the one that plugs directly into an outlet rather than the battery operated one after reading a review on the battery operated that stalls when pressed too hard.</li>
            <li> Removing a lot of the dead skin at one time may cause the new skin to crack worse than the older dead skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, and especially dry feet.  </li>
            <li> My heels wernt terrible but they wernt great either.  </li>
            <li> The thought of dead skin on feet is enough to make me toss my cookies.</li>
            <li> Makes my heels which are normally so rough</li>
            <li> I have some heavy calluses on both feet,do to not having boots for a period of time in the Jungle; I have tried different items to softened the calluses and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer if the roller were farther from the case so that it would reach harder to get to areas of the feet.</li>
            <li> My rough feet are gone.  </li>
            <li> I wear heels all day every day and they give me rough calluses.</li>
            <li> If you have rough feet</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Rough skin on feet</li>
            <li> I purchased the green coarse rollers as a supplement because winter destroys your feet.  </li>
            <li> My feet always get so rough after I have been at the beach.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my plan for the next go &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my plan for the next go &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> I do not have extra money to waste in this economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 20 years trying to find a way to heal my heels.  </li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WITH ROUGH SKIN</li>
            <li> EMOJI is not meant for someone with rough feet.</li>
            <li> My feet were so rough that I would scratch myself in my sleep when they would accidentally rub against each other.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and can do more with a simple pumice stone in seconds than using multiple roller refills.</li>
            <li> Works like it says and I got the electric powered because battery operated usually falls short of expectations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other callous removers (the egg-shaped thing, the one that looks like a cheese grater, etc.)</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used other power foot smoothers</li>
            <li> O&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s for your feet, as one compliments the  other.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty useless.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> Use this once a week or every other week</li>
            <li> I wear flip flops and backless shoes often enough to cause hard, rough calluses on my feet.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I can say that it \\&quot;polishes\\&quot; dry skin off your feet, rather than removes calluses.</li>
            <li> Only negative was a bill for import duty for some ¬£12, must read the small print in future.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with the Emjoi is small and not really well suited to the job, especially if you have heavy calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to work hard moving my arms back and forth.</li>
            <li> I was concerned by the negative reviews that it is not powerful enough but that turned out not to be an issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The roller didn&#x27;t last either, at least in my case, and would be cost-prohibitive.</li>
            <li> The device runs on batteries, so it&#x27;s not terribly powerful, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Saved my coarse, thick, cracking heels.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is why the roller area isn&#x27;t a lot larger - you could do your foot in half the time.</li>
            <li> For us, the grinder wore down after about three people used it twice.  </li>
            <li> my calluses are down to level with the rest of my skin and</li>
            <li> I can say, I could see how it would bog down with battery operation.</li>
            <li> I had bookmarked this item some time ago hoping the price would go down around the holidays and it did.</li>
            <li> Threw out all my other foot products!</li>
            <li> My feet are ROUGH!!</li>
            <li> I was going back and forth with a few other expensive  one&#x27;s and finally decided  on this</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to sit on the edge of the tub for half an hour sanding.</li>
            <li> Worked less than fifteen minutes and no return allowed.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try since it is less than the price on one pedicure.</li>
            <li> I also like the slightly longer size of this unit over my battery rated unit.  </li>
            <li> less time consuming...</li>
            <li> less effort ...</li>
            <li> less sweat..</li>
            <li> Well this baby did the job in less time than it takes to get a pedicure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, nor do I recommend if you have a lot of dryness, much less cracked heels.</li>
            <li> We have previously used the battery operated version of this and thought it was great.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I previously had a ped egg, never again.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the slightly courser rollers also.</li>
            <li> it does it take the skin from thick, dry and rough, to thick, dry and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a wimp, so I&#x27;ve just been using it a little bit every day, until I get them all the way down.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not a total barbarian, I do have an arsenal of Pedi Eggs, a Microplane Egg, a pumice stone with handle for the shower, one of those ultra rough, sponge like faux pumice rectangles one uses with soap, a deadly razor tool (for wet feet only!)</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with dry scaly feet with hard callouses.  </li>
            <li> I &#x27;smoked&#x27; one of them off a little while ago.</li>
            <li> I stand on my feet all day and nothing worked as well as this little machine.</li>
            <li> I reccomend doing a little at a time...and repeat it 3 to 4 days in a row.</li>
            <li> but you must follow the instructions and NOT press at all because it will cause little skin cuts of sorts.  </li>
            <li> One does not have to press or push or labor at using this little darling.</li>
            <li> This little beauty is the answer to my prayers.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this little gem.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the plug is not very secure where it attaches to the machine and at least once</li>
            <li> If your feet are in pretty bad shape, you will need to buy the other stones.</li>
            <li> I ordered the extra tough refills to go with it.</li>
            <li> My wife was skeptical, but after doing just one of her heels, it was clear to her that this device is a dream come true!&lt;br</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;The unit ins&#x27;t as heavy &amp; balanced as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I used the battery operated Emjoi for several years and was tired of having to replace batteries all the time.  </li>
            <li> I have never had anything work on the dead skin on my feet</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of investing in bulk packs of AA&#x27;s and decided to try a corded callus remover.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 10-15 minutes to remove all the dead skin and callous from my feet.</li>
            <li> ANYMORE WHEN YOU CAN DO YOUR ON IN JUST A FEW MINUTES WITH THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> After 4 treatments, I have yet to remove the dead, calloused skin from my heels and feet.</li>
            <li> I had to use it twice before I removed all the dead skin from my feet.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the corded one and the green replacement heads because I knew I would also have my grown son use this.  </li>
            <li> I used a pumice stone and foot soaks for a few weeks before using my Micro Pedi and I have no complaints with the results.</li>
            <li> I also agree with those who recommend the green rollers.</li>
            <li> I find the skin thickens every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if you have calluses.</li>
            <li> I had the battery operated version and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I got the one with the power cord.</li>
            <li> After a few reviews, I settle for the corded version.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and spring for the corded one.</li>
            <li> Living in San Diego I wear flip flops and sandals everyday.  </li>
            <li> However, after a few months it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I use this just about everyday</li>
            <li> It removes the dead skin.</li>
            <li> It takes off a mountain of dead skin</li>
            <li> As a committed barefooter, I have very rough, thick calluses.</li>
            <li> Regular use has substantially reduced the deep (and painful) crevassing that heavy callus areas can cause on the heels and sides of the feet.</li>
            <li> The dead skin was falling like winter snow in my living room, so I used a small tarp to ease the clean-up.  </li>
            <li> (though why the batteries would be bad after using it twice for such a short amount of time, I don&#x27;t know) - to no avail.  </li>
            <li> This little tool works wonders on my heels!</li>
            <li> This little machine has done wonders for smoothing/buffing my feet!  </li>
            <li> and I had some real rough feet!!  </li>
            <li> I have the softest, pinkest feet with very little effort.  </li>
            <li> The callus remover had very little to NO power.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s extremely noisy!!!</li>
            <li> No slowing down due to weak batteries!</li>
            <li> My feet have never been bad or really crusty but a couple of spots could use a bit of touch up.  </li>
            <li> After I use it (usually before bed), I slather lotion on my feet and put them in socks and pass out.</li>
            <li> I get impatient!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to every person I know, but I almost don&#x27;t want to because I want to keep this miracle tool a secret all for myself!</li>
            <li> Ooh this is probably going to be another useless product that I am going to have to send back...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else, BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I do small ...3 to 4 sweeps at one time on calluses.</li>
            <li> It is small and under powered.</li>
            <li> no more.</li>
            <li> Not sure why that happens.</li>
            <li> I complained and was told that I could either return it AT MY EXPENSE or get a few dollars off.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have (why it&#x27;s 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the buffing refill rollers are quite expensive and you have to replace them often.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Small and compact.</li>
            <li> Put those 2 together and they equal dry, cracking, callused and ugly heels.</li>
            <li> I have very thick calluses and this roller system works extremely well and reducing the calluses.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just sorry I waited so long to get it.</li>
            <li> Another sad thing was, when we pressed it down to the heel just a little bit, it stopped rotating altogether...</li>
            <li> The hard skin on the heel is merely just smoothed down just a little bit -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to press hard, it just does the job.</li>
            <li> cant go to hard or it stalls out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the device stops rotating, you&#x27;re pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad who loathes going for pedicures to remove the hard skin on his heels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve endured years and years of scraping, cutting, shaving, sanding, and filing my cracked, sometimes-bleeding, often-painful, gross heels.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift I can not tell you anything about the product since I do not own one.</li>
            <li> At 34.95 you would think that this would come with at least 2 rollers.</li>
            <li> Second point is that it should be chargeable instead of battery operated, as it is quite inconvenient and uses a lot of battery life.</li>
            <li> I have always had thick calluses on my heels and used a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> My heels are in such bad shape the Emjoi can&#x27;t keep up.</li>
            <li> still no good.</li>
            <li> I figured anything that did such an efficient job would somehow be painful.  </li>
            <li> Finally don&#x27;t have to worry about my dry and cracked heels that felt awful.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of pumice stones, scrapers, etc., and had to work hard to see any results...not with this!  </li>
            <li> I was truly amazed and also disgusted looking at all of the old dead skin this thing takes off.  </li>
            <li> I had one of those and they are weak.</li>
            <li> Of course I will still get my toes done but will not need expensive treatments for heavy calluses!</li>
            <li> Iv tried everything and until Emjoi my husband has complained about my \\&quot;flip flop Arizona feet\\&quot; for yeas!  </li>
            <li> It takes a lot of time to get through that tough callous on feet.</li>
            <li> Very slow product.</li>
            <li> One thing I will say is that if your heels are not that bad I noticed that they can be rough after you use this product.  </li>
            <li> Meanwhile my feet just got worse.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive and slow for what it does.</li>
            <li> and you are tired of the blades and</li>
            <li> but i have keep stroking and my girl would get tired after&lt;</li>
            <li> I have very tough heels and a bad back.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it would work for really bad calluses.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a corded tool, but it is very weak.</li>
            <li> No more pumice stones for me!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to it!</li>
            <li> I had horrible callouses as well as deep cracks in my heels that the Marianas Trench would have been envious of.</li>
            <li> The callouses were gone in minutes and the trench is now merely a gutter.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this Micro-Pedi</li>
            <li> It is absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the return time has expired and now I have a useless item in my possession.</li>
            <li> This thing is useless.</li>
            <li> - I am a man who often wears flip flops and feel I owe it to the public to not have disgusting feet.  </li>
            <li> It was utterly useless for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because I think that the replacement rollers are too expensive.  </li>
            <li> No more expensive salon pedicures save your money and do it yourself!!</li>
            <li> Are you people really seriously asking me to review this crap.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve become cynical about products made for sale in the U.</li>
            <li> but that would be messy and disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Unhappy with your feet??</li>
            <li> I saw this on youtube via Miss Crazy Tammy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> , u can&#x27;t go wrong with the corded model, the Mrs. loves it!</li>

            <li> I have especially bad calluses, very thick and painful to walk on.  </li>
            <li> I have corns so bad my feet ache.</li>
            <li> I had thought on getting a lotion type solution to slough off the bad skin</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, because she has bad calluses on her feet.  </li>
            <li> I would also like to say, if your feet are like really bad order the coarsest pedi roller.</li>
            <li> And believe me my feet were really bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clicking and popping so badly that I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> Maybe i got a bad one.</li>
            <li> Nothing ever worked, or it was to painful.</li>
            <li> 120 volt power with this guy.very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> took forever to get here but exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> Loving this new power remover. Should have bought it sooner. Worth the money. Well made and happy with this puchase.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does as advertised</li>
            <li> Love it!! My feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum!! I will save thousands of dollars on pedicures!!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very tough heels and a bad back. I have to go and pay for a pedicure every 4 weeks and by then my heels are cracking. This little tool works wonders on my heels! Takes off all the callous within about 7 minutes so I don&#x27;t have to sit on the edge of the tub for half an hour sanding. I LOVE this! I will buy another one for my son who also struggles with calloused heels! Thank you!</li>
            <li> love it wish I had got it sooner</li>
            <li> This is the best product! I may finally have smooth heels for the first time in decades.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s just as described , fast shipping...Thank You</li>
            <li> This buffer is so easy to use. It does a great job with little effort.The more pressure you apply the greater results. I would definately recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Helps with stubborn calluses and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This works well but the blue sanding wheels included is not strong enough for men&#x27;s callus. Men will have to buy the more course sanding wheel.</li>
            <li> Works well, but do NOT leave this thing in one place. You have to constantly move it or you will burn your foot with friction. Does a good job of smoothing calluses.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  My heels have never looked better.  It&#x27;s so easy to use.  I&#x27;m addicted to it!</li>
            <li> Takes too long to get results.  Over three days I experienced only minimal results.  Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> I am REALLY glad I took the plunge and bought this tool.  I have extremely dry skin, and especially dry feet.  I have flat feet, I am an overpronator, and I suffer from plantar fasciitis AND a heel spur.  I often sacrifice a really great pedicure in terms of the nail care because I really need a nail tech who will scrub, scrape, and exfoliate away the two large calluses on my big toes and the dry skin on my heels.  Using this tool took a while, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t as laborious as using a buffing pad in the shower or in the tub.  In fact, it was not laborious AT ALL.  It was a simple matter of running the thing back and forth over the calluses and dry areas of my feet.  This tool is used on DRY feet, and you should work over a large beach towel or bath sheet to collect the white powdery residue it creates (dead skin).  This comes with two Extra Coarse rollers, but I purchased separately some EXTREME COARSE rollers, and used the included Extra Coarse rollers for smoothing.  Nothing is perfect, but I saw a HUGE difference.  After the initial treatment, I think it will be quite easy to achieve and maintain desirable results by using this tool regularly.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, and the results are significant.  Even if the rollers need regular replacement, I think this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I got one and just now bought another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> What an incredible product!  And how did I ever get along without it before!  So easy to use and such great results.  Easy to purchase refills are available in sets of two.  What a great little product for helping keep feet smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> It does the job.  However, it uses up batteries pretty quick and I have to change new batteries often.  Otherwise, it is good and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does.  It is quick and easy to use.  My feet are now very smooth and better looking.</li>
            <li> My feet were beyond bad, this greatly helped clear up the deep hurting cracks in my heels!</li>
            <li> FACT: This really does work, and it works well until the grinder and or the battery wear down.  For us, the grinder wore down after about three people used it twice.  I was truly amazed and also disgusted looking at all of the old dead skin this thing takes off.  It does leave the feet looking smooth and afterward putting lotion on the feet leaves them even smoother.  For me, being diabetic I have to take care of my feet and this is the first time I ever &amp;#34;buffed&amp;#34; them but I am not disappointed.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Smokin&#x27;!!! It literally turned my corns and callouses into smoke! Really a fine airborne powder that looks like smoke. I have corns so bad my feet ache. I &#x27;smoked&#x27; one of them off a little while ago. A lot of relief. I am a guy too so I wear crummy shoes and get my feet wrecked up a lot. I am taking this thing with me! If I get any pain I&#x27;m gonna turn this thing loose on it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most wonderful devices. i bought both battery and corded Emjoi machines as i wasn&#x27;t sure if there would be a power difference. i cant say i notice one. either way i love them both. They are gentle if used properly, and before i knew it my feet were soft, i do continue to put a foot cream on my feet at night to aid in the process. Best thing i have bought in a long while, love them.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife Christmas of 2013 and she absolutely loves it. Yes you have to plug this in to a wall socket but it is so much more powerful than the battery operated ones. Well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I am blown away by how well this works.  I have struggled with dry, scratchy skin on my feet my whole adult life and in about 10 minutes and I have soles as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I noticed my socks did not catch as I put them on this morning.  After reading reviews, I bought the corded version as it seems the reviews were a little more mixed with the battery operated or rechargeable version.  You definitely want to use this on dry feet and you will need to use it over a towel or garbage can to catch the mess.  Buy this!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  Just buy it already.  It works perfectly at removing more callus than you could ever imagine.</li>
            <li> wife very happy need say any more</li>
            <li> The motor is weaker than I would like so maybe a four-star rating is better deserved but I was surprised when it worked as well as it did thus the five-star rating. (I&#x27;ve become cynical about products made for sale in the U. S.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, tough calluses constantly forming on my big toes and this small tool does a good job of removing them. With judicious pressure and time the callus is removed easily.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing. The sanding cylinder is about the size of 4 miniature marshmallows and is easy to take off and put on. This thing is feather-light. Because I saw others compare it to electric razors, I thought it would be heavy and cumbersome but this thing feels amazing in the hand. It&#x27;s extremely light and doesn&#x27;t require any sort of sturdy grip to hold onto it. The cord is ~ 6 feet just like others described. Don&#x27;t let its daintiness fool you though, as this thing is very effective. I had horrible callouses as well as deep cracks in my heels that the Marianas Trench would have been envious of. The roller grit that came with the item worked just fine for that (one on the gadget, one back-up, totaling 2 in the package). The callouses were gone in minutes and the trench is now merely a gutter. I find myself inspecting my heel every day, hoping for new callouses so I can use sand them away again. I definitely recommend this outstanding little gadget.</li>
            <li> This works so well...I love it!</li>
            <li> This products is excellent. I have always had thick calluses on my heels and used a pumice stone. This micro pedi worked wonders  and now I just have to do maintenance. I highly recommend this product. It is so easy. I like the plug-in versus battery type.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works like it says and I got the electric powered because battery operated usually falls short of expectations.  Electric was more costly but it works great.  My heels were like sandpaper and I destroyed a couple of bed sheets.  I also had large calluses on my feet and a corn on my toe.  I had thought on getting a lotion type solution to slough off the bad skin but that would be messy and disgusting.  I have used the machine three times and only for about ten minutes or less each time.  My heels are smooth my calluses are down to level with the rest of my skin and the corn is just barely there.  Great product and comes with a extra roller.</li>
            <li> My favorite foot tool. I have baby soft feet and its so easy to use.</li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting something stronger (metal I guess) it is mostly plastic. I used it last night and i have to tell you this thing works very well, anything more powerful would make you bleed. It delivery the right amount of power, if you press too hard it stop the moving roll, (a good thing as you shouldn&#x27;t press so hard)&lt;br /&gt;I always want to use one of my power tools on my feet but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had the battery operated version of this and was so happy to find the corded version. I bought this about a year ago, and it is still running perfectly. One of the best inventions ever for those of us who fight tough callus&#x27;s on our feet.</li>
            <li> This tool works great.</li>
            <li> I have a foot phobia, I think. The thought of dead skin on feet is enough to make me toss my cookies. When I noticed that MY feet were starting to get a little less than perfect, I ordered this micro pedi. I sure couldn&#x27;t have dead skin on my feet! And now I don&#x27;t. This thing works really well. I don&#x27;t have to press hard, it just does the job. After the first use, my feet were great again. I always use it and then put on lotion. I don&#x27;t have to use it often, maybe once a week, if that. When I&#x27;m redoing my nails, I just make it a part of my routine. After I use it (usually before bed), I slather lotion on my feet and put them in socks and pass out. My feet always look great. If you had really rough feet, I&#x27;m sure it would take a few uses to see perfect results. It also cleans up really well and easily. Just rinse it all with water and it&#x27;s ready to be put back into my pedi bag!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s prefect!! i love it very much! EXCELLENT product!</li>
            <li> This is my second Emjoi Pedi.  I bought the battery powered one first and loved it.  This one is definitely more powerful.  I also bought the accessory pack and it works great with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, because she has bad calluses on her feet.  She loves it and says that it works amazingly!  It must be powerful, because I have rubbed that lady&#x27;s feet and I thought it would take a belt sander to do the job.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! The only reason I gave it 4 of 5 stars is because if your feet are really rough like mind get, then you need to purchase the extreme coarse rollers as this unit comes with rollers that are good but not quite tough enough!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pedi Power (corded) it works great, u can&#x27;t go wrong with the corded model, the Mrs. loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this device! I&#x27;ve been struggling with my calluses on my heels for ever, and purchased many other tools before, but this is the best! It took me a while to achieve the desired result when I used it for the first time, but me heels looked awesome. To maintain the smoothness, the second time around was easy. I highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> She likes it!  She had been using sandpaper and a scrub brush type device, this is much nicer and easier on her heals and gives her the heals that she is looking for.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to do by hand, but this thing makes short work of foot sanding.</li>
            <li> Items received as described.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite gadgets ever. Luv luv luv it. Smooth feet finally and no cracks in my heels. Ahhhh relief at last.</li>
            <li> saves money on pedies</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Love it!! Thank you for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Works ok, but a a detail sander works much better and costs about the same.  And detail replacement sand paper is much much cheaper and lasts a lot longer.  But then I am a guy and am not into dainty things.</li>
            <li> IT IS FANTASTIC. MY FEET LOOK GREAT FOR A LONGER TIME IN BETWEEN PEDICURES.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic,  it really does work. Makes my heels which are normally so rough I could cut glass feel super smooth. I love this!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but it is time for the price to come down. Makes it easier to groom your feet.</li>
            <li> Great product. I wanted a callus remover with a cord,as opposed to a battery,so power would be steady from start to finish.This does the job. I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long the rollers last.Because the replacement rollers are affordable,this isn&#x27;t a real concern.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried what seems like everything and this is the first tool that has made a difference.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my heels aren&#x27;t perfect yet - but what an improvement!  Highly recommend it, especially for people like me that are too busy to make it in for pedicure appointments.  Happened to find mine at Costco with 3 rollers for a really good price :)</li>
            <li> could not hold up for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best product to this date that I have bought to help remove my calluses. Would reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of time and money. Not very powerful and the rollers are not going to help unless you have very smooth feet. And if you have smooth feet why are you ordering this? I am very disappointed and can do more with a simple pumice stone in seconds than using multiple roller refills.</li>
            <li> So glad this was given to me as a Christmas gift, works great and has helped me improve my heals. I probably use it once every 2 weeks just to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product, it works.  I was concerned by the negative reviews that it is not powerful enough but that turned out not to be an issue.  My feet are now free of dried skin.</li>
            <li> I would probably recommend just buying a hand tool.  It works but it doesn&#x27;t produce any king of phenomenal results.  I think the rollers run out fast.  I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times and it seems like the roller already needs replaced.  I&#x27;ll probably just got back to using a hand tool rather than ordering replacements since there isn&#x27;t much difference.</li>
            <li> This pedi is amazing I love it, my feet stay so soft and its great for stubborn  calluses . It was a great purchase, so happy I purchased  this cause I was going back and forth with a few other expensive  one&#x27;s and finally decided  on this and it is better then I thought!!</li>
            <li> Ordered one for myself, loved it.  My daughter wanted one for her birthday, ordered it sent it to her, she loves it.  Now second daughter wants one for her birthday in July, so I&#x27;ll be ordering one more.  I like electric one.  It&#x27;s more expensive that battery operated unit, but it&#x27;s always ready and you save on batteries.  Ultimately, it will pay for itself.</li>
            <li> Worked less than fifteen minutes and no return allowed.</li>
            <li> works great - love it - doesn&#x27;t hurt like using a manual callus remover</li>
            <li> a very good product..it does the job ............</li>
            <li> Are you people really seriously asking me to review this crap. Without bursting a blood vessel shouting obscenities at the screen while typing this, let me just say, this product is for actresses who had a rough movie shoot outside barefoot and wants to tidy up a bit for the red carpet later in the evening. Exactly what I&#x27;m saying:- your feet must be already looking clean and smooth. The makers of this product was so concern with image and safety that they made the darn thing to cut off from you applying an incy bit of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t thrown out the original packing paper and box, I would have returned it. I gave this  thing to my girlfriend and on her first use she made it known, she wasn&#x27;t giving up going to the salon. I threw this thing so far outside, I swear someone in China got hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I base my reason for buying this on reviews I read here, so don&#x27; take my word for this. Try it then decide, but if you do, keep the original packing stuff so you can return if needs be Good luck.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  It is painless and gets the job done.  Simple to pop out the roller and clean.  Just rinse the roller off and pop back in.  I have arthritic hands and the Pedi is light and comfortable to hold.  There is nothing to dislike about this product.  I gave one to sister-in-law at Christmas and she loves her too.  My heels are the best they have ever been.</li>
            <li> This has helped to keep my feet smoother.  I still have to use it frequently to keep my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I would totally buy again.</li>
            <li> Now I have the baby (portable) and the mommy. I absolutely love the end results!</li>
            <li> Works so well, I gave one to my sister</li>
            <li> I love this. This is my second purchase of the Emjoi. (I gave my old one to my Mom.) Though I&#x27;m not sure that this is anymore powerful than the corded version it replaces. I do prefer the shape of this one over the shape of the old one. I think this one is probably more ergonomical.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> If your feet are in pretty bad shape, you will need to buy the other stones. Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use, great results.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.  I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to try it.  Living where it is over 100 degrees for months, my feet are in sandals a LOT.  I can&#x27;t believe with the first use how soft my feet are.  Even getting a pedi twice a month doesn&#x27;t take care of the dry areas like this Micro-Pedi does.  Also, the supplier was very reasonably pricing the item and shipped it same day (Sunday) and I got it within 3 days.  No expedited charges needed with that great service.  I totally recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Great to smooth those rough calluses on your feet but not for diabetics!  One use can make a huge difference.  Get your feet ready for sandal-wear! Oh, I have tried the weaker battery powered ones and they don&#x27;t begin to touch how well this product works!</li>
            <li> Did a good job and arrived in a timely manner. I was very happy with this purchase, which I made for my son in law.  He seems to like it</li>
            <li> Okay, this is great and it works. My one complaint is why the roller area isn&#x27;t a lot larger - you could do your foot in half the time. I get impatient!  But - the thing works.</li>
            <li> It was a present for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as described!!  I am a runner so my feet take a beating.  Plus, wearing sandals all summer makes my heels even rougher.  The micro-pedi smoothed my heels in no time!!  I recommend using it while sitting on the side of the tub...debris will fly everywhere.  I am very happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> When I saw this on T.v.; I wasn&#x27;t quite sure I would like it; but I ordered this one because it doesn&#x27;t use batteries; it has a plug in to plug in to a wall.  I love this product; it is amazing and does such a great job....I always tried to clean off my calluses; but this does a great job and it is approved by podiatrist....  Thank you for sending it in such a timely manner....</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product! I&#x27;ve had other callous removers (the egg-shaped thing, the one that looks like a cheese grater, etc.) and this is the only one that works as stated. In 5 min. my feet were baby smooth! Love it!</li>
            <li> Take alot more than this wimp to take care of my feet . But maybe somebody might like it .</li>
            <li> Finally someone got it right!  I have used everything you can think of to try to keep my feet smooth. Now that summer is near I will use this even more, it is so easy!  A good product!</li>
            <li> I needed a quicker way to keep my feet pretty &amp; sandal ready.&lt;br /&gt;I run &amp; practice yoga so it&#x27;s helpful to be able to choose to contour around the ares I need a little tougher as opposed to exfoliating cream.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used other power foot smoothers but I like this one. I ordered the corded version so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep batteries.Where the cord plugs into the unit I have to be careful not to knock it loose but it&#x27;s ok I just know it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too strong so I don&#x27;t have to watch about it getting hot &amp; burning me.&lt;br /&gt;The unit ins&#x27;t as heavy &amp; balanced as I thought it would be but it works fine. It&#x27;s so light weight that it doesn&#x27;t need balancing.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again. Nice storage bag.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time &amp; packed well.</li>
            <li> this is the best one I have found, no batteries just plug it in. my mom loves this!!!!! the ones you get with batteries run out too fast, but not this one. they where great on shipping, and price as well, easy to change callus rolls as well very easy too use great to have and my mother is very happy to own this one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this Micro-Pedi but I&amp;#34;m so glad I did. My dinosaur feet have never looked so good. This product gets all the cracks and calluses out and I had some real rough feet!!  LOVED IT!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product, having tried many many things on my horrible dry and cracked heels. Nothing had worked in the past (short of a professional pedicure, which would last about a week before my heels were cracked and dry again). I thought I would give it a try since it is less than the price on one pedicure. Wow, this thing really works. Within a 3 minute use on each foot, my ankles were smooth. It would have taken my pedicurist a good 30 minutes to get that much skin off, and most of the time, they do not even do a job as well as this machine does. Since then, I use it every 3-4 days, for 3-4 minutes on each side and my heels are beautiful and smooth. I have been able to get some dry skin off toes and balls of the feet too, but it works best for heels. It does remove the skin as a dry, super-thin powder so you might want to use it with your feet in a plastic tub. Afterwards, I wash them, and moisturize. You do not need to apply pressure at all. It is very easy to use. What people said about batteries is true -they do get weak pretty soon (the batteries are probably still good for things that are not mechanical after you are done with them for this machine) -  you definitely want new batteries for this, but I have started using rechargeable ones, so they are always new. Great product! I am amazed at my beautiful anlkles.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but have discovered an even better and inexpesive product -- the pedi-planer tool, which is outstanding and reviewed separately.</li>
            <li> Very slow product. It stops when I press it against my feet. For this price, i expected something that has more torque.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many product to cure my cracking food heal due to heavy hiking, this product works really well, don&#x27;t buy the battery version, it sucks, this version works great but hope it&#x27;s a bit stronger</li>
            <li> Exceeded all expectations! Quick and easy.  All you need is this and some foot cream for soft, callus free feet! Threw out all my other foot products! This is a five-star item for sure!</li>
            <li> What the company said it would does work.  I have some heavy calluses on both feet,do to not having boots for a period of time in the Jungle; I have tried different items to softened the calluses and nothing worked.  I&#x27;m using also with this product O&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s for your feet, as one compliments the  other.</li>
            <li> It works just like i  hoped it would. I like the product.</li>
            <li> I just got this, there is seriously no reason not to buy it.  AMAZING!  Easy to use and does the job better than any professional pedicure or product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I received my EMJOI Micro-Pedi yesterday and decided to give it a try.  I cannot believe what a great job it does on my feet.  Even though I get pedicures my heels and sides of my feet always feel rough, sometimes they crack.&lt;br /&gt;After using this just one time they are unbelievably soft and smooth.  I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I wasn&#x27;t experiencing it first hand.  Unhappy with your feet?? Buy one, I&#x27;m beyond impressed.  What a great time of the year to have nice feet, sandals here I come.</li>
            <li> Finally something that does the job nice and I don&#x27;t have to work hard moving my arms back and forth. It is amazing how my heals feel after I use this. I initially bought the other shape corded one but returned because I like the way this one feels better. I had tried from a friend but bought the other one because it was cheaper, but I believe it is worth paying the extra cash for this one.</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;nt have much power&#x27; it stops.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I&#x27;ve never felt my feet this smooth before&#x27; extremely satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Customers inferred that, because it had a power chord it would be more powerful. I differ. It takes a lot of time to get through that tough callous on feet. Apart from that, it beats doing the work with a pomice or a hand tool.</li>
            <li> Great device. Powerful and thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t run on batteries. I had one of those and they are weak.</li>
            <li> Bought the EMJOI for a relative and gave one to my husband.  He tried it an is hooked.  His feet never looked so smooth or felt it either.  Thanks for such a great product.  Great Christmas present too!!</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that does what it promises.  Wish I would have found before I spent countless dollars on pedi-eggs, spins, creams,gels, files, stones, etc. You will never need to spend dollars on a spa pedicure again.  Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I used the battery operated Emjoi for several years and was tired of having to replace batteries all the time.  This electrical unit works great and doesn&#x27;t lose power like my old one did when the batteries were wearing down.  I also like the slightly longer size of this unit over my battery rated unit.  I gave my battery operated unit to my sister and I am keeping the new unit -- win, win!</li>
            <li> Such a convenient and easy way to keep calluses from feet.  I would prefer if the roller were farther from the case so that it would reach harder to get to areas of the feet.</li>
            <li> As a committed barefooter, I have very rough, thick calluses. I knew one of those battery operated sanders would never be strong enough, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance on this corded model.  I&#x27;m also glad that I bought the &amp;#34;extreme coarse&amp;#34; refills.  This did a nicer job on my feet than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  All that remains to be seen is how it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> Love the callus remover.  Very glad that I got the corded one so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of power half way thru a treatment</li>
            <li> A very excellent and works for a temporal&lt;br /&gt;The use of a smooth&lt;br /&gt;Working 220 v and 110 v .</li>
            <li> My feet never looked so good!  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> BEST THINK I HAVE SPENT MONEY ON IN A LONG WHILE.  MY FEET ACTUALLY FEEL SMOOTH AFTER I‚ÄôVE USED THIS TOOL. IT DOESN‚ÄôT TAKE VERY LONG TO DO BOTH FEET. I REALLY LOVE THIS GADGET AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ONE NEEDING TO BE PLUGGED IN.</li>
            <li> according to my wife this Emjoi pedi power callus remover works great, better than the battery powered one. excellent product</li>
            <li> This BEST invention in years!!! Everyone household should have several!! Forget those crowded salons.  Do it yourself!! Perfect!!! I highly recommend the corded version.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this thing is the greatest thing ever!!!!  I wish I had it years ago all the walking in thongs and bare feet has made calluses  that I thought would never go away thank you for getting my feet back  thank you again and I will be back for more thanks julie</li>
            <li> Should have just bought the cordless. runs on 2.8 volts only. cant go to hard or it stalls out.&lt;br /&gt;no 120 volt power with this guy.very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I  love this product . It did a wonderful job on my heels.  They were so  smooth and soft when I finished using it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to every person I know, but I almost don&#x27;t want to because I want to keep this miracle tool a secret all for myself! It&#x27;s honestly a great product that does exactly what it says that it&#x27;s going to. The product arrived exactly as described, and shipped quickly. I&#x27;ve had mine for a full month with no issues and I would definitely purchase another one if anything ever happened to my current one. A definite must have for all women who love to pamper their feet and keep them soft and smooth just in time for the warmer weather!</li>
            <li> I did not get the corded, but the battery operated and its wonderful. My rough feet are gone.  I walk barefeet alot and now it doesnt even matter.  It great as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that I could have purchased for myself... My feet are singing happy melodies...I  thought to myself..Ooh this is probably going to be another useless product that I am going to have to send back...I used the Micro Pedi and instantly fell in Love with it .. less time consuming...less effort ... less sweat..I found a true friend...Thanks Emjoi!</li>
            <li> I have the battery operated and now this electric one and the electric one is the best ever!  No slowing down due to weak batteries! One of my best buys ever and it&#x27;s fun to use!  I would also recommend getting the extension handle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had this Emjoi for 3 months now.  Still like it&#x27;s continued power and the smooth heels; but now it&#x27;s extremely noisy!!! :-O  Goes from 5 stars to 3 stars!</li>
            <li> TrIed to use battery only ones But the minute you apply any pressure the roller stopped. Only negative was a bill for import duty for some ¬£12, must read the small print in future. Works very well, nice fit in the hand and takes a lot of dry skin off.</li>
            <li> Purchased for wife........she LOVES it. It is very powerful and does an extremely good job.</li>
            <li> It took a long time coming, for what customs. I highly recommend it, leaves you soft heels.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I came across this item. I have suffered from cracked heels for 20 years.  I have tried many things. Nothing ever worked, or it was to painful. So I almost passed on purchasing the Emjoi Micro - Pedi. I read many reviews, thought about it for a month. Meanwhile my feet just got worse. So I went ahead and ordered one. Upon arrival I promptly put it to use.  This thing should be renamed to OMGoi, after some time spent, my feet felt wonderful. I went easy the first day, used it again for 3 days straight. hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my feet thus far. I like that I purchased the electrically operated one. I can say, I could see how it would bog down with battery operation. I would also like to say, if your feet are like really bad order the coarsest pedi roller. (I think they are grey)  when you place your order.</li>
            <li> Love this product a lot</li>
            <li> I was most impressed with the effectiveness of this EMJOI Micro-Pedi.  I am a very finicky shopper and this is the best product for smoothing the heel of your feet.  My feet are amazing smooth and soft now.  Unlike the Ped-Egg that often left my feet sore, this product is excellent and it is completely pain free.  I am ordering replacement rollers right now--just that impressed.  Take it from me, your feet will be sandal ready after using this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased for myself.  It does what it says it does.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  I have never had anything work on the dead skin on my feet do such a great job. My feet feel smooth and I didn&#x27;t have to use a cheese grater type instrument. It works so very fast and easy!  I have given 2 as gifts.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very good.  Packaging very good, as well.  When I first took it out of the box, it felt light and somewhat cheap.  I&#x27;m wondering about the longevity and durability...time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used the callus remover 5-6 times with very good results.  It comes with two (2) blue rollers that are good, but maybe not coarse enough for very thick calluses.  It takes 15-20 minutes per heal to get good results.  However, that is much faster and easier than the old-fashioned way.  Overall, I am very satisfied and would recommend both this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for rough heels! Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else, BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> Works exactly like advertised.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase.  It works great and is so fast at smoothing over the rough places on my feet.  I am looking forward to enjoying this product in the coming months.</li>
            <li> It worked better than expected.  My wife was skeptical, but after doing just one of her heels, it was clear to her that this device is a dream come true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip, spend the extra money to get the Corded Model, the battery powered one probably would only be good for light-duty &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Best Micro-Pedi ever.  It works like nothing else has.</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Great product. It does it&#x27;s work we&#x27;ll.  powerful and effective.  My callous was massive and this product took care of it.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about Emjoi from several people who bought another model that works with batteries. Since I&#x27;m not a big fan of dealing with batteries,  I decided to try this power operated model. I absolutely love it! Wish I had it years ago. I stand on my feet all day and nothing worked as well as this little machine. Finally don&#x27;t have to worry about my dry and cracked heels that felt awful. Every woman and man should have one. Much better, easier, safer and cheaper than professional pedicures.Since I tried it on myself, it&#x27;s a great gift idea too!.</li>
            <li> Works great, gets the calluses off without cutting my feet. The only issue is it&#x27;s a little messy, best to use it outside if possible.</li>
            <li> I am happier with this product with the electric cord than another I purchased without the cord. It is stronger. I do small ...3 to 4 sweeps at one time on calluses. I used to do footcare for older adults.I wished I had this then. I reccomend doing a little at a time...and repeat it 3 to 4 days in a row.It is quick and doing small amounts keeps you from overdoing a callus that can be cared for in this manner. The company was very professsional and I intend to gift more of this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Amazing wooooowwwwww‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èi loveit ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> I bought two battery operated units at QVC‚Äîone for myself and one for my daughter. Then I bought the power unit and iVog refills at Amazon. We love them all. After using the Emjoi and washing my feet, I apply L‚ÄôOccitance shea butter and wear cotton socks. My soles and heels look good for the first time in ages.</li>
            <li> I had the battery operated Emjoi Micro-Pedi and thought this would have even more oomph. It does not. I still like it but for those of us with limited outlets (and space), I&#x27;d say the battery operated product is the best bet. I have given these as gifts and everyone loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the best callus remover. It is so easy to use and does such a fantastic job that I have recommended the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Power Callus Remover  to other family members who have purchased it for their very own..</li>
            <li> My friend received one of these for Christmas and let me try it.  I Had to Have One!!!  And I bought a couple as gifts as well.  Works like a charm, lots of power, extra replacement wheel inclulded.  Never has getting smooth feet (painlessly) been easier. I love it.</li>
            <li> I am 100 percent satisfied with this product and the fast, easy results of using it to get really smooth callous free feet.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE THIS!!  I have especially bad calluses, very thick and painful to walk on.  I&#x27;m a bit of a wimp, so I&#x27;ve just been using it a little bit every day, until I get them all the way down.  Each time I use it, I feel more confident.  It really does get through the layers very quickly, and leaves it soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I used to go to the doctor to have them removed, but they would come right back because I walk so much.  No need to ever do that again, with this Emjoi!  I like that it&#x27;s electric, so I never have to worry about it loosing juice on me.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Best product I have purchased in a long time I wish I had found it years ago.. But company did not answer my email with a question on another one of their products</li>
            <li> Works way better than all others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Just wow!  I&#x27;ve endured years and years of scraping, cutting, shaving, sanding, and filing my cracked, sometimes-bleeding, often-painful, gross heels.  This thing works!&lt;br /&gt;For Christmas I got the Amop√© Pedi Perfect (the one that requires 4AA batteries).  It did an OK job, but frequently bogged down as it ran out of battery power.  Plus it never really smoothed my dry feet.  After a callus removing session, I invariably still had dry bits of skin poking up.  I finally got tired of investing in bulk packs of AA&#x27;s and decided to try a corded callus remover.  Best foot care decision I ever made!&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi Micro-Pedi corded callus remover is easy to use, lightweight, and does an admirable job removing layers of hard, dry skin.  My feet are smooth and the cracks are almost gone.  Skip the AA&#x27;s and the rechargeable batteries and go straight to the corded callus remover.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I saw this on youtube via Miss Crazy Tammy. It really works!!! My feet are very smooth. It takes about 10-15 minutes to remove all the dead skin and callous from my feet. I use it once a week to keep my feet pretty. We all must keep our feet pretty for summer sandals. I bought the corded version because I did not want to deal with batteries. I think the corded version is likely stronger than the battery version. Very easy to pop the rollers in and out.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool. Very easy to use and very effective. I highly recommend it! The only thing I regret is not having found it sooner. The sandpaper rollers have to be ordered again when they wear out. However, this is a slight inconvenience and a small price to pay for a very good product. Order replacements right away and for very hard callused  feet order the slightly coarser rollers.</li>
            <li> Works well. Glad I got this product.</li>
            <li> Yes i would refer this to friends , very good for the feet won&#x27;t be using a hand one anymore so much more smoother .</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and uses it all the time.  She still uses the hand buffer first but this buffer finishes it off great.  So i&#x27;m told anyway.</li>
            <li> Overpriced crap.  I bought a 20 dollar palm sander and some high grit paper.  My feet are ROUGH!! That does the trick.</li>
            <li> I love this product...Thank you.....Thank you....Thank you...</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER MADE!  NO NEED TO PAY PEOPLE FOR PEDICURE&#x27;S ANYMORE WHEN YOU CAN DO YOUR ON IN JUST A FEW MINUTES WITH THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS EXCELLENT!  BEST INVESTMENT I&#x27;VE EVER MADE.  HIGH QUALITY TOO.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than filing my feet.  Keeps them smooth and soft. Don&#x27; t know how I lived without it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the corded version, but the seller sent me the battery operated one. I kept it, and I love it! It works fast and well. I ordered the extra tough refills to go with it. I am pleased with the results I get and am recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the battery operated version and am very happy I did.  Liked the results from battery operated but love the results from corded version. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I wish this had a swivel head and could be used so one did not have to have handle being almost against area to work.&lt;br /&gt;Having a skin disorder and being in a chair it also would be nice to have a longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all the research I do before purchase&#x27;s, this works VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my reviews have helped you,\\&quot;Please\\&quot; click below.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;ve used it almost every day since it arrived. It&#x27;s especially nice for the callous on the side of the big toe. I&#x27;ll be ordering the coarser rollers for the heels. I&#x27;ve only had couple salon pedicures because I don&#x27;t like the way it feels, and with this you feel nothing. And I can do it at my convenience.</li>
            <li> I had bought the battery operated one and returned it. The plug in one works much better. There is no weak power from dying batteries and I don&#x27;t need to charge it. For the first time in years I finally have smooth feet. It&#x27;s better than getting a pedicare. I now do my own pedicare and save a lot of money!!! Plus, my husband and kids even noticed the difference. I love to rub my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smooth feet. I would give this 10 stars!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product!!!!!!!!!  I do not have to go to a salon any more, I can do my pedicures at home and with ease.  I should have seen this sooner.</li>
            <li> This little baby is one of the best products out there.  This has the power to really take care of your feet without the damage you could sustain from some other products on the market.  I use this every night and my feet remain soft, no calluses or dry cracked skin.  I highly reccomend this product for anyone with either of these issues with their feet.</li>
            <li> The BOMB!! I had the battery powered Emoji that works well when there are brand new batteries. This corded version is so much better abd worth the price. It removed dead skin within minutes and leaves your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries. Does what it says. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this model figuring that if it is AC powered there would be no power loss problems as the batteries died.  It did work great after a bit of  a learning curve and produced nice smooth feet but after a couple months use has completely died!!  The power light is on in the device but totally dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to return now......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update</li>
            <li> Way too expensive and slow for what it does. I tried it once and after 30 minutes of use and wearing out 2 wheels I could see it was not going to be worth it so I returned it. The machine feels weak and cheap in my opinion, I could not imagine it lasting any reasonable length of time and the wheels are much too expensive for how quickly they wear out. Another thing I found annoying is how the manufacturer has labeled all their replacement wheels with some level of coarse, what&#x27;s wrong with fine, medium and coarse instead of coarse, extra coarse, extreme coarse and super coarse? Surely professional salons must have a more commercial grade machine than this thing, that&#x27;s what I would look for, something more substantial with reasonably priced refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I found it! This is a thousand times better and a hundred times cheaper. First buy this SofFeet CallusReducer, then buy this 3M-99440 Pro-Pak Drywall 100 Grit and for $20 you will have an awesome callus removing tool with enough refills to last 10 years! The 3M sanding screens are exactly the same as the original, you just take some scissors and cut them to size.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!  Just start out slow because it really works.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I expected more. After 4 treatments, I have yet to remove the dead, calloused skin from my heels and feet. Eventually is will do the job. It is small and under powered. I will need to buy the more coarse rollers.  Update: I bought the coarse rollers, but still this is not very helpful. It is good at smoothing nails and such, but my callouses are still there.  Update 2 (Jan 2, 2016): downgrading to 1 star. Very disapointing in removing callouses.</li>
            <li> Great except for the rollers they wear off too quickly, expect to spend a lot on replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. It worked wonderfully for a few months then just stopped. Initially, it seemed to be a short in wiring. But it&#x27;s getting power because it&#x27;s trying to spin (without a roller installed).</li>
            <li> Love this device... this is my favorite find for 2014.  I decided to stop going to the local nail shops. They leave your hand and feet in distress.  I have used this device 3 times so far, and each time I am amazed at how smooth it leaves my feet. I do prefer to use this on dry feet , not damp feet. Then i use Avon lotion and my feet feel really soft.  This is a must .... for soft smooth feet.</li>
            <li> I had to use it twice before I removed all the dead skin from my feet.  But I had not gotten a pedicure for a couple of months and love to go barefooted.  I think for normal use this is great.  It really does a nice job.</li>
            <li> I love this for my feet! I am definitely glad I went with the power cord version vs. the battery one. Does exactly what it says and just what I needed!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to anyone who loves a smooth foot bottom ;-)</li>
            <li> I bought the Mico-Pedi for my wife after seeing it on one of the home shopping shows.  when I researched it on amazon, I took the recommendations from others to purchase the corded version over the battery operated one.  It seemed to be the right choice because there is not loss of power that others have stated from the battery version.  When it arrived my whole family decided to give it a shot and it does work great.  Dead skin comes off easily leaving your feet very smooth.  If you clean the rollers they will last a good while before replacing them.</li>
            <li> This thing is so great. A wonderful alternative to a pumice stone, rasp or razor.. It is super safe and gentle.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but very impressed with performance.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well. Great purchase</li>
            <li> as advertised&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping</li>
            <li> My feet are terribly tickleish.  This works great but you must follow the instructions and NOT press at all because it will cause little skin cuts of sorts.  This really is a great little tool.  the electric one is awsome and not batteries.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T.  Not enough power... it&#x27;s pretty useless. You will spend a lot of time hoping it will get through the callouses... and then not ever get the results you want.  I even spent extra money to purchase some of the &#x27;extreme&#x27; course refills. didn&#x27;t change a thing... still no good. works more like a gentle buffer than a callous remover. I&#x27;ve done better with the foot files you can find in the dollar store. There has to be a better way.</li>
            <li> Meets all my expectations</li>
            <li> The best pedi machine, love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these and they work good. I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times so far. I liked it so much I gave my sister one for Christmas. I got the corded ones, I read that they were better. I wish they would send with the pedi one of the different types of rollers. The only reason this didn&#x27;t get a five star is because it didn&#x27;t include different variations of rollers.</li>
            <li> This is great...good way to care for your feet properly at home and not run the risk of foot infection in a salon.</li>
            <li> A drum sander for your heels.  Powerful enough to remove the hardest callus.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your heel about 400 grit smooooooooth.&lt;br /&gt;Believe the other 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  I have tried pumice stones, lava rocks, creams, lotions and potions.  Nothing in my arsenal came close to my Micro  Pedi  It worked wonders the very first time! I&#x27;m glad it is electric.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying batteries.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have it during the summer, sandal and flip flop season!  My feet are ready for next year though!</li>
            <li> the product is corded , but it is not very strong,  also you need to order anywhere from 4 to 6 extra rotors of sandpaper just to do your feet,  it took about 4  two for each foot,,,,,, the results are fantastic but you have to be very patient, it takes a while and it takes several inserts as they were out fast,,,,,, but if you&#x27;re okay by inserts then I would recommend this product,,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> This really takes off the dead skin quickly leaving feet very soft.  I find myself using it weekly and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> LOVE This!  My husband has DRY feet like an elephant, and this product worked wonders....the original roller is still good for another pedicure!</li>
            <li> Good unit, but I was expecting more power for a plug in unit that advertise the as being the most powerful.  Bogs down easy.  Still works great though!</li>
            <li> this is the best one i&#x27;ve tried so far.  My husband needs this because of his line of work and it works the absolute best and quickest and you dont have to do to anything but turn it on and move around your feet.  It is far better than the amope pedicure machine and it cost only $5 more.  this one is well worth the extra $5.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the Emjoi versions of this callus remover and decided on this version specifically because it was corded. I have very thick calluses and this roller system works extremely well and reducing the calluses. My spouse actually does the work and this type of hand grip makes it very easy for a partner to use. Since it takes a while to grind down my feet calluses, the fact that the grinder power is constant is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth the extra money to have the corded version. The results on my feet are excellent and what I was hoping to achieve. Regular use has substantially reduced the deep (and painful) crevassing that heavy callus areas can cause on the heels and sides of the feet. Now I can walk much better and my feet look much better, too. Note: do use a towel under your work area to catch the dust.</li>
            <li> Works AWESOME!!!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it would not work but got surprised....it works fine and really smotthed out the skin in my feet...yes, it wouldn&#x27;t become as if you go to a specialist but it is something you can do at home, at your own time...it definetely works.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!  it is quite amazing at making your feet soft and smooth without causing pain and irritation while using.  This is a must have that makes the job of removing rough spots, soft corns and callouses much easier than a foot file or pumice stone.  It is very quick and so easy to use.  The only drawback is how often you will need to replace the mineral buffing rollers.  I use it 2-3 times per week because I like to stay on top of the skin build-up because I am on my feet 8+ hours a day at work.  However, it is well worth the cost for me.</li>
            <li> Edited March 2014.  NOTE:  This model being sold was originally a CORDLESS model. It appears that either Amazon or the third party seller is now supplying this with a POWER CORD so my review doesn&#x27;t apply to that model. My review is from October 2012.&lt;br /&gt;********************************&lt;br /&gt;My heels are so S-C-A-R-Y; if I had a dog she could chew on my heels instead of a rawhide treat for 2 hours and not make a dent in them. :) They are calloused, dry and the cracks appear to be almost 1/4\\&quot; deep. For years I&#x27;ve been soaking my feet in hot water, then using a razor-blade callus remover to shave off the thick skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been watching the presentations of this on QVC and thought this could take the place of using that tiny razor blade, but it didn&#x27;t work out for me. My heels are in such bad shape the Emjoi can&#x27;t keep up. The instructions say to not hold it in the same spot for over 2 to 3 seconds, this would take forever to make a difference in my heels. The motor labored, even when gently held against my heels; it wasn&#x27;t bad batteries as they were freshly charged Eneloops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roller didn&#x27;t last either, at least in my case, and would be cost-prohibitive. The coarse roller would be better for my heels, but now that I&#x27;ve tried this, the old way I&#x27;ve been doing this seems better for me.</li>
            <li> My feet are soooo soft after using this twice in 2 weeks.  It is so easy to use and even easier to clean.  Quick to use and better results than when I go to get a pedicure! Would definitely recommend for anyone who does their own pedicures @ home, more than worth the cost.</li>
            <li> if you have rough feet, better order a few refills...you will go through them fast! I ordered one course and one extra course but of course they didn&#x27;t come together, so right now I don&#x27;t know for sure but this might be very spendy to use. Not too too powerful.</li>
            <li> Wow this thing is very handy.  My heels wernt terrible but they wernt great either.  I used to just use a pumice stone but this is 1000 times better.  I purchased the corded one and the green replacement heads because I knew I would also have my grown son use this.  His feet are out of control and one heel was starting to crack.  They are so much softer and i think with another session the area that was starting to crack will be close to 100%.  If you think you will use this often then get the corded version it is very much worth it.</li>
            <li> By far, the best purchase I&#x27;ve made at Amazon (and I&#x27;ve made quite a few...)!  This does EXACTLY what it says it does - and works far better than I&#x27;d anticipated.  This is my favourite gadget...possibly ever.</li>
            <li> I have used the Emjoi Micro-Pedi for a year.  I replaced the blue rollers with the extra coarse white rollers sold on Amazon. This is a marvelous tool!  Hint:  Do not use pressure when holding the roller head to your heel.  The more pressure used, the less effective the Emjoi is at smoothing the heel.  I am gifting my daughters and daughter-in-law with the Emjoi and the coarse rollers this Christmas 2012.  Wise purchase !!</li>
            <li> It works very well.  If you buy it, go ahead &amp; buy the extra heads.  Put an old towel down on the floor while you&#x27;re using it; it&#x27;s kind of gross to see all that dead skin accumulating.  But it&#x27;s more gentle than other electric exfoliators, &amp; it makes the feet feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> I  wish that I had known about this Pedi years ago.  It is just wonderful.  Quick and painless, and easy  to use.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I have purchased, but I only have kept one...the rest are for gifts.  I think this is one of the all time best personal foot grooming products on the market.  EMJOI Micro-Pedi is easy to use, and does a better job since it has a battery, rather than rubbing by hand.  It is great you can replace the roller as needed.</li>
            <li> Well, where has this been my whole adult life.  My feet have never been bad or really crusty but a couple of spots could use a bit of touch up.  This callus remover is a miracle gadget.  I have the softest, pinkest feet with very little effort.  This is easy and comfortable to use, no pressure needed.  Actually applying pressure will reduce its ability to do the job.  A light touch is all that needed - well, that and a towel as it produces a lot of white powdery skin.  I just run it along the area I&#x27;m working on and it softly sands away the dead skin.  I then apply a good body cream to my feet and done!  This is a wonderful product - love it!</li>
            <li> I had bookmarked this item some time ago hoping the price would go down around the holidays and it did. Now I&#x27;m just sorry I waited so long to get it. This is the ultimate in foot files. I&#x27;m an avid golfer and my feet (and hands) get quite rough. My feet to the point of snagging on carpets, socks, blankets etc. Well this baby did the job in less time than it takes to get a pedicure. I absolutely love it and will be recommending to all my friends who have rough feet.</li>
            <li> Had the battery powered one and loved it, this one is even better.  I am get my feet all done without having to worry about batteries!</li>
            <li> This little thing is Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! My feet are extremely smooth and callus free with twice weekly use. I also have a battery operated one and if I were doing it again, I would have never purchased one without a cord. You need a consistent power supply to make this really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who say this device doesn&#x27;t do a good job on extremely rough feet or feet that have been neglected for a while, you might need a bit of extra help, initially. I am embarrassed to admit I barely touched my feet throughout the winter and they were a mess. I used a pumice stone and foot soaks for a few weeks before using my Micro Pedi and I have no complaints with the results. I also agree with those who recommend the green rollers. They work best.</li>
            <li> Works as good as I hoped! Love the electric aspect of it, very powerful and doesn&#x27;t slow down when it touches up against skin. Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, I am telling my friends all about it. I first saw this on QVC and I thought I bet I can get it cheaper on Amazon. I was right. Then I started reading it&#x27;s reviews, which were mixed. By what I saw on QVC it looked awesome. When it arrived last night I tried it right out. It does an awesome job. I am thinking about buying it for friends for Christmas. It does what it says it will do. I will forever have soft feet. Much easier than using a stone to do. This is an awesome tool.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this product. I didn&#x27;t think it would work that well. After I used it for the first time I was hooked. It is completely pain free. It took me less that 10 minutes to smooth both of my feet. I recommend having a towel under where you using it because the skin that comes off of your feet will get all over otherwise.</li>
            <li> This little gadget really removes calluses and dry cracked skin,a must have. No more expensive salon pedicures save your money and do it yourself!!</li>
            <li> I received my micro pedi today, which the shipping was quite fast. When I ordered it, I probably debated whether I should spend 10 bucks more to get the newest pink model or the original, and decided to just go ahead and get the original blue one. So when I opened the package and saw they had sent me the pink one I was absolutely overjoyed. I immediately opened it and tried it out. I have had horrible luck when it comes to foot file products. I&#x27;ve had the pedi egg which was okay, but it took me forever to get my feet even half way okay. Then, I ordered the pedi spin and the motor burned out within 15 minutes of use, then the earth Theraputics version which worked well, but had no replacement heads. THIS one solved every problem I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s quick, durable, and it looks like the roller head will last a long time. Plus I love the battery cover concept. It twists to lock in so you don&#x27;t have to worry about flimsy battery plates coming off. Kudos to emjoi. They have made a PHENOMENAL product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Read instructions first, not complicated just gives you the understanding of basic operational skills required.  Can remove dry dead skin very quickly.  When instructions tells you skin contact 2-3 seconds that is exactly what it means you can be in tender skin very fast.  Work your way up to a comfortable amount of dead skin removal.  Removing a lot of the dead skin at one time may cause the new skin to crack worse than the older dead skin did because now the exposed new skin is thinner.  The pressure on your heels is too great fot the new skin so it tears.  Use a really good moisturizing lotion for your feet and heels to keep the skin soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of different items from the brand EMJOI and they are all nice and work well. This really makes your feet smooth after just one use!</li>
            <li> I love it when a product works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to work. The Micro-Pedi successfully, and fairly quickly, removes callused skin from the bottom of the foot. It takes a little getting used to understand how best to hold it, but once you&#x27;re comfortable with it, you&#x27;ll find it very effective. In fact, if you&#x27;re not careful, you can take too much off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to quality, it&#x27;s at least as good as I&#x27;d expect in this price range, perhaps better. It&#x27;s simple to operate and simple to clean. Replacing the rotating cutter is exceptionally easy. The device runs on batteries, so it&#x27;s not terribly powerful, but it gets the job done. If the device stops rotating, you&#x27;re pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I am not one bit impressed with this expensive $30 item.  It is okay perhaps for those who have just a little bit of dry heels, in which case a regular $3 buffer would do, but not if you have very dry, cracked heels.  The roller needs to be rougher, in my opinion.  I don&#x27;t like it, nor do I recommend if you have a lot of dryness, much less cracked heels.</li>
            <li> This is almost better than apple pie..not really....I love this little machine...try to use a couple times per week...makes my feet nice and smooth.  Best thing ilve found so far for removing callouses and dry cracked feet and heels.</li>
            <li> One of the ten best tools I ever bought in my life.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> I just received this today. I ordered the corded and what I got is battery operated. I already own the battery operated model and I don&#x27;t like it, it goes through battery fast. Sending this back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my feet and this really helps keep my feet free of any dry skin.  Not sure if it would work for really bad calluses.  But for touch ups and maintenance it simply perfect.  .</li>
            <li> We have previously used the battery operated version of this and thought it was great.&lt;br /&gt;But this electric model is the BEST! It removes calluses and dry skin really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> When it worked (the two times I used it), it was great.  It did a wonderful job.  However, then it stopped working.  It continued to spin but would stop immediately at the slightest  pressure.  I read some of the positive reviewers commenting that you need to use a very light touch and believe me, that&#x27;s what I was doing.  I followed all the instructions given - even changed the batteries (though why the batteries would be bad after using it twice for such a short amount of time, I don&#x27;t know) - to no avail.  I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Of course I will still get my toes done but will not need expensive treatments for heavy calluses! This mighty machine leaves my heals smooth in no time. I like the size and ease of use . I was pleased that replacement sanders were included. I plan on gifting many of these this season.</li>
            <li> I really like  the micro-pedi I feel it does a good job. Especially on my heels which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> After a disastrous experience with the egg-shaped pedicure tool that left me unable to walk normally for a solid week, I&#x27;m loving this new tool.  It&#x27;s getting my feet ready for summer and getting rid of the cracked heels that I seem to always get in winter.  Loving it so far!</li>
            <li> Have had this product for about a month.  Seems to work really well.  I would highly recommend.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This gave my bunions great relief.  I find the skin thickens every few weeks.  I ordered the extra coarse roller to increase the results.</li>
            <li> I love this it keeps my feet smooth and healthy looking between going out for pedicures. It&#x27;s so easy to use, just roll it across!</li>
            <li> Fabulous.  Best thing I ever bought.  Quick, easy and painless removal of calluses.  I have one callus that was a real problem.  Not anymore. Love it!</li>
            <li> You have to use light pressure and move it around, and it isn&#x27;t as quick and using something with metal shaver blade (such as the &amp;#34;ped egg.&amp;#34;) It does leave the skin smoother and it is gentler, so no &amp;#34;gouging&amp;#34; the skin.  I work with my hands also use this on my fingertips to get the callouses off.</li>
            <li> Love the lastest Micro-Pedi. I had the cordless version, but felt I was replacing batteries too often. This new version has a cord but is completely reliable and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised at all the great reviews this item is getting. It is absolutely useless. Any pressure placed on the rotating wheel and it stops. I have calluses on my feet and it did nothing. I guess the best so far for my feet is the pedi egg. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you have calluses. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Received it fast! Plugged it in right away and smoothed my footsies! I wear heels all day every day and they give me rough calluses. I&#x27;ve tried all the reguar home pedi callous removers and none compare to this. I definitely recommend this plug in version of the Emjoi as i&#x27;m not a fan of battery powered beauty tool. It came with the extra coarse roller attached along with a spare. If you have rough feet then I would definitely purchase the super coarse rollers at the same time. That being said, the extra coarse roller did the job. If you want ultra smooth feet 24/7 and you are tired of the blades and horrible smelling callous removing lotions then BUY THIS! I&#x27;m giving them out at Christmas this year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip-the shavings are very fine,  be sure to lay down a towel to catch them.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!!  My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good in years!  There are several of these type devices on the market, however, I decided to go with the corded version because I didn&#x27;t want to go through a ton of batteries and I also felt the corded one probably had more power.  I can honestly say I&#x27;m glad I went with this one cause I&#x27;ve been putting it through it&#x27;s paces. I have tried all sorts of pumice stones, scrapers, etc., and had to work hard to see any results...not with this!  I am taking my time and using it a little bit every day and after a few days usage, wow...what a difference!  Getting some of the callouses off, I am finally able to get lotion into my feet!  Sounds gross but let&#x27;s face it....lotion can only penetrate so much and getting rid of the callouses is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Florida and pretty much always either wearing sandals or being barefoot, this is a must have device to keep your feet in tip top shape.  My husband even likes it and that says a lot!</li>
            <li> Love love thought the fowl would feel a little rougher but it works fine</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more powerful being that it uses power from an outlet.  It&#x27;s no different from using a hand-held slougher powered by elbow grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I had the battery operated version and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I got the one with the power cord. What a big difference! It removes dry skin so much quicker. My only complaint is that the plug is not very secure where it attaches to the machine and at least once when I use it I have to plug it back in.</li>
            <li> As a result of being a true \\&quot;barefoot girl\\&quot;, I have suffered with very unsightly rough heels and callouses. I bought this product several months ago,(it came with the blue extra course roller)and have used it weekly to combat the problem.  It has worked beautifully and I haven&#x27;t had to replace the roller.  I do take the roller out after each use and rinse it off so that may explain why it&#x27;s lasted this long.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I made this purchase. I figured that this is another one of those products that will last a week or two and will die out. Well I am glad to say that I was wrong. This product works very well and your feet are supper soft afterward. It works to help remove calases and does a good job. You will want to change the batteries often. It doesn&#x27;t go through them that fast but when this item has a fresh pair of batteries in it you really know the difference. I recommend rechargeable batteries. But even with daily use batteries last almost two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally amazed how well the micro-pedi works! In no time at all my feet were silky smooth just like the commercial!  And believe me my feet were really bad. I applied a thick coat of my favorite lotion then put on socks to hold in the moisture. When I woke up in the morning my feet looked wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product is super!!  Easy to use, and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  I don&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;big issues&amp;#34;, but use it regularly to avoid getting any.</li>
            <li> Fun thing to have. It works great but like with all these type things consistency is key. I feel like if I took the time to use it 4x per week I would have gorgeous feet! :) :)</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I like it.  One thing I will say is that if your heels are not that bad I noticed that they can be rough after you use this product.  It really gets down into the skin.  I think you must use a heel softener when using this tool.  I would buy it again and I would give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> QUICK SHIPPING..DOES ALL MY KNIFES AND SISSCORS ..NICE NOT TO THROW OUT GOOD STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD RECCOMEND VERY MUCH ..DONT HESITATE.&lt;br /&gt;THIS ONE IS THE BEST I&#x27;VE TRIED.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item but can be found cheaper on QVC.com that comes with an extra roller. Highly recommended product, works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> a great product. Easy to use and the results are great!</li>
            <li> Iv tried everything and until Emjoi my husband has complained about my \\&quot;flip flop Arizona feet\\&quot; for yeas!  This product works perfectly!</li>
            <li> What a great product.  I&#x27;ve been using some kind of mini metal grater on my feet and this is so much easier and nicer.  I love this!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and makes my rough feet smooth as silk in no time.</li>
            <li> I like this unit as the battery operated unit, from this company, stops too easily when applying pressure. I feel that this should be viewed as a fine sander. Very rough foot callouses should be filed down first with a rough manual callous scraping tool. Then you use this for final touch ups as those rough files can take off too much without enough warning leaving you with a too sensitive foot.A Corn Huskers type of product should be applied to feet that are chronically rough and dry.</li>
            <li> WOW!  It&#x27;s just great!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is great I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Product recieved 2 days earlier. Picked it up while I was in States. So far so good.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  Rough skin on feet no more. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great, really gets rid of the rough skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product ..works great fast delivery Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Broke after 6 months and I cant get it fixed</li>
            <li> wish the rollers would last longer,but on the whole it eliminates getting a pedicure!</li>
            <li> This is awesome!! Love love love!</li>
            <li> This product works well, however it does stall occasionally. I think the best results are achieved when you use the correct roller to address your concern. I use the extreme course on my heels followed by the roller that came in the package and the results are fair. My feet will be smooth for about two days then they start peeling. Not sure why that happens.</li>
            <li> This little machine has done wonders for smoothing/buffing my feet!  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t use any kind of metal and has proven to be way more effective than a pumice stone. I use it at least once a month after a good 20 minute foot soak.  Easy to clean and small enough to store with my other foot products. Price is very reasonable as well. Beats paying for a pedicure any day!!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!  This product is very easy to use and is super gentle.  The rollers are easy to swap out.  I purchased the green coarse rollers as a supplement because winter destroys your feet.  It is written that you only get so many uses out of a roller, but I have found that to not be true.  I&#x27;m glad I sprung for the corded model because it is still a time consuming process, but well worth the time.  With regular use, you WILL see results.  Every time I use this, I can tell that I&#x27;m getting closer and closer to softer, better looking feet.  I have used this on the ever-dreaded soft corns very gently and have them completely gone when I was done.  I like that this product has a number of patents so that the technology has been tested to ensure results and safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Great product so far now I just need to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> This product was advertised as being &#x27;CORDED&#x27; with an extra replacement roller included.  When it arrived, it was a cheaper battery operated model without an extra roller.  This model is considerably cheaper than the electric corded one.  I complained and was told that I could either return it AT MY EXPENSE or get a few dollars off.  All I want is what I ordered as per the advertisement.  I don&#x27;t think that is too much to ask.</li>
            <li> My feet were so rough that I would scratch myself in my sleep when they would accidentally rub against each other. The very first time I used this product my feet were so smooth and soft.  I showed it to my sister-in-law, told her how pleased I was with it, and she immediately ordered herself one.</li>
            <li> Good Deal.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different product sand this is the best callus remover I&#x27;ve ever used.  I think this corded one is much more powerful than the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> This is so worth the money spent.  I have very dry heels from walking around barefoot in my home and the pedi fixes my feet all up..  Amazon seems to be selling for a much lower price then other sellers  so my advice to anyone needing one is to get it while you can.  I tell you this because they were no longer available for a few months and I had to wait... so don&#x27;t hesitate. Also  the best thing too about the pedi is that  its power operated and never loses power.  this for me is the best!!!</li>
            <li> stoped working after 6 weeks.  requested manufacture return for repair.  never heard back.</li>
            <li> Very well made and does excellent job.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!  Would highly recommend!!  My feet always get so rough after I have been at the beach.  They scratch the sheets and feel terrible!  Then I purchased this product and use regularly.  Feet are extremely soft now.</li>
            <li> MUST GET THE ONE THAT HAS AN ELECTRICAL PLUG otherwise it is garbage.  Any of the ones with batteries do nto work well because if you use any preassure at all it slows the roll.  Also, you can get really course files for this one for around the heel and outside of the foot.  Use this once a week or every other week and you will have baby soft feet worthy of any sandal or open shoe.</li>
            <li> My skin is super thick.  This doesn&#x27;t even make a dent.  All it does it take the skin from thick, dry and rough, to thick, dry and shiny.  Not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Does everything it said it would do.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it. Great value and quick delivery. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Could use a little more power but works good and does the job.</li>
            <li> Good product takes all dry skin off</li>
            <li> I feet were absolutely terrible! I&#x27;d put my pajamas on, and the &amp;#34;scales&amp;#34; on my feet would cling to the pants and sound like velcro! I could pull layers of skin off my feet easily! Dry? Cracked? My feet would laugh at a pumice stone! I needed help, but I was literally too embarrassed to get a pedicure. I can put on a new pair of socks, and by the end of the day, they develop holes. So I see an infomercial for another electric callus remover, hit up amazon, and find the Emjoi.  After a few reviews, I settle for the corded version. Shipping took a long time, nine days, but it probably felt long because I was really anticipating its arrival. Once I plugged it up, it went to work! The dead skin was falling like winter snow in my living room, so I used a small tarp to ease the clean-up.  This thing is amazing! The motor will bog down if you apply too much pressure, but it takes a lot to completely stop the Emjoi from spinning. I had so much fun rejuvenating my feet that I spent about an hour on them. It got my feet looking like normal peoples feet! Now I can use the pumice stone and the Flexitol foot lotion to take my feet to the next level! BTW, I&#x27;m not paid by Emjoi or Flexitol.  I&#x27;m just a guy that has tried everything.  Do not waste you time with other lotions. Flexitol works, but with the Emjoi, it will work even better. I promise you, even if your feet look like elephant hoofs, you can have them looking, feeling, and smelling like brand new in no time!  **UPDATE**  After using this three times, the gears started making noise. It&#x27;s clicking and popping so badly that I can&#x27;t even use it. At first, I thouought I installed the replacement head incorrectly, but even with nothing, it&#x27;s noisy. I was SO happy with this product at first, but after 2-3 months, it&#x27;s headed to the garbage. Maybe i got a bad one.</li>
            <li> Works great! Wish I had this years ago!</li>
            <li> I just used my Micro-Pedi for the first time and it works great. It removes rough skin and calluses and leaves my feet baby soft. I am impressed.</li>
            <li> This works very well eliminating calloused heels and bunions. I chose the one that plugs directly into an outlet rather than the battery operated one after reading a review on the battery operated that stalls when pressed too hard. The one with the cord does not do that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how come it took me so long to find this thing! I will NEVER use anything else for stubborn callus again. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Got this for my father and he simply raved! Fast and easy to use (even for seniors). Well worth it!</li>
            <li> amazing really amazing i got it for my mom and sisters and they love it too it cleans dead skin and caluses in no time, and its truely worth buying,</li>
            <li> This was a gift I can not tell you anything about the product since I do not own one.</li>
            <li> Best personal beauty item ever!!! My heels were gross despite regular pedis, moisturizer, and pumice and Ped Egg. In 1 use, soft as a baby&#x27;s bum! It looked like it snowed in my trash can! :-0 Nice long cord, a snap to use. Bought one for a friend within 10 minutes of using mine. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Works really well! Definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> I have purchased several callus removing tools before, some better than others.  I thought with an egg-shaped one and battery-operated rotating head, it was ok, but I had reached to top of the heap.&lt;br /&gt;One more try was the EMJOI and what a difference!  It sands right through the calluses without a nic to the good skin.  I simply do not know how is does it!  I figured anything that did such an efficient job would somehow be painful.  But no pain, all gain....and baby soft skin that actually absorbs the lotion again.  I am so pleasantly surprised that I am using it nightly for the fun of it....who would have thought?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price as it is heads above the rest, easy to hold onto and use at any angle, and powerful even on just two batteries....not changed them yet.&lt;br /&gt;By the way - the blue roller is course and if you&#x27;re into being prepared, you can also purchase a twin pack of one course and one super course (pink) replacement rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, to the person who wrote about inability to clean.  It&#x27;s sandpaper!  How often have you been able to clean sandpaper?  This is a personal device.  Get two or change the roller for the next person.  Just don&#x27;t expect it to do something like clean itself.  The handle-holder cleans beautifully.</li>
            <li> Works very good.  Easy to handle and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased that I gave this a chance, it really helps keep on top of my callouses which grow very quickly. My soles look healthy for the first time in a long time. A pleasant surprise was that I used to be plagued by burning, painful feet at night and apparently I was not taking care of the callouses right, though this might not be the case for everyone, as soon as I used the emjoi that whole business stopped. I make sure to follow directions and use it without pressure. I&#x27;m chuffed.</li>
            <li> Use 1 time and stopped working they were to pay my return shipping which they did not new one is working better have used it twice cost me $10.+ to get new one so keep this in mind if you buy one</li>
            <li> this machine works wonders&lt;br /&gt;it really works great&lt;br /&gt;i used to use the ped egg but i have keep stroking and my girl would get tired after&lt;br /&gt;with this machine its really easy to do it and its faster. i ordered the green set of rollers because they are really course and to start the green ones work great. After i used the blue one for maintaining my smoothness of my feet&lt;br /&gt;i do recommend this for smooth feet&lt;br /&gt;my girl uses it too</li>
            <li> this is awesome, my calluses are why I get a pedicure every 2-3 weeks, now I can stretch it out a bit longer and save a little cash.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro-Pedi Foot Buffer is very easy to use.  Leaves feet feeling soft and smooth.  Just turn on and guide it.</li>
            <li> Amazed at how well it works. Goodbye expensive salon pedicures! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> The only issue I have (why it&#x27;s 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the buffing refill rollers are quite expensive and you have to replace them often. But in terms of does it work, yes it does. I replaced my battery one with this one to save on having to replace lots of batteries.</li>
            <li> This product gets rid of callouses quick and is easy to use. Glad I have it available when I need it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product. Easy to use, leaves feet feeling smooth and works great.</li>
            <li> I think I lost 10 punds after the first use.  I only have the buffer and got so much junk off.  Imagine if I had the coarse tip!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the first time I used it I was extremely impressed.  Being in a warm climate, I wear sandals most of the year so my feet are subjected to the elements year round and sometimes need some extra TLC for dry skin especially on my heels. The Emjoi made my feet and heels soft and supple in one use..  Love it!</li>
            <li> works very good would like roller to be a more coarse sandpaper roller</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great deal, on price as well as the ranking; then after buying one, I started reading reviews on the &amp;#34;Amop√© Pedi Perfect Electronic Pedicure Foot File&amp;#34; not only are there almost 4x  as many reviews, but they average higher in their ranking,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So people, look around before you buy, don&#x27;t wait until after like I did!</li>
            <li> Think this is going to be great!! Gave it as a gift and my daughter is already using it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and quiet. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> my husband said whoever did your pedicure deserves an extra tip!!! i took the money but we will keep it a secret&lt;br /&gt;this is the secret.i&#x27;m so glad i found it!!!!! i give it a 10+++++++</li>
            <li> For someone with Arthritis this product made it easy to do my pedicure and it was fast. Highly recommended would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> After only two months of joyous use, my Micropedi just whirs and now does not work correctly. Unfortunately, the return time has expired and now I have a useless item in my possession.</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on the reviews. This device is worth the money.</li>
            <li> My wife is a cosmetologist.  I bought this for her personal use.  She is so impressed that she is buying one for her salon.  I definitely would recommend the corded one that I bought as it remains powerful through it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> This thing is useless. Although it is a corded tool, but it is very weak. It barely does anything to the callus on my feet.</li>
            <li> Wow! I am truly enjoying my Emhoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> So often a product doesn&#x27;t perform as described but this item is fabulous!  Very effecient removal of calluses on my heels. Made them very smooth in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  So easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt your feet!</li>
            <li> You can purchase this on QVC for $24.95  and it comes with 2 rollers. At 34.95 you would think that this would come with at least 2 rollers. Buy this from QVC!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought the cordless one first.  Nice, but was constantly replacing batteries.  Save yourself the trouble and spring for the corded one.</li>
            <li> First I ordered battery model worked great on my feet received mannicure set today my fingers look good after useing tools today I ordered corded model great products. To self groom.</li>
            <li> I love that this does not need batteries and it has a pretty powerful little motor. I have terrible thick callouses on my heels and the balls of my feet and this is the first tool I have found to grind down that dry hard skin to where it is smooth and looks good. The sanding wheels are durable as well and do not wear out quickly.  I have loved this gadget from the first time I used it and hopefully it will last for a long time to come. Well worth the expense!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific personal tool. I now and for always will have nice soft feet and no more rough chapped heels in my summer sandals. Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much, I got one for my mom. She loves it too.</li>
            <li> I wear flip flops and backless shoes often enough to cause hard, rough calluses on my feet. I am also hypothyroid so I have dry skin on my extremities. Put those 2 together and they equal dry, cracking, callused and ugly heels. Since I&#x27;m not a total barbarian, I do have an arsenal of Pedi Eggs, a Microplane Egg, a pumice stone with handle for the shower, one of those ultra rough, sponge like faux pumice rectangles one uses with soap, a deadly razor tool (for wet feet only!) to shave calluses and 4 diamond foot files in various strengths to keep the calluses at bay. In addition, I get a professional pedicure every 3 weeks. All well and good, but the pumicing and filing and shaving keep the soles and heels soft for 2-3 days at most, and then the calluses build up, thicken and get rough again. I work full time, I&#x27;m single and there are no foot fetishists in my life who are longing to buff and file my feet on a daily basis and quite frankly, I am not up to doing it myself every day, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was considering the Big Splurge for a Clarisonic device for the feet, but could not justify it. Last Wednesday, I spent 45 minutes with first the Ped Egg, then the 4 files and a good slathering of Eucerin cream for feet. The same week, I went for a Friday pedicure and just prior to it, in spite of the Wednesday filing and buffing, my heels looked like I&#x27;d hiked the Italian Alps barefoot. Since Google is everyone&#x27;s friend and I was growing tired of spending more time on my feet than I do on vacuuming, I researched \\&quot;best callus remover\\&quot; which led me to Amazon and the Emjoi Callus Remover. Since I am sick of battery operated things, I went for the \\&quot;Most Powerful &amp; Corded\\&quot; model and it arrived today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE SURE TO START WITH DRY FEET. Don&#x27;t use this on moist feet, after soaking your feet or right out of the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi Micro-Pedi POWER-Callus Remover is nicely packaged with an extra roller, a cleaning brush and a drawstring travel bag. Instant gratification is a biggie for me so I wanted to put this to work right away. I plugged it in and started on my left foot. One does not have to press or push or labor at using this little darling. Simply push the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button in and up and touch the blue roller to your callus. Operative word is TOUCH. Imagine placing your finger on a baby&#x27;s eyelid or a butterfly&#x27;s wing. The roller does the rest. I gently moved the roller all over my left heel for about 3 minutes, then stopped so I could look at and feel my handy work and clean the debrided skin from the roller. My heel was like satin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent, in total, about 10 minutes on each foot-heel, ball of the foot, outer edge of the big toe, outer edge of the little toe, instep. Not only was this easy, but I was astounded at the amount of dry, rough skin that was coming off so soon after my 45 minute routine of last week and the recent pedicure. My heels still have cracks, but they are not open cracks and I know smoothing them out will take time. The nicest part of using the Emjoi? The gentle buzz of the roller was almost as good as a foot massage and I was extremely relaxed when I finished my feet and cleaned the roller for the last time before putting everything away in the travel bag. Do you need to spend 10 minutes per foot? Not really, but this was so gentle and soothing, I did not want to stop. Since I was not gouging skin off my feet or digging down with a razor tool into tender new skin, rather just barely touching the roller to the foot, I felt no reason to rush. I will suggest using an old toothbrush to clean the roller. The brush that comes with the Emjoi is small and not really well suited to the job, especially if you have heavy calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet felt fresh, soft, pampered and revived when I was through. I think the ideal treatment, time permitting, would be to use the Emjoi as long as desired on dry feet, followed by a soak in warm, scented water, followed by an application of a thick lotion and then retire to bed. That&#x27;s my plan for the next go &#x27;round. I think it would be super to trade off using this on a friend and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why people reviewed the battery operated model under this product-but I would not trade this in for anything! If you love feeling pampered, have hard to vanquish calluses, wear lots of backless or revealing shoes, are just a hedonist (or all of the aforementioned), this belongs in your foot care bag of tricks! What a fantastic purchase!hen retire to bed. That&#x27;s my plan for the next go &#x27;round.

            <li> I have tried lots of different things to get rid of the callouses and dry dead skin on my heels. Most just do not work well-- pumice stones and the like are just messy and take a lot of rubbing to do any good at all. This device is fabulous-- gently sands away the dry skin and leaves your feet so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried many options to remove callouses from my feet (pumice stones, kredo knives and even medicated disks), but nothing ever left the skin on my feet as soft as this machine did!</li>
            <li> This item is worth buying. It really works wonders and it is easy to use. Received it in a good timeline and it was well packaged. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with dry scaly feet with hard callouses.  Sometimes I would even cut them off.  This product is fast and easy and I won&#x27;t ever have to cut again.  I highly recommend it and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have ticklish feet and getting a pedicure at a salon is pure torture! Using this product is so easy and does a wonderful job. Feet can look good all year round.</li>
            <li> Works great. Unlike battery powered types it has consistant power that does not fade.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product very much,so she wanted to get another one for my daughter.She had used my wife&#x27;s so it pleased her fine.</li>
            <li> Very effective for dry,cracked skin on your heels.This is a problem if you wear clog style shoes.</li>
            <li> This proved to be the most productive instrument of this kind that I have used.  I bought it as a gift and tried it out immediately on that family member.  It does what it says and does a pretty good job.  I am sure to purchase another one soon.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Makes my heels extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t take much work. The only complaint I have is that i wish it wasn&#x27;t as gentle. I need a higher powered item.</li>
            <li> It works!  IT WORKS!!!  I&#x27;ve had rough, calloused and cracked heels my whole adult life. No amount of sloughing or filing has ever worked for me. I occasionally used a callous shaver (yes, a blade) to get rid of them, but the callouses only came back tougher.  The Emjoi Micro-Pedi was able to smooth my heels in MINUTES.  I wish I had taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture to show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, please DO NOT expect miracles. My heels were so deeply cracked that it will take a while for me to get them in shape. But after just one use my heels were smooth and presentable enough to wear sandals in public without embarrassment. AND they no longer snag my sheets and socks.  This product has exceeded my expectations. It is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I purchased the corded model. Didn&#x27;t want to be bothered with batteries. I believe that I have found value here.</li>
            <li> I previously had a ped egg, never again.  Bought this product and it is absolutely fantastic, so easy to use.  I suffer terribly with hard skin but I have never had such smooth feet as I have now in such a short time.  Would highly recommend to anyone.  So pleased with the item I bought one for my daught and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what is wrong with some people - seems like no matter how great a product is, some people need to tear it down.  This thing works great - I am a man who often wears flip flops and feel I owe it to the public to not have disgusting feet.  I&#x27;ve used the Micro plane, which was the best thing I&#x27;d found, until I read about this in a magazine.  There is no comparison - thisnis infintely better.  After one use, your feet will be transformed. Seriously.</li>
            <li> It leaves my heels silky smooth and soft ! love this machine. very happy with this purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Love this product it does exactly what it says it will do.  Just be sure to clean&lt;br /&gt;the old skin off after each use and the roller will last a lot longer.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! Saved my coarse, thick, cracking heels. I use with the extreme coarse rollers.  I have tried many products and this one by far out preforms anything I have used.</li>
            <li> As soon as i got them My Husband Did His feet, It Is Amazing And Got It On time, Thank You</li>
            <li> Living in San Diego I wear flip flops and sandals everyday.  My heels get really dry especially during the summer walking around the pool with no shoes on.  I needed more help than the pumice stone, and grater.  This did the job. Plug it in and smooth soft heels again.  Its like using a mini sander on your heels.  I have used the same roller three times and it still has a few more uses in it. I purchased the slightly courser rollers also. I popped one in, used on each heel about 30 seconds ,then switched back to the finer roller for smoothing.  The roller it comes with is good enough on its own, but i need some serious help.  I purchased one for my mother and sister in law.  I use it on my husbands feet and on his eczema thickend knees and elbows.  Be sure to put a towel or paper towel under your foot when using because the dry skin becomes a powder that falls to the floor, yuk.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was terrific when I first got it. It did the job really well. However, after a few months it stopped working. I changed the batteries and I also changed the rollers, both to no avail whatsoever. Really disappointed in this product. If it works for you then it&#x27;s great, but breaking down after just a short time is simply unacceptable.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOODNESS!!  Where has this been all my life!??!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Love this, got very fast in the mail. The best I have ever tryed works real good the best there is</li>
            <li> Makes my feet so soft!  Love this!  In the winter-time, my feet get so dry and flaky, and I use this before applying lotion, and my feet feel so awesome.  Love products like this!</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product since the reviews I read BEFORE ordering it were positive and encouraging. Finally a product worth buying...that was NOT the case! The callus remover had very little to NO power. I might as well have used a toy! The sanding disc was a fine grade so it wouldn&#x27;t remove dry skin let alone a callus! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!</li>
            <li> works pretty good... plug is not tight, it falls out...</li>
            <li> This item actually does what it says it does.  I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products on my feet, including the expensive Diamancel foot files -- this is far better.  It does a better job than foot files and you don&#x27;t have to kill yourself--the product does the work for you.  I&#x27;ve had good experience with Emjoi products, so I was willing to give this a try.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this. Pedicure results at home!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this little machine</li>
            <li> It is almost as good as my Podiatrist.  I travel with it and and it has served me well, especially when I am in the Tropics and have a tendency to wear open-toed shoes and FitFlops.</li>
            <li> I loved this gizmo, BUT it only worked twice!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I could have had 2 pedicures for the same amount of money.  REALLY Bummed out!&lt;br /&gt;AND I do not have extra money to waste in this economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(and yes, I did try putting in new batteries)</li>
            <li> Works great! Happy with the way it leaves my feet. Bring on those summer sandals!</li>
            <li> This works great. My only complaint is that it goes through batteries fast. I will be upgrading to the new electric version for that reason but it really does work very well.</li>
            <li> I love it and purchased one for my son.  definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Small and compact. I bought it for a gift.  Hope it works as well as it is advertised to do.  If it does, it will be well worth it.It&#x27;s the day after Valentines Day and I have to tell you, this product is all and more that it was advertised to be. It&#x27;s quick, efficient and so easy to use. I am going to order replacement rollers right now so I will never be without it.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This little beauty is the answer to my prayers.  I now have smooth feet all the time, without lotions and socks at bedtime.  It is very fast and effective.  I was so happy with this product, I bought every woman in my family one.......and they love theirs too.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this little gem.  It is easy and safe.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product.  This is one of the best gadget I have ever bought.  I will be buying several as gifts for my family and friends.  A must have.  Its also cost effective, as it saves you on pedi. visits to salons.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best things i have ever bought.  I used to have the roughest, driest, flaky, cracked gross feet ever.  I use this just about everyday (I work out everyday and really need it).  This has transformed my feet.  I previously had the battery operated model and it just wasn&#x27;t enough power and did eat batteries (I had to replace just about every time I used the product).  Once I use, I rinse my feet off with hot water and put some heavy duty lotion on.  I then put moisture booties on while i sleep.  I think the key is also putting lotion on once you use.  I would definitely buy again and would recommend to anyone.  I spend so much less getting pedicures now because I don&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li> Can not beat the results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, this product does not have much power at all. Was expecting a lot more.</li>
            <li> i love my feet now. theyre so smooth. i play soccer all the time so my feet are constantly getting callouses. this helps keep them lady like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 20 years trying to find a way to heal my heels.  The last 2 years I babied them 9 months of the year &amp; they never healed before summer. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week but the difference is amazing.  My nylons never snag anymore because of my calluses anymore. I&#x27;m glad I splurged &amp; I think the plug in is a much better option than battery operated.  Amy</li>
            <li> Loved this until my dog ate it.  Works well.  Must be close to electrical outlet.</li>
            <li> Okay, if I could I would give this product 50 STARS!  I PURCHASED THE EMJOI MICRO PEDI POWER (corded)CALLUS REMOVER.  this is the best pedicure product I have ever used!  It is gentle, and left my heels and the balls of my feet looking smoother and pinker than they have looked in years!  Much better than any professional pedicure!  Really!  My feet actually feel &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; not tired.  I am very very pleased with my purchase.  I am glad I selected the corded model as I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries.  Yes - definitely purchase for yourself or someone you like as a present.  You or they will be pleased.</li>
            <li> Vey nice! Works very well...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she has used several types of foot care products, she said that this is by far the best item that she has tried on her feet!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful.  Really gets rid of callouses in matter of a few swipes.  Glad they came out with the corded variety since you never know when batteries are going to run out.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product, for sure!</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT ON ROUGH SKIN ON MY FEET, AND ITS HAS ENOUGH POWER FOR MY BF&#x27;S FEET TOO.  I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WITH ROUGH SKIN THEY WANT TO GET RID OF!!!</li>
            <li> thanks&lt;br /&gt;very good material</li>
            <li> The Emjoi worked just like it is supposed to.  It removed callus and left a smooth foot in its place.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be for a corded unit.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the performance of this item.  I now have very smooth feet without much fuss.  No more pumice stones for me!!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this I used it once and the second time I used it it died wouldnt spin anymore.JUNK!!</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with the product</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for myself from somewhere else but this one I got for my husband since he saw what a great job mine had done for me. This is a stocking stuffer for him so he has not gotten it yet but I received it from the seller in a very timely manner and the packaging was in great shape. If you have any sort of calluses or any kind of buildup on your heels or even your toes, try this Emjoi out, I think you will love it just like I do. You can also buy the refill cartridges on Amazon as well. This is safer and less expensive than going to a salon and having it done for you and paying them a fortune over time to take care of something that you can do yourself and save all that cash for a new pair of shoes to show off how great your feet will  look just after a couple of uses. Mine looked 100% better after just the first use but I use it about 2-3 times a month just for touch ups. It works like a dream!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t given up getting my pedicures, but it helps for in between.  I haven&#x27;t been able to master the evenness of using it yet.  I&#x27;m sure with a little more practice and I will.  It removes the dead skin.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I can say that it \\&quot;polishes\\&quot; dry skin off your feet, rather than removes calluses. This is good for traveling when you don&#x27;t have access to all your pedi tools. It left my heels feel smoother, but it did not eliminate the full layer of the calluses like a razor would, and my feet are not that callused to begin with!! Second point is that it should be chargeable instead of battery operated, as it is quite inconvenient and uses a lot of battery life. My verdict - it is OK for in between really well done pedis, where your calluses are removed completely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. I am so glad I bought the cord option. Need all the power you can get.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad who loathes going for pedicures to remove the hard skin on his heels. It was utterly useless for that purpose. EMOJI is not meant for someone with rough feet. Rather, it is meant for someone who already has smooth feet and intends to maintain the smoothness. The hard skin on the heel is merely just smoothed down just a little bit - well it does say it&#x27;s only a \\&quot;buffer\\&quot;. A 10-min walk barefoot on sandy ground would have worked better. Another sad thing was, when we pressed it down to the heel just a little bit, it stopped rotating altogether... Lame :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because I think that the replacement rollers are too expensive.  That being said, I like the products.  It takes off a mountain of dead skin and so I like to use it outside.  I plan on buying them for birthday gifts to give the girls, I know they will like it too.  I was addicted to the callous remover with the blade on it, but the bottoms of my feet get really uneven when I use them, so I still use that thing, but I use this to smooth my feet out after I use the blade.  I also used it on my husbands feet and it didn&#x27;t hurt him or wear my arm out like the ped egg.</li>
            <li> I originally saw this on HSN or QVC (can&#x27;t remember) and I was sold based off of that broadcast.  I purchased from Amazon because I love the PRIME 2-day shipping. I really like the foot pedi buffer and it does a really good job. I am able to stretch out my visits to the salon for a pedicure and use this in between.  My husband even likes to use it on days when he knows he is going to wear flip flops (California!!!).  Don&#x27;t hesitate to pick this up for anyone who likes smooth feet.</li>
            <li> More powerful than the battery operated model but it has its limits. It&#x27;s most useful as a foot smoother but don&#x27;t expect it to do heavy duty work. For that you&#x27;ll probably need a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> These are the best!  If you buy it you will love it.  The person who does your pedicures will love you for it.</li>
