            <li>Nice selection of lengths to choose from.</li>
            <li>Good working product for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy haircuts &#x3D; happy kids.</li>
            <li>so I love this one</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the side ear combs on my husband, I just use the correct color comb instead, I have more control.</li>
            <li>Love the color coding, and all of the accessories it comes with.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my husband, who shaves his head - one of many he&#x27;s had over the years.</li>
            <li>It was extremely easy to use, the different size in combs allowed a perfect learning process and eased my nervousness  </li>
            <li>Works great (also secretly used it on the dog to shave a hot-spot) and it worked great for that as well!</li>
            <li>My wife clip my hair for me and she ssaid it is easy to do.</li>
            <li>Color coded clips are a godsend, easy to remember.</li>
            <li>It does a great job, doesn&#x27;t get so hot he can&#x27;t use it, and has held up very well.</li>
            <li>Recommended for kids because its color, they enjoy using it</li>
            <li>very nice, easy to change the guides, and LOVE that it has left and right ear guides that shade the hairline in and prevent it from tickling so much around my ears!  </li>
            <li>Cuts hair quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>made quick work of my thinning lettuce</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone needing a quick buzz cut on a budget.</li>
            <li>So far, this is his favorite.</li>
            <li>Great little cutter!</li>
            <li>No other cutter I had lasted more than a year.</li>
            <li>I cut my fiance&#x27;s hair ever few weeks since it grows so fast, and this works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty loud, heavy and had a strong vibe, but overall I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Just got done using these for the first time.</li>
            <li>The one thing I wish it had was a nice case, but I sew, and will make a little carrying pouch for it all.  </li>
            <li>This one does the job but is SO much quieter that the ConAir.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much else</li>
            <li>I chose a Wahl cutters kit due to their reputation and love it.</li>
            <li>I cut my husbands hair whenever he needs it now, and it looks professional!</li>
            <li>We bought this set of clippers because I was receiving complaints that my old one sounded like a Boing 747.</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud but doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete kit with the scissors and comb, etc.  </li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>I can cut and keep my hair trimmed the same length easily with no more trips to the barber.</li>
            <li>not only was it loud</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this guy since middle of June 2013 and even now almost two years later it still feels like new.</li>

            <li> I wanted something mid-range in price, to use with my long haired cat.  </li>

            <li> Sharp, color coated guides</li>

            <li> Am very unhappy with this cutter.1st its very loud.by the 3rd time I used it</li>
            <li> Comes with a few accessories that make cutting hair a lot easier.</li>
            <li> your money and buy there as 1 piece comes with case, disappointed no case fore this price point</li>

            <li> it was annoying how it adjusted itself</li>

            <li> We bought this set of clippers because I was receiving complaints that my old one sounded like a Boing 747. This one does the job but is SO much quieter that the ConAir.</li>
            <li> Use this every month to cut my husbands hair. Works great (also secretly used it on the dog to shave a hot-spot) and it worked great for that as well! Good working product for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t have adjustable trimmer on the side and all the other models have it and it was annoying how it adjusted itself so I love this one just keeps the blade in place. You need a screwdriver to use though.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, very light, works excellent,cuts perfect.  Very pleased with my buy.    Recommended for kids because its color, they enjoy using it</li>
            <li> I love these clippers!!!!  I like that the guides are color coded as to their size and it is also indicated on the clipper itself so you don&#x27;t have to second guess or have an OOPS moment~!  They work very well.</li>
            <li> The color coding is so convenient for amateurs like me! I cut my husbands hair whenever he needs it now, and it looks professional!</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for me simply because I wanted to start wearing my hair almost shavedto the scalp. These clippers work just great. My wife clip my hair for me and she ssaid it is easy to do. The blades just pop off and on. Not a loud buzz. Great instruction book.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Easy to use!!  Cutting combs are color coordinated to the directions for length of cut and if you start out with the larger size, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the side ear combs on my husband, I just use the correct color comb instead, I have more control.</li>
            <li> Just got done using these for the first time. No hair pulls. Surprisingly quiet. Nice selection of lengths to choose from.</li>
            <li> I looked after ordered and found 21 piece for 21.97 at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy there as 1 piece comes with case, disappointed no case fore this price point</li>
            <li> It does its job. Can&#x27;t say much else but it hasn&#x27;t failed.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the colored combs with lengths labeled.</li>
            <li> This was perfect.  I needed this for myself and I didn&#x27;t want to continuously pay alot for trimming my short doo.  It was extremely easy to use, the different size in combs allowed a perfect learning process and eased my nervousness  It is a bit loud but doesn&#x27;t bother me.  The price was perfect.</li>
            <li> I chose a Wahl cutters kit due to their reputation and love it. I can cut and keep my hair trimmed the same length easily with no more trips to the barber. Buy this haircutting kit and you&#x27;ll see for yourself. No regrets! Great buy and service from Amazon...</li>
            <li> Great product just as described everything arrived in super good condition and worked as its suppose too..</li>
            <li> Perfect for my San Bernard on summer</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, this buzzer kicks ass. I cut my fiance&#x27;s hair ever few weeks since it grows so fast, and this works great. Love the color coding, and all of the accessories it comes with. Great buy! :]</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband, who shaves his head - one of many he&#x27;s had over the years. So far, this is his favorite. It does a great job, doesn&#x27;t get so hot he can&#x27;t use it, and has held up very well. Lots of attachments for those who need them and well-constructed.</li>
            <li> Am very unhappy with this cutter.1st its very loud.by the 3rd time I used it not only was it loud but it didnt cut well.even pulled the hair.would not recimmend this one to anyone!</li>
            <li> Our family loves easy care hair, and this is the best set of clippers that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Sharp, color coated guides so people just need to remember their color, not an obscure number or measurement.  It&#x27;s a complete kit with the scissors and comb, etc.  The one thing I wish it had was a nice case, but I sew, and will make a little carrying pouch for it all.  Use it on hubby&#x27;s beard and hair, my hair and my  mother&#x27;s alike... very nice, easy to change the guides, and LOVE that it has left and right ear guides that shade the hairline in and prevent it from tickling so much around my ears!  INCREDIBLY HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I wanted something mid-range in price, to use with my long haired cat.  It&#x27;s a little noisy, but works well.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair quickly and smoothly.  It&#x27;s pretty loud, heavy and had a strong vibe, but overall I am very happy with it.  Quick, easy haircuts &#x3D; happy kids.</li>
            <li> made quick work of my thinning lettuce</li>
            <li> Great little cutter! Comes with a few accessories that make cutting hair a lot easier. Color coded clips are a godsend, easy to remember.
