            <li>tissue holder is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but Velcro doesn&#x27;t work perfect on carpet.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have vents to the backseat for air conditioning, it is great.</li>
            <li>Otherwise you have to place it to the side which isn&#x27;t great for reaching a tissue from the front seat.</li>
            <li>Great invention.</li>

            <li>Very nice design</li>
            <li>Superior quality for the money.</li>
            <li>My Prius has a space on on the floor between the driver &amp; passenger&#x27;s side that is the perfect fit and not in anyone&#x27;s way.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t move around - really nice.  </li>
            <li>[...]  Nicely made, and recommended for those of us who need a supply of kleenex handy wherever we go.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most innovative ideas of our time.</li>
            <li>Yes we are pleased with it and how it looks in the vehicle.</li>
            <li>We all love it as a family.</li>
            <li>nice fit.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT THANKS TO WHO EVER CREATED THIS.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly on the middle hump.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to try to make one myself, so I&#x27;m delighted to find it being sold at such a good price.</li>
            <li>only comes in the beige color but is very good construction</li>
            <li>Love this tissue holder, light, versatile, can put a variety of places.  </li>
            <li>Works well and easy to replace tissue boxes.  </li>
            <li>It stays in place and the zipper will make it easy to replace box.</li>
            <li>I can reach it easily from either the driver or passenger seat.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to reach.  </li>
            <li>It stays secure with the Velcro bottom that holds onto the carpet</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good, and</li>
            <li>Very useful and aesthetic.</li>
            <li>Clean+net) construction with a zippered top, and fits my box nicely- even though it is actually a Kirkland (Costco) box.</li>
            <li>Now that most cars have cup holders, no place for a box of tissues has become my new auto annoyance.  </li>
            <li>great little gadget.</li>
            <li>Great little invention.</li>
            <li>A very handy little gadget that doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>Stays in place, easy to use and offers exactly what you want it to do.  </li>
            <li>It stuck to my floor for about three days before it fell off the first time.  </li>
            <li>My tissue boxes were very beat up being tossed from the floor to the passenger seat to the back seat depending on who was driving and how many passengers were along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this keeps it in a certain spot and keeps the tissue box from falling apart.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This handy little holder solves the problem.  </li>
            <li>Just finished driving 4700 miles and the tissue holder stayed in place the whole time even with the back seat filled with bags, notebooks, and jackets that got jostled around from time to time.  </li>
            <li>and really serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>for whatever reason, maybe because my husband throws it everywhere, my tissue box gets really beat up in the car and falls apart.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I used to just use some velcro adhesive hook on the bottom of my kleenex box for the hump behind the armrest (just like they show in the picture, and worked great until the tissues ran out, then try to find my velcro again-</li>
            <li>My wife just absolutely loves it her Kleenex is</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This really works for me.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to just reach back to the middle hump and pull out a tissue from either front seat or from any of the rear passenger seats.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that the Velcro could be a little more coarse so it sticks to the carpet better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to see if anyone made a holder, and pretty much only could find this one.</li>
            <li>They evidently make several sizes-</li>
            <li>I plopped it right where I usually have it- sticks to the carpeting with the whole bottom being the velcro hook fabric.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The holder can be found in several different sizes if you prefer using a large box of tissue.</li>
            <li>Looks like it won&#x27;t fit a standard small kleenex box, but it does.</li>
            <li>Stays in place nicely within reach behind my center console in Chev Equinox.</li>
            <li>Zipper a little stiff, but works out fine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have vents to the backseat for air conditioning, it is great. Otherwise you have to place it to the side which isn&#x27;t great for reaching a tissue from the front seat. It doesn&#x27;t move around though which I like.</li>
            <li> Awesome. I can keep my tissues within reach and no big fuss finding a way to attach them to the vehicle.</li>
            <li> Very nice design and really serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most innovative ideas of our time. Keeps the tissue box from flying all over the back of your car. It is very easy to just reach back to the middle hump and pull out a tissue from either front seat or from any of the rear passenger seats. Great invention.</li>
            <li> I have actually made two different purchases of this product. I now have this Tissue holder located in both my vehicles. Superior quality for the money.</li>
            <li> great little gadget. I wanted something to keep my tissue box from exploding in the car. for whatever reason, maybe because my husband throws it everywhere, my tissue box gets really beat up in the car and falls apart. this keeps it in a certain spot and keeps the tissue box from falling apart. so far so good.</li>
            <li> Yes we are pleased with it and how it looks in the vehicle.</li>
            <li> This is the handiest little product we have purchased. We have it just like the picture, sitting on the floor of the back seat between the front seat, simply reach back and get a tissue when you need it. It has hook &amp; loop and fastens to the carpet so it doesn&#x27;t move around - really nice.  Recommend that everyone have one in their vehicle!</li>
            <li> Very useful and aesthetic. Matches my seats&#x27; color perfectly. We all love it as a family. We used to put a box of tissue in the car before and it would either be stepped on or tissues would be wasted. No wasting tissues anymore.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I received it as it is a mesh, zip-able container with a double back taped bottom to adhere to the surface. Since I was putting on the carpeted hump on the floor board behind the front seats, I doubted that the tape would hold - but it does! Won&#x27;t have to search for the tissue box anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this tissue holder, light, versatile, can put a variety of places.  My only complain is that the Velcro could be a little more coarse so it sticks to the carpet better.</li>
            <li> Stays in place, easy to use and offers exactly what you want it to do.  Highly recommend.  I bought two.</li>
            <li> Keep&#x27;s tissue box in place.  No more digging around behind the front seat to find a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install. agood product.</li>
            <li> This item is nothing but a tissue box cover with two-sided tape on the bottom.  It stuck to my floor for about three days before it fell off the first time.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just finished driving 4700 miles and the tissue holder stayed in place the whole time even with the back seat filled with bags, notebooks, and jackets that got jostled around from time to time.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Now my tissues aren&#x27;t moving all over the car.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this tissue holder.  I use it in my car and it&#x27;s so convenient to have the tissues close at hand when I need them.</li>
            <li> I used to just use some velcro adhesive hook on the bottom of my kleenex box for the hump behind the armrest (just like they show in the picture, and worked great until the tissues ran out, then try to find my velcro again- so I decided to see if anyone made a holder, and pretty much only could find this one. It was hard to tell how it is made by description or photos, so I took a chance with it- I thought a little pricey, but no one else seems to make one.  It is a nylon mesh (Cleanet- O I get it now- Clean+net) construction with a zippered top, and fits my box nicely- even though it is actually a Kirkland (Costco) box. Zipper a little stiff, but works out fine. I plopped it right where I usually have it- sticks to the carpeting with the whole bottom being the velcro hook fabric. I can change in situ, or remove and change outside the car. So far so good, and I like that it stays where I put it.  They evidently make several sizes- the 005 is for the (not exactly) cube containers- nice fit. You can go to their website to see the others: [...]  Nicely made, and recommended for those of us who need a supply of kleenex handy wherever we go. It seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> GREAT INVENTION  SOME ONE FINALLY THOUGHT THERE WAS A NEED FOR TISSUE HOLDERS IN CARS AND TRUCKS. WORKS GREAT THANKS TO WHO EVER CREATED THIS.</li>
            <li> All tha it says it is, all that other reviews indicate.  A very simple invention that is extremely handy.&lt;br /&gt;What a pleasure not to have to rummage around looking for a tumbling tissue box.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to replace tissue boxes.  Stays in place nicely within reach behind my center console in Chev Equinox.</li>
            <li> Looks like it won&#x27;t fit a standard small kleenex box, but it does. I just put it on the floor and it sticks to the carpet and stays in place.  Great little invention.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product. So convenient and the tissue box is no longer everywhere but where we want it. It stays in place and the zipper will make it easy to replace box. Yesterday my husband said it was the best purchase ever.</li>
            <li> The best invention yet, works like a charm and made in USA.  Workmanship outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to friend and others.</li>
            <li> Works just like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> My tissue boxes were very beat up being tossed from the floor to the passenger seat to the back seat depending on who was driving and how many passengers were along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tissue holder is the perfect solution.  My Prius has a space on on the floor between the driver &amp; passenger&#x27;s side that is the perfect fit and not in anyone&#x27;s way.  I can reach it easily from either the driver or passenger seat.  It stays secure with the Velcro bottom that holds onto the carpet (I didn&#x27;t need the extra Velcro piece that came with it),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sew, and I can see how well designed and well made the tissue holder is.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to try to make one myself, so I&#x27;m delighted to find it being sold at such a good price.</li>
            <li> My wife just absolutely loves it her Kleenex is always were it is suppose to be.&lt;br /&gt;I would  recommend it to everyone that has a vehicle.</li>
            <li> A great gadget that I have been wanting and could not find until now.  It has a Velcro bottom with a removable glued piece that can be placed any where in your vehicle to attach the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only comes in the beige color but is very good construction material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holder can be found in several different sizes if you prefer using a large box of tissue.</li>
            <li> Now that most cars have cup holders, no place for a box of tissues has become my new auto annoyance.  This handy little holder solves the problem.  It fits perfectly on the middle hump.  It is easy to reach.  A self stick Velcro base keeps it firmly in place but easily removed.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  This product works without having to add the separate adhesive portion in my car.  I didn&#x27;t want to chance that portion not working and having a sticky substance lingering after it was removed.  So I tried it without that.  Does it absolutely not move at all without that portion ... no, but it does somewhat adhere and I decided to use it that way.  This really works for me.</li>
            <li> A very handy little gadget that doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space.  It fits the box like a glove.</li>
            <li> Great product, but Velcro doesn&#x27;t work perfect on carpet. Hasn&#x27;t fallen over yet though.</li>
