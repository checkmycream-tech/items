            <li>Great value.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>This is a great practical package that includes all the face care necessities at a great price.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more kits!!</li>
            <li>I think this is very nice for your skin and works well, but I haven&#x27;t seen any appreciable difference with the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The foaming cleanser is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It helped bright up my face and even cleared some sun spots</li>
            <li>I loved it and used it for 4 years, and then of course I thought I found a \\&quot;better\\&quot; NEWER product</li>
            <li>This is a really good buy if you like the anti-wrinkle cream--</li>
            <li>May be a good product for some people</li>
            <li>This is a good buy when you purchase the three products together.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes good product&#x27;s, so will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>removes make up good.</li>
            <li>good eye cream.</li>
            <li>It smooths out wonderfully though, feels really light and is not greasy/shiny at all.</li>
            <li>This is a good package if you want to try it out.</li>
            <li>Good results.</li>
            <li>The face wash was good but the moisturizer was not all that moisturizing, and the eye cream would cause my eyes to burn</li>
            <li>so that was a good thing</li>
            <li>The scrub is great and the eye cream is good but would like some more mostrising from the face cream.</li>
            <li>The moisturiser however is pleasant and feels nice going on.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product 2 days ago, over all it feels so good after applying, moisturizes nicely, and smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>Great product like all of the Neutrogena products and getting the whole set delivered right to your door for a great price is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Amazing deal, for the face wash, the face lotion, and the eye cream I paid $12.00, which is what you pay for just the face lotion alone, in store and even on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing after one use.</li>
            <li>This stuff has made my skin noticeably clearer and generally more bright and youthful looking.</li>
            <li>: I really liked this cream.</li>
            <li>The retinol moisturizer is nice, however, I have oily skin--</li>
            <li>The spf was a nice addition &amp; didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift and friend liked it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy and the price is right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;am delighted with this product, easily absorbed, pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very satisfied repeat customer :)</li>
            <li>Great product and keeps my skin healthy and wrinkle free</li>
            <li>Not only the price is good but also all 3 products are doing awesome job.  </li>
            <li>the best for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought that set because of many good reviews and was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found those creams - going to order again.</li>
            <li>My favorite face lotion.</li>
            <li>I have not seen the results, but I feel more softness in the skin</li>
            <li>This set contains 2 of my favorite products - the eye cream and face lotion.  </li>
            <li>The price here is so much better than anyplace else.  </li>
            <li>The face wash is ok - not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>So enjoy this while it lasts!</li>
            <li>Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream SPF&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>not too sure about the face cream yet to see the difference on my face.</li>
            <li>I love this package of Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find a skin care system that was affordable and made by a company</li>
            <li>Most trials are 8-12 weeks.</li>
            <li>Is Okey  it can be better</li>
            <li>A+  :)</li>
            <li>They are fantastic!</li>
            <li>so, I have to use a mattifier on top.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and it isn&#x27;t overly fragrant.  </li>
            <li>Been using for a month and love product.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased both.</li>
            <li>Included my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogina products and have used 2 of the 3 (excluding the cleanser) before.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>To top it off I am at that age where I am getting hormone imbalances</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product kit, it works as i was loking for, face clean and a good Sensation,  and not expensive as i thoug</li>
            <li>Pretty good.....</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Healthy SkinÂ® Eye Cream to reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye area</li>
            <li>and I love how smooth it keeps my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it because it does work well, but like I said I don&#x27;t like the smell, which I can easily get over for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to place the order</li>
            <li>The cleanser is very gentle, yet effective at cleaning and removing make up.</li>
            <li>Fantastic value for the money.</li>
            <li>This system is fabulous for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I like the light texture of this.</li>
            <li>After two uses my skin looks fresh and smooth, and my 3-job fatigue is erased!  </li>
            <li>Nice set, but just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>As for results, so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>The night cream is fine (4 stars), not my favorite, but it&#x27;s nice enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I can&#x27;t say whether it removes makeup easily; however, my skin feels super clean after using it.</li>
            <li>The SEI Import Storefront has many good products at value prices and economical shipping for multiple items.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it is actually making the wrinkles better, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not getting any more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with.  </li>
            <li>She was excited, we&#x27;re a Neutrogena family and their products never disappoint.</li>
            <li>Eye irritation happens a lot for me when it comes to eye cream, so I was excited to find this.</li>
            <li>This kit has one Fresh Foaming Cleanser, which leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh and not tight; one Healthy Skin Eye Cream, great for the area under the eye; and one Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, that leaves your skin soft with a non-grasy feeling.</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>Nothing too special here.</li>
            <li>I take impecable care of my skin, chemical peels etc, but it never looks better than when I use this kit and dab pure emu oil as a moisturizer and carrier.</li>
            <li>It is total fun that this inexpensive set of creams so far proved the best of them all.</li>
            <li>i use the anti wrinkle cream and it is more then the whole kit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle anti-wrinkle system but a good quality overall.</li>
            <li>but not bad either</li>
            <li>There is a mild scent to the cleanser, so maybe that&#x27;s why I had a reaction to it</li>
            <li>Since the very first week I used it, my skin improved a lot.</li>
            <li>I also liked the it is reccomended by dermotoloygests  more ofter than other products.</li>
            <li>It simply absorbed quickly and I did not see any moisturizing effect or anti-aging benefits.  </li>
            <li>it is the first time that I use it I can see an improve!</li>
            <li>Fresh Foaming Cleanser gently removes makeup and cleanses in one easy step.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>The cleanser is nice with a mild scent, and I&#x27;ve only used the eye and wrinkle creams a couple of times, but already feel improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>especially I purchased the bare escentuals skin products but never felt good using them, as I continued to get wrinkles but felt it did great for my occasional acne.</li>
            <li>thats the only thing I liked about this kit.</li>
            <li>But it is still worth it for the price.  </li>
            <li>The product in the kit is the same size (1.4 ounces) as the cream on its own</li>
            <li>This is an economical skincare kit.</li>
            <li>I love the moisturizer, it can be worn under makeup and makes your face feel so soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The cleanser takes off my makeup fast and gently, and I love the moisterizers ;</li>
            <li>and it came right to my door.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it rinses clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Face SPF contains retinol so exfoliates dead cells, makes skin soft and glowy, also lightweight, there is no residue, skin looks healthy and perfect for regular foundations as well as mineral make up.</li>
            <li>this kit is very large and for the price i was amazed.  </li>
            <li>My biggest concern now is that it will get pulled off the marked to be replaced with a \\&quot;new updated\\&quot; version that of course won&#x27;t work as good as the older version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but the price is pretty good for the whole system, not been using long.</li>
            <li>not bad reactions but still keeps your skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>SUPER gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any fash wash or wet face cloths better than Neutrogena for taking off all makeup (like my colorstay), and mascara-even waterproof!  </li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena products and normally love them but the anti-wrinkle moisturizer or whatever clogged my pours and caused me to break out only in the places I used it.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>if you plan on trying any of the three items then you are better off getting this entire system because of the price!  </li>
            <li>but the system seems to work well for my skin: no breakouts, soft smooth texture and isn&#x27;t heavy-I can wear under makeup and it has the SPF in it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The eye cream is ok, I&#x27;m honestly not a big user</li>
            <li>I love the eye cream and moisturizer, but the facial cleanser tends to make my skin break out.  </li>
            <li>Especially when so many SPF creams smell like sunscreen and make your face shiny</li>
            <li>The cleanser is one of Neutrogena&#x27;s most basic, gentle cleansers, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>system is COMPLETE and includes: an anti-aging moisturizer, anti-aging eye cream, and a gentle facial cleanser, this convenient anti-wrinkle kit combines retinol with vitamin-rich and moisture-rich ingredients to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, and to help soften and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy and definitely will try other Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>Some wrinkles around the eyes and a large one on the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser:</li>
            <li>a pea size gives nice foam and removes all face make up and most of eye make up, doesn&#x27;t make skin dry and tight.</li>
            <li>I normally have bigger pores and red splotches but when using this set it has made my skin SO soft, made my pores almost invisible, and cleared up the redness in my face, so much so that people have noticed and complimented me on how great my skin is looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to.</li>
            <li>I use it now to wash my hands after I put my makeup on and it does wash the makeup off my hands very well</li>
            <li>I use all three of them, so really is a saving&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li>If you use these products then you will really like this.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it did too much for the wrinkles</li>
            <li>As for the eye cream, it&#x27;&#x27;s very moisturizing, yet doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>A lady told me she wants the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>There was a small bit of irritation the first week, but it is normal, it soon went away and now my skin looks much lighter and better.   </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it does the same for your face, if you can get passed the feeling of putting public restroom soap all over your face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The anti aging cream doesn&#x27;t really do to much for the face as far as anti aging goes</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really please so far.  </li>
            <li>Normally retinols should be used as a night treatment, because they make skin photosensitive.</li>
            <li>This foaming cleanser works fine, still prefer the other but will use this also.  </li>
            <li>took the advice of another user &amp;#34;midcenturymod&amp;#34; and used it at an early age hoping to prevent skin aging quickly in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m running low and must order it again right now.</li>
            <li>Wrinkle cream is great for daily use, doesn;t feel heavy or as sticky as other creams (loreal and olay), just a dab will do my whole face.  </li>
            <li>Diminished fine lines, but lets be real, there is no magic cream out there to stop growing old gracefully!  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>So honestly it would be hard for me to see the difference now, but will be back with an update after my mom uses it.</li>
            <li>Both creams work wonders and are gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This system helps clear up my skin even though it is not marketed to do so.</li>
            <li>When I was in my late teens my dermatologist recommended Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream with SPF 15, just for moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>no harsh redness.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 years old</li>
            <li>I still get complemented on my skin and frequently get told I do not look my age.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and like neutrogena products, but I&#x27;ll stick with Rapid Clear.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkles disappearing.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really expect an instant result.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and wanted to try neutrogena&#x27;s face wash, it was cheaper to buy the set.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I used these products for about a month and didn&#x27;t have any breakouts</li>
            <li>I dont see a difference in my fine lines and small wrinkles yet - but then again, it hasnt even been a week yet</li>
            <li>Using the eye cream at corners of eyes and it doesn&#x27;t take much either (previously used loreal pure retinol eye cream).  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something a little more massive than these tiny creams...</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this and the other products I purchased, for a very long time and save a huge amount of money in the process.</li>
            <li>I was using healthy skin anti-acne anti-wrinkle cream cleanser, but it has become hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li>Had major results using all three every morning and evening along with salicylic acid exfoliator and benzoyl peroxide spot treatment I had been using before.</li>
            <li>Have not had the product long enough to really see a difference, but will keep trying.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good...maybe update later.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is nice, very thin and moisturizing with no perfumes...</li>
            <li>The only major issue I have is when the moisturiser or eye cream get too close to the eye my eyes begin to sting and water.</li>
            <li>If I wake up with circles or loose skin around my eyes, I put the eye cream on and it makes me look like a new person.  </li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job and is actually really gentle on my sensitive skin but it has a really strong, unpleasant smell in my opinion.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great value for the price.  </li>
            <li> I even got my boyfriend using it because he kept commenting on how great my skin had been looking.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after using these products.  </li>
            <li> Great value.  </li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great practical package that includes all the face care necessities at a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more kits!!</li>
            <li> I think this is very nice for your skin and works well, but I haven&#x27;t seen any appreciable difference with the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The foaming cleanser is pleasant.</li>
            <li> It helped bright up my face and even cleared some sun spots</li>
            <li> I loved it and used it for 4 years, and then of course I thought I found a \\&quot;better\\&quot; NEWER product</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy if you like the anti-wrinkle cream--</li>
            <li> May be a good product for some people</li>
            <li> This is a good buy when you purchase the three products together.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes good product&#x27;s, so will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> removes make up good.</li>
            <li> good eye cream.</li>
            <li> It smooths out wonderfully though, feels really light and is not greasy/shiny at all.</li>
            <li> This is a good package if you want to try it out.</li>
            <li> Good results.</li>
            <li> The face wash was good but the moisturizer was not all that moisturizing, and the eye cream would cause my eyes to burn</li>
            <li> so that was a good thing</li>
            <li> The scrub is great and the eye cream is good but would like some more mostrising from the face cream.</li>
            <li> The moisturiser however is pleasant and feels nice going on.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product 2 days ago, over all it feels so good after applying, moisturizes nicely, and smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love!  </li>
            <li> Great product like all of the Neutrogena products and getting the whole set delivered right to your door for a great price is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Amazing deal, for the face wash, the face lotion, and the eye cream I paid $12.00, which is what you pay for just the face lotion alone, in store and even on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after one use.</li>
            <li> This stuff has made my skin noticeably clearer and generally more bright and youthful looking.</li>
            <li> : I really liked this cream.</li>
            <li> The retinol moisturizer is nice, however, I have oily skin--</li>
            <li> The spf was a nice addition &amp; didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift and friend liked it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy and the price is right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am delighted with this product, easily absorbed, pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very satisfied repeat customer :)</li>
            <li> Great product and keeps my skin healthy and wrinkle free</li>
            <li> Not only the price is good but also all 3 products are doing awesome job.  </li>
            <li> the best for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought that set because of many good reviews and was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found those creams - going to order again.</li>
            <li> My favorite face lotion.</li>
            <li> I have not seen the results, but I feel more softness in the skin</li>
            <li> This set contains 2 of my favorite products - the eye cream and face lotion.  </li>
            <li> The price here is so much better than anyplace else.  </li>
            <li> The face wash is ok - not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> So enjoy this while it lasts!</li>
            <li> Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream SPF&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> not too sure about the face cream yet to see the difference on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this package of Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find a skin care system that was affordable and made by a company</li>
            <li> Most trials are 8-12 weeks.</li>
            <li> Is Okey  it can be better</li>
            <li> A+  :)</li>
            <li> They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> so, I have to use a mattifier on top.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and it isn&#x27;t overly fragrant.  </li>
            <li> Been using for a month and love product.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased both.</li>
            <li> Included my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogina products and have used 2 of the 3 (excluding the cleanser) before.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> To top it off I am at that age where I am getting hormone imbalances</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product kit, it works as i was loking for, face clean and a good Sensation,  and not expensive as i thoug</li>
            <li> Pretty good.....</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Healthy SkinÂ® Eye Cream to reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye area</li>
            <li> and I love how smooth it keeps my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it because it does work well, but like I said I don&#x27;t like the smell, which I can easily get over for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to place the order</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very gentle, yet effective at cleaning and removing make up.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value for the money.</li>
            <li> This system is fabulous for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I like the light texture of this.</li>
            <li> After two uses my skin looks fresh and smooth, and my 3-job fatigue is erased!  </li>
            <li> Nice set, but just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> As for results, so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> The night cream is fine (4 stars), not my favorite, but it&#x27;s nice enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I can&#x27;t say whether it removes makeup easily; however, my skin feels super clean after using it.</li>
            <li> The SEI Import Storefront has many good products at value prices and economical shipping for multiple items.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it is actually making the wrinkles better, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not getting any more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar with.  </li>
            <li> She was excited, we&#x27;re a Neutrogena family and their products never disappoint.</li>
            <li> Eye irritation happens a lot for me when it comes to eye cream, so I was excited to find this.</li>
            <li> This kit has one Fresh Foaming Cleanser, which leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh and not tight; one Healthy Skin Eye Cream, great for the area under the eye; and one Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, that leaves your skin soft with a non-grasy feeling.</li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> Nothing too special here.</li>
            <li> I take impecable care of my skin, chemical peels etc, but it never looks better than when I use this kit and dab pure emu oil as a moisturizer and carrier.</li>
            <li> It is total fun that this inexpensive set of creams so far proved the best of them all.</li>
            <li> i use the anti wrinkle cream and it is more then the whole kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle anti-wrinkle system but a good quality overall.</li>
            <li> but not bad either</li>
            <li> There is a mild scent to the cleanser, so maybe that&#x27;s why I had a reaction to it</li>
            <li> Since the very first week I used it, my skin improved a lot.</li>
            <li> I also liked the it is reccomended by dermotoloygests  more ofter than other products.</li>
            <li> It simply absorbed quickly and I did not see any moisturizing effect or anti-aging benefits.  </li>
            <li> it is the first time that I use it I can see an improve!</li>
            <li> Fresh Foaming Cleanser gently removes makeup and cleanses in one easy step.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> The cleanser is nice with a mild scent, and I&#x27;ve only used the eye and wrinkle creams a couple of times, but already feel improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> especially I purchased the bare escentuals skin products but never felt good using them, as I continued to get wrinkles but felt it did great for my occasional acne.</li>
            <li> thats the only thing I liked about this kit.</li>
            <li> But it is still worth it for the price.  </li>
            <li> The product in the kit is the same size (1.4 ounces) as the cream on its own</li>
            <li> This is an economical skincare kit.</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizer, it can be worn under makeup and makes your face feel so soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> The cleanser takes off my makeup fast and gently, and I love the moisterizers ;</li>
            <li> and it came right to my door.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it rinses clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Face SPF contains retinol so exfoliates dead cells, makes skin soft and glowy, also lightweight, there is no residue, skin looks healthy and perfect for regular foundations as well as mineral make up.</li>
            <li> this kit is very large and for the price i was amazed.  </li>
            <li> My biggest concern now is that it will get pulled off the marked to be replaced with a \\&quot;new updated\\&quot; version that of course won&#x27;t work as good as the older version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but the price is pretty good for the whole system, not been using long.</li>
            <li> not bad reactions but still keeps your skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> SUPER gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any fash wash or wet face cloths better than Neutrogena for taking off all makeup (like my colorstay), and mascara-even waterproof!  </li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena products and normally love them but the anti-wrinkle moisturizer or whatever clogged my pours and caused me to break out only in the places I used it.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> if you plan on trying any of the three items then you are better off getting this entire system because of the price!  </li>
            <li> but the system seems to work well for my skin: no breakouts, soft smooth texture and isn&#x27;t heavy-I can wear under makeup and it has the SPF in it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The eye cream is ok, I&#x27;m honestly not a big user</li>
            <li> I love the eye cream and moisturizer, but the facial cleanser tends to make my skin break out.  </li>
            <li> Especially when so many SPF creams smell like sunscreen and make your face shiny</li>
            <li> The cleanser is one of Neutrogena&#x27;s most basic, gentle cleansers, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> system is COMPLETE and includes: an anti-aging moisturizer, anti-aging eye cream, and a gentle facial cleanser, this convenient anti-wrinkle kit combines retinol with vitamin-rich and moisture-rich ingredients to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, and to help soften and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy and definitely will try other Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li> Some wrinkles around the eyes and a large one on the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser:</li>
            <li> a pea size gives nice foam and removes all face make up and most of eye make up, doesn&#x27;t make skin dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I normally have bigger pores and red splotches but when using this set it has made my skin SO soft, made my pores almost invisible, and cleared up the redness in my face, so much so that people have noticed and complimented me on how great my skin is looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I really don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to.</li>
            <li> I use it now to wash my hands after I put my makeup on and it does wash the makeup off my hands very well</li>
            <li> I use all three of them, so really is a saving&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> If you use these products then you will really like this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it did too much for the wrinkles</li>
            <li> As for the eye cream, it&#x27;&#x27;s very moisturizing, yet doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> A lady told me she wants the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> There was a small bit of irritation the first week, but it is normal, it soon went away and now my skin looks much lighter and better.   </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it does the same for your face, if you can get passed the feeling of putting public restroom soap all over your face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The anti aging cream doesn&#x27;t really do to much for the face as far as anti aging goes</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really please so far.  </li>
            <li> Normally retinols should be used as a night treatment, because they make skin photosensitive.</li>
            <li> This foaming cleanser works fine, still prefer the other but will use this also.  </li>
            <li> took the advice of another user &amp;#34;midcenturymod&amp;#34; and used it at an early age hoping to prevent skin aging quickly in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m running low and must order it again right now.</li>
            <li> Wrinkle cream is great for daily use, doesn;t feel heavy or as sticky as other creams (loreal and olay), just a dab will do my whole face.  </li>
            <li> Diminished fine lines, but lets be real, there is no magic cream out there to stop growing old gracefully!  </li>
            <li> Came quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> So honestly it would be hard for me to see the difference now, but will be back with an update after my mom uses it.</li>
            <li> Both creams work wonders and are gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This system helps clear up my skin even though it is not marketed to do so.</li>
            <li> When I was in my late teens my dermatologist recommended Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream with SPF 15, just for moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> no harsh redness.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 years old</li>
            <li> I still get complemented on my skin and frequently get told I do not look my age.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and like neutrogena products, but I&#x27;ll stick with Rapid Clear.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkles disappearing.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really expect an instant result.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wanted to try neutrogena&#x27;s face wash, it was cheaper to buy the set.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I used these products for about a month and didn&#x27;t have any breakouts</li>
            <li> I dont see a difference in my fine lines and small wrinkles yet - but then again, it hasnt even been a week yet</li>
            <li> Using the eye cream at corners of eyes and it doesn&#x27;t take much either (previously used loreal pure retinol eye cream).  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more massive than these tiny creams...</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and the other products I purchased, for a very long time and save a huge amount of money in the process.</li>
            <li> I was using healthy skin anti-acne anti-wrinkle cream cleanser, but it has become hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> Had major results using all three every morning and evening along with salicylic acid exfoliator and benzoyl peroxide spot treatment I had been using before.</li>
            <li> Have not had the product long enough to really see a difference, but will keep trying.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good...maybe update later.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is nice, very thin and moisturizing with no perfumes...</li>
            <li> The only major issue I have is when the moisturiser or eye cream get too close to the eye my eyes begin to sting and water.</li>
            <li> If I wake up with circles or loose skin around my eyes, I put the eye cream on and it makes me look like a new person.  </li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job and is actually really gentle on my sensitive skin but it has a really strong, unpleasant smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but I found that it caused major breakouts in some areas and extremely dry patches elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money trying to find the right things for my skins, I always feel like something is missing.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is just a normal everyday makeup remover</li>
            <li> and I tried all kind of brands including some very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> , I use retin-A and hydroquione for some scarring etc left on my face and these products don&#x27;t agitate the dry skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is a little strong and makes my face tingle for a few minutes, so I use a small amount.</li>
            <li> The different items either do one thing or the other</li>
            <li> and I can see my skin looking softer and not as dry</li>
            <li> so my basis for comparison is limited.</li>
            <li> The eye cream definitely smooths out the wrinkles and even reduced the dark circles that I happen to have -</li>
            <li> on I kept changing and changing and now 8 years later I have found myself back at the same products that were recommended for me in my late teens.</li>
            <li> That has not happened without makeup in a long time!!</li>
            <li> You might think that the creams are only a small amount (.5oz) but you only need to use a little bit so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of plastic or some other synthetic substance, and I am not sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> I am Italian and have complicated skin, dry in areas, oily in others and large pores to tend with.</li>
            <li> I used to get pretty bad breakouts at least twice a month, and since I&#x27;ve started using these three products, I haven&#x27;t had a single one worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and have extremely oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> My concern is so many Neutrogena products/lines are disappearing from the marketplace without a comparable replacement :(</li>
            <li> I studied the list of ingredients on it and compared other products.</li>
            <li> ; the other products seem to be unscented.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted to try something different from the usual regimen I was using.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a nice produce, at least this brand is not too bad.</li>
            <li> It lathers and slightly foams like any other soap would.</li>
            <li> However, the under eye cream worked well it helped my under eye area from puffiness, dark circles and evened out the texture under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The facewash is average, but the eye cream and night cream I would buy again.  </li>
            <li> The daily moisturizer is not very moisturizing, its very thick and gummy, it leaves a film on my face.</li>
            <li> I do think that my eye wrinkles may have diminished slightly but the bumps under my eyes are still there.&lt;br /&gt;Anti</li>
            <li> but what can I say... got this for less than $20... expect less.</li>
            <li> It took over a month in a half to see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had little samples that you can buy for $10... just to check out if you like it or not.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a week, the little bumps all over my face from allergic reactions are almost gone</li>
            <li> (around my mouth) actually got worse.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed brighter and smoother skin Over just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I gave 2 stars because the eye cream was nice, but everything else was terrible.</li>
            <li> The skin cream is not too harsh and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for spring summer use for a few years.</li>
            <li> I might even give up my expensive bare escentuals makeup!!</li>
            <li> I usually buy skincare from Sephora, but wanted to cut expenses.</li>
            <li> The worst part is it looks and smells exactly like the hand soap you get from a dispenser at public restrooms.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face twice and just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> As for the anti wrinkle aspect, not sure I noticed any improvements.</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I was using an expensive department store brand of skin care products.</li>
            <li> They are significantly cheaper then if you buy them in the store even after shipping and you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> even tough</li>
            <li> It came in a metal tube and was very thick when it came out.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is terrible, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; really.</li>
            <li> I also agree with others who have said that the face wash smells bad.</li>
            <li> So even if can be used to get rid of eye makeup it burns to bad to try.</li>
            <li> These are not unscented , but do not have an annoying obtrusive scent.</li>
            <li> so I am breaking out like crazy!!  </li>
            <li> The smell is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought that set because of many good reviews and was not disappointed at all. Both creams work wonders and are gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin. There was a small bit of irritation the first week, but it is normal, it soon went away and now my skin looks much lighter and better.   The eye cream definitely smooths out the wrinkles and even reduced the dark circles that I happen to have - the area under the eyes looks much younger after just 3 weeks of use.   I am 48 and I tried all kind of brands including some very expensive ones. It is total fun that this inexpensive set of creams so far proved the best of them all. I am so glad I found those creams - going to order again. Fantastic value for the money.</li>
            <li> I usually buy skincare from Sephora, but wanted to cut expenses. Some of my friends told me how great Neutrogena spf lotions are so I gave a try. This kit was a great buy! Not only the price is good but also all 3 products are doing awesome job.  Cleanser: a pea size gives nice foam and removes all face make up and most of eye make up, doesn&#x27;t make skin dry and tight. The container is 6 oz and will last a while. The scent is not the greatest but nothing offensive.  Eye cream: leaves skin around eyes moisturized, lightweight, but because of AHA I use it in the evening.   Face SPF contains retinol so exfoliates dead cells, makes skin soft and glowy, also lightweight, there is no residue, skin looks healthy and perfect for regular foundations as well as mineral make up. It clears up any bumps and pimples. Normally retinols should be used as a night treatment, because they make skin photosensitive. Sometimes I use it as a night moisturizer. During the day I follow with extra sunscreen if I&#x27;m outside for longer period.  Overall I am very happy and definitely will try other Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> When I was in my late teens my dermatologist recommended Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream with SPF 15, just for moisturizing my face. I loved it and used it for 4 years, and then of course I thought I found a \\&quot;better\\&quot; NEWER product so I changed and from then on I kept changing and changing and now 8 years later I have found myself back at the same products that were recommended for me in my late teens. I always price check my local store and Amazon before I actually buy. While checking Amazon, I found this set! Amazing deal, for the face wash, the face lotion, and the eye cream I paid $12.00, which is what you pay for just the face lotion alone, in store and even on Amazon. I stocked up on this deal because I will not be changing my face regimine anymore. I normally have bigger pores and red splotches but when using this set it has made my skin SO soft, made my pores almost invisible, and cleared up the redness in my face, so much so that people have noticed and complimented me on how great my skin is looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this set is that I REALLY am not a big fan on the smell of the face wash. It does it&#x27;s job and is actually really gentle on my sensitive skin but it has a really strong, unpleasant smell in my opinion. I use it because it does work well, but like I said I don&#x27;t like the smell, which I can easily get over for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you age, you grow from experiences and I have leared, if it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it. This is a great system. My biggest concern now is that it will get pulled off the marked to be replaced with a \\&quot;new updated\\&quot; version that of course won&#x27;t work as good as the older version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product like all of the Neutrogena products and getting the whole set delivered right to your door for a great price is wonderful.</li>
            <li> the best for sensitive skin.  not bad reactions but still keeps your skin soft and clean.  no harsh redness.  people have noticed the difference</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money trying to find the right things for my skins, I always feel like something is missing. The different items either do one thing or the other well but I never get all I am looking for in skin care. I have just purchased this system and used it tonight as I work graveyard. It is the reason I have been looking for anti-aging at the age of 32. Until I started nights I still was asked for ID everywhere I went. When I noticed the night shift was taking a toll on my eyes especially I purchased the bare escentuals skin products but never felt good using them, as I continued to get wrinkles but felt it did great for my occasional acne. I can already see the wrinkles disappearing after 1 use!! I am so happy that I am going to buy all recommended products!! It has taken away the tiredness in my eyes and to truly test it I wore no makeup to work today and have received compliments on my skin!! That has not happened without makeup in a long time!! If you are looking to purchase these items DO IT!! They are significantly cheaper then if you buy them in the store even after shipping and you will not be disappointed!! I am Italian and have complicated skin, dry in areas, oily in others and large pores to tend with. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like by summer time!! I might even give up my expensive bare escentuals makeup!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it was the placebo effect, but I swear I felt a difference after using these three products ONE time. I&#x27;ve now been using the system for about a month and even though I always thought I had skin that was too oily for moisturizers, this has done WONDERS for my skin! I used to get pretty bad breakouts at least twice a month, and since I&#x27;ve started using these three products, I haven&#x27;t had a single one worth mentioning. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The only part of this kit that I like is the under eye cream. I use Neutrogena products and normally love them but the anti-wrinkle moisturizer or whatever clogged my pours and caused me to break out only in the places I used it. It does warn of this on the package and claims that if you keep using it the break outs will go away - after a month, I really don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to. I didn&#x27;t notice any change in wrinkles - I&#x27;m only 33 so it&#x27;s not like I have a ton but I swear the one I have which concerns me (around my mouth) actually got worse. I also agree with others who have said that the face wash smells bad. It reminds me of plastic or some other synthetic substance, and I am not sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> My favorite face lotion. Moisturizes without leaving your face greasy feeling</li>
            <li> It helped bright up my face and even cleared some sun spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am delighted with this product, easily absorbed, pleasant aroma. practical bottle. I have not seen the results, but I feel more softness in the skin</li>
            <li> I am 25 and have extremely oily and acne prone skin. This system helps clear up my skin even though it is not marketed to do so. I have also noticed brighter and smoother skin Over just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is nice, very thin and moisturizing with no perfumes...thats the only thing I liked about this kit. The cleanser is terrible, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; really. It lathers and slightly foams like any other soap would. I assumed it would be one of those that comes out as foam when you press the pump, but it&#x27;s not. The worst part is it looks and smells exactly like the hand soap you get from a dispenser at public restrooms. The smell is terrible. I used it on my face twice and just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. I use it now to wash my hands after I put my makeup on and it does wash the makeup off my hands very well so I&#x27;m sure it does the same for your face, if you can get passed the feeling of putting public restroom soap all over your face. The daily moisturizer is not very moisturizing, its very thick and gummy, it leaves a film on my face. I won&#x27;t be buying this again..I gave 2 stars because the eye cream was nice, but everything else was terrible. Yuck.</li>
            <li> SUPER gentle on my face. It&#x27;s been a month and I can see my skin looking softer and not as dry, I use retin-A and hydroquione for some scarring etc left on my face and these products don&#x27;t agitate the dry skin.</li>
            <li> Really great for acne prone skin. Had major results using all three every morning and evening along with salicylic acid exfoliator and benzoyl peroxide spot treatment I had been using before.</li>
            <li> This set contains 2 of my favorite products - the eye cream and face lotion.  The price here is so much better than anyplace else.  The face wash is ok - not my favorite.  But it is still worth it for the price.  I am 40 years old and I have been using neutrogena since my teens.  I still get complemented on my skin and frequently get told I do not look my age.</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy if you like the anti-wrinkle cream-- that by itself is close to $11. The product in the kit is the same size (1.4 ounces) as the cream on its own</li>
            <li> All three products in this system are awesome! The cleanser is very gentle, yet effective at cleaning and removing make up. The eye cream instantly moisturizes and tightens up the skin under the eyes. The skin cream is not too harsh and moisturizes well. This system is a great value and works well!</li>
            <li> The cleanser is just a normal everyday makeup remover nothing special but it removes even the toughest makeup. I use it to wash my makeup off my hands and off some of my makeup brushes. The anti aging cream doesn&#x27;t really do to much for the face as far as anti aging goes and it did break me out continuously. However, the under eye cream worked well it helped my under eye area from puffiness, dark circles and evened out the texture under my eyes. Would definitely buy the eye cream again everything else I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This Skincare system is very good. It does exactly what it says it will do. It&#x27;s an Allure Magazine Award Winner! This is an economical skincare kit. My concern is so many Neutrogena products/lines are disappearing from the marketplace without a comparable replacement :( So enjoy this while it lasts! The SEI Import Storefront has many good products at value prices and economical shipping for multiple items. I&#x27;m a very satisfied repeat customer :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated details...&lt;br /&gt;This system is COMPLETE and includes: an anti-aging moisturizer, anti-aging eye cream, and a gentle facial cleanser, this convenient anti-wrinkle kit combines retinol with vitamin-rich and moisture-rich ingredients to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, and to help soften and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 Cleanse: Fresh Foaming Cleanser gently removes makeup and cleanses in one easy step.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 Moisturize: Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream SPF&lt;br /&gt;Step 3 Treat: Neutrogena Healthy SkinÂ® Eye Cream to reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye area</li>
            <li> Have not had the product long enough to really see a difference, but will keep trying.  can hurt me, can it</li>
            <li> Everything works as advertised, but the pump for the bottle cleanser doesn&#x27;t work.  I had already been using everything else for a while so didn&#x27;t bother trying to get a refund.  I just pour a bit of the cleanser onto my hand, but I sort of wish the pump mechanism worked.</li>
            <li> So far, so good...maybe update later.</li>
            <li> May be a good product for some people but I found that it caused major breakouts in some areas and extremely dry patches elsewhere. I have somewhat sensitive skin and like neutrogena products, but I&#x27;ll stick with Rapid Clear. As for the anti wrinkle aspect, not sure I noticed any improvements.</li>
            <li> Very good, it works great even tough it is the first time that I use it I can see an improve!</li>
            <li> I do like the system, and I even have the brush,  It works well for me.</li>
            <li> This system is fabulous for the price. My skin feels amazing after one use. I love the moisturizer, it can be worn under makeup and makes your face feel so soft and not greasy. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> this kit is very large and for the price i was amazed.  i use the anti wrinkle cream and it is more then the whole kit. went on auto delivery</li>
            <li> This is a good buy when you purchase the three products together. I use all three of them, so really is a saving&#x27;s for me. Neutrogena makes good product&#x27;s, so will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months. Does not work. Maybe because I am a guy. I don&#x27;t know. For me it is just a garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this system for several months.  I decided to try neutrogena anti wrinkle creamm and then found this set.  if you plan on trying any of the three items then you are better off getting this entire system because of the price!  The anti wrinkle cream for the eyes or face is almost the same as the entire kit if bought individually here at amazon or at the store.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkles disappearing.  However, I have to say that the face wash it great!  Like others state, the smell isn&#x27;t the best but this stuff works.  I haven&#x27;t found any fash wash or wet face cloths better than Neutrogena for taking off all makeup (like my colorstay), and mascara-even waterproof!  As for if the anti wrinkle claims are true-I haven&#x27;t seen the results yet but the system seems to work well for my skin: no breakouts, soft smooth texture and isn&#x27;t heavy-I can wear under makeup and it has the SPF in it.  I&#x27;m happy and the price is right!</li>
            <li> removes make up good. good eye cream. not too sure about the face cream yet to see the difference on my face. but not bad either</li>
            <li> I love this package of Neutrogena products. The cleanser is nice with a mild scent, and I&#x27;ve only used the eye and wrinkle creams a couple of times, but already feel improvements in my skin. Prior to this, I was using an expensive department store brand of skin care products. I studied the list of ingredients on it and compared other products. Neutrogena is just as good, if not better. I will continue to use this and the other products I purchased, for a very long time and save a huge amount of money in the process. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The five stars are for the vendor. I got my stuff quickly at a great price. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;The product I give 3.5 stars. I like the day cream a lot (5 stars). The night cream is fine (4 stars), not my favorite, but it&#x27;s nice enough. The eye cream is ok, I&#x27;m honestly not a big user so my basis for comparison is limited. I shouldn&#x27;t rate this one. The face wash I do not like (2 stars). I don&#x27;t feel like it rinses clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, the face wash and eye cream were bonus, so I can&#x27;t (and am not) complaining.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the foaming cleanser much, it dries out my skin, but I use the eye and facial cream everyday.  It&#x27;s fabulous.  If I wake up with circles or loose skin around my eyes, I put the eye cream on and it makes me look like a new person.  I don&#x27;t know that it is actually making the wrinkles better, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not getting any more.  Well done, Neutrogena</li>
            <li> very happy with the system it is improving the wrinkles and lines in my face and it leaves my skin soft and radiant. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> If you use these products then you will really like this. This is a great price that you can&#x27;t get in stores.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find a skin care system that was affordable and made by a company I&#x27;m familiar with.  I love the eye cream and moisturizer, but the facial cleanser tends to make my skin break out.  There is a mild scent to the cleanser, so maybe that&#x27;s why I had a reaction to it; the other products seem to be unscented.  I&#x27;ll probably re-purchase the moisturizer and eye cream in the future, but the cleanser is not for me.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It&#x27;s not a miracle anti-wrinkle system but a good quality overall.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 weeks and am very happy with the results. I still have some cleanser and eye cream left but wanted to go ahead and write a review. I have oily skin and large pores. Some wrinkles around the eyes and a large one on the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser: Nothing too special here. I am not a fan of the smell but I&#x27;ll use it until I run out and then purchase a different one (probably Murad Clarifying cleaner, best I&#x27;ve tried so far).&lt;br /&gt;Eye cream: I like the light texture of this. I used it at night but I also used the anti-wrinkle cream around my eyes. I do think that my eye wrinkles may have diminished slightly but the bumps under my eyes are still there.&lt;br /&gt;Anti-wrinkle cream with SPF: I really liked this cream. It came in a metal tube and was very thick when it came out. It smooths out wonderfully though, feels really light and is not greasy/shiny at all. Especially when so many SPF creams smell like sunscreen and make your face shiny I was really happy with it. Can&#x27;t say it did too much for the wrinkles but I don&#x27;t really expect an instant result. Most trials are 8-12 weeks. Because I like the feel of this cream, I will probably repurchase it and use it for longer.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.....but no as mostrising as i would like but the price is pretty good for the whole system, not been using long. The scrub is great and the eye cream is good but would like some more mostrising from the face cream.</li>
            <li> Is Okey  it can be better doesn&#x27;t  leave your skin ferm.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wanted to try neutrogena&#x27;s face wash, it was cheaper to buy the set. The wash broke my face out after the second use but it took me several days to determine whether it was the lotion or wash. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. Plus the face wash burned the dickens out of my eyes. So even if can be used to get rid of eye makeup it burns to bad to try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any benefit with these 3 items.</li>
            <li> Just recieved this package and I&#x27;m really please so far.  After two uses my skin looks fresh and smooth, and my 3-job fatigue is erased!  The cream is a little strong and makes my face tingle for a few minutes, so I use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more massive than these tiny creams... but what can I say... got this for less than $20... expect less. This is a good package if you want to try it out. I wish they had little samples that you can buy for $10... just to check out if you like it or not.</li>
            <li> Already a neutrogena product user, but wanted to try these items.  Wrinkle cream is great for daily use, doesn;t feel heavy or as sticky as other creams (loreal and olay), just a dab will do my whole face.  Using the eye cream at corners of eyes and it doesn&#x27;t take much either (previously used loreal pure retinol eye cream).  I was using healthy skin anti-acne anti-wrinkle cream cleanser, but it has become hard to find locally.  This foaming cleanser works fine, still prefer the other but will use this also.  I am 60 and have an aversion to perfumed products.  These are not unscented , but do not have an annoying obtrusive scent.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted in two days.  Easy to place the order and it came right to my door.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Already seeing an improvement in my moms skin. She was excited, we&#x27;re a Neutrogena family and their products never disappoint.</li>
            <li> Love!  Definitely a great combination. Good results.</li>
            <li> Great products.  Great company.</li>
            <li> what can I say it is Neutrogena  A+  :)</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  As for results, so far, so good.  The cleanser takes off my makeup fast and gently, and I love the moisterizers ;</li>
            <li> The foaming cleanser is pleasant. The only major issue I have is when the moisturiser or eye cream get too close to the eye my eyes begin to sting and water. The moisturiser however is pleasant and feels nice going on.</li>
            <li> I like these products. I could tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product kit, it works as i was loking for, face clean and a good Sensation,  and not expensive as i thoug</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to something in this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of using it for preventive maintenance and I love how smooth it keeps my skin. You might think that the creams are only a small amount (.5oz) but you only need to use a little bit so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is  must have for those who want to take care of their face. I&#x27;ve seen a vast improvement in my skin tone since using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted to try something different from the usual regimen I was using. The face wash was good but the moisturizer was not all that moisturizing, and the eye cream would cause my eyes to burn so I stopped using it after 1 week. I have sensitive skin, and I used these products for about a month and didn&#x27;t have any breakouts so that was a good thing however I will not be purchasing this again. Everyone skin isn&#x27;t the same so these products may work well for someone else. They just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product 2 days ago, over all it feels so good after applying, moisturizes nicely, and smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;I took the advice of another user &amp;#34;midcenturymod&amp;#34; and used it at an early age hoping to prevent skin aging quickly in the future. So honestly it would be hard for me to see the difference now, but will be back with an update after my mom uses it.</li>
            <li> What can tou say about Neutrogena products? They are fantastic! This kit has one Fresh Foaming Cleanser, which leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh and not tight; one Healthy Skin Eye Cream, great for the area under the eye; and one Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, that leaves your skin soft with a non-grasy feeling. and itÂ´s SPF 15!</li>
            <li> For the price, this set is a steal! The cleanser is one of Neutrogena&#x27;s most basic, gentle cleansers, but it gets the job done. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I can&#x27;t say whether it removes makeup easily; however, my skin feels super clean after using it. As for the eye cream, it&#x27;&#x27;s very moisturizing, yet doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Eye irritation happens a lot for me when it comes to eye cream, so I was excited to find this. The retinol moisturizer is nice, however, I have oily skin--so, I have to use a mattifier on top. The spf was a nice addition &amp; didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Overall, I think for the price, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try this set.</li>
            <li> It took over a month in a half to see a difference in my skin.  Diminished fine lines, but lets be real, there is no magic cream out there to stop growing old gracefully!  I love the consistency and it isn&#x27;t overly fragrant.  The facewash is average, but the eye cream and night cream I would buy again.  I have been using Oil of Olay since the age of 17 so that is saying something.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month and love product.</li>
            <li> This stuff has made my skin noticeably clearer and generally more bright and youthful looking. I even got my boyfriend using it because he kept commenting on how great my skin had been looking. I will definitely be buying this again when I run out. I&#x27;ve also been using a 1.5mm derma roller and using both has improved my skin exponentially. So glad I purchased both.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after using these products.  The price is reasonable.  Great value.  I will continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> Great price. Included my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogina products and have used 2 of the 3 (excluding the cleanser) before. This is a great practical package that includes all the face care necessities at a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift and friend liked it.  I think it&#x27;s a nice produce, at least this brand is not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was never a &amp;#34;Neutrogena&amp;#34; girl until now. Great product and keeps my skin healthy and wrinkle free - I&#x27;m 36. I also purchased this system with the Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair and this has become my skin regime ever since. I&#x27;m running low and must order it again right now.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Since the very first week I used it, my skin improved a lot.</li>
            <li> It simply absorbed quickly and I did not see any moisturizing effect or anti-aging benefits.  I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think this is very nice for your skin and works well, but I haven&#x27;t seen any appreciable difference with the wrinkles.  Nice set, but just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost all perfumes and dyes.  To top it off I am at that age where I am getting hormone imbalances so I am breaking out like crazy!!  I have been using this for almost a week, the little bumps all over my face from allergic reactions are almost gone and my skin has cleared up 98% already.  I dont see a difference in my fine lines and small wrinkles yet - but then again, it hasnt even been a week yet :)  I bought 2 more kits!!</li>
            <li> This product helped the the prob;ems that I was having. I also liked the it is reccomended by dermotoloygests  more ofter than other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for spring summer use for a few years. I take impecable care of my skin, chemical peels etc, but it never looks better than when I use this kit and dab pure emu oil as a moisturizer and carrier. A lady told me she wants the skin on my face. Shes 18 and im a man age 29.</li>
