            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many beard stylers, but I like this one the best.</li>

            <li>After trying to like this razor for a month now, it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>Which is good</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also designed fairly well to capture the hair in there.  </li>
            <li>I forgot to mention that the very top of the Styler is removable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a trade-off that doesn&#x27;t make it an ideal primary</li>

            <li>I really like it and it has worked flawlessly for me.</li>
            <li>I liked this styling tool from Philips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has two heads, one for sculpting and one for cleaning up, and they both do a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s inexpensive &amp; it&#x27;s a nice travel size.</li>
            <li>I used it and liked it</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver, The best trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li>Despite our best efforts, we&#x27;ve never found a device to do a good job on both bare skin and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used a bunch of \\&quot;accessory\\&quot; trimmers/shavers including the Philips Norelco BodyGroom (junk) and Multigroom Pro (awesome) and All-in-1 (good) and various Wahl&#x27;s and others...</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and can&#x27;t handle a razor so these are perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for anyone who wants to shape and trim their own beard.</li>
            <li>First off I want to say that I am happy with this product and at the price point it is offered I can&#x27;t complain one bit.  </li>
            <li>in all, this is a nice device for travel, or just to do fine details on your beard, chin, or</li>
            <li>Tried many detail shavers.</li>
            <li>waited 6 months to leave this review because I saw many that were cautious</li>
            <li>What he uses the most, however, is his 20-year-old Norelco rotary shaver, to shave around the goatee.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Much more evenly trimmed and neat looking.</li>
            <li>yes it has many heads</li>
            <li>You could--but there are better options out there.</li>
            <li>Many have worked well and many have not.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for travel, too, so u can do touch ups anytime, like before a big meeting.</li>
            <li>It does make lovely curves and angles, and if what you&#x27;re after is a Mephistopheles goatee</li>
            <li>Styler\\&quot; is too cute.  </li>
            <li>It is cute.  </li>
            <li>You insert the battery then assemble it by connecting the bottom to the top.</li>
            <li>This thing is cute.</li>
            <li>It looks stylish and sleek.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No matter, the design should be more idiot-proof for \\&quot;precision\\&quot; trimming,</li>
            <li>have not use,seem ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very easy to understand, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and cut very precise just the way I like.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ideal for traveling, and pretty good for home use as well.</li>
            <li>So, it is all to easy to accidentally turn the thing more than one stop and/or inadvertently disassemble the thing.  </li>
            <li>Great concept but way too loud!</li>
            <li>This unit is by far the most useful shaver/trimmer i have ever owned and for the price is truly the best deal available.  </li>
            <li>The top of the mini head easily removes by pressing two side buttons together for easy cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heads are easy to swap.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with length attachments which seem like it would make it easy to trim beards, etc.</li>
            <li>The two heads easily twist then pull off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>AAA battery easily replaceable on the go; no charger needed&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, too - holding a mirror</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it would take me easily 5</li>
            <li>Exellent product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery is easily replaced.  </li>
            <li>and then you can easily switch to the foil blade and it gets even closer.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my eyebrows and it gives a good clean look without much effort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works fine, though.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>The sizes are fine, and once you pick the one you like, you can throw the rest in a pile somewhere</li>
            <li>basic trim thingy is great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it runs on a battery--much simpler than one that you have to charge--and my original battery is still going strong a month after I put it in.</li>
            <li>The mini foil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I cannot find Norelco mini foil shaver parts available anywhere.  </li>
            <li>My primary use for this was as a ear trimmer and it works to perfection.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean - I had no problems just rinsing it off under the tap after a trim.</li>
            <li>It is a great addition to your stable that will provide you some flexibility and lighten your load while traveling but lacks the power and size to tackle much hair (of any kind) on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>Its really close trim and its really amazing.</li>
            <li>The slender blade also makes it rather precise.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>For those of you that have facial hair this is the perfect device I&#x27;m able to trim and accurately get perfect cuts to my goatee or whatever other facial hair style.</li>
            <li>First, it has a very fine tooth trimmer blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Whomever said two heads are better than one got it right with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco styler is quite inexpensive and very useful.  </li>
            <li>Very handy, especially if you keep rechargeable AAs around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine using it as a primary tool for keeping your face clean.</li>
            <li>It is about the size of a permanent marker, so it&#x27;s easy to toss in your gym bag for a quick trim.  </li>
            <li>+ Small and lightweight, perfect for travel</li>
            <li>Bought it just for the foil shaver attachment to clean up my mustache.</li>
            <li>put on the trimmer head and clean up all the edges,</li>
            <li>Super price and free shipping ....</li>
            <li>+ minutes just to clean up my beard/neck</li>
            <li>Plus a Mini Foil Shaver to give you a closer shave, resulting in a clean shave look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had to defer to another blade to clean it</li>
            <li>Thankfully, neither are true.</li>
            <li>And, as a man with a goatee, the Braun isn&#x27;t quite equipped to handle the full job.  </li>
            <li>It seems obviously designed for travel, but its size and water resistance also makes it a good leave-in-the-shower type trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This fine pitch is important because some are too coarse which lead to more nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>And the handle, joy of joys, feels like a safety razor, even when he&#x27;s rapping it on the edge of the sink to clean it, or running it under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is battery-operated (battery included, and no charger issues if you take it traveling), and firmly from the keep-it-simple school of design.</li>
            <li>its a great little shaver super usefull for trips when you just need a trim or to detail your beard design</li>
            <li>It comes with three different length attachments, and is water resistant, so you can clean it very easily under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer, powerful, uses a standard battery size and strong enough to cut through even the toughest of hairs.</li>
            <li>and I were just talking about trimmers and in fact both found and agreed that this is a great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to be ideal for little bits of styling here or there, or so your gf can borrow it before hitting up the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the straight edge for trimming around my mouth then use the foil to get it smooth.</li>
            <li>Whoever invented the &amp;#34;twist to turn on, twist just a bit more to completely disassemble and drop the batteries on the floor&amp;#34; battery hatch should probably be tried as a war criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you slide it on you have to make sure you don&#x27;t slide it too far because then it will detach itself from the trimmer, since you are sliding the bottom portion which contains the battery.</li>
            <li>is worth the money .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a beard for most of my adult life and would often struggle to get it &amp;#34;cleaned up&amp;#34; the way I wanted to.</li>
            <li>told, it&#x27;s a handy trimmer that he&#x27;ll likely use two times a weeks.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small size which makes it easy to handle and good for travel.</li>
            <li>The attachments and other pieces are of good quality.</li>
            <li>foil shaver head attachment gets the spots the Braun can&#x27;t: right up under the nose and the edges of the beard.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer head cleans up any</li>
            <li>The price is right on this one.  </li>
            <li>While they sell this as a trimmer meant mainly for beards, I find it does a great job with other manscaping projects.</li>
            <li>They are small and great for edge ups and goatee&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer, although small in size, produces some great results.&lt;br /&gt;-Close,</li>
            <li>I found that to get a short clip, its better not to use the plastic shave size adapters and to just use the trimmer right on the face.</li>
            <li>No, but it works quickly and easily to shave the same size area each time.  </li>
            <li>my book, for a clean and accurate shave, you need something very sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li>Overall, all in all I&#x27;m glad I purchased this device</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>So this thing does a wondeful job at the most intricate of manscaping applications; enough said.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion only get this as an addition to a more grounded razor, cause</li>
            <li>I sent of back and ordered the Norelco NT9130 which is better design</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I just let the facial hair grow - who will recognize a dozen or so more hairs in my face anyway?</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far its very simple to use, and he says its easy to get the right length and its a great little tool for hair up keep.</li>
            <li>So far original battery is still going.</li>
            <li>It is a great companion to my other shavers, especially my Braun foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>thing is easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>size attachments pop on and off easily from the back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough and strong and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The two heads work really well for shaping and spot-shaving.</li>
            <li>This is not for shaving your whole face.</li>
            <li>And for me, this Norelco works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it does that very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and came on date promised.</li>
            <li>My buddy does say that he absolutely loves this trimmer</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect much out of the shaving function.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver for sculpting and for working on places ion my neck.</li>
            <li>I have a whole battery of them now.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but my straight razor does it in one or two strokes when I have to insist with the foil.</li>
            <li>the trimmer and shaver heads work very well</li>
            <li>I would much prefer a separate on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes this razor because it can get in that area under his bottom lip for shaping his goatee.</li>
            <li>He tried the various heads and found he had to go for the shortest options to get a more complete trim.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much but after it arrived it is and works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t do the most efficient job due to the slender blade width and lack of power, but it does get the job done.  </li>
            <li>It trims ok, but I didn&#x27;t find the blades to be all that sharp</li>
            <li>It comes with three clipper sizes to match the desired length of one&#x27;s beard, an electric razor (for stubble), and a tiny brush to keep it all clean.</li>
            <li>Nice nifty piece for the small detail work.</li>
            <li>Nice small size is is to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>Over all does a pretty good job, for such a small size.  </li>
            <li>It has enough power to even perform a full trim on my beard, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a regular, full size Braun with a foil head.</li>
            <li>I am not paying twice as much to replace the foil part, and i will not buy a new kit every time the foil part breaks either.</li>
            <li>All and all, after going through about a dozen different trimmers over the years - this is one of the most solid and reliable ones that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>We purchased it to replace an older one that lasted a couple of years.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle razor that is suitable for all sorts of body parts--especially because of its small maneuverable size.</li>
            <li>I said it is compact although I must mention that after you connect the two main parts the Styler</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self has a decent length to it.  </li>
            <li>We have on sampled the mini for shaver and the main styler w/o the attachments.</li>
            <li>So far its a great item to have &amp; vine saved me having to buy something I was not sure would be simple or used.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this trimmer to any of my friends.</li>
            <li>The razor takes a good five to ten minutes to trim even the least of my facial hair down to a good level.  </li>
            <li>This one works well, a little more money</li>
            <li>My other norelcos say very boldly that they can be used in the shower for instance.</li>
            <li>The blades on this trimmer don&#x27;t seem to be like those on a normal trimmer.  </li>
            <li>but it gives up speed to a normal trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Also, the on/off action is the same which opens the bottom to replace the battery and which is the same which twists off the top pieces.</li>
            <li>It is simple, small, and does a good job trimming with some degree of detail and closeness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I thought this little machine here, about one third the size and weight of my \\&quot;serious\\&quot; trimmer, would come in handy for my business trips.</li>
            <li>unit has a conventional shaving head that will allow you to do a close, fine shave in areas surrounding your beard.</li>
            <li>annoyance cost the trimmer the fifth star, because in all other areas it is a very useful machine.</li>
            <li>One head is a foil shaver, which does a good job shaving down to the bare skin (not as fast as the older Norelco, but there&#x27;s a lot less blade to work with).  </li>
            <li>I am not so interested in submersing it, but I do like to rinse things under water or with a little hand soap to clean it out, and so far, that doesn&#x27;t seem to affect it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I gave this to my significant other to try out on his mustache-goatee (in lieu of scissors alone)</li>
            <li>and on the longest trim setting it cuts pretty short</li>
            <li>I had this while having facial hair and shaving it off, too, and i thought it worked well for cleaning up areas on the upper lip as well even after clean</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the size of the small and medium combs are virtually the same size, so it would have been nice to have a more significant difference between the two in terms of length</li>
            <li>But for all that, it fits in a dopp bag easily and saves the trouble of packing another charger.</li>
            <li>One problem is that it&#x27;s round and rolls easily off the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>I have a full beard, which I trim with a big fancy trimmer - which I only take with me on business trips that are longer than a week.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenage son who is very particular about his hair being &amp;#34;lined up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It can take a little practice as holding the trimmer at different angles will alter the length of the trim so try to find the sweet spot and be consistent.</li>
            <li>I did not run into this issue as it is clearly marked how to turn it on.  </li>
            <li>So far, it is has worked</li>
            <li>I hope this offers you some insight.</li>
            <li>final nit is that I didn&#x27;t find a whole lot of difference in the 3 beard combs, which are listed as 4mm, 5mm, and 6mm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Others here seem to have had better results, so maybe I&#x27;m just clumsy.</li>
            <li>the small width of the blade lets me work very precisely in corners were the big trimmer has its difficulties.</li>
            <li>I got this for my teenage high school aged son who is not growing a full on beard but likes to have some facial hair to show he is growing up!!</li>
            <li>Well built, highly recommend and it uses a regular battery too.</li>
            <li>I think I need a slightly larger/longer surface area if I were primarily using it to shave a beard daily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the comb attachments to be useful, they all seem to trim at roughly the same length and longer hair tends to get stuck between the comb and the top of the trimmer blade, stopping it from cutting until you clean it out.</li>
            <li>It is listed for use on facial hair, but since it uses the same cutter and foil as the Multigroom Pro (similar but better than the Bodygroom), I found it works as well on other parts of the body as well or better because it is so compact, thin, and well balanced.  </li>
            <li>It uses a single AA battery which is very powerful and seems to last plenty long for the detail work for which it is intended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i constantly wind up twisting it too far and opening up the machine completely.</li>
            <li>I can go over my entire goatee and the trimmer will take it all down very close, yet leave the goatee looking like a real beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But be careful if using it on/around sensitive areas - the teeth are large enough to catch/nick the skin if it gets caught in them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of different shavers and trimmers over the years from high dollar versions to low dollar versions.  </li>
            <li>Also, this is impossibly small compared to the other tools mentioned above which makes it very convenient and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>Might want to keep an extra in your glove compartment, for those unexpected over night stays away from home.  </li>
            <li>A dime-size patch was shaved off, almost to the bare skin.</li>
            <li>If you twist it too far when you turn the thing off, the battery compartment pops open in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Hubby has a small drawer full of beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>u can even do blind spots yourself without help, which IMO makes it a handy item that deserves a permanent spot in my grooming kit.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have the trimmer with the 3 attachments which many units posess but what this unit has that most units do not is a shaver component which not only provides a close shave but also is small enough to shave at tight angles and spaces required to properly manage a gotee or other facial manscaping requirements.</li>
            <li>It has 3 cutting sizes or combs that snap on and off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 2: I find this is still useful for getting to small areas to shake my beard.</li>
            <li>I have to wipe down the whole sink and counter since there is hair all over the place.</li>
            <li>cuts fine, a bit weak though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 1: We just lost a huge contract because the customer made a comment on the \\&quot;poorly groomed staff\\&quot; here and the possible implications about our professionalism and attention to detail.</li>

            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> Which is good</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also designed fairly well to capture the hair in there.  </li>
            <li> I forgot to mention that the very top of the Styler is removable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trade-off that doesn&#x27;t make it an ideal primary</li>

            <li> I used it and liked it</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver, The best trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> Despite our best efforts, we&#x27;ve never found a device to do a good job on both bare skin and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used a bunch of \\&quot;accessory\\&quot; trimmers/shavers including the Philips Norelco BodyGroom (junk) and Multigroom Pro (awesome) and All-in-1 (good) and various Wahl&#x27;s and others...</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and can&#x27;t handle a razor so these are perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for anyone who wants to shape and trim their own beard.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I am happy with this product and at the price point it is offered I can&#x27;t complain one bit.  </li>
            <li> in all, this is a nice device for travel, or just to do fine details on your beard, chin, or</li>
            <li> Tried many detail shavers.</li>
            <li> waited 6 months to leave this review because I saw many that were cautious</li>
            <li> What he uses the most, however, is his 20-year-old Norelco rotary shaver, to shave around the goatee.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Much more evenly trimmed and neat looking.</li>
            <li> yes it has many heads</li>
            <li> You could--but there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> Many have worked well and many have not.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for travel, too, so u can do touch ups anytime, like before a big meeting.</li>
            <li> It does make lovely curves and angles, and if what you&#x27;re after is a Mephistopheles goatee</li>
            <li> Styler\\&quot; is too cute.  </li>
            <li> It is cute.  </li>
            <li> You insert the battery then assemble it by connecting the bottom to the top.</li>
            <li> This thing is cute.</li>
            <li> It looks stylish and sleek.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter, the design should be more idiot-proof for \\&quot;precision\\&quot; trimming,</li>
            <li> have not use,seem ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very easy to understand, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to store and cut very precise just the way I like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ideal for traveling, and pretty good for home use as well.</li>
            <li> So, it is all to easy to accidentally turn the thing more than one stop and/or inadvertently disassemble the thing.  </li>
            <li> Great concept but way too loud!</li>
            <li> This unit is by far the most useful shaver/trimmer i have ever owned and for the price is truly the best deal available.  </li>
            <li> The top of the mini head easily removes by pressing two side buttons together for easy cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heads are easy to swap.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with length attachments which seem like it would make it easy to trim beards, etc.</li>
            <li> The two heads easily twist then pull off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AAA battery easily replaceable on the go; no charger needed&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, too - holding a mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it would take me easily 5</li>
            <li> Exellent product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery is easily replaced.  </li>
            <li> and then you can easily switch to the foil blade and it gets even closer.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my eyebrows and it gives a good clean look without much effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works fine, though.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> The sizes are fine, and once you pick the one you like, you can throw the rest in a pile somewhere</li>
            <li> basic trim thingy is great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it runs on a battery--much simpler than one that you have to charge--and my original battery is still going strong a month after I put it in.</li>
            <li> The mini foil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I cannot find Norelco mini foil shaver parts available anywhere.  </li>
            <li> My primary use for this was as a ear trimmer and it works to perfection.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean - I had no problems just rinsing it off under the tap after a trim.</li>
            <li> It is a great addition to your stable that will provide you some flexibility and lighten your load while traveling but lacks the power and size to tackle much hair (of any kind) on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> Its really close trim and its really amazing.</li>
            <li> The slender blade also makes it rather precise.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> For those of you that have facial hair this is the perfect device I&#x27;m able to trim and accurately get perfect cuts to my goatee or whatever other facial hair style.</li>
            <li> First, it has a very fine tooth trimmer blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Whomever said two heads are better than one got it right with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco styler is quite inexpensive and very useful.  </li>
            <li> Very handy, especially if you keep rechargeable AAs around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine using it as a primary tool for keeping your face clean.</li>
            <li> It is about the size of a permanent marker, so it&#x27;s easy to toss in your gym bag for a quick trim.  </li>
            <li> + Small and lightweight, perfect for travel</li>
            <li> Bought it just for the foil shaver attachment to clean up my mustache.</li>
            <li> put on the trimmer head and clean up all the edges,</li>
            <li> Super price and free shipping ....</li>
            <li> + minutes just to clean up my beard/neck</li>
            <li> Plus a Mini Foil Shaver to give you a closer shave, resulting in a clean shave look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had to defer to another blade to clean it</li>
            <li> Thankfully, neither are true.</li>
            <li> And, as a man with a goatee, the Braun isn&#x27;t quite equipped to handle the full job.  </li>
            <li> It seems obviously designed for travel, but its size and water resistance also makes it a good leave-in-the-shower type trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This fine pitch is important because some are too coarse which lead to more nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> And the handle, joy of joys, feels like a safety razor, even when he&#x27;s rapping it on the edge of the sink to clean it, or running it under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is battery-operated (battery included, and no charger issues if you take it traveling), and firmly from the keep-it-simple school of design.</li>
            <li> its a great little shaver super usefull for trips when you just need a trim or to detail your beard design</li>
            <li> It comes with three different length attachments, and is water resistant, so you can clean it very easily under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, powerful, uses a standard battery size and strong enough to cut through even the toughest of hairs.</li>
            <li> and I were just talking about trimmers and in fact both found and agreed that this is a great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It really seems to be ideal for little bits of styling here or there, or so your gf can borrow it before hitting up the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the straight edge for trimming around my mouth then use the foil to get it smooth.</li>
            <li> Whoever invented the &amp;#34;twist to turn on, twist just a bit more to completely disassemble and drop the batteries on the floor&amp;#34; battery hatch should probably be tried as a war criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you slide it on you have to make sure you don&#x27;t slide it too far because then it will detach itself from the trimmer, since you are sliding the bottom portion which contains the battery.</li>
            <li> is worth the money .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for most of my adult life and would often struggle to get it &amp;#34;cleaned up&amp;#34; the way I wanted to.</li>
            <li> told, it&#x27;s a handy trimmer that he&#x27;ll likely use two times a weeks.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small size which makes it easy to handle and good for travel.</li>
            <li> The attachments and other pieces are of good quality.</li>
            <li> foil shaver head attachment gets the spots the Braun can&#x27;t: right up under the nose and the edges of the beard.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer head cleans up any</li>
            <li> The price is right on this one.  </li>
            <li> While they sell this as a trimmer meant mainly for beards, I find it does a great job with other manscaping projects.</li>
            <li> They are small and great for edge ups and goatee&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer, although small in size, produces some great results.&lt;br /&gt;-Close,</li>
            <li> I found that to get a short clip, its better not to use the plastic shave size adapters and to just use the trimmer right on the face.</li>
            <li> No, but it works quickly and easily to shave the same size area each time.  </li>
            <li> my book, for a clean and accurate shave, you need something very sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li> Overall, all in all I&#x27;m glad I purchased this device</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> So this thing does a wondeful job at the most intricate of manscaping applications; enough said.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion only get this as an addition to a more grounded razor, cause</li>
            <li> I sent of back and ordered the Norelco NT9130 which is better design</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I just let the facial hair grow - who will recognize a dozen or so more hairs in my face anyway?</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far its very simple to use, and he says its easy to get the right length and its a great little tool for hair up keep.</li>
            <li> So far original battery is still going.</li>
            <li> It is a great companion to my other shavers, especially my Braun foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> thing is easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> size attachments pop on and off easily from the back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough and strong and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The two heads work really well for shaping and spot-shaving.</li>
            <li> This is not for shaving your whole face.</li>
            <li> And for me, this Norelco works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it does that very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and came on date promised.</li>
            <li> My buddy does say that he absolutely loves this trimmer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect much out of the shaving function.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver for sculpting and for working on places ion my neck.</li>
            <li> I have a whole battery of them now.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but my straight razor does it in one or two strokes when I have to insist with the foil.</li>
            <li> the trimmer and shaver heads work very well</li>
            <li> I would much prefer a separate on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes this razor because it can get in that area under his bottom lip for shaping his goatee.</li>
            <li> He tried the various heads and found he had to go for the shortest options to get a more complete trim.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much but after it arrived it is and works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li> I find it doesn&#x27;t do the most efficient job due to the slender blade width and lack of power, but it does get the job done.  </li>
            <li> It trims ok, but I didn&#x27;t find the blades to be all that sharp</li>
            <li> It comes with three clipper sizes to match the desired length of one&#x27;s beard, an electric razor (for stubble), and a tiny brush to keep it all clean.</li>
            <li> Nice nifty piece for the small detail work.</li>
            <li> Nice small size is is to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Over all does a pretty good job, for such a small size.  </li>
            <li> It has enough power to even perform a full trim on my beard, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a regular, full size Braun with a foil head.</li>
            <li> I am not paying twice as much to replace the foil part, and i will not buy a new kit every time the foil part breaks either.</li>
            <li> All and all, after going through about a dozen different trimmers over the years - this is one of the most solid and reliable ones that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> We purchased it to replace an older one that lasted a couple of years.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle razor that is suitable for all sorts of body parts--especially because of its small maneuverable size.</li>
            <li> I said it is compact although I must mention that after you connect the two main parts the Styler</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self has a decent length to it.  </li>
            <li> We have on sampled the mini for shaver and the main styler w/o the attachments.</li>
            <li> So far its a great item to have &amp; vine saved me having to buy something I was not sure would be simple or used.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this trimmer to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> The razor takes a good five to ten minutes to trim even the least of my facial hair down to a good level.  </li>
            <li> This one works well, a little more money</li>
            <li> My other norelcos say very boldly that they can be used in the shower for instance.</li>
            <li> The blades on this trimmer don&#x27;t seem to be like those on a normal trimmer.  </li>
            <li> but it gives up speed to a normal trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Also, the on/off action is the same which opens the bottom to replace the battery and which is the same which twists off the top pieces.</li>
            <li> It is simple, small, and does a good job trimming with some degree of detail and closeness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I thought this little machine here, about one third the size and weight of my \\&quot;serious\\&quot; trimmer, would come in handy for my business trips.</li>
            <li> unit has a conventional shaving head that will allow you to do a close, fine shave in areas surrounding your beard.</li>
            <li> annoyance cost the trimmer the fifth star, because in all other areas it is a very useful machine.</li>
            <li> One head is a foil shaver, which does a good job shaving down to the bare skin (not as fast as the older Norelco, but there&#x27;s a lot less blade to work with).  </li>
            <li> I am not so interested in submersing it, but I do like to rinse things under water or with a little hand soap to clean it out, and so far, that doesn&#x27;t seem to affect it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I gave this to my significant other to try out on his mustache-goatee (in lieu of scissors alone)</li>
            <li> and on the longest trim setting it cuts pretty short</li>
            <li> I had this while having facial hair and shaving it off, too, and i thought it worked well for cleaning up areas on the upper lip as well even after clean</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the size of the small and medium combs are virtually the same size, so it would have been nice to have a more significant difference between the two in terms of length</li>
            <li> But for all that, it fits in a dopp bag easily and saves the trouble of packing another charger.</li>
            <li> One problem is that it&#x27;s round and rolls easily off the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> I have a full beard, which I trim with a big fancy trimmer - which I only take with me on business trips that are longer than a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son who is very particular about his hair being &amp;#34;lined up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It can take a little practice as holding the trimmer at different angles will alter the length of the trim so try to find the sweet spot and be consistent.</li>
            <li> I did not run into this issue as it is clearly marked how to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> So far, it is has worked</li>
            <li> I hope this offers you some insight.</li>
            <li> final nit is that I didn&#x27;t find a whole lot of difference in the 3 beard combs, which are listed as 4mm, 5mm, and 6mm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Others here seem to have had better results, so maybe I&#x27;m just clumsy.</li>
            <li> the small width of the blade lets me work very precisely in corners were the big trimmer has its difficulties.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage high school aged son who is not growing a full on beard but likes to have some facial hair to show he is growing up!!</li>
            <li> Well built, highly recommend and it uses a regular battery too.</li>
            <li> I think I need a slightly larger/longer surface area if I were primarily using it to shave a beard daily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the comb attachments to be useful, they all seem to trim at roughly the same length and longer hair tends to get stuck between the comb and the top of the trimmer blade, stopping it from cutting until you clean it out.</li>
            <li> It is listed for use on facial hair, but since it uses the same cutter and foil as the Multigroom Pro (similar but better than the Bodygroom), I found it works as well on other parts of the body as well or better because it is so compact, thin, and well balanced.  </li>
            <li> It uses a single AA battery which is very powerful and seems to last plenty long for the detail work for which it is intended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i constantly wind up twisting it too far and opening up the machine completely.</li>
            <li> I can go over my entire goatee and the trimmer will take it all down very close, yet leave the goatee looking like a real beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But be careful if using it on/around sensitive areas - the teeth are large enough to catch/nick the skin if it gets caught in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of different shavers and trimmers over the years from high dollar versions to low dollar versions.  </li>
            <li> Also, this is impossibly small compared to the other tools mentioned above which makes it very convenient and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Might want to keep an extra in your glove compartment, for those unexpected over night stays away from home.  </li>
            <li> A dime-size patch was shaved off, almost to the bare skin.</li>
            <li> If you twist it too far when you turn the thing off, the battery compartment pops open in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Hubby has a small drawer full of beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> u can even do blind spots yourself without help, which IMO makes it a handy item that deserves a permanent spot in my grooming kit.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have the trimmer with the 3 attachments which many units posess but what this unit has that most units do not is a shaver component which not only provides a close shave but also is small enough to shave at tight angles and spaces required to properly manage a gotee or other facial manscaping requirements.</li>
            <li> It has 3 cutting sizes or combs that snap on and off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 2: I find this is still useful for getting to small areas to shake my beard.</li>
            <li> I have to wipe down the whole sink and counter since there is hair all over the place.</li>
            <li> cuts fine, a bit weak though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 1: We just lost a huge contract because the customer made a comment on the \\&quot;poorly groomed staff\\&quot; here and the possible implications about our professionalism and attention to detail.</li>
            <li> This is especially annoying if you use this trimmer only once in a while, so you either have to really concentrate to do it right, or, probably what most people will do, don&#x27;t remember the correct direction, don&#x27;t bother to take a closer look and just take the fifty-fifty chance.</li>
            <li> It came with three blades, small, medium and large.</li>
            <li> Sizes are Small, Med. and Large.</li>
            <li> Love this for all those irritating little facial hairs.</li>
            <li> The other head is a beard trimmer, with three different length beard combs (not one extendible comb like the more complicated models, just some snap-on plastic bits).</li>
            <li> This tool does not do it since I have do do multiple passes to sometimes cut a single hair that the comb misses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a little old thing.</li>
            <li> That hasn&#x27;t yet happened with the GoStyler, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time (said with the voice of bitter experience).  </li>
            <li> all, my complaints are relatively minor, though.  </li>
            <li> The removal process is also strange because it&#x27;s one slip away from the twisting on/off mechanism.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a few sessions with the trimmer at full power, but then the battery peters off slowly.  </li>
            <li> The only other thing is when you do trim the hair goes everywhere.</li>
            <li> it is not so powerfull and each of the three combs is close similar to the other</li>
            <li> really like this little trimmer/shaver despite a few complaints.  </li>
            <li> Lastly it uses a standard AA battery that I had to replace after 4 days of heavy (exclusive) use.</li>
            <li> Also included is a second head that works as a conventional shaver &amp; a single AA</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+ Trims cleanly in a single sweep</li>
            <li> package contains the buzzer, a single AA battery, 3 length attachments and a grid-type foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> put the smallest orange guide on the trimmer head and go over the goatee to get it shaved down as close as possible.</li>
            <li> The blade is about half the width of a standard beard or body trimmer.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m wondering what&#x27;s the purpose of the two other included longer combs (Medium and Long) ?!?</li>
            <li> (though a freehand trim worked well enough), and a little bag to keep all the parts together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The transparent package is a little dirty, and the top part of the package was damaged and crushed.  </li>
            <li> I used this one in the shower once without any water getting into the battery compartment or blade/hair sticking, but im not sure how long that will last.</li>
            <li> I use it on daily basis for few minutes.</li>
            <li> be careful; that is all folks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Works as expected</li>
            <li> this trimmer is not really what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m careful now...</li>
            <li> You might as well throw the foil shaver right in the trash though, because it&#x27;s completely useless.  </li>
            <li> The beard combs are also a little tight to remove and require the same twisting action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small and very simple.</li>
            <li> In fact, it has the same small trimmer blade and foil as the Multigroom Pro.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe the problem is it&#x27;s for precision edging only, for which it&#x27;s small footprint is well-suited.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s hard to believe, but there are several competitors specializing in Carcharodon-mounted lasers.)</li>
            <li> lightweight, plastic trimmer (size of an electric toothbrush) with the trimmer head attached, small, medium &amp; long sized combs, and a brush.</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer rechargeable devices, but at least this one doesn&#x27;t use any odd batteries or proprietary power</li>
            <li> /&gt;I put on the foil head and take everything I just trimmed down to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it goes down.  </li>
            <li> My beard is not very strong or dense.</li>
            <li> body is sleek and shiny plastic on half, but there is an orange slightly rubberized grip.  </li>
            <li> Not cool man, Not cool...</li>
            <li> It just made a mess</li>
            <li> This guy is little.</li>
            <li> But this little Phillips Norelco GoStyler picks up where the Braun leaves off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> little shaver runs on one AA battery.  </li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t knock this little guy.  </li>
            <li> &quot; a little, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Also comes with a foil head, for the really up close cutting you may need to do.  </li>
            <li> In clear, not that difficult to trim.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s frustrating overall.</li>
            <li> Few reviewers have mentioned that they keep on opening the battery compartment instead of turning it on.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I might be missing something.</li>
            <li> help the skin to return helthy and firm</li>
            <li> You do not want to use this as your everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> I did not find that it was too slippery to hold or grip at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things which I don&#x27;t like about it, though.  </li>
            <li> Well, one knock: since it&#x27;s round, it does have a tendency to roll off of the sink.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Like other reviewers said, there&#x27;s no ON/OFF switch, you have to twist the trimmer body (upper part is the motor and the lower part the battery compartment), but the problem is if you twist in the wrong direction, the battery compartment falls off and stays in your hand.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no indicator of battery level in any way other than a slow death.  </li>
            <li> But, my biggest disappointment and the main reason for buying this trimmer was for the foil option.</li>
            <li> That makes it somewhat prissy for your average Joe--though that&#x27;s probably not for whom this styling tool is intended.  </li>
            <li> The only thing weird about it is turning it on.</li>
            <li> The foil head is small, so it takes longer to get all the whiskers from the face.  </li>
            <li> I like having the attachment for the trimmer, since I have a small beard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these small clippers in the stores and thought they were junk.</li>
            <li> use it to keep my sideburns trimmed, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for small trims.</li>
            <li> I want to start this review by stating that I usually like the Philips shavers.</li>
            <li> Yes it is small,</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> It is small and compact.  </li>
            <li> he needed something small to trim things up a bit rather then to shave off everything when it was getting to long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something small for travel just to do some touch-up trimming, this might be the unit for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But first, the \\&quot;twist to turn on/off\\&quot; thing is annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the 3 precision combs as the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; is still too large as I don&#x27;t like a thick goatee and the trimmer could be sharper.</li>
            <li> there is one really annoying thing here - to start the trimmer, you have to twist the upper half against the lower half.</li>
            <li> That can be a benefit or negative, depending on your point of view.</li>
            <li> That requires two hands and which also means if the other hand is wet or dirty with razor stubble, now both pieces are wet, dirty, etc.  </li>
            <li> other thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is vague about using it around water.  </li>
            <li> I was getting tired of cutting my lips with my big electric razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any serious gripes here.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the one, tough beard, nose and ear hair - no problem.</li>
            <li> However, unless you have thin facial hair, be prepared to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The mini foil shaver head is ultra thin and cracks.  </li>
            <li> You can always toss a rechargeable AA once it can&#x27;t hold a charge, unlike a lithium which would have made the unit unnecessarily expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of the $9.00 type and was not happy with them.</li>
            <li> a bad little Styler</li>
            <li> I just bought this trimmer, which is under $20, and I must say I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it can be a little annoying.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is 100% useless when use with one of the three included bears combs.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I end with a nasty feeling of electric shave between my upper lip and my nose.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Twist the wrong way and you&#x27;re dumping the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was using it at the wrong angle?</li>
            <li> Sorry for any typos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not terribly impressed, but I also wouldn&#x27;t mind getting one of these as a gift.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is battery drive (and not rechargeable)</li>
            <li> Those areas are the worst for conventional electrics</li>
            <li> It just stinks that I need 2 buzzers to do the job.</li>
            <li> 100% useless!</li>
            <li> Completely useless!</li>
            <li> Really bad design...</li>
            <li> If it is meant for a man, my bad.  </li>
            <li> am disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> and I hate feeling like I missed a spot.</li>
            <li> This thing is absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> 100% piece of crap!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Whoever invented the &amp;#34;twist to turn on, twist just a bit more to completely disassemble and drop the batteries on the floor&amp;#34; battery hatch should probably be tried as a war criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fine, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for a couple weeks now. So far so good. It does of great job of trimming my sideburns, mustache and beard. It came with three blades, small, medium and large. I like the color scheme. It is easy to wash and maintain and fits perfectly in my luggage. The only thing weird about it is turning it on. When you slide it on you have to make sure you don&#x27;t slide it too far because then it will detach itself from the trimmer, since you are sliding the bottom portion which contains the battery. The only other thing is when you do trim the hair goes everywhere. I have to wipe down the whole sink and counter since there is hair all over the place. But I am guessing that happens with all the trimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many beard stylers, but I like this one the best. The two heads work really well for shaping and spot-shaving. I like the fact that it runs on a battery--much simpler than one that you have to charge--and my original battery is still going strong a month after I put it in. The heads are easy to swap. All in all, I&#x27;m quite happy with this styler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the 3 precision combs as the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; is still too large as I don&#x27;t like a thick goatee and the trimmer could be sharper. The mini foil is fantastic. Overall, I would not buy another and will try another brand once this one dies on me. That said, I do use it and make it work but it&#x27;s frustrating overall.</li>
            <li> For those of you that have facial hair this is the perfect device I&#x27;m able to trim and accurately get perfect cuts to my goatee or whatever other facial hair style. In addition, if you or lady do some body scapping then this does the trick. It uses 1 double AA battery, which I like and can be rinsed off in water. Overall, all in all I&#x27;m glad I purchased this device is worth the money .</li>
            <li> Tried many detail shavers. They all sucked and broke over time. This one, however did not. It&#x27;s tough and strong and easy to clean. Seriously, this is the one, tough beard, nose and ear hair - no problem. Cheek whiskers, all gone. Well built, highly recommend and it uses a regular battery too.</li>
            <li> Bought it just for the foil shaver attachment to clean up my mustache. The foil shaver broke on me within two months (only used it once a week). Not a big deal that it broke, the problem is that the replacement part for just the foil shaver attachment is $20 with $10 shipping. I am not paying twice as much to replace the foil part, and i will not buy a new kit every time the foil part breaks either. Not cool man, Not cool...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last 6 months now.  It works great.  Battery lasted for about 4 months.  I use it on daily basis for few minutes. Few reviewers have mentioned that they keep on opening the battery compartment instead of turning it on.  I did not run into this issue as it is clearly marked how to turn it on.  Good product for the money.</li>
            <li> Watch your purchases of this item.  The mini foil shaver head is ultra thin and cracks.  You may not even notice until it starts scraping your face and causing pulling-bleeding.  I cannot find Norelco mini foil shaver parts available anywhere.  This item was the reason I bought the GoStyler.  Now it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> Nice nifty piece for the small detail work. Dont expect to use it instead of an electric shaver. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. This is not for shaving your whole face. I needed something to trim around my mouth. I was getting tired of cutting my lips with my big electric razor. I use the straight edge for trimming around my mouth then use the foil to get it smooth. It also works well on my eye brows. I only trim about twice a week. So far original battery is still going.</li>
            <li> 100% useless! 100% piece of crap! Do NOT buy this Philips Norelco GoStyler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The foil shaver doesn&#x27;t offer close shave.&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer is 100% useless when use with one of the three included bears combs. I had a 5-day goatee, and with the shortest Short (S) comb attached the trimmer doesn&#x27;t shave nothing at all!!! Completely useless! So I&#x27;m wondering what&#x27;s the purpose of the two other included longer combs (Medium and Long) ?!?&lt;br /&gt;- Like other reviewers said, there&#x27;s no ON/OFF switch, you have to twist the trimmer body (upper part is the motor and the lower part the battery compartment), but the problem is if you twist in the wrong direction, the battery compartment falls off and stays in your hand. Really bad design...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this Philips Norelco GoStyler</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any serious gripes here.  I know some folks have commented that they don&#x27;t like the on/off mechanism, but I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it and the batteries never fell out.  I used the shaver for about a week on a recent trip and had no issues.  No problems with battery life. The foil head is small, so it takes longer to get all the whiskers from the face.  I like having the attachment for the trimmer, since I have a small beard.  I found that to get a short clip, its better not to use the plastic shave size adapters and to just use the trimmer right on the face.</li>
            <li> So this thing does a wondeful job at the most intricate of manscaping applications; enough said.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful; that is all folks.</li>
            <li> This is a great beard trimmer. This one has moved from a backup/travel trimmer to my regular one. Does a good job of keeping my beard nice a tidy.</li>
            <li> Whether you like this trimmer or not will depend somewhat on what you hoped it would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine using it as a primary tool for keeping your face clean. That would be like mowing a lawn with an edge trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every couple of years I grow a goatee. For those times, I need an edge trimmer. And for me, this Norelco works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited 6 months to leave this review because I saw many that were cautious and I thought I might be missing something. But I&#x27;ve had no problems. And I&#x27;ve gone through maybe three batteries in that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is you, this trimmer will work for you:&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower. Then I use this trimmer. The process below takes me maybe 3-4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on the trimmer head and clean up all the edges, even some places I&#x27;m going to use the foil head on.&lt;br /&gt;I put on the foil head and take everything I just trimmed down to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I put the smallest orange guide on the trimmer head and go over the goatee to get it shaved down as close as possible. I can go over my entire goatee and the trimmer will take it all down very close, yet leave the goatee looking like a real beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I want a trimmer to do. And it does that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to hold up. As I say, I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months. It works fine. It all snaps apart and rinses under the faucet. Easy peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product, does it work, very good for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> its a great little shaver super usefull for trips when you just need a trim or to detail your beard design i wish it came with a nose/ear accesory and it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> I really like it and it has worked flawlessly for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for most of my adult life and would often struggle to get it &amp;#34;cleaned up&amp;#34; the way I wanted to. I&#x27;ve seen these small clippers in the stores and thought they were junk. I was wrong. This is a great tool for anyone who wants to shape and trim their own beard. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> it is not so powerfull and each of the three combs is close similar to the other</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son who is very particular about his hair being &amp;#34;lined up&amp;#34;. It works like a charm. Shipping was fast and came on date promised.</li>
            <li> My primary use for this was as a ear trimmer and it works to perfection. Highly recommended. I think I need a slightly larger/longer surface area if I were primarily using it to shave a beard daily.</li>
            <li> help the skin to return helthy and firm&lt;br /&gt;is amazing antiaging formula&lt;br /&gt;it have also Q10to promote the cellular energy</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend so I have not used it. My buddy does say that he absolutely loves this trimmer and he goatee is proof of it. He &amp; I would recommend this trimmer to anyone. Super price and free shipping .... YES!</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, powerful, uses a standard battery size and strong enough to cut through even the toughest of hairs. Easy to clean - I had no problems just rinsing it off under the tap after a trim. But be careful if using it on/around sensitive areas - the teeth are large enough to catch/nick the skin if it gets caught in them. I didn&#x27;t find the comb attachments to be useful, they all seem to trim at roughly the same length and longer hair tends to get stuck between the comb and the top of the trimmer blade, stopping it from cutting until you clean it out. I just use the longest one, perpendicularly, to trim the stray hairs off. All and all, after going through about a dozen different trimmers over the years - this is one of the most solid and reliable ones that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Works well for for trimming.</li>
            <li> It tore my face up.  Don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Hubby has a small drawer full of beard trimmers. What he uses the most, however, is his 20-year-old Norelco rotary shaver, to shave around the goatee. Despite our best efforts, we&#x27;ve never found a device to do a good job on both bare skin and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this two-headed chimera. One head is a foil shaver, which does a good job shaving down to the bare skin (not as fast as the older Norelco, but there&#x27;s a lot less blade to work with).  The other head is a beard trimmer, with three different length beard combs (not one extendible comb like the more complicated models, just some snap-on plastic bits). And the handle, joy of joys, feels like a safety razor, even when he&#x27;s rapping it on the edge of the sink to clean it, or running it under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is battery-operated (battery included, and no charger issues if you take it traveling), and firmly from the keep-it-simple school of design. I love it. The only thing I would add is a longer beard comb (though a freehand trim worked well enough), and a little bag to keep all the parts together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for traveling, and pretty good for home use as well.</li>
            <li> I liked this styling tool from Philips.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to keep my sideburns trimmed, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for small trims.</li>
            <li> When I gave this to my significant other to try out on his mustache-goatee (in lieu of scissors alone) the end result was good. Much more evenly trimmed and neat looking. He tried the various heads and found he had to go for the shortest options to get a more complete trim. Stretching of skin was required to provide access to all the hairs. He used the hydrofoil once for shaving the skin immediately around the the facial hair, but said that it didn&#x27;t shave close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, it&#x27;s a handy trimmer that he&#x27;ll likely use two times a weeks. Don&#x27;t expect much out of the shaving function.</li>
            <li> This is Great. We bought it to match my husbands shaver which it does and we couldn&#x27;t find in store but he also loves using it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for trimming body hair. Has lasted me over 6 months with the same battery.</li>
            <li> Works great.  As described.</li>
            <li> Nice small size is is to maneuver.  Comes with 3 size combs, so you can get the length you want.  Also comes with a foil head, for the really up close cutting you may need to do.  Over all does a pretty good job, for such a small size.  Might want to keep an extra in your glove compartment, for those unexpected over night stays away from home.  Water proof and uses 1 AA size battery, witch should last you about a month of use. Says it never needs any oiling.  Comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim around my husband&#x27;s ears when I cut his hair. We purchased it to replace an older one that lasted a couple of years. At this low of a price ($18), I would expect to have to replace it every 2 to 3 years.</li>
            <li> I am not a big body groomer, but I like the idea of this b/c it&#x27;s small and very simple. It comes with length attachments which seem like it would make it easy to trim beards, etc. I use this on my eyebrows and it gives a good clean look without much effort. It is about the size of a permanent marker, so it&#x27;s easy to toss in your gym bag for a quick trim.  It does great on my sideburns and also trims my neck well. Overall, this is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver for sculpting and for working on places ion my neck. Those areas are the worst for conventional electrics and I hate feeling like I missed a spot. I had this while having facial hair and shaving it off, too, and i thought it worked well for cleaning up areas on the upper lip as well even after clean shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is easy enough to use. It takes two batteries that are placed inside, the body is turned, and boom. Instant shaver. Comes with the batteries too, to note. It has two heads, one for sculpting and one for cleaning up, and they both do a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to understand, very easy to use. No setting, trying to find heights, all the things i dislike about styling.</li>
            <li> I want to start this review by stating that I usually like the Philips shavers. I have a whole battery of them now.&lt;br /&gt;This one comes in as the smallest.&lt;br /&gt;I wear a goatee. My beard is not very strong or dense. In clear, not that difficult to trim.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with this one. Yes it is small, yes it has many heads but what for?&lt;br /&gt;The mini foil does shave but my straight razor does it in one or two strokes when I have to insist with the foil. I end with a nasty feeling of electric shave between my upper lip and my nose.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried trimming my mustache, I managed to nick my upper lip after I had removed the combs. With them, forget about a short and neat shave.&lt;br /&gt;In my book, for a clean and accurate shave, you need something very sharp and accurate. This tool does not do it since I have do do multiple passes to sometimes cut a single hair that the comb misses.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? No.</li>
            <li> I didnt fully realize the significance of the &#x27;GO&#x27; until I got it. You do not want to use this as your everyday shaver. You could--but there are better options out there. This guy is little. The blade is about half the width of a standard beard or body trimmer. And includes three plastic guides that are not adjustable. The blade is also not as deep as regular norelco trimmer so it takes a couple passes. Lastly it uses a standard AA battery that I had to replace after 4 days of heavy (exclusive) use. But for all that, it fits in a dopp bag easily and saves the trouble of packing another charger. It really seems to be ideal for little bits of styling here or there, or so your gf can borrow it before hitting up the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is mine didnt say anywhere how water resistant it was. My other norelcos say very boldly that they can be used in the shower for instance. I used this one in the shower once without any water getting into the battery compartment or blade/hair sticking, but im not sure how long that will last. Will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion only get this as an addition to a more grounded razor, cause this is a little old thing. It is a great addition to your stable that will provide you some flexibility and lighten your load while traveling but lacks the power and size to tackle much hair (of any kind) on a regular basis. It is a gentle razor that is suitable for all sorts of body parts--especially because of its small maneuverable size.</li>
            <li> Contains:&lt;br /&gt;A lightweight, plastic trimmer (size of an electric toothbrush) with the trimmer head attached, small, medium &amp; long sized combs, and a brush. Also included is a second head that works as a conventional shaver &amp; a single AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:&lt;br /&gt;Setup and usage is a breeze, you turn the shaver on by twisting the bottom piece that holds the battery into the ON position.&lt;br /&gt;Whomever said two heads are better than one got it right with this trimmer. The two heads easily twist then pull off.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;You get the trimmer head with which the 3 different combs attach. You trim your beard to varying lengths by stroking the comb up through your beard. It can take a little practice as holding the trimmer at different angles will alter the length of the trim so try to find the sweet spot and be consistent. Unfortunately, the size of the small and medium combs are virtually the same size, so it would have been nice to have a more significant difference between the two in terms of length options.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving:&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a conventional shaving head that will allow you to do a close, fine shave in areas surrounding your beard. The top of the mini head easily removes by pressing two side buttons together for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Battery:&lt;br /&gt;Using a AA is great as you can always find one around &amp; using rechargeable are great. You can always toss a rechargeable AA once it can&#x27;t hold a charge, unlike a lithium which would have made the unit unnecessarily expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;br /&gt;Both the trimmer and shaver heads work very well, it&#x27;s inexpensive &amp; it&#x27;s a nice travel size.</li>
            <li> + Small and lightweight, perfect for travel&lt;br /&gt;+ Works as expected&lt;br /&gt;+ Trims cleanly in a single sweep&lt;br /&gt;+ AAA battery easily replaceable on the go; no charger needed&lt;br /&gt;+ Different combs supplied for styling (although I don&#x27;t use these)</li>
            <li> Great concept but way too loud! I sent of back and ordered the Norelco NT9130 which is better design even it it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra fancy attachments.</li>
            <li> After trying to like this razor for a month now, it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job. The razor takes a good five to ten minutes to trim even the least of my facial hair down to a good level.  The attachments and other pieces are of good quality. However, unless you have thin facial hair, be prepared to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> One AA battery powers this multi-purpose beard trimmer. It comes with three clipper sizes to match the desired length of one&#x27;s beard, an electric razor (for stubble), and a tiny brush to keep it all clean. So far, it is has worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two largest worries for handheld razors are that either they will die from steam from my shower or it will eat batteries weekly. Thankfully, neither are true. The Norelco razor is well-built and reliable. It painlessly keeps my beard looking well kept. What else can a man desire from a razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this trimmer to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> The transparent package is a little dirty, and the top part of the package was damaged and crushed.  I have no idea who did it.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much but after it arrived it is and works better than I expected.  smaller than my prior unit which was having a battery charge holding issue.  would buy again for the price although I wish it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard, which I trim with a big fancy trimmer - which I only take with me on business trips that are longer than a week. Otherwise, I just let the facial hair grow - who will recognize a dozen or so more hairs in my face anyway? So, I thought this little machine here, about one third the size and weight of my \\&quot;serious\\&quot; trimmer, would come in handy for my business trips. And actually, it does. It has enough power to even perform a full trim on my beard, and the small width of the blade lets me work very precisely in corners were the big trimmer has its difficulties. It comes with three different length attachments, and is water resistant, so you can clean it very easily under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;But there is one really annoying thing here - to start the trimmer, you have to twist the upper half against the lower half. The problem is that one direction activates the trimmer, the opposite direction unscrews the battery compartment - so more than once, I lost the batteries when I turned it the wrong way. This is especially annoying if you use this trimmer only once in a while, so you either have to really concentrate to do it right, or, probably what most people will do, don&#x27;t remember the correct direction, don&#x27;t bother to take a closer look and just take the fifty-fifty chance. It never works, you&#x27;ll always lose the battery.&lt;br /&gt;That annoyance cost the trimmer the fifth star, because in all other areas it is a very useful machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of different shavers and trimmers over the years from high dollar versions to low dollar versions.  Many have worked well and many have not.  This unit is by far the most useful shaver/trimmer i have ever owned and for the price is truly the best deal available.  A co-woker and I were just talking about trimmers and in fact both found and agreed that this is a great little trimmer.  Not only does it have the trimmer with the 3 attachments which many units posess but what this unit has that most units do not is a shaver component which not only provides a close shave but also is small enough to shave at tight angles and spaces required to properly manage a gotee or other facial manscaping requirements.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is not really what i was looking for. when using it tends to pull on you&#x27;re facial hair(ouch) and on the longest trim setting it cuts pretty short so if you keep a longer beard this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I went to visit my son who has one for his beard and mustache.  I used it and liked it so I purchased this  one for myself.  I tried a couple of the $9.00 type and was not happy with them. This one works well, a little more money but well worth it.</li>
            <li> PRECISION is the key word for this grooming tool! It&#x27;s so easy to use, too - holding a mirror u can even do blind spots yourself without help, which IMO makes it a handy item that deserves a permanent spot in my grooming kit. Excellent for travel, too, so u can do touch ups anytime, like before a big meeting. Recommended!</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I am happy with this product and at the price point it is offered I can&#x27;t complain one bit.  However, there is a caveat.  The blades on this trimmer don&#x27;t seem to be like those on a normal trimmer.  It provides a close trim everytime but it gives up speed to a normal trimmer.  I&#x27;d say it would take me easily 5+ minutes just to clean up my beard/neck and if I was going to use a guard and trim my entire beard it takes over 15 minutes.  Maybe it&#x27;s my beard, maybe it&#x27;s the trimmer. I can say my beard is not of lumberjack quality but closer to a stubble/scruff thing.  I hope this offers you some insight.</li>
            <li> They are small and great for edge ups and goatee&#x27;s.  Easy to store and cut very precise just the way I like.  My skin is sensitive and can&#x27;t handle a razor so these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver, The best trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> This gadget is great, except for the necessity of changing heads for every angle.  That makes it somewhat prissy for your average Joe--though that&#x27;s probably not for whom this styling tool is intended.  It does make lovely curves and angles, and if what you&#x27;re after is a Mephistopheles goatee--this is your thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic trim thingy is great and easy to use.  One problem is that it&#x27;s round and rolls easily off the bathroom sink.  That&#x27;s a deal breaker in my household.  Things tend to roll onto the tile floor and explode.  That hasn&#x27;t yet happened with the GoStyler, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time (said with the voice of bitter experience).  I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t a roller.</li>
            <li> Love this for all those irritating little facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Exellent product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used a bunch of \\&quot;accessory\\&quot; trimmers/shavers including the Philips Norelco BodyGroom (junk) and Multigroom Pro (awesome) and All-in-1 (good) and various Wahl&#x27;s and others...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this little trimmer/shaver despite a few complaints.  First, it has a very fine tooth trimmer blade.  In fact, it has the same small trimmer blade and foil as the Multigroom Pro.  This fine pitch is important because some are too coarse which lead to more nicks and cuts.  Yikes!  Also, this is impossibly small compared to the other tools mentioned above which makes it very convenient and easy to maneuver.  It is listed for use on facial hair, but since it uses the same cutter and foil as the Multigroom Pro (similar but better than the Bodygroom), I found it works as well on other parts of the body as well or better because it is so compact, thin, and well balanced.  Overall, operation/function-wise, I would give it 5 stars.  It uses a single AA battery which is very powerful and seems to last plenty long for the detail work for which it is intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body is sleek and shiny plastic on half, but there is an orange slightly rubberized grip.  I did not find that it was too slippery to hold or grip at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things which I don&#x27;t like about it, though.  One is that the on/off requires a twist motion.  That requires two hands and which also means if the other hand is wet or dirty with razor stubble, now both pieces are wet, dirty, etc.  Also, the on/off action is the same which opens the bottom to replace the battery and which is the same which twists off the top pieces. So, it is all to easy to accidentally turn the thing more than one stop and/or inadvertently disassemble the thing.  I would much prefer a separate on/off switch.  The beard combs are also a little tight to remove and require the same twisting action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is vague about using it around water.  It says notfor use while bathing/showering/etc. and not water-proof, but to wash it after use.  In fact, INSIDE the battery compartment is a water faucet symbol.  There is a rubber O-ring sealing the battery compartment.  I am not so interested in submersing it, but I do like to rinse things under water or with a little hand soap to clean it out, and so far, that doesn&#x27;t seem to affect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final nit is that I didn&#x27;t find a whole lot of difference in the 3 beard combs, which are listed as 4mm, 5mm, and 6mm.  I would have preferred a larger range such as 2mm, 4mm, and 8mm, or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, my complaints are relatively minor, though.  It is a great companion to my other shavers, especially my Braun foil shaver.  Braun shavers for the last umpteen years have just the junkiest trimmers on them, and I can pull this out and do the trimming that I need.  The Philips Norelco styler is quite inexpensive and very useful.  Not perfect, but definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This trimmer, although small in size, produces some great results.&lt;br /&gt;-Close, comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to maneuver around the contours of your face&lt;br /&gt;-Compact size makes it a wonderful tool for travel&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> Really good product. Its really close trim and its really amazing. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Go Styler\\&quot; is too cute.  If it is meant for a man, my bad.  It is cute.  It is small and compact.  It comes in two parts and a battery. You insert the battery then assemble it by connecting the bottom to the top. Just give a twist and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Styler comes with 3 attachments called beard combs. Sizes are Small, Med. and Large. Plus a Mini Foil Shaver to give you a closer shave, resulting in a clean shave look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said it is compact although I must mention that after you connect the two main parts the Styler it&#x27;s self has a decent length to it.  Which is good or else you would keep dropping the thing. I forgot to mention that the very top of the Styler is removable. This is how you attach the mini foil shaver.  We have on sampled the mini for shaver and the main styler w/o the attachments. It works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No a bad little Styler</li>
            <li> This thing is cute. It looks stylish and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, the \\&quot;twist to turn on/off\\&quot; thing is annoying. Twist the wrong way and you&#x27;re dumping the battery compartment. You get used to it, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, a couple of the comb attachments look almost the same height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I used one of the longer combs and started to use it on my chin. Bam! A dime-size patch was shaved off, almost to the bare skin. Maybe I was using it at the wrong angle? No matter, the design should be more idiot-proof for \\&quot;precision\\&quot; trimming, shouldn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the problem is it&#x27;s for precision edging only, for which it&#x27;s small footprint is well-suited. But the description does say it&#x27;s also for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others here seem to have had better results, so maybe I&#x27;m just clumsy. I&#x27;ll update this once I get the courage to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1: We just lost a huge contract because the customer made a comment on the \\&quot;poorly groomed staff\\&quot; here and the possible implications about our professionalism and attention to detail. (It&#x27;s hard to believe, but there are several competitors specializing in Carcharodon-mounted lasers.) This led my demotion to Sanitation Specialist. As a result, I could not continue payments and my car was repossessed. Thus my recent cycling accident, which leaves me typing using a pencil in my mouth. Sorry for any typos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: I find this is still useful for getting to small areas to shake my beard. However, I still dump the batteries by mistake.</li>
            <li> dont like the way it turns on and off. i constantly wind up twisting it too far and opening up the machine completely. cuts fine, a bit weak though. (takes about two minutes to cut beard)</li>
            <li> have not use,seem ok.</li>
            <li> I do use an electric razor quite often.  It&#x27;s a regular, full size Braun with a foil head. And, as a man with a goatee, the Braun isn&#x27;t quite equipped to handle the full job.  But this little Phillips Norelco GoStyler picks up where the Braun leaves off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil shaver head attachment gets the spots the Braun can&#x27;t: right up under the nose and the edges of the beard.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer head cleans up any strays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little shaver runs on one AA battery.  Very handy, especially if you keep rechargeable AAs around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in need of an additional tool for your shaving arsenal, I can&#x27;t knock this little guy.  Well, one knock: since it&#x27;s round, it does have a tendency to roll off of the sink.  But still, I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage high school aged son who is not growing a full on beard but likes to have some facial hair to show he is growing up!! he needed something small to trim things up a bit rather then to shave off everything when it was getting to long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far its very simple to use, and he says its easy to get the right length and its a great little tool for hair up keep. So far its a great item to have &amp; vine saved me having to buy something I was not sure would be simple or used.</li>
            <li> While they sell this as a trimmer meant mainly for beards, I find it does a great job with other manscaping projects. It is simple, small, and does a good job trimming with some degree of detail and closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GoStyler runs on batteries, and is not rechargeable. That can be a benefit or negative, depending on your point of view. Personally, I prefer rechargeable devices, but at least this one doesn&#x27;t use any odd batteries or proprietary power supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a nice device for travel, or just to do fine details on your beard, chin, or wherever else you might need a finer touch.</li>
            <li> The price is right on this one.  It seems obviously designed for travel, but its size and water resistance also makes it a good leave-in-the-shower type trimmer.  I find it doesn&#x27;t do the most efficient job due to the slender blade width and lack of power, but it does get the job done.  The slender blade also makes it rather precise.  It&#x27;s a trade-off that doesn&#x27;t make it an ideal primary trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package contains the buzzer, a single AA battery, 3 length attachments and a grid-type foil shaver.  The sizes are fine, and once you pick the one you like, you can throw the rest in a pile somewhere (there&#x27;s no included bag to put them in).  You might as well throw the foil shaver right in the trash though, because it&#x27;s completely useless.  It just made a mess and I had to defer to another blade to clean it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size attachments pop on and off easily from the back.  They&#x27;re also designed fairly well to capture the hair in there.  When you pop it off, a clump of hair comes out.  However, hairs still fly everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is easily replaced.  You&#x27;ll get a few sessions with the trimmer at full power, but then the battery peters off slowly.  There&#x27;s no indicator of battery level in any way other than a slow death.  The removal process is also strange because it&#x27;s one slip away from the twisting on/off mechanism.  If you twist it too far when you turn the thing off, the battery compartment pops open in the shower.  So I&#x27;m careful now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not terribly impressed, but I also wouldn&#x27;t mind getting one of these as a gift.  I think I reviewed the Gillette version of this at 4 stars, but this Norelco one actually complements it.  It just stinks that I need 2 buzzers to do the job.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this razor because it can get in that area under his bottom lip for shaping his goatee. The regular blade takes the hair off and then you can easily switch to the foil blade and it gets even closer.  This is the first electric razor I have found that has a foil blade that is that small.  Does it get as close as a regular blade razor? No, but it works quickly and easily to shave the same size area each time.  Unfortunately it is battery drive (and not rechargeable) but I plane to get a rechargeable battery for it once the one that came with it goes down.  My husband has been using it for a month and that battery is still good!</li>
            <li> I just bought this trimmer, which is under $20, and I must say I was a little disappointed. What I like about this trimmer is it&#x27;s small size which makes it easy to handle and good for travel. It uses a AA battery and I like the twist on and twist off. It trims ok, but I didn&#x27;t find the blades to be all that sharp so I had to go over some spots a couple of times - not a big deal but it can be a little annoying. It has 3 cutting sizes or combs that snap on and off pretty easily. But, my biggest disappointment and the main reason for buying this trimmer was for the foil option. This thing is absolutely worthless. If you are looking at this unit to trim and \\&quot;shave\\&quot; a little, this is not it. If you are looking for something small for travel just to do some touch-up trimming, this might be the unit for you.</li>
