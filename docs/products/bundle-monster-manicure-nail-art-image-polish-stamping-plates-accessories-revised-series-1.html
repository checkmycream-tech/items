            <li>Great product, there was a lot of great different stamps.</li>
            <li>Product was great &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Some images seems to be better than others, but that could be operator error.</li>
            <li>I was so looking forward to many of these.</li>
            <li>The ones I got are mostly hearts and stuff</li>
            <li>Seal with top coat</li>
            <li>Protective film was easy to remove which I can appreciate.</li>
            <li>the images come out crystal clear very nice quality and product very very hapy with this purchace</li>
            <li>I was really really looking forward to many of these.</li>
            <li>I new to stamping, so I&#x27;m sure this is going to take some practice.</li>
            <li>I got it today, ready and excited to start doing my nails.</li>
            <li>The designs are crisp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed.</li>
            <li>i just recently bought 2 sets of the stamping plate collections ond i absolutely love both sets and</li>
            <li>Crisp images.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately not w hopes of getting exactly what is pictured.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery....</li>
            <li>these are all just as shown, guess i got lucky, some reviews said they got a different variety.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is I can&#x27;t decide which design to try first!</li>
            <li>Full nail designs work with my nail beds so long as I have patience and line up correctly</li>
            <li>MATCHED!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME WITH THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Polish grabbed design every time on each plate I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Not a single one with the same plate design.</li>
            <li>again, my number one complaint is that the size of the full nail patterns are still not quite big enough for my thumb.</li>

            <li> Out of the 23 plates there&#x27;s like 3 that I&#x27;ll end up using. :(</li>

            <li> Happy good quality and selection</li>
            <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
            <li> Bought this set as a gift for my nieces. One 13 the other 11. They loved them. The designs are crisp. We use konad polish on them. I recommend</li>
            <li> I like some of the designs and that is why I purchased this lot, but some are just weird.

            <li> NOT ONE DESIGN MATCHED!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME WITH THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;They send you whatever junk NO ONE wants!&lt;br /&gt;EXTREMELY UNHAPPY CUSTOMR</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Fast delivery....</li>
            <li> I new to stamping, so I&#x27;m sure this is going to take some practice. Some images seems to be better than others, but that could be operator error.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I loved the designs shown in the pictures. I was really really looking forward to many of these. I got it today, ready and excited to start doing my nails. I opened it up and they are all different from the pictures shown here. Not a single one with the same plate design. I didn&#x27;t get a single one I wanted. It didn&#x27;t say they were different than what was pictured here. I&#x27;m pretty bummed. I was so looking forward to many of these. The ones I got are mostly hearts and stuff I will never use. Out of the 23 plates there&#x27;s like 3 that I&#x27;ll end up using. :( So bummed out! Why couldn&#x27;t they just send me the ones from the pictures? I guess the search continues.</li>
            <li> Some images worked well, others were too shallow.</li>
            <li> i just recently bought 2 sets of the stamping plate collections ond i absolutely love both sets and the images come out crystal clear very nice quality and product very very hapy with this purchace</li>
            <li> Great discs perfect for nail art with nicely etched designs that were easy to lift and very detailed.</li>
            <li> These are awesome !!!!</li>
            <li> these are all just as shown, guess i got lucky, some reviews said they got a different variety.  All the images work well and they are very cute. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooo excited!!  These arrived yesterday! The only problem is I can&#x27;t decide which design to try first!</li>
            <li> Not very usable and very disappointed the quality is not the greatest and getting the prints was very hard didn&#x27;t have much luck At all :(</li>
            <li> Never had a problem stamping with these! They are etched deeply enough for stamping and the bottoms do not cut your fingers</li>
            <li> Bundlemonster is always great. The images are great and nicely carved into the plates, and they stamp without a problem. Seal with top coat and they are set.</li>
            <li> Great product, there was a lot of great different stamps. I gave them to my nail lady as a gift she loves them</li>
            <li> Product was great &amp; fast delivery! Will order again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Crisp images. Didn&#x27;t get some of the plates that were pictured. (Plate w peacock, feather, etc). I&#x27;m happy w the designs I did get however. Polish grabbed design every time on each plate I&#x27;ve used so far. Full nail designs work with my nail beds so long as I have patience and line up correctly (I have wider nail beds). Protective film was easy to remove which I can appreciate. Would purchase again for the quality...but unfortunately not w hopes of getting exactly what is pictured.</li>
