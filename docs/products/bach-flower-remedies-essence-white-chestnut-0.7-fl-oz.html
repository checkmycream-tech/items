            <li>I&#x27;m able to sleep for longer periods.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Stuff!</li>
            <li>I love Bach Flower Essences, but I can&#x27;t say this one improved my mood as suggested in the diet program.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a complement to a bizarre diet my boyfriend paid for.</li>
            <li>Both my folks and I have had great luck using the Bach White Chestnut to calm those &amp;#34;racing thoughts&amp;#34; and sleep better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got about 15 of them and have found great results either alone or combined with other remedies.  </li>
            <li>We can deal calmly and rationally with any underlying problems that might be causing the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really work...even for pets!</li>

            <li>The White Chestnut REALLY helps keep your mind from spinning out of control.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put Bach&#x27;s in my coffee, tea, bottled water, and directly under the tongue.  </li>
            <li>This white chesnut remedy has been helping me sleep without dreaming as much.</li>
            <li>To subtle to tell for sure.</li>
            <li>Hard to say, I can&#x27;t really say it did much for me.</li>
            <li>Usually at such times when the interest of the moment is not strong enough to keep the mind full.</li>
            <li>My worries and anxieties calmed down a whole lot.</li>
            <li>And due to this manic society we live in where everything needs to be done yesterday, our minds can&#x27;t help but get overwhelmed with &#x27;stuff&#x27;.  </li>

            <li> First introduced by my wellness nutrition/chiropractor who also practices applied kinesiology in 2010, I have &#x27;tested&#x27; for it multiple times and have found this product to help my mind and body release negative mood/thought patterns and thus reduce anxiety.</li>
            <li> You will find both physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health.</li>
            <li> The presence of such unpleasant thoughts drives out peace and interferes with being able to think only of the work or pleasure of the day.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> From the Dr. Bach&#x27;s website:  &amp;#34;White Chestnut...is the remedy for unwanted thoughts and mental arguments that intrude into the mind and stop us concentrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;White Chestnut thoughts are often described as &#x27;worrying&#x27; - but they are not necessarily anxious or fearful, more repetitive.</li>
            <li> and she calms down.</li>
            <li> They seem to circle round and round and cause mental torture.</li>
            <li> I use this Bach Flower Remedy Essence when I have trouble shutting down my &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; mind at night when I&#x27;m trying to get to sleep.</li>
            <li> You just need to give it a chance; give it a few days and you&#x27;ll see the difference.  </li>
            <li> If you have problems sleeping, try a few drops of this in your tea at night.</li>
            <li> They circle round and round in the head like a looped recording.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it , a few drops under tounge to relax.</li>
            <li> I tend to get very tense  since being forced into a walker after a stroke last March, and this is a Godsend!</li>
            <li> I got this at the recommendation of a natural-leaning healthcare specialist for pets, for my anxious cat.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s impossible for me so who can tell.</li>

            <li> I got this at the recommendation of a natural-leaning healthcare specialist for pets, for my anxious cat.  It does the trick - just one drop in the bowl and she calms down. She also recommended mimulus and I use the two together.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Bach&#x27;s Flower Remedies for years  now, and I wouldn&#x27;t have a home without it.  I&#x27;ve got about 15 of them and have found great results either alone or combined with other remedies.  And due to this manic society we live in where everything needs to be done yesterday, our minds can&#x27;t help but get overwhelmed with &#x27;stuff&#x27;.  The White Chestnut REALLY helps keep your mind from spinning out of control.  You just need to give it a chance; give it a few days and you&#x27;ll see the difference.  I&#x27;ve put Bach&#x27;s in my coffee, tea, bottled water, and directly under the tongue.  Whichever method you choose, I think you&#x27;ll be glad you tried.  Go ahead...get a bottle....it just might make a believer out of you. :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li> White Chestnut is a quality anti-anxiety Flower Essence. It does take some time to get used too but it works very well. My worries and anxieties calmed down a whole lot. I will keep it my cabinet of holistic products.</li>
            <li> Have used Bach flower remedies for years...</li>
            <li> I love ALL Bach&#x27;s remedies. They really work...even for pets! They&#x27;re safe, effective and also appropriate for children. Try them...you can even mix them for a personal/family remedy.</li>
            <li> My Shamron healers recommend i look into the Bach Flowers. I have anxiety and racing thoughts.  I wanted to see would this really work. I took two drops in a glass of water and in no time I was just focused what was in front of me and not all the things I need to do next week. I also felt very comfortable and at peace with myself. The things that were bothering me just didn&#x27;t have any weight to it. I will try all week and  see how I feel. I love drinking my healing water and taking control of these emotions and not thr emotions taking control of me. Take control of my emotions</li>
            <li> If you have problems sleeping, try a few drops of this in your tea at night. It does help!&lt;br /&gt;Nite-nite!:)</li>
            <li> I use this Bach Flower Remedy Essence when I have trouble shutting down my &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; mind at night when I&#x27;m trying to get to sleep.</li>
            <li> Hard to say, I can&#x27;t really say it did much for me. But I know these things can range in efficiency from person to person. I doubt I would buy again, as I didn&#x27;t notice any changes I could say came from taking this.</li>
            <li> This white chesnut remedy has been helping me sleep without dreaming as much. Calms my mind n I&#x27;m able to sleep for longer periods.</li>
            <li> this is an excdellent product</li>
            <li> It was incredulous to take homeopathic medicines, but I tried to change my mind, now I can ensure the benefits of this medication, no side effects or adverse reactions. You will find both physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. thank you.</li>

They worry at us like a dog worries a bone. White Chestnut thoughts go nowhere.

We can deal calmly and rationally with any underlying problems that might be causing the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Bach&#x27;s description:  &amp;#34;For those who cannot prevent thoughts, ideas, arguments which they do not desire from entering their minds. Usually at such times when the interest of the moment is not strong enough to keep the mind full. Thoughts which worry and will remain, or if for a time thrown out, will return. They seem to circle round and round and cause mental torture. The presence of such unpleasant thoughts drives out peace and interferes with being able to think only of the work or pleasure of the day.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> White Chestnut Tincture 20 ml, 0.70 fl. oz.: I obsess over things and White Chestnut Tincture helps to ease my mind.</li>
            <li> To subtle to tell for sure. Besides you need to put it in a bottle of water and sip it all day. That&#x27;s impossible for me so who can tell.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Stuff! Use it , a few drops under tounge to relax. I tend to get very tense  since being forced into a walker after a stroke last March, and this is a Godsend!</li>
