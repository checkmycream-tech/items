            <li>and i needed a good red lipstick and this one is perfect shade thanks again for ur business</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very classic color that looks good on EVERYONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that there is a color that has this beautiful red on it by lime crime,.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a bit more of a darker berry color like in the picture, but it might look lighter on me because I&#x27;m tanner than I usually am right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still however a very nice shade of wine red.</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>So I recommend you google swatches to see true color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, classic red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pale so the contrast looked great on me.</li>
            <li>Their others are cool, pretty strong, very young.</li>
            <li>Fun package and color is really pretty.</li>
            <li>Its very sultry and mature, yet cute to wear during the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming - more like - sophisticated.</li>
            <li>The color was exactly as I hoped it would beðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>sooo pretty on and so creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>(I have to put white foundation in the lightest cool toned shade L&#x27;Oreal has) and it looks fabulous on me; I wear it often.</li>
            <li>the velvet like lipgloss really does go on like velvet!</li>
            <li>the boutique colors are kind of cool, I like to see my wife in a retro, deep red lipstick.</li>
            <li>it is not the same  color as the one on the picture, but I love it sooooo much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a brownish (but not exceedingly so) red with cool blue undertones.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty for occasions and leaves a nice stain for more casual events.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice deep red, very classic looking.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and last.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>said, I absolutely adore the unicorn tube.</li>
            <li>When I took it off I really had to scrub to get everything off</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for good color (or at least the one advertised) that lasts, you should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for myself, but I ended up using it for myself AND my entire Winterguard team (excluding the two boys).</li>
            <li>It has a rich, full color without being heavy or waxy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more in other colors!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay as lipstick, but I was hoping for something a little deeper with a nicer gloss.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-There&#x27;s a cute little unicorn on the case&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;She doesn&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but when she does, this color is her favorite.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The color of the lipstick isn&#x27;t as dark or nearly as glossy as the picture portrayed, but other than that I was pretty pleased with the lipstick.</li>
            <li>Subdued enough to be professional, strong enough for a romantic evening look.</li>
            <li>; my only complaint is that is DOES kind of stain.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a Rimmel/Kate Moss in nearly the exact shade, for a LOT less</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super dark berry red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other lipsticks from LimeCrime and loved them, I just think this one was a little bland.</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant and does not give you a sticky feeling or dry out your lips</li>
    </ol>

            <li> color&#x27;s pretty, but not good for me.</li>
            <li> She works some long hours and when she comes home, it is still noticeable</li>
            <li> it smells like vanilla and stays on for a long time.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like it too wet</li>
            <li> I spent what I did on a lipstick</li>
            <li> wife likes it and it seems to have enough mositurizer, and it sets well after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I got this product four days sooner than expected and immediately tried it on.</li>
            <li> and it was still sort of a pink tint on my lips.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because it messed up the cute little unicorn.  </li>
            <li> and I got it less than two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> The color is not true to picture but limecrime is known for enhancing their pictures.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the case was cracked when it arrived!  </li>
            <li> I noticed it did come of a little, but the stain it leaves on your lips is so dark you hardly notice.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not thrilled</li>
            <li> I opened the product and was disappointed to find a bricky, orange red...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this since you can&#x27;t swatch it in person before buying, but Im glass I decided to take a chance;</li>
            <li> This one was a bit boring.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this lipstick is so luxurious and creamy I just love it. Its the nicest red I have. I don&#x27;t do matte but I don&#x27;t like it too wet looking this is the perfect medium consistency.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 12th and received my product the 16th. It was well wrapped and protected so it suffered no damage. The lipstick itself is just as depicted in the picture, remember that it is called opaque for a reason. But it goes on beautifully and to darken the color all you have to do is add a layer or two. The color is vibrant and does not give you a sticky feeling or dry out your lips</li>
            <li> I thou the color be darker but i like it :D Goes on smooth and last. Works well as a blush :3 Very moisturizing. There a unicorn on it too XD. The packaging is so cute :D. Would reccommend this and willing to get another color to try :D</li>
            <li> I purchased this color because the color portrayed it as a deep, bluish red wine color. I opened the product and was disappointed to find a bricky, orange red... nothing similar to the picture at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this color because it was advertised as a bluish red. I don&#x27;t do orange reds and I&#x27;m not thrilled I spent what I did on a lipstick I&#x27;ll probably never wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color&#x27;s pretty, but not good for me. My suggestion is to update the picture so it&#x27;s not misleading.</li>
            <li> I like a &#x27;finished&#x27; kind of look and tho&#x27; the boutique colors are kind of cool, I like to see my wife in a retro, deep red lipstick. Reminds me a lot of the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s when I was a boy growing up, and almost all the ladies wore red. It&#x27;s not overwhelming - more like - sophisticated. I think you could rev it up with lipliner and repeat applications, but that&#x27;s not always apropos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes it and it seems to have enough mositurizer, and it sets well after a few minutes. She works some long hours and when she comes home, it is still noticeable; I know she doesn&#x27;t re-apply &#x27;cuz she leaves it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but when she does, this color is her favorite. It does come off with kissing, but... isn&#x27;t that the point? LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope LimeCrime keeps this color going. Their others are cool, pretty strong, very young. We have a couple of them as well. However, this one is our favorite. Subdued enough to be professional, strong enough for a romantic evening look. I plan to buy a couple more tubes soon, just in case....</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain. Great long-lasting  color. This is my favorite color. I use it daily and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of limecrime so when I saw that I was able to get this with a gift card I had I was excited. The color is not true to picture but limecrime is known for enhancing their pictures. So I recommend you google swatches to see true color. It&#x27;s still however a very nice shade of wine red. I love it.</li>
            <li> The color of the lipstick isn&#x27;t as dark or nearly as glossy as the picture portrayed, but other than that I was pretty pleased with the lipstick.</li>
            <li> Not only is the color of this lipstick amazing, but it feels so good going on! Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this since you can&#x27;t swatch it in person before buying, but Im glass I decided to take a chance; because this is one of my favorite colors and the lipstick itself wears very comfortably and lasts quite awhile. I pair it with the Candy Apple gloss and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this lipstick!!! The color was exactly as I hoped it would beðŸ˜Š I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more in other colors!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a pleasant brick-red color.  It&#x27;s okay as lipstick, but I was hoping for something a little deeper with a nicer gloss.  This one was a bit boring.  I&#x27;ve purchased other lipsticks from LimeCrime and loved them, I just think this one was a little bland.</li>
            <li> it is not the same  color as the one on the picture, but I love it sooooo much and I am so glad that there is a color that has this beautiful red on it by lime crime,. sooo pretty on and so creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> ...but it&#x27;s definitely NOT the one I thought it was gonna be. Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a Rimmel/Kate Moss in nearly the exact shade, for a LOT less and it lasts a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I absolutely adore the unicorn tube. if that is why you&#x27;re buying it, so that you can pull it out in front of your friends and watch everyone SQUEE for their lives, you should totally buy it. If you&#x27;re looking for good color (or at least the one advertised) that lasts, you should look elsewhere. &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But omg SQUEE....I frikkin LOVE unicorns! SQUEE SQUEE!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself, but I ended up using it for myself AND my entire Winterguard team (excluding the two boys). Everyone loved the color, and it looked good on everyone&#x27;s skin tone.  I am the lightest person on the team (I have to put white foundation in the lightest cool toned shade L&#x27;Oreal has) and it looks fabulous on me; I wear it often. The darkest person on our team was a young woman with beautiful olive gold skin and it looks amazing on her! Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know any African American or biracial people who wear makeup, but I can imagine that anyone with those skin tones would look fantastic in this lipstick as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is different than what&#x27;s shown. It&#x27;s more of a brownish (but not exceedingly so) red with cool blue undertones. It&#x27;s a very classic color that looks good on EVERYONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick- it smells like vanilla and stays on for a long time.  Beautiful color!  Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice deep red, very classic looking. I was hoping for a bit more of a darker berry color like in the picture, but it might look lighter on me because I&#x27;m tanner than I usually am right now. I&#x27;ll definitely wear it however, it&#x27;s pretty for occasions and leaves a nice stain for more casual events. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll look darker when I get paler around the winter. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonuses:&lt;br /&gt;-It smells like vanilla!&lt;br /&gt;-There&#x27;s a cute little unicorn on the case&lt;br /&gt;-Very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> i love lime crime and i needed a good red lipstick and this one is perfect shade thanks again for ur business</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.  It has a rich, full color without being heavy or waxy.  Plus it smells fabulous.  It&#x27;s a great, classic red.  My only complaint is that the case was cracked when it arrived!  I was so disappointed because it messed up the cute little unicorn.  I probably could have sent it back for another but I didn&#x27;t feel like waiting.  Aside from that, though, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This ia a Great product. Fun package and color is really pretty. I saw it on Pinterest and I am really happy I decided to order it. FYI the velvet like lipgloss really does go on like velvet! It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this color!  Its very sultry and mature, yet cute to wear during the day.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it already and I got it less than two weeks ago.  It moisturizes enough so a gloss isn&#x27;t reuqired; my only complaint is that is DOES kind of stain.  Overall, I&#x27;d suggest this lipstick 100%!</li>
            <li> I got this product four days sooner than expected and immediately tried it on. I instantly loved it. It&#x27;s super dark berry red. I&#x27;m extremely pale so the contrast looked great on me. I noticed it did come of a little, but the stain it leaves on your lips is so dark you hardly notice. When I took it off I really had to scrub to get everything off and it was still sort of a pink tint on my lips. Wore it to work the same night; did not stop receiving compliments.</li>
