            <li>It&#x27;s nice not to have to put on concealer</li>
            <li>I wanted something light, and good for your skin, that provides some coverage, and can be worn almost every day.</li>
            <li>The best BB cream out of the three I&#x27;ve tried thus far.  </li>
            <li>It has the best coverage by far and doesn&#x27;t turn gray on my face like the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I love it and its consistency</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding.  </li>

            <li>love.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>if its a very special occasion</li>
            <li>As far as the product, great medium tone, not oily but moisturizing.</li>
            <li>its light weight, easy to apply, and lasts all day, it does also offer light to medium coverage for imperfections.</li>
            <li>I ordered the medium light which turned out to be a prefect shade for me.  </li>
            <li>I use it for everyday use and its the best thing ever!!!</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried it wouldnt fit my complexion</li>
            <li>the Medium should fit you well</li>
            <li>I just used some blotting powder, and I am good to go, other than that, its one of the best BB creams that I have tried, and for only $10 at my  nearest beauty supply store, it cant be beat.</li>
            <li>I purchased it and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Thanks! :-)</li>
            <li>Really cool.</li>
            <li>iys such a good product, because I cant return it.</li>
            <li>If you found you right shade</li>
            <li>I wanted coverage, something lightweight, &amp; IN MY COLOR (which I ordered right on the first try).</li>
            <li>I love it so much, especially because it acts like a concealer too for my scars.</li>
            <li>Overall, though I really love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using BB cremes.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can make it as minimal or full coverage as I want.  </li>
            <li>I goes on smooth and feels very light (not at all heavy) on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because my shade was just a bit too light and will get the darker shade next time.</li>
            <li>i really like it</li>
            <li>So you may need to have a refreshing mist with you or simply only use this product on a day you&#x27;re not going to be doing much and then will be returning home shortly.</li>
            <li>covering very well and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I live in Jamaica,  </li>
            <li>I would say its a little too thick to be called a BB cream but its great cover.</li>
            <li>I would say purchase an LA girl concealer with this product to complete your face.</li>
            <li>I would like to know if there&#x27;s an opportunity to possibly start a distribution business as a representative to really and truly sell, promote this product.  </li>
            <li>It truly covers all of your spots and blemishes while maintaining a natural skin look.</li>
            <li>, it is very moisturizing and has a primer texture and appearance on the face, however its build-able, unlike other BB creams.  </li>
            <li>Just got this and so far it seems to be a good product, but I ordered the wrong shade which is a bit too dark for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>so if you have dry skin especially in the winter time, I highly suggest you apply a moisturizer before applying the BB cream or you could end up looking ashy.</li>
            <li>Gives full coverage and a very little goes a long way!</li>

            <li> I am just getting into the makeup scene and didn&#x27;t really want a thick foundation all the time. I wanted something light, and good for your skin, that provides some coverage, and can be worn almost every day. This stuff is GREAT. its light weight, easy to apply, and lasts all day, it does also offer light to medium coverage for imperfections. I would deff recommend this. The only con for me personally is that I have oily/ acne prone skin, and some oil does peak through after wearing it for a few hours. I just used some blotting powder, and I am good to go, other than that, its one of the best BB creams that I have tried, and for only $10 at my  nearest beauty supply store, it cant be beat.</li>
            <li> Just got this and so far it seems to be a good product, but I ordered the wrong shade which is a bit too dark for my complexion.  I didn&#x27;t send it back because I decided to use it as a contour shade.  I ordered the medium light which turned out to be a prefect shade for me.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is not oily or shiny.  It&#x27;s a matted look so if you have dry skin especially in the winter time, I highly suggest you apply a moisturizer before applying the BB cream or you could end up looking ashy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. If you found you right shade then it&#x27;s perfect. covering very well and not heavy at all. Also good for oily skin. will recommend it</li>
            <li> This is the bb cream for all with oily skin. I love it so much, especially because it acts like a concealer too for my scars. I had to order the lighter shade, because this was a little on the dark side for me, but I can use it to contour. Btw, you only need a little and you can use it as a base for you foundation. Really cool.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice I love it and its consistency, it is very moisturizing and has a primer texture and appearance on the face, however its build-able, unlike other BB creams.  It even comes off easier than foundation!  However, I am not convinced of its last power.  Due to its consistency, even with a primer and a setting spray it begins to look powdery after a couple of hours.  So you may need to have a refreshing mist with you or simply only use this product on a day you&#x27;re not going to be doing much and then will be returning home shortly. Overall, though I really love it.  Also while it says it can do 8 things in 1, I do not believe its a wonderful concealer unless you have one mark or two.  I would say purchase an LA girl concealer with this product to complete your face. And it is GREAT for acne prone/oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product is all it says it is.  I purchased it and was not disappointed. It&#x27;s nice not to have to put on concealer and then the makeup.  This product is outstanding.  I recommend it very highly. Try it, I promise you will NOT be sorry.</li>
            <li> this has replaced all my other products...  including Mac</li>
            <li> Better than my MAC makeup!</li>
            <li> I really really love this product. It&#x27;s nice not to have to put on concealer and then the make up.</li>
            <li> This is amazing product!!!! When i couldnt find it at my BSS, i went in search of it online immediately!!! perfect shade, easy to apply, just as good as foundation....if its a very special occasion i use this in conjunction with revlon color stay foundation in Caramel (just to give a reference of the complexion this medium shade works with). I use it for everyday use and its the best thing ever!!! so glad i found this...so so glad...</li>
            <li> The tube was half empty like it was used. I&#x27;ve had ruby kiss bb cream before and how this one came it was clearly obvious it was used.</li>
            <li> Came way before estimated date, received tracking number upon shipped confirmation. Customer service is a 5 STAR RATING. As far as the product, great medium tone, not oily but moisturizing. You only get a little bit of product, bunch of air inside.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I was a bit worried it wouldnt fit my complexion but it did. It was shipped and delivered promptly too. No complaints at all.I live in Jamaica,  so I bought it and asked someone to bring it here for me. So im real happy iys such a good product, because I cant return it. Lol</li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB cremes.  I must say I am very impressed!  I goes on smooth and feels very light (not at all heavy) on my skin.  I use this first then add some stick foundation and blend for a flawless face.</li>
            <li> I seen great reviews on YT about this product so I had to try it. I wanted coverage, something lightweight, &amp; IN MY COLOR (which I ordered right on the first try). I&#x27;ll be ordering my summer shade soon.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT!  I would like to know if there&#x27;s an opportunity to possibly start a distribution business as a representative to really and truly sell, promote this product.  Please advise!  Thanks! :-)</li>
            <li> The best BB cream out of the three I&#x27;ve tried thus far.  It has the best coverage by far and doesn&#x27;t turn gray on my face like the others I&#x27;ve tried.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores (even when I wear a little to the gym).  I love that I can make it as minimal or full coverage as I want.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t try it sooner.  My search is over, for now.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!! I would say its a little too thick to be called a BB cream but its great cover. BTW if you can wear either a NC50 in MAC the Medium should fit you well (it has yellow tones in it).</li>
            <li> love. love. love!!! this product is amazing for darker skinned women. Gives full coverage and a very little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It truly covers all of your spots and blemishes while maintaining a natural skin look. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because my shade was just a bit too light and will get the darker shade next time. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> great foundation i really like it</li>
