            <li>I first experienced this delightful scent while flipping through a fashion magazine... then got called in to my appointment before I could discover the name and maker.  </li>
            <li>Nice, seductive, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It is a shame, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>love this scent cant afford the large bottle but this is perfect</li>
            <li>very calming, relaxing and unforgettable.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume</li>

            <li>One day I will try the white version, but for now I am very very satisfied and surprisingly happy.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and very clean!</li>
            <li>I love the roll-on applicator, very useful and clean.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and without any hassle!</li>
            <li>Amazing scent - first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased perfume/cologne without smelling it first, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the ease of a rollerball applicator.  </li>
            <li>The roll on is a good way to not waste it spraying the air.  </li>
            <li>$20 and worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Success!  </li>
            <li>it smells like caramel, sandalwood and vanilla - rich and a bit sultry, yet its not too sweet or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Oh my, this Nirvana Black is without a doubt the most AMAZING scent I have ever worn!  </li>
            <li>But would have never imagined to ever get such a good version from them here.</li>
            <li>said it had a sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>It does not smell sweet at all.  </li>
            <li>This is one of THE best Sandalwood oils I&#x27;ve ever used in the past about 35 years!</li>
            <li>Smells awesome when you put it on, but doesn&#x27;t last at all...not only on me</li>
            <li>I got this Product very quickly and brand new!</li>
            <li>smells great, smokey, velvet undertones - long lasting</li>
            <li>I will admit that I was a tad embarrassed at first being head over heels for an Olsen twin product, but now I will shout it from the roof tops:</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s equally amazing when mixed with the Nirvana White.</li>
            <li>The vanilla and violet create such a warm, sexy aroma that it&#x27;s impossible not to fall in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to jot down the information just in time.  </li>
            <li>Love the small size for my purse.  </li>
            <li>I remembered that there was a black and a white version... and mistakenly ordered a sample of Creed &amp;#34; Love in Black&amp;#34;, hoping that was it.  </li>
            <li>It started out that my 15 yr young daughter got it from a friend.</li>
            <li>I feel so blessed to have access to such a luxurious fragrance at such a reasonable price, delivered to my door.  </li>
            <li>Imagine my delight when it arrived two days before the first expected delivery date!  </li>
            <li>scent definitely last a long time, but is not very strong of sandalwood, too much undertone of something less appealing, veery  musky</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells awesome when you put it on, but doesn&#x27;t last at all...not only on me, I know of other people that say the same..It is a shame, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is one of THE best Sandalwood oils I&#x27;ve ever used in the past about 35 years! I love the roll-on applicator, very useful and clean. Feels like I will get all out, no rest will remain. One day I will try the white version, but for now I am very very satisfied and surprisingly happy. It started out that my 15 yr young daughter got it from a friend. I said, how great, I made a wish to receive that from you and your sister for Christmas. Wow, this is so good! I am almost 50 and have used a lot like these. But would have never imagined to ever get such a good version from them here. Bravo! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and very clean! It arrived quickly and without any hassle! $20 and worth the buy! I ordered this to test the fragrance on myself before committing to the larger version. I will be buying the larger version.</li>
            <li> Smells great and I received it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> love this scent cant afford the large bottle but this is perfect</li>
            <li> The roll on is a good way to not waste it spraying the air.  Smells wonderful, which I knew as I had a sample.&lt;br /&gt;Will but it again.</li>
            <li> Love the small size for my purse.  Smell is heaven</li>
            <li> smelled nasty, almost like it was expired ....yuck</li>
            <li> smells great, smokey, velvet undertones - long lasting</li>
            <li> I first experienced this delightful scent while flipping through a fashion magazine... then got called in to my appointment before I could discover the name and maker.  This perfume was unforgettable and I found myself searching fashion magazines for another ad... no luck.  I remembered that there was a black and a white version... and mistakenly ordered a sample of Creed &amp;#34; Love in Black&amp;#34;, hoping that was it.  Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned to the office for a follow-up appointment, I was on a mission.  I immediately started searching for the magazine (In Style) then feverishly flipping through the pages hoping to find it before my name was called.  Success!  I was able to jot down the information just in time.  Oh happy day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my appointment I made a bee line home to search for it and found it on Amazon.com.  Imagine my delight when it arrived two days before the first expected delivery date!  This will be my signature scent... very calming, relaxing and unforgettable. I feel so blessed to have access to such a luxurious fragrance at such a reasonable price, delivered to my door.  Thank you, Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Nice, seductive, pleasant smell. I like to apply it on the inside of my wrists and wear it.</li>
            <li> I did not love the smell but that is not. The sellers fault</li>
            <li> Smells so good.  Could be a male or female sent.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance,,,its perfect for your purse,and ,,or even for a gift!!!</li>
            <li> Oh my, this Nirvana Black is without a doubt the most AMAZING scent I have ever worn!  The vanilla and violet create such a warm, sexy aroma that it&#x27;s impossible not to fall in love with it.  For me, this scent lasts all day and though it&#x27;s awesome all by itself it&#x27;s equally amazing when mixed with the Nirvana White. I use this rollerball before using the spray to hit pulse points on my neck, and it&#x27;s perfect to travel with so I can reapply later in the day.  I will admit that I was a tad embarrassed at first being head over heels for an Olsen twin product, but now I will shout it from the roof tops: I LOVE this perfume and I will ALWAYS have it in my possession!</li>
            <li> Amazing scent - first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased perfume/cologne without smelling it first, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This is wonderful - to me it smells like caramel, sandalwood and vanilla - rich and a bit sultry, yet its not too sweet or overpowering.  There&#x27;s also a touch of violet, I think.  I enjoy the ease of a rollerball applicator.  My only complaint is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, but this small size is easy to carry with you.</li>
            <li> scent definitely last a long time, but is not very strong of sandalwood, too much undertone of something less appealing, veery  musky</li>
            <li> Ordered this after hearing about it on a&lt;br /&gt;vlog.  They gave it a very good review said it had a sweet scent.  It does not smell sweet at all.  Gonna have to give this away.  Do not like this smell at all.</li>
            <li> I got this Product very quickly and brand new! I even had a personal message from them in shipping! I am 100% satisfied and will be ordering again!!!</li>
