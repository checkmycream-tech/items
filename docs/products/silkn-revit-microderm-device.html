    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I also like that there is varying tips and suction, to find what works best for you.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect in home solution.</li>
            <li>Excellent after 1st use all the blackheads gone....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s recommended to repeat treatments about every 3-5 days for best results.</li>
            <li>This isnt going to work very good unless you take the time and follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>I think that I&#x27;d be happy if my skin tone was evened out and not blotchy.</li>
            <li>I think that I&#x27;d be happy if my skin tone was evened out and not blotchy.</li>
            <li>and we thought that would be a good place to try this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of the tips are best suited for spot treatment, not for large areas of the face.</li>
            <li>Whether it effectively removes scars, age spots or wrinkles is going to take longer to evaluate.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this machine for my own face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading through the instruction booklet, I was happy to see that I didn&#x27;t have any issues that would contraindicate me being able to use it safely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it on my hands in hopes that it will sand off the age spots and maybe stimulate new skin growth, but I&#x27;m not all that impressed at this point.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a bag of 30, and you can buy more from the manufacturer&#x27;s website</li>
            <li>I will change my review if it breaks or stops working in under a year - for this price, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to work for more than a year if you use it 2-3x a week, when you consider that a treatment at the spa costs between $80-180, and that&#x27;s just for one session.my acne through diet and by using skinceuticals products, so</li>

            <li>No, don&#x27;t fret; it won&#x27;t eat your eyebrows; I even went over one part tentatively to make sure.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Not terrible, but noticeable.</li>
            <li>When you take the tip of, you will see the filter and are able to replace it</li>
            <li>It looks more saggy, probably because of the suction.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this machine.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>i guess i need to buy more filters</li>
            <li>The instruction booklet shows a diagram of the pattern of movement that is suggested for you to use in order to get the most from your treatment.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite suprised to feel like my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Kind of a cool device.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tips did a good job of gently exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I am super happy for what it&#x27;s done for my nose; and my skin feels so much lighter and freer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We ordered replacement filters from the manufacturer and they were easy to get and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You should always use good sunscreen after using this device, because your skin will be more sensitive to the sun and pron to sun burn and sun spots!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Changing the tips is easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and store and seems to be made with quality.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Has easy to follow guide with area to stroke, and the direction to start and stop.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably wise, as I can see how some people would go overboard and do more damage than good with overuse.</li>
            <li>Key to great results is to use light to medium pressure and keep the unit moving continuously.  </li>
            <li>it is a HUGE bargain.</li>
            <li>I could not find refills on amazon, but they are available now at the manufacturer&#x27;s website with free shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have only been using this for a week</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually worth more than the cheaper systems.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep using this wonderful product and update this review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li>For anyone who is looking for simple microdermabrasion, this kit is great.</li>
            <li>love the system, its easy to use no hassles and very efficient!.</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I first used this</li>
            <li>This unit did an excellent job of exfoliating and smoothing out those small wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, so it is comfortable to use and feels fairly well made overall, although a bit light.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, so it is comfortable to use and feels fairly well made overall, although a bit light.</li>
            <li>But it was an interesting concept that I was interested in trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Youll need a outlet, big mirror, good lighting, and comfortable place to sit.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say for sure if this would do it.</li>

            <li>She cannot say enough good things about it and compared to what she&#x27;d pay to go to a salon to have this done...</li>
            <li>gives you full suction.</li>
            <li>Once that goes away after use, I will move up to full suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I will move up to full suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so much..</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep the unit clean and put in a new filter as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, as suggested, I selected and used the fine tip for my first treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is surprisingly gentle and effective device, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review if my skin suddenly looks amazing and people start complementing me.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the the &amp;#34;beauty takes pain&amp;#34; camp then you might be more open to this than I am.ot cheap either.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve never done mirodermabrasion on my skin, and to be honest, it&#x27;s not something that is going to dramatically change my looks or make me look years younger.</li>
            <li>its kind of gross</li>
            <li>I think it would be best to consult a professional if you have more serious skin issues or need a much deeper treatment than this device will provide.</li>

            <li>The irritation subsided pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li>The result is pretty great, it is not as harsh peel, but it keeps your skin glowing.</li>
            <li>It should also help your serums and creams work better too, so if dark spots are an issue, I believe those specialty serums will have a greater effect along with this</li>

            <li>I have some light wrinkles on my face, mainly around my mouth and eyes, and I have a couple of age spots on my hands.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was impressed with the amount of skin the filter caught when she used it, but I reminded her that a firmly applied washcloth has the same effect -</li>
            <li>Her face is nicely exfoliated, but the current price of $97 is way too much for a glorified sander.r was impressed with the amount of skin the filter caught when she used it, but I reminded her that a firmly applied washcloth has the same effect -</li>
            <li>Her face is nicely exfoliated, but the current price of $97 is way too much for a glorified sander.</li>
            <li>i use it twice a day, works great on my skin, especially nose area, but i u stop for 2-3 days, it;ll go back to before.</li>
            <li>Best to do it before you go to bed and not right before a day that you plan to spend the whole day outside!</li>
            <li>you have some minor skin imperfections like light scarring or light lines, this is worth checking out.</li>
            <li>I used it very gently since it was my first time</li>
            <li>But, so far, this device has made a strong positive impression.</li>
            <li>The diamond treatment heads looked intimidating on the first site, until I realize that they do not rotate or vibrate when the device is on.</li>
            <li>There are directions on how to use it most effectively on facial areas.  </li>
            <li>I used the medium head the first time I used it, on the lowest suction.</li>
            <li>And I always make sure to use sunscreen (but I&#x27;m a big fan of sunscreen</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the the &amp;#34;beauty takes pain&amp;#34; camp then you might be more open to this than I am.</li>
            <li>Just tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I bought this device and over the last 3 months my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I used partial suction mode and fine tip on my face, and fine and precision tips on my hands.</li>
            <li>I was done going over most of my face within 10 minutes, and I think that was more than long enough.</li>
            <li>When I didn&#x27;t have any kind of reaction (I have sensitive skin), I moved up to the larger head and the highest suction</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just make sure that you move the tool across your face and don&#x27;t leave it in one spot for too long, which will cause a temporary hickey I&#x27;ve heard.</li>
            <li>; but that&#x27;s going to take more of a long time test.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles (I certainly didn&#x27;t get them), but it will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this seems like a great tool for exfoliating the skin, without being very harsh or causing irritation.</li>
            <li>This gadget features a donut-shaped abrasive ring and a strong vacuum.</li>
            <li>The hands feel much smoother, too.</li>
            <li>have not seen any difference or improvement in the skin, however I will freely admit I have not used this enough for it to work.</li>
            <li>But for what it is, and if you have reasonable expectations, this deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love that you can actually see how much skin was removed, because as with most skincare products - the results are cumulative, so don&#x27;t expect a miracle after one use, but seeing the dead skin helps you know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You do feel it suction your skin, but that is really all you feel.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t expect any of my deeper lines or furrows to change and suddenly be smooth.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t expect any of my deeper lines or furrows to change and suddenly be smooth.</li>
            <li>But much to my surprise, it works very well.</li>
            <li>My skin gets incredibly dry and flaky when it&#x27;s cool out, and I&#x27;m always looking for the best way to exfoliate without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>will update this review if I see any dramatic results on the age spots on my hands, or if my daughters acne scars are greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>I will update this review if I see any dramatic results on the age spots on my hands, or if my daughters acne scars are greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s provided clean simple care that you can do it yourself at home once a week.</li>
            <li>Gross, but true.  </li>
            <li>If you still have no signs of irritation, you can move on to a different tip and the full suction setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- When I first opened the package, the tip that was already on the device (the coarse one) had a fine white residue on it.</li>
            <li>main &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I could probably do a fair amount of the same thing by using a heavy scrub, but this works at a deeper level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While an exfoliating scrub is probably better suited for large areas, the Silk&#x27;n Revit Microderm Device offers a great solution for getting in tight areas that would otherwise be difficult to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>i saw this as a free offer from Amazon &amp; not really knowing what it is, i ordered one.  </li>
            <li>device is used on clean dry skin.</li>
            <li>but I shouldn&#x27;t have used the tool in that area in the first place; however, by the morning there was, for all practical purposes, no scratch apparent</li>
            <li>The manual says that you will be able to see first results after just couple of treatments, and that is just what had happened - the wrinkle and the scar look smoother and less deep already.</li>
            <li>The manual says you can get some mild redness and sensitivity right after treatment, but it should not last long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you have to use a new filter every time you use the device.</li>
            <li>After two uses, she claims she can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>The purpose of the handheld tool is to remove the damaged skin cells so they will be replaced with a new layer.</li>
            <li>When you move the device over your skin, it sucks in the skin, and the diamond edges gently scrub the top of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my expectations were low even as I used it because it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing much but sucking on my face.  </li>
            <li>Since I use an apricot scrub nightly, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting to see much but not only</li>
            <li>Most of the redness goes away in a couple of hours, but she has to be careful to do it when she doesn&#x27;t have anywhere to go the next day because there is some residual redness for about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I have always been scared of using any metallic objects on my skin - particularly dislike the loud ones like the epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit leery about this microdermabrasion device, but was willing to try it at home to avoid the high cost of salon visits -- plus I&#x27;ve seen some pretty scary faces of women who&#x27;ve had more aggressive treatment.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin very soft after you use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool to see all the dead skin get sucked into the device, but I really don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first time, my chin was majorly red and irritated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, take note that when you use this, stay out of direct sun that day!  </li>
            <li>i was able to scrape off some dead skin, but although gentle, the tool really doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of removing blackheads or dark</li>
            <li>It feels like a mini vacuum going over your skin, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all.  </li>
            <li>After I began to see the improvement I purchased retin a to minimize old acne scars and zap new pimples.   </li>
            <li>machine comes with three different sized heads/tips that allow wider or more narrow focus on a particular area.</li>
            <li>No redness so far on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have no moved up to full suction yet, due to the pinkish/reddish skin and itching.</li>
            <li>The two that are the same size offer different level of exfoliation - coarse and fine.</li>
            <li>Initially I had a little too much suction with the unit on low, so I just let it ride more superficially on my face and kept the wand moving without stopping at any point.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vacuum power is adjustable, and offers just a slight pull to help maintain contact with your skin and keep the exfoliating head clean</li>
            <li>skin does feel soft after use.</li>
            <li>I did accidentally scratch an area of skin near my eye</li>
            <li>Just stay away from the sensitive skin near your eye</li>
            <li>Putting moisturizer on my face, I just continued to marvel at how soft my skin was feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin; so I was worried it would annoy my skin but even with the toughest setting</li>
            <li>there and this has completely eradicated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is very fussy about what she uses on her face and has skin that looks 10 years younger than she is.  </li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin and even on the lowest setting she has quite a bit of redness after using this machine.  </li>
            <li>My least favorite part of the system is the fact that it must be plugged in to work, it is not rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had plenty of dead skin in the filter, and it did smooth out the pores.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to really be trying to hurt yourself with this, and following the instructions keeps you within the limits of what yo should expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then put on my moisturizer and my face felt really soft.</li>
            <li>I suffer from very oily skin and battled acne my entire life.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that amazon will have the refills in the next few weeks, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>filter definitely catches a lot of dead skin, but I&#x27;m not seeing a magical improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It has adjustable suction, which is nice for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin (on low), or for my tough hands (on high).  </li>
            <li>manual has very detailed (but small) pictures on how to treat different areas - they recommend to use the device on face, neck, body and hands (not on sensitive parts like lips, eyelids, nipples, etc., though).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, having never used one of these before, I thought it was very strange at first.</li>
            <li>a red, round &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; wound but the suction wasn&#x27;t that strong</li>
            <li>First click is partial suction and another click</li>
            <li>Each one is a different size and features a different &amp;#34;roughness.&amp;#34; The vacuum is powerful.</li>
            <li>main reason I&#x27;d recommend this is that the cost of salon treatment is high, and if your issues are only minor, this seems the way to go.</li>
            <li>The main reason I&#x27;d recommend this is that the cost of salon treatment is high, and if your issues are only minor, this seems the way to go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third week now, not seeing much noticeable decreasing of lines, but an overall smoothness to my skin.</li>
            <li>Did not use for full amount of time because I was not sure how sensitive my face would be.</li>
            <li>Since I have very sensitive skin, I started out only using the Silk&#x27;n Revit Microderm Device once a week to see how it worked on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes some time and practice to learn how to use it without giving yourself little round hickeys all over your face, but once you get the technique down, it&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I can see major improvement in my skin.    </li>
            <li>The unit comes with 3 different tips, so read carefully so that you choose the right one for your intent and purpose.</li>
            <li>; about this product is that, as far as I can tell, it will not harm your skin in any real way unlike other products on the market that can scratch your skin or cause permanent scarring.</li>
            <li>The small tip is similar to the larger fine tip as far as the abrasive level.</li>
            <li>I used the precision tip on low suction because I have sensitive skin and did one area of my face.</li>
            <li>This one is gentle enough that you can go over the same areas multiple times during one use.</li>
            <li>The redness goes away shortly after use and your skin does feel extremely soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently I have not been as well exfoliated as I thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep trying it, but so far I can only give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>After the first usage, I did notice a little redness, but nothing major, so I decided to continue trying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see less fine lines, but I&#x27;m not sure how realistic that is.</li>

            <li>/&gt;i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be using this much &amp; for those stubborn blackheads or dark spot, so far there&#x27;s no avoiding chemical abrasion such as liquid nitrogen or salicylic acid to remove them.</li>
            <li>but this is basically just a rough suction device that sands off the top layer of skin and sucks up the debris into a filter.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if the trade off is worth it.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I also like that there is varying tips and suction, to find what works best for you.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect in home solution.</li>
            <li> Excellent after 1st use all the blackheads gone....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended to repeat treatments about every 3-5 days for best results.</li>
            <li> This isnt going to work very good unless you take the time and follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> I think that I&#x27;d be happy if my skin tone was evened out and not blotchy.</li>
            <li> I think that I&#x27;d be happy if my skin tone was evened out and not blotchy.</li>
            <li> and we thought that would be a good place to try this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of the tips are best suited for spot treatment, not for large areas of the face.</li>
            <li> Whether it effectively removes scars, age spots or wrinkles is going to take longer to evaluate.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this machine for my own face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading through the instruction booklet, I was happy to see that I didn&#x27;t have any issues that would contraindicate me being able to use it safely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it on my hands in hopes that it will sand off the age spots and maybe stimulate new skin growth, but I&#x27;m not all that impressed at this point.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a bag of 30, and you can buy more from the manufacturer&#x27;s website</li>
            <li> I will change my review if it breaks or stops working in under a year - for this price, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to work for more than a year if you use it 2-3x a week, when you consider that a treatment at the spa costs between $80-180, and that&#x27;s just for one session.my acne through diet and by using skinceuticals products, so</li>

            <li> No, don&#x27;t fret; it won&#x27;t eat your eyebrows; I even went over one part tentatively to make sure.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Not terrible, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> When you take the tip of, you will see the filter and are able to replace it</li>
            <li> It looks more saggy, probably because of the suction.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this machine.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> i guess i need to buy more filters</li>
            <li> The instruction booklet shows a diagram of the pattern of movement that is suggested for you to use in order to get the most from your treatment.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite suprised to feel like my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Kind of a cool device.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tips did a good job of gently exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I am super happy for what it&#x27;s done for my nose; and my skin feels so much lighter and freer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We ordered replacement filters from the manufacturer and they were easy to get and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You should always use good sunscreen after using this device, because your skin will be more sensitive to the sun and pron to sun burn and sun spots!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Changing the tips is easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and store and seems to be made with quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Has easy to follow guide with area to stroke, and the direction to start and stop.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably wise, as I can see how some people would go overboard and do more damage than good with overuse.</li>
            <li> Key to great results is to use light to medium pressure and keep the unit moving continuously.  </li>
            <li> it is a HUGE bargain.</li>
            <li> I could not find refills on amazon, but they are available now at the manufacturer&#x27;s website with free shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have only been using this for a week</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually worth more than the cheaper systems.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep using this wonderful product and update this review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li> For anyone who is looking for simple microdermabrasion, this kit is great.</li>
            <li> love the system, its easy to use no hassles and very efficient!.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this product.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I first used this</li>
            <li> This unit did an excellent job of exfoliating and smoothing out those small wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, so it is comfortable to use and feels fairly well made overall, although a bit light.</li>

            <li> But it was an interesting concept that I was interested in trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Youll need a outlet, big mirror, good lighting, and comfortable place to sit.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say for sure if this would do it.</li>

            <li> gives you full suction.</li>
            <li> Once that goes away after use, I will move up to full suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Be sure to keep the unit clean and put in a new filter as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, as suggested, I selected and used the fine tip for my first treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is surprisingly gentle and effective device, highly recommended.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never done mirodermabrasion on my skin, and to be honest, it&#x27;s not something that is going to dramatically change my looks or make me look years younger.</li>
            <li> its kind of gross</li>
            <li> I think it would be best to consult a professional if you have more serious skin issues or need a much deeper treatment than this device will provide.</li>

            <li> The irritation subsided pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li> The result is pretty great, it is not as harsh peel, but it keeps your skin glowing.</li>
            <li> It should also help your serums and creams work better too, so if dark spots are an issue, I believe those specialty serums will have a greater effect along with this</li>

            <li> I have some light wrinkles on my face, mainly around my mouth and eyes, and I have a couple of age spots on my hands.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was impressed with the amount of skin the filter caught when she used it, but I reminded her that a firmly applied washcloth has the same effect -</li>

            <li> Her face is nicely exfoliated, but the current price of $97 is way too much for a glorified sander.</li>
            <li> i use it twice a day, works great on my skin, especially nose area, but i u stop for 2-3 days, it;ll go back to before.</li>
            <li> Best to do it before you go to bed and not right before a day that you plan to spend the whole day outside!</li>
            <li> you have some minor skin imperfections like light scarring or light lines, this is worth checking out.</li>
            <li> I used it very gently since it was my first time</li>
            <li> But, so far, this device has made a strong positive impression.</li>
            <li> The diamond treatment heads looked intimidating on the first site, until I realize that they do not rotate or vibrate when the device is on.</li>
            <li> There are directions on how to use it most effectively on facial areas.  </li>
            <li> I used the medium head the first time I used it, on the lowest suction.</li>
            <li> And I always make sure to use sunscreen (but I&#x27;m a big fan of sunscreen</li>

            <li> Just tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I bought this device and over the last 3 months my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I used partial suction mode and fine tip on my face, and fine and precision tips on my hands.</li>
            <li> I was done going over most of my face within 10 minutes, and I think that was more than long enough.</li>
            <li> When I didn&#x27;t have any kind of reaction (I have sensitive skin), I moved up to the larger head and the highest suction</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just make sure that you move the tool across your face and don&#x27;t leave it in one spot for too long, which will cause a temporary hickey I&#x27;ve heard.</li>
            <li> ; but that&#x27;s going to take more of a long time test.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles (I certainly didn&#x27;t get them), but it will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this seems like a great tool for exfoliating the skin, without being very harsh or causing irritation.</li>
            <li> This gadget features a donut-shaped abrasive ring and a strong vacuum.</li>
            <li> The hands feel much smoother, too.</li>
            <li> have not seen any difference or improvement in the skin, however I will freely admit I have not used this enough for it to work.</li>
            <li> But for what it is, and if you have reasonable expectations, this deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love that you can actually see how much skin was removed, because as with most skincare products - the results are cumulative, so don&#x27;t expect a miracle after one use, but seeing the dead skin helps you know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do feel it suction your skin, but that is really all you feel.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t expect any of my deeper lines or furrows to change and suddenly be smooth.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t expect any of my deeper lines or furrows to change and suddenly be smooth.</li>
            <li> But much to my surprise, it works very well.</li>
            <li> My skin gets incredibly dry and flaky when it&#x27;s cool out, and I&#x27;m always looking for the best way to exfoliate without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> will update this review if I see any dramatic results on the age spots on my hands, or if my daughters acne scars are greatly improved.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s provided clean simple care that you can do it yourself at home once a week.</li>
            <li> Gross, but true.  </li>
            <li> If you still have no signs of irritation, you can move on to a different tip and the full suction setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- When I first opened the package, the tip that was already on the device (the coarse one) had a fine white residue on it.</li>
            <li> main &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I could probably do a fair amount of the same thing by using a heavy scrub, but this works at a deeper level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While an exfoliating scrub is probably better suited for large areas, the Silk&#x27;n Revit Microderm Device offers a great solution for getting in tight areas that would otherwise be difficult to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> i saw this as a free offer from Amazon &amp; not really knowing what it is, i ordered one.  </li>
            <li> device is used on clean dry skin.</li>
            <li> but I shouldn&#x27;t have used the tool in that area in the first place; however, by the morning there was, for all practical purposes, no scratch apparent</li>
            <li> The manual says that you will be able to see first results after just couple of treatments, and that is just what had happened - the wrinkle and the scar look smoother and less deep already.</li>
            <li> The manual says you can get some mild redness and sensitivity right after treatment, but it should not last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you have to use a new filter every time you use the device.</li>
            <li> After two uses, she claims she can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> The purpose of the handheld tool is to remove the damaged skin cells so they will be replaced with a new layer.</li>
            <li> When you move the device over your skin, it sucks in the skin, and the diamond edges gently scrub the top of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my expectations were low even as I used it because it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing much but sucking on my face.  </li>
            <li> Since I use an apricot scrub nightly, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting to see much but not only</li>
            <li> Most of the redness goes away in a couple of hours, but she has to be careful to do it when she doesn&#x27;t have anywhere to go the next day because there is some residual redness for about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I have always been scared of using any metallic objects on my skin - particularly dislike the loud ones like the epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit leery about this microdermabrasion device, but was willing to try it at home to avoid the high cost of salon visits -- plus I&#x27;ve seen some pretty scary faces of women who&#x27;ve had more aggressive treatment.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin very soft after you use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool to see all the dead skin get sucked into the device, but I really don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first time, my chin was majorly red and irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, take note that when you use this, stay out of direct sun that day!  </li>
            <li> i was able to scrape off some dead skin, but although gentle, the tool really doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of removing blackheads or dark</li>
            <li> It feels like a mini vacuum going over your skin, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all.  </li>
            <li> After I began to see the improvement I purchased retin a to minimize old acne scars and zap new pimples.   </li>
            <li> machine comes with three different sized heads/tips that allow wider or more narrow focus on a particular area.</li>
            <li> No redness so far on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have no moved up to full suction yet, due to the pinkish/reddish skin and itching.</li>
            <li> The two that are the same size offer different level of exfoliation - coarse and fine.</li>
            <li> Initially I had a little too much suction with the unit on low, so I just let it ride more superficially on my face and kept the wand moving without stopping at any point.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vacuum power is adjustable, and offers just a slight pull to help maintain contact with your skin and keep the exfoliating head clean</li>
            <li> skin does feel soft after use.</li>
            <li> I did accidentally scratch an area of skin near my eye</li>
            <li> Just stay away from the sensitive skin near your eye</li>
            <li> Putting moisturizer on my face, I just continued to marvel at how soft my skin was feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin; so I was worried it would annoy my skin but even with the toughest setting</li>
            <li> there and this has completely eradicated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is very fussy about what she uses on her face and has skin that looks 10 years younger than she is.  </li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin and even on the lowest setting she has quite a bit of redness after using this machine.  </li>
            <li> My least favorite part of the system is the fact that it must be plugged in to work, it is not rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had plenty of dead skin in the filter, and it did smooth out the pores.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to really be trying to hurt yourself with this, and following the instructions keeps you within the limits of what yo should expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then put on my moisturizer and my face felt really soft.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very oily skin and battled acne my entire life.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that amazon will have the refills in the next few weeks, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> filter definitely catches a lot of dead skin, but I&#x27;m not seeing a magical improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It has adjustable suction, which is nice for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin (on low), or for my tough hands (on high).  </li>
            <li> manual has very detailed (but small) pictures on how to treat different areas - they recommend to use the device on face, neck, body and hands (not on sensitive parts like lips, eyelids, nipples, etc., though).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, having never used one of these before, I thought it was very strange at first.</li>
            <li> a red, round &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; wound but the suction wasn&#x27;t that strong</li>
            <li> First click is partial suction and another click</li>
            <li> Each one is a different size and features a different &amp;#34;roughness.&amp;#34; The vacuum is powerful.</li>
            <li> main reason I&#x27;d recommend this is that the cost of salon treatment is high, and if your issues are only minor, this seems the way to go.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m on my third week now, not seeing much noticeable decreasing of lines, but an overall smoothness to my skin.</li>
            <li> Did not use for full amount of time because I was not sure how sensitive my face would be.</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin, I started out only using the Silk&#x27;n Revit Microderm Device once a week to see how it worked on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes some time and practice to learn how to use it without giving yourself little round hickeys all over your face, but once you get the technique down, it&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I can see major improvement in my skin.    </li>
            <li> The unit comes with 3 different tips, so read carefully so that you choose the right one for your intent and purpose.</li>
            <li> ; about this product is that, as far as I can tell, it will not harm your skin in any real way unlike other products on the market that can scratch your skin or cause permanent scarring.</li>
            <li> The small tip is similar to the larger fine tip as far as the abrasive level.</li>
            <li> I used the precision tip on low suction because I have sensitive skin and did one area of my face.</li>
            <li> This one is gentle enough that you can go over the same areas multiple times during one use.</li>
            <li> The redness goes away shortly after use and your skin does feel extremely soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently I have not been as well exfoliated as I thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep trying it, but so far I can only give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> After the first usage, I did notice a little redness, but nothing major, so I decided to continue trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see less fine lines, but I&#x27;m not sure how realistic that is.</li>

            <li> /&gt;i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be using this much &amp; for those stubborn blackheads or dark spot, so far there&#x27;s no avoiding chemical abrasion such as liquid nitrogen or salicylic acid to remove them.</li>
            <li> but this is basically just a rough suction device that sands off the top layer of skin and sucks up the debris into a filter.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if the trade off is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was there a good amount of dead skin cells, but also a lot of random tiny hairs that I have growing on my face.</li>
            <li> daughter has used it three times now, and thinks maybe it&#x27;s helping open some of her pores and vacuum them out.  </li>
            <li> A tiny vacuum with an abrasive tip?</li>
            <li> it was fine; just left my skin a little redder than usual</li>
            <li> It also allows target exfoliation on specific trouble areas such as small scars, age spots, and around fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note all the reasons or situations that would make it a bad idea to use the Revit device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by washing my face with a mild cleanser and allowing it to fully dry.</li>
            <li> The device is essentially a vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> the sandpaper tips do not move or rotate, the power is just for the vacuum.  </li>

            <li> The Silk&#x27;n Revit Microderm Device is basically a plug in powered vacuum to whisk away dead skin cells that you manually scrub away with one of three sized scrubbing tips.</li>

            <li> Basically, it takes away dead skin cells and leaves the surface feeling softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> After using this a few times, here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would imagine this would prevent acne, as acne is often caused by dead skin clogging up pores</li>
            <li> and this was just a few minutes out of my morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also comes with a bag of filters, which trap any dead skin the machine sands off.  </li>
            <li> Since it literally remove dead cells from your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It causes redness, but that fades after a few hours.</li>
            <li> tool basically combines suction and scrubbing to eliminate dead skin cells where you use the tool.</li>
            <li> Your skin will tingle, maybe even slightly burn afterward, but when you see all the dead skin that was collected in the filter, you&#x27;ll know why!</li>
            <li> The tp is not powered, the wand has no battery, and there is a small filter that fills up with your dead skin cells that must be replaced or washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past, I have used the Neutrogena micro dermabrasion system, which basically just sands your skin, but sadly, I don&#x27;t see a big difference between this and the Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> and surely we no longer need power cords for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife has used it five times now and claims that small wrinkles around her lips have disappeared and those around her eyes have shrunk.  </li>
            <li> This year I spent over a $1000 on a dermatologist and my skin was getting worse using the prescribed products.    </li>
            <li> I usually stick to scrubs and microdermabrasion creams, but I thought I&#x27;d try out the Silk&#x27;n Revit.</li>
            <li> There are three 2 small, and one very small.</li>
            <li> I used precision tip on fingers, because it was hard to maintain suction in some areas</li>
            <li> Some areas are hard to get, like in the creases of your nose/around the nostrils, since the area is not flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen products like this advertised a lot lately</li>
            <li> have also noticed that when I use this at least every two weeks that I don&#x27;t break out into pimples.</li>
            <li> (no more flakes!)</li>
            <li> You have to slide it very slowly, and this is hard to do so since the thing is sucking away at your skin.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not too expensive, but still not cheap either.</li>
            <li> As if it had previously been used or perhaps was dirty from the factory?</li>
            <li> The thing is, it&#x27;s uncomfortable and unpleasant enough that I&#x27;m dubious I want to do it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is crazy to see all of the dead skin &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; on the filter even after just one use.</li>
            <li> I just visited the Silk&#x27;n website, where I learn that each filter lasts for approximately 5 sessions.</li>
            <li> After using the device for 3 months, I&#x27;m addicted to this device.   </li>

            <li> The device is essentially a vacuum cleaner. The diamond treatment heads looked intimidating on the first site, until I realize that they do not rotate or vibrate when the device is on. When you move the device over your skin, it sucks in the skin, and the diamond edges gently scrub the top of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual says to ask your doctor if you have any of this conditions:&lt;br /&gt;- Undiagnosed lesions&lt;br /&gt;- Recent herpes outbreak&lt;br /&gt;- Warts&lt;br /&gt;- Sunburn&lt;br /&gt;- Active rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;- Unstable diabetes mellitis&lt;br /&gt;- Disorders of the auto-immune system&lt;br /&gt;- Skin cancer&lt;br /&gt;- Vascular lesions&lt;br /&gt;- Usage of oral blood thinners (anti-coagulants)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have some rosacea on my face, so I cannot use it all over my face, but there is a spot without any redness, that conveniently has a deep wrinkle and a scar, so I decided to try the device there. I also used it on my hands. I was skeptical at first, but it seems to be working. I used partial suction mode and fine tip on my face, and fine and precision tips on my hands. The manual says that you will be able to see first results after just couple of treatments, and that is just what had happened - the wrinkle and the scar look smoother and less deep already. The hands feel much smoother, too. I used precision tip on fingers, because it was hard to maintain suction in some areas there.&lt;br /&gt;The manual has very detailed (but small) pictures on how to treat different areas - they recommend to use the device on face, neck, body and hands (not on sensitive parts like lips, eyelids, nipples, etc., though). The manual says you can get some mild redness and sensitivity right after treatment, but it should not last long. I did not feel any reaction on my hands, and on the face there was some tingling for a couple of minutes, and then it was gone. No redness so far on my very sensitive skin. They suggest to rinse the area with cold water and apply some moisturizer there, and use sunscreen if thearea is going to be exposed to sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the device, under the removable tip, there is a place where you put a filter, they include a whole baggy of filters, and you are supposed to replace filters every few treatments if suction feels weaker. I could not find refills on amazon, but they are available now at the manufacturer&#x27;s website with free shipping. I am sure that amazon will have the refills in the next few weeks, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is surprisingly gentle and effective device, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have only been using this for a week and I already notice a difference in my skin texture, less wrinkles, and lighter acne scarring.  I am so excited about this product.  You can really tell the device is working, because the little filter that is in the device shows the dead skin that has been removed (kinda gross).  You can go over an area a few times in one sitting.  I also like that there is varying tips and suction, to find what works best for you.  This is a perfect in home solution.</li>
            <li> Kind of a cool device.  It feels like a mini vacuum going over your skin, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all.  It leaves your skin very soft after you use it.  It has different speeds, so you can vary from a light to stronger treatment, none of which are unappealing.  Basically, it takes away dead skin cells and leaves the surface feeling softer and smoother.  There are directions on how to use it most effectively on facial areas.  Whether it effectively removes scars, age spots or wrinkles is going to take longer to evaluate.  But, so far, this device has made a strong positive impression.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week, so I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three heads and two speeds of suction. There&#x27;s a small head for small areas (the crease of your nose), a medium head and a larger head. I used the medium head the first time I used it, on the lowest suction. When I didn&#x27;t have any kind of reaction (I have sensitive skin), I moved up to the larger head and the highest suction and I switched out the heads for different sections of my face. It comes with a bag of replacement filters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filter definitely catches a lot of dead skin, but I&#x27;m not seeing a magical improvement in my skin. In the past, I have used the Neutrogena micro dermabrasion system, which basically just sands your skin, but sadly, I don&#x27;t see a big difference between this and the Neutrogena. It&#x27;s cool to see all the dead skin get sucked into the device, but I really don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does feel soft after use. And I always make sure to use sunscreen (but I&#x27;m a big fan of sunscreen anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I actually like that it plugs in. It saves me from forgetting to charge it and then having to wait a day to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually worth more than the cheaper systems. I&#x27;ll update my review if my skin suddenly looks amazing and people start complementing me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting closer to 40 years and the wrinkles on my face are starting to get noticeable. I&#x27;ve seen products like this advertised a lot lately so I thought I would give it a try. After using this a few times, here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When I first opened the package, the tip that was already on the device (the coarse one) had a fine white residue on it. As if it had previously been used or perhaps was dirty from the factory? Either way, it was very unappealing to have something that goes on my face come out of the box with residue on it. The other two tips were clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I used the precision tip on low suction because I have sensitive skin and did one area of my face. I tried my chin and only my chin so I could compare how my skin looked between my chin and the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The feeling was weird. It&#x27;s literally vacuuming your face while you slide this abrasive tip over your skin. You have to slide it very slowly, and this is hard to do so since the thing is sucking away at your skin. After the first time, my chin was majorly red and irritated. The irritation subsided pretty quickly though. The second time it was red and irritated as well, though again, the irritation only lasted minutes after I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen any difference or improvement in the skin, however I will freely admit I have not used this enough for it to work. The thing is, it&#x27;s uncomfortable and unpleasant enough that I&#x27;m dubious I want to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel like if given a chance, this could work to reduce lines and wrinkles because it is sucking the collagen back into the lines. Of course it is also stretching your skin out a bit with the suctioning so I&#x27;m not sure if the trade off is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you have to use a new filter every time you use the device. EVERY TIME. So you&#x27;re constantly sinking money into this. It comes with a bag of 30, and you can buy more from the manufacturer&#x27;s website (I think it&#x27;s $9.99 for a bag of 30 filters) So it&#x27;s not too expensive, but still not cheap either. Especially considering the money you&#x27;ve already spent purchasing the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Can I recommend it? Not really. But am I encouraging people to stay away from it? Not really. If you&#x27;re in the the &amp;#34;beauty takes pain&amp;#34; camp then you might be more open to this than I am.ot cheap either.

            <li> Excellent after 1st use all the blackheads gone....</li>
            <li> I give this product five stars because I believe it is the only (or one of the very few) at-home microdermabrasian tool that a non-professional should consider purchasing. I&#x27;m not giving it five stars because it works miracles or is in any way comparable to the results you&#x27;ll get at the spa or aesthetician&#x27;s office. But for what it is, and if you have reasonable expectations, this deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; about this product is that, as far as I can tell, it will not harm your skin in any real way unlike other products on the market that can scratch your skin or cause permanent scarring. This one is gentle enough that you can go over the same areas multiple times during one use. Your skin will tingle, maybe even slightly burn afterward, but when you see all the dead skin that was collected in the filter, you&#x27;ll know why! I love that you can actually see how much skin was removed, because as with most skincare products - the results are cumulative, so don&#x27;t expect a miracle after one use, but seeing the dead skin helps you know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure that you move the tool across your face and don&#x27;t leave it in one spot for too long, which will cause a temporary hickey I&#x27;ve heard. I did accidentally scratch an area of skin near my eye but I shouldn&#x27;t have used the tool in that area in the first place; however, by the morning there was, for all practical purposes, no scratch apparent (I mean, I could see something if I looked reeeeally closely in my magnifying mirror - but even then, it was very faint). Just stay away from the sensitive skin near your eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST FOR: flaky skin (no more flakes!); dull looking skin (definitely will brighten up your skin by removing dead layers); rough, pock-marked, and/or scarred skin (will moderately buff some of those issues - but won&#x27;t work miracles). I would imagine this would prevent acne, as acne is often caused by dead skin clogging up pores but I have already cleared up my acne through diet and by using skinceuticals products, so I can&#x27;t really say for sure if this would do it. If exfoliating helps your acne but hasn&#x27;t completely cleared it - this might help that last little bit. I would also imagine that this would help prevent wrinkles, especially if you&#x27;re in your late 20&#x27;s - early 30&#x27;s (I am 30), but it&#x27;s too soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only just got it yesterday, so I will change my review if it breaks or stops working in under a year - for this price, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to work for more than a year if you use it 2-3x a week, when you consider that a treatment at the spa costs between $80-180, and that&#x27;s just for one session.my acne through diet and by using skinceuticals products, so I can&#x27;t really say for sure if this would do it.

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I first used this and there was a bit of a learning curve for me.  I started with the medium tip and the lower suction and my expectations were low even as I used it because it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing much but sucking on my face.  So you can imagine my surprise when, after I was finished using the &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; and rinsed my face with cold water and felt how smooth my skin felt afterwards.  Putting moisturizer on my face, I just continued to marvel at how soft my skin was feeling.  At 53, I don&#x27;t expect my skin to feel like this without a lot of effort and this was just a few minutes out of my morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that is only after one use and I want to see how my face will feel in a few weeks.  So you can expect me to update this review.  I will say that I wish the company had made the device rechargeable.  We&#x27;ve come a long way with technology and surely we no longer need power cords for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe with the next model they will make it cordless.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep using this wonderful product and update this review in a few weeks. So far, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Ew!  That&#x27;s what you will say when you pull off the head and see what came off your face. Since I use an apricot scrub nightly, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting to see much but not only was there a good amount of dead skin cells, but also a lot of random tiny hairs that I have growing on my face. It cleaned up a lot of them!  No, don&#x27;t fret; it won&#x27;t eat your eyebrows; I even went over one part tentatively to make sure. :)  I have relatively sensitive skin; so I was worried it would annoy my skin but even with the toughest setting it was fine; just left my skin a little redder than usual afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest area that I saw an immediate difference was on my nose; with those ever expanding pores that seem to always be highlighted there.  It basically buffed them and cleared out a lot of the little white stuff that likes to hang out inside.  Gross, but true.  I will see how it works on my slight blotchiness I&#x27;ve been noticing along my cheekbones (I&#x27;m only 32! Come on!); but that&#x27;s going to take more of a long time test. Meanwhile, I am super happy for what it&#x27;s done for my nose; and my skin feels so much lighter and freer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that when I use this at least every two weeks that I don&#x27;t break out into pimples. I am not prone to pimples but I do get little ones here and there and this has completely eradicated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, take note that when you use this, stay out of direct sun that day!  Best to do it before you go to bed and not right before a day that you plan to spend the whole day outside!</li>
            <li> After just one use, my wife loves it.  After two uses, she claims she can&#x27;t live without it.  She is very fussy about what she uses on her face and has skin that looks 10 years younger than she is.  This unit did an excellent job of exfoliating and smoothing out those small wrinkles.  Key to great results is to use light to medium pressure and keep the unit moving continuously.  Stay in one place for any length of time and you run the risk of redness or tenderness.  Except in only an extreme case of misuse can I see this leaving any permanent marks or damage.  Update - My wife has used it five times now and claims that small wrinkles around her lips have disappeared and those around her eyes have shrunk.  We ordered replacement filters from the manufacturer and they were easy to get and inexpensive.  She cannot say enough good things about it and compared to what she&#x27;d pay to go to a salon to have this done...it is a HUGE bargain.</li>
            <li> i saw this as a free offer from Amazon &amp; not really knowing what it is, i ordered one.  it&#x27;s essentially a mini vacuum with sandpaper tips you can scrape over your face to remove dead skin.  the sandpaper tips do not move or rotate, the power is just for the vacuum.  i was able to scrape off some dead skin, but although gentle, the tool really doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of removing blackheads or dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be using this much &amp; for those stubborn blackheads or dark spot, so far there&#x27;s no avoiding chemical abrasion such as liquid nitrogen or salicylic acid to remove them.</li>
            <li> love the system, its easy to use no hassles and very efficient!.</li>
            <li> So far this seems like a great tool for exfoliating the skin, without being very harsh or causing irritation. Long terms results as far as helping with wrinkles, dark spot, etc are yet to be seen, but I am hopeful that with continued use, I will see an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, I treated just a small at first, to test it out and see how my skin would react. This was per the instructions - it says to start on a small area and use partial suction setting, along with the finest tip. If there are no signs of irritation, you can do the entire face. If you still have no signs of irritation, you can move on to a different tip and the full suction setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was minimal redness for me and I have semi-sensitive skin. My skin also felt a little itchy for about 10-15 minutes after use. Not terrible, but noticeable. The redness goes away shortly after use and your skin does feel extremely soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is used on clean dry skin. You glide the tip across the skin in different areas. You do feel it suction your skin, but that is really all you feel. Some areas are hard to get, like in the creases of your nose/around the nostrils, since the area is not flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should always use good sunscreen after using this device, because your skin will be more sensitive to the sun and pron to sun burn and sun spots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing the tips is easy. They just snap on and off. When you take the tip of, you will see the filter and are able to replace it It is crazy to see all of the dead skin &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; on the filter even after just one use. I thought I exfoliated well already and I also use a facial cleansing brush. Apparently I have not been as well exfoliated as I thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To change the suction level, you click the power button. First click is partial suction and another click gives you full suction. I have no moved up to full suction yet, due to the pinkish/reddish skin and itching. Once that goes away after use, I will move up to full suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am pleased with just the exfoliation. You can tell that aspect definitely works by the way your skin feels and by seeing all of the debris on the filter. I expect that you should see other improvements as well, after quite some time using it, since you&#x27;re shedding layers of skin. It should also help your serums and creams work better too, so if dark spots are an issue, I believe those specialty serums will have a greater effect along with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use this while it is plugged in. It is not a chargeable device. The cord is fairly long. It is lightweight, so it is comfortable to use and feels fairly well made overall, although a bit light., I will move up to full suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am pleased with just the exfoliation.

            <li> I did not see any results with this product.  As a matter of fact, my skin looks worse!  It looks more saggy, probably because of the suction.  It sucks your skin and now I look even older than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried microdermabrasion so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this machine. I have some light wrinkles on my face, mainly around my mouth and eyes, and I have a couple of age spots on my hands.  My 20-year old daughter has some acne, blocked pores and a little scaring on her chin and we thought that would be a good place to try this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has used it three times now, and thinks maybe it&#x27;s helping open some of her pores and vacuum them out.  She has sensitive skin and even on the lowest setting she has quite a bit of redness after using this machine.  Most of the redness goes away in a couple of hours, but she has to be careful to do it when she doesn&#x27;t have anywhere to go the next day because there is some residual redness for about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice on the age spots on my hands.  I&#x27;m not sure what I expected but this is basically just a rough suction device that sands off the top layer of skin and sucks up the debris into a filter.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it on my hands in hopes that it will sand off the age spots and maybe stimulate new skin growth, but I&#x27;m not all that impressed at this point.  I exfoliate my face quite often, and treat it with a Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid serum so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this machine for my own face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine comes with three different sized heads/tips that allow wider or more narrow focus on a particular area. The edges of the tips are covered with diamond dust to give a sanding/exfoliating effect.  I use the widest head on my hands, and my daughter uses the medium one for her chin.  The most narrow head would be for the crack of the nose or a very small area that needs attention.  It has adjustable suction, which is nice for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin (on low), or for my tough hands (on high).  The suction and friction stimulates blood flow, which will supposedly help regenerate skin.  It also comes with a bag of filters, which trap any dead skin the machine sands off.  My daughter was impressed with the amount of skin the filter caught when she used it, but I reminded her that a firmly applied washcloth has the same effect - you just can&#x27;t *see* the skin that comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if I see any dramatic results on the age spots on my hands, or if my daughters acne scars are greatly improved.  For now, I am giving this machine three stars.  It works as expected for exfoliating, but I&#x27;m not sure I would pay $87 for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 14 May 2015:  My daughter used this machine about ten times over three weeks, and saw no change in the scars on her chin, nor did the machine actually suction out any plugged pores.  Her face is nicely exfoliated, but the current price of $97 is way too much for a glorified sander.r was impressed with the amount of skin the filter caught when she used it, but I reminded her that a firmly applied washcloth has the same effect - you just can&#x27;t *see* the skin that comes off.

            <li> Definitely works as advertised on flaky skin. It works as well as expensive powder exfoliants in this regard. I did not see a noticeable difference on smoother skin where there are wrinkles/scars/etc. The price seems a little hefty but I expect that it will go down in the future. Easy to use and store and seems to be made with quality. I like it but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I love it so much..I even purchased a second one for my mom.</li>
            <li> i use it twice a day, works great on my skin, especially nose area, but i u stop for 2-3 days, it;ll go back to before. i guess i need to buy more filters</li>
            <li> I have always been scared of using any metallic objects on my skin - particularly dislike the loud ones like the epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it on my face - for about 10 mins before bath, later used my Dove face wash.  I used it very gently since it was my first time and I can already feel a difference which no wash/facial can give you.  Since it literally remove dead cells from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to keep moving it across your face - just like you would use any shaver/epilator.  Keeping it on one spot is not going to work.</li>
            <li> The Silk&#x27;n Revit Microderm Device is basically a plug in powered vacuum to whisk away dead skin cells that you manually scrub away with one of three sized scrubbing tips. The tp is not powered, the wand has no battery, and there is a small filter that fills up with your dead skin cells that must be replaced or washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips did a good job of gently exfoliating. There are three 2 small, and one very small. The two that are the same size offer different level of exfoliation - coarse and fine. The small tip is similar to the larger fine tip as far as the abrasive level. All of the tips are best suited for spot treatment, not for large areas of the face. My least favorite part of the system is the fact that it must be plugged in to work, it is not rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum power is adjustable, and offers just a slight pull to help maintain contact with your skin and keep the exfoliating head clean so it maintains effectiveness. While an exfoliating scrub is probably better suited for large areas, the Silk&#x27;n Revit Microderm Device offers a great solution for getting in tight areas that would otherwise be difficult to exfoliate. It also allows target exfoliation on specific trouble areas such as small scars, age spots, and around fine lines.</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin, I started out only using the Silk&#x27;n Revit Microderm Device once a week to see how it worked on my skin. After the first usage, I did notice a little redness, but nothing major, so I decided to continue trying. The next week, I tried it twice. It feels like a vacuum pulling on your skin and I did see some of the &amp;#34;old age&amp;#34; spots diminishing. However, I would not recommend this product for anyone who has roseaca. I have it on my cheeks, so I avoid those areas when I use the Revit device. I&#x27;m on my third week now, not seeing much noticeable decreasing of lines, but an overall smoothness to my skin. I&#x27;m going to keep trying it, but so far I can only give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This gadget features a donut-shaped abrasive ring and a strong vacuum. Actually, three abrasive rings are provided. Each one is a different size and features a different &amp;#34;roughness.&amp;#34; The vacuum is powerful. The abrasion is powered only by your arm: you have to stroke your face with the gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some wrinkles around my mouth and I could perceive some improvement after using this tool. It causes redness, but that fades after a few hours. On the other hand, I have a deep wrinkle on my forehead that did not respond to treatment. It got red and it got a bit sore. This condition persisted for days. Oh well, I don&#x27;t think that wrinkle will go away without dynamite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool grinds off some of your skin and as such, it has a filter to catch the dust that was your skin. I just visited the Silk&#x27;n website, where I learn that each filter lasts for approximately 5 sessions. I also learned that thirty replacement filters cost $10. I believe that it is possible to rinse off these little filters, allow them to dry, and then use them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done mirodermabrasion on my skin, and to be honest, it&#x27;s not something that is going to dramatically change my looks or make me look years younger. But it was an interesting concept that I was interested in trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool basically combines suction and scrubbing to eliminate dead skin cells where you use the tool. For me, I tried it out on my nose area to see how it would treat the pores there. Overall, it *does* work. I had plenty of dead skin in the filter, and it did smooth out the pores. I could probably do a fair amount of the same thing by using a heavy scrub, but this works at a deeper level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve read about professional dermabrasion, this is definitely a few steps down from that. That&#x27;s probably wise, as I can see how some people would go overboard and do more damage than good with overuse. You&#x27;d have to really be trying to hurt yourself with this, and following the instructions keeps you within the limits of what yo should expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have some minor skin imperfections like light scarring or light lines, this is worth checking out. Don&#x27;t expect miracles (I certainly didn&#x27;t get them), but it will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review Program&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li> I was a bit leery about this microdermabrasion device, but was willing to try it at home to avoid the high cost of salon visits -- plus I&#x27;ve seen some pretty scary faces of women who&#x27;ve had more aggressive treatment. The purpose of the handheld tool is to remove the damaged skin cells so they will be replaced with a new layer. This is supposed to even out skin tone, get rid of pigmented spots, help increase elasticity and softness, as well as to decrease the appearance of tiny lines and wrinkles. After reading through the instruction booklet, I was happy to see that I didn&#x27;t have any issues that would contraindicate me being able to use it safely. It&#x27;s important to note all the reasons or situations that would make it a bad idea to use the Revit device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by washing my face with a mild cleanser and allowing it to fully dry. Then, as suggested, I selected and used the fine tip for my first treatment. There is a little, round black filter that sits on top of the plastic wand, and then the tip screws into that base. The unit comes with 3 different tips, so read carefully so that you choose the right one for your intent and purpose. The instruction booklet shows a diagram of the pattern of movement that is suggested for you to use in order to get the most from your treatment. Initially I had a little too much suction with the unit on low, so I just let it ride more superficially on my face and kept the wand moving without stopping at any point. I was afraid I&#x27;d see a red, round &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; wound but the suction wasn&#x27;t that strong and I did not have any issues. I was done going over most of my face within 10 minutes, and I think that was more than long enough. I then put on my moisturizer and my face felt really soft. It&#x27;s recommended to repeat treatments about every 3-5 days for best results. Be sure to keep the unit clean and put in a new filter as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The documentation makes a lot of promises about the improvement  you will see in your skin, and it&#x27;s hard to evaluate a product such as this without using it over a much longer period of time. I intend to do treatments with the least coarse tip and the lowest suction for a month or so as directed. What do I want to see? Definitely I want my hyper-pigmented areas from age or sun exposure to be minimized. I&#x27;d like to see less fine lines, but I&#x27;m not sure how realistic that is. I definitely don&#x27;t expect any of my deeper lines or furrows to change and suddenly be smooth. I think that I&#x27;d be happy if my skin tone was evened out and not blotchy. I intend to update my dramatic results as they happen...or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I&#x27;d recommend this is that the cost of salon treatment is high, and if your issues are only minor, this seems the way to go. I think it would be best to consult a professional if you have more serious skin issues or need a much deeper treatment than this device will provide.

            <li> Just tried it for the first time. Did not use for full amount of time because I was not sure how sensitive my face would be. My skin feels softer after its use.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is looking for simple microdermabrasion, this kit is great. It&#x27;s provided clean simple care that you can do it yourself at home once a week. The result is pretty great, it is not as harsh peel, but it keeps your skin glowing.</li>
            <li> After using the device for 3 months, I&#x27;m addicted to this device.   Pros- Easy to use Has easy to follow guide with area to stroke, and the direction to start and stop. PAINLESS Minimal redness after you finish the treatment. Im using this device once a week. I can see major improvement in my skin.    Cons Its corded.  Youll need a outlet, big mirror, good lighting, and comfortable place to sit. If you use as directed it takes about an hour to treat each section for 5 minutes. I break it up when I dont have lots of time, cheeks and forehead in the morning, nose and neck later that day.  This isnt going to work very good unless you take the time and follow the directions.  You will see the results when you remove the tip.......its kind of gross but it makes me realize all that nasty stuff just came off my face.  I suffer from very oily skin and battled acne my entire life.  This year I spent over a $1000 on a dermatologist and my skin was getting worse using the prescribed products.    I bought this device and over the last 3 months my skin has never looked better.  After I began to see the improvement I purchased retin a to minimize old acne scars and zap new pimples.   I just turned 40 and I&#x27;m quite suprised to feel like my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> My skin gets incredibly dry and flaky when it&#x27;s cool out, and I&#x27;m always looking for the best way to exfoliate without irritating my sensitive skin. I usually stick to scrubs and microdermabrasion creams, but I thought I&#x27;d try out the Silk&#x27;n Revit. I&#x27;ll admit, having never used one of these before, I thought it was very strange at first. A tiny vacuum with an abrasive tip? But much to my surprise, it works very well. After using it just a few times, my skin felt noticeably smoother, and I had less flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some time and practice to learn how to use it without giving yourself little round hickeys all over your face, but once you get the technique down, it&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate. And in the long run, it costs a lot less than $50 tubes of microdermabrasion cream.</li>
            <li> When the first time I used it, it really shocked me with the dust in the device when I clean it per instruction.  I thought my face has been cleaned thoroughly but it seemed definitely not.  My only concern is if the skin will be loose if I used it a lot.</li>
