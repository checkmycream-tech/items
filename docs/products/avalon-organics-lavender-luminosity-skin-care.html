    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was so impressed that I emailed the company, too.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this product since the review were great!</li>
            <li>Thank you Avalon Organics you are doing great!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful under make-up.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the face.  </li>
            <li>and he has been happy with it!</li>
            <li>I run out of adjectives trying to describe how perfect this cream was.</li>
            <li>Best price here too.</li>
            <li>It is very good that this cream is fragrance-free and can be used both during the day and at night.</li>
            <li>This is very good.</li>
            <li>Though the smell is not what I like, but the condition is very good.</li>
            <li>It absorbs beautifully into your skin.</li>
            <li>bc Amazon was so great at working with me with the problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a happy mom.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice.</li>
            <li>Good title</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but a week after I began using this product, my skin tone became more even, lines began fading, and--most importantly--my face feels great.</li>
            <li>No breakouts or irritation ,feels very calming and relaxing on my skin-my favourite moisturiser ever,a great price and  the most wonderful lavender smell.</li>
            <li>: very high-quality ingredients, extremely good for the skin, feels great going on, smells lovely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found this 2-pack.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I am very allergic to the night cream, but the moisture cream worked great.</li>
            <li>In addition, it gets used up more quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t reach a saturation point in that I can keep putting on more and more</li>
            <li>The effects are not terribly noticable.</li>
            <li>I note the company does not say what becomes \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love falling asleep to the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was before a very unique 5 star formula, but now has changed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time, and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Received product very quickly which is always a \\&quot;+\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>However,the lavender is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>I like very much this moisture leaves your skin soft and the smell is very good</li>
            <li>The wonderful lavender scent is missing from this product.</li>
            <li>It is not the smooth velvety texture I was used to.  </li>
            <li>This cream is REALLY good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I made sure I got the right cream this time, so I thought, but I didn&#x27;t think to check the ending order.</li>
            <li>No longer rich and creamy, it is now watery.</li>
            <li>This cream is okay, but it no longer has ANY of the features that made me love the old formula.  </li>
            <li>but then is softens out and is quiet pleasant.</li>
            <li>The original cream was a lovely and rich (without being heavy) cream that gave my skin a remarkable and noticeable glow often commented on by others.</li>
            <li>Love this cream, my skin more sensitive to give me better protection, especially in the winter to give me better protection, like lavender Avalon</li>
            <li>Also, I can really only find it at a good price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the lavender because it is very calming for the skin (as well as the mind).  </li>
            <li>I also use as a hand cream,  as I experience a lot of dryness and after using a good exfoliation glove and the Avalon Organics Ultimate Moisture Cream, I am experiencing lessening of my age spots.</li>
            <li>So the air conditioning is always on to keep the computers cool.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Avalon&#x27;s Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream for years and have absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Included also are many flower products, very allergenic.  </li>
            <li>None are as perfect as the one solitary jar I have left of the original formula \\&quot;Ultimate Moisture Cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly but hydrates for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li>Super Hydrated.</li>
            <li>, the texture is ultra soft and absorbs very quickly, leaving the skin plumped, fresh and with a lovely lavender scent.</li>
            <li>When I went to make a recent online purchase I saw more than one review of the product stating that if you had previously enjoyed this product to now beware.</li>
            <li>I tried to melt it in a skillet and it never melted, even at very hot temperatures.</li>
            <li>It was a quick to soak in, frothy souffle of intense moisture but with a feather light feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>the Avalon Lavender Night cream and the daily moisture cream is excellent, it helps with wrinkles and also very nourishing for the facial skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy for this moisture night cream.  </li>
            <li>This night cream is a non-greasy, fresh smelling way to moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>It may work great for those who aren&#x27;t allergic to the ingredients, but it seems as though several other reviewers have experienced the same problem.</li>
            <li>Super light, goes right into the skin, no heavy feel, and that luxurious lavender aroma!  </li>
            <li>but it just does not feel right?</li>
            <li>People are right - this product isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  </li>
            <li>When I traveled to hot and tropical climates the amazing effect was an actual lessening of oiliness.</li>
            <li>This cream is very good for my dry skin,I use it as a daily cream as well .</li>
            <li>I work in an office with a very large bank of computers.  </li>
            <li>lament the new night cream feels just as cheap and ineffectually formulated as third-world</li>
            <li>: If my skin is irritated that day, it will sometimes sting when I first apply it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this facial moisturiser and cannot be without it!I</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, smooth and  </li>
            <li>Love this cream, wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li>In what far stretch of the imagination can citrus oils be considered &#x27;hypoallerginic&#x27; and suitable for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I think this product would probably work great for those without an allergy to it&#x27;s ingredients, I had a negative experience with it.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering the Ultimate Moisture Cream which I have used for years and love.  </li>
            <li>The light texture and luxurious feel without greasiness on my face was a major selling point of the old Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream, but I might have been able to do without that pleasant experience if the (all natural essential oil) lavender scent remained.  </li>
            <li>Love this product for dry climates.  </li>
            <li>I tried the product last night and my skin seems fine today.  </li>
            <li>I lived in the Rockies where it is very arid</li>
            <li>so I needed something very moisturizing for every day.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend this product to a lot of customers who said they needed something really hydrating and balancing.  </li>
            <li>However, can&#x27;t beat the price and the free shipping and the ingredients appear the same.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Avalon Organics for years and really like all their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot, Avalon Organics.</li>
            <li>The density of the cream is the real issue for me.</li>
            <li>that one, \\&quot;ultimate\\&quot; is absolutely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves a completely unnatural \\&quot;mask\\&quot; like layer on top of the skin without actually sinking in or moisturizing in any way.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes without feeling greasy and has a pleasant, subtle aroma.</li>
            <li>I am also not sure that such strong fragrance is a good choice for the sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have very normal skin.  </li>
            <li>The new formula was an entirely different product and had suffered at the hand of the new \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot; formula.</li>
            <li>I have put so many different kinds of products on my face in my life, most of them filled with harsh chemicals created in a lab somewhere, and I&#x27;ve NEVER had an allergic reaction to a single one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like it even more than initially due to the improvement i see in my skintone.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever had an allergic reaction to, which is ironic considering that it&#x27;s all natural, organic, and calls itself \\&quot;calming, and non-irritating.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I absolutely have to agree this previous reviews This is Rich, Rich soft Moisture!  </li>
            <li>It soaks in fine, but it&#x27;s so dry it pulls my skin with every swipe.</li>
            <li>Fine lines were kept at bay, my face was never shiny or dry.</li>
            <li>This is a new formulation and very different from the original.  </li>
            <li>If you loved the old Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream for the same reasons, don&#x27;t waste your money on this lesser, ho-hum cream that feels heavier to apply and wear, and barely even smells good.</li>
            <li>I am inclined to believe it has more to to with their cash flow and less to do with the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>probably nothing more at all from Avalon in light of their poor judgment and lack of customer service) and</li>
            <li>I use it day and night and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks much fresher than in the past and with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>This cream is kind of thick</li>
            <li>I bought this night cream and my face became beet red right after using it.  </li>
            <li>The cream itself is more of a stiff consistency and it made me break out.</li>
            <li>It was totally worth the slightly higher price than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Now that I live in in the Northeast</li>
            <li>The Avalon company did not respond to my email comments and complaints, but I was told by another distributor (not Amazon) that the new product is what Avalon is sending them now</li>
            <li>I wrote Avalon Organics to express to them my disillusionment with their new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was surprised to receive the Ultimate Night Cream which is a much heavier consistency.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after looking everywhere unsuccessfully for the avalon night cream for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>In no place were the words for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This cream seems to have nearly eliminated my break outs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking they might have a stock of old creams that they&#x27;re trying to get rid of...</li>
            <li>An added bonus is the container which allows you to use every bit of product with no waste.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this stuff just isn&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li>I also have acne prone skin, so finding a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t bother my acne is difficult.</li>
            <li>My face is currently BEET red and burning hot with blisters.  </li>
            <li>I had to quickly wash it off and take benadryl the previous time I thought I had bought the cream by mistake and used it anyway.</li>
            <li>No other cream (including several quite expensive ones) had ever been so remarkable.</li>
            <li>Finally a reasonably price, not animal tested products that work, From a dry face to soft after one nights use.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that really moisturized my skin here in the Rocky Mountains with nearly 350 days a year of unrelenting sunshine and wind at 8,000 feet above sea level.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed the product off and taken a benadryl and trying to calm down with an ice pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the second time Avalon has cheapened a product, I won&#x27;t try any new Avalon products.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>finally found a store I could test the new formula.</li>
            <li>Unless and until they bring back the old formula.  </li>
            <li>You would think \\&quot;organic\\&quot; might mean mild or natural - don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li>, it is with a heavy heart that I find I must change my decade long and loyal romance with Avalon Organics to someone else.</li>
            <li>Apparently Avalon is no longer making a day cream, only this loser night cream.</li>

            <li> However, can&#x27;t beat the price and the free shipping and the ingredients appear the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Avalon Organics for years and really like all their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot, Avalon Organics.</li>
            <li> The density of the cream is the real issue for me.</li>
            <li> that one, \\&quot;ultimate\\&quot; is absolutely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves a completely unnatural \\&quot;mask\\&quot; like layer on top of the skin without actually sinking in or moisturizing in any way.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without feeling greasy and has a pleasant, subtle aroma.</li>
            <li> I am also not sure that such strong fragrance is a good choice for the sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have very normal skin.  </li>
            <li> The new formula was an entirely different product and had suffered at the hand of the new \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot; formula.</li>
            <li> I have put so many different kinds of products on my face in my life, most of them filled with harsh chemicals created in a lab somewhere, and I&#x27;ve NEVER had an allergic reaction to a single one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like it even more than initially due to the improvement i see in my skintone.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever had an allergic reaction to, which is ironic considering that it&#x27;s all natural, organic, and calls itself \\&quot;calming, and non-irritating.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I absolutely have to agree this previous reviews This is Rich, Rich soft Moisture!  </li>
            <li> It soaks in fine, but it&#x27;s so dry it pulls my skin with every swipe.</li>
            <li> Fine lines were kept at bay, my face was never shiny or dry.</li>
            <li> This is a new formulation and very different from the original.  </li>
            <li> If you loved the old Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream for the same reasons, don&#x27;t waste your money on this lesser, ho-hum cream that feels heavier to apply and wear, and barely even smells good.</li>
            <li> I am inclined to believe it has more to to with their cash flow and less to do with the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> probably nothing more at all from Avalon in light of their poor judgment and lack of customer service) and</li>
            <li> I use it day and night and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks much fresher than in the past and with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> This cream is kind of thick</li>
            <li> I bought this night cream and my face became beet red right after using it.  </li>
            <li> The cream itself is more of a stiff consistency and it made me break out.</li>
            <li> It was totally worth the slightly higher price than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Now that I live in in the Northeast</li>
            <li> The Avalon company did not respond to my email comments and complaints, but I was told by another distributor (not Amazon) that the new product is what Avalon is sending them now</li>
            <li> I wrote Avalon Organics to express to them my disillusionment with their new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to receive the Ultimate Night Cream which is a much heavier consistency.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after looking everywhere unsuccessfully for the avalon night cream for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> In no place were the words for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to have nearly eliminated my break outs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking they might have a stock of old creams that they&#x27;re trying to get rid of...</li>
            <li> An added bonus is the container which allows you to use every bit of product with no waste.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this stuff just isn&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li> I also have acne prone skin, so finding a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t bother my acne is difficult.</li>
            <li> My face is currently BEET red and burning hot with blisters.  </li>
            <li> I had to quickly wash it off and take benadryl the previous time I thought I had bought the cream by mistake and used it anyway.</li>
            <li> No other cream (including several quite expensive ones) had ever been so remarkable.</li>
            <li> Finally a reasonably price, not animal tested products that work, From a dry face to soft after one nights use.</li>
            <li> It is the only product that really moisturized my skin here in the Rocky Mountains with nearly 350 days a year of unrelenting sunshine and wind at 8,000 feet above sea level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed the product off and taken a benadryl and trying to calm down with an ice pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the second time Avalon has cheapened a product, I won&#x27;t try any new Avalon products.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> finally found a store I could test the new formula.</li>
            <li> Unless and until they bring back the old formula.  </li>
            <li> You would think \\&quot;organic\\&quot; might mean mild or natural - don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> , it is with a heavy heart that I find I must change my decade long and loyal romance with Avalon Organics to someone else.</li>
            <li> Apparently Avalon is no longer making a day cream, only this loser night cream.</li>
            <li> you are a user of the late lamented Ultimate Night cream and have found any product that compares favorably please let me know.mate\\&quot; is absolutely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin gets so dry during the winter that it&#x27;s the only thing that will keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I see several other people had this same reaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no matter how many people like it, obviously it&#x27;s not good for at least two of us.</li>
            <li> The smell of lavender is calming after a long day.</li>
            <li> This is strange because I&#x27;ve used a jar of this for a year now</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unbeknownst to me my mother did purchase both the daily moisturizer and the Ultimate Moisture night cream (based on my rave reviews to her of the previous formula), which she gave me (since she didn&#x27;t like it anyway).</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was the ultimate moisture cream, but received the other instead.</li>
            <li> I am currently trying a bevy of products one after the other in my quest.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has transformed my itchy, dry, fine-lined winter skin.</li>
            <li> A unique an unpleasant sensation no other product before or after has managed to produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the single bottle &amp; will continue to buy them in singles because it seems you&#x27;re getting a deal on 2 for a reason.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body cream, not face, and was surprised at how small the jars are.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t until I bought this second purchase online that I came across this odd mixture.</li>
            <li> As a consequence the office is very, very dry.  </li>
            <li> careful with this one</li>
            <li> And it would be a gross waste of my money to purchase either one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any product which was this extreme.</li>
            <li> They should have warnings on the label and now I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;ve changed their other products as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this in the evening but on an especially dry day, I will put this on before applying make-up.</li>
            <li> Like we need to glow in the dark or something?)</li>
            <li> you are a user of the late lamented Ultimate Night cream and have found any product that compares favorably please let me know.</li>
            <li> So my face and neck were not dried out even as the skin behind my ears was cracking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this reaction to another lotion, and was very disappointed that this product, which is cruelty free, all natural and affordable, had caused such a negative reaction.</li>
            <li> : my most recent order of this product came with a terrible discovery: it&#x27;s been reformulated.</li>
            <li> I was not lucky in buying this item.</li>
            <li> This past winter, the office air and the outside air was so dry that the skin behind my ears cracked.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick cream so it will keep your face hydrated even during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> This caused me to take a little longer to figure out</li>
            <li> Due to our extremely dry climate I would use approximately two 2 oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few months and just can&#x27;t seem to like it.</li>
            <li> thought it not possible, but the night cream was even worse.</li>
            <li> I used to have trouble remembering to wash my face at night, now that I have this night cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s some stiff mixture that you have to work at  </li>
            <li> The reason it took me so long to figure it out is that I had been using this moisturizer on my face and neck but had never thought to put it behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> I cannot find it anymore, so no more avalon for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years, but from this past delivery, I&#x27;ve found the cream consistancy is no longer&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li> Five minutes after I applied this lousy product, my face was as red as a devil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and heavy like a paste, not emollient at all.</li>
            <li> I will also add he product turned my face dangerously red and stung like an angry hornet.</li>
            <li> Keep using it for the past year.</li>
            <li> The cream is now heavy (pulls on my skin when I put it on) and greasy-feeling, makes my skin feel slightly burn-y, and smells just plain weird.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something thick and moisturizing for winter nights which didn&#x27;t break me out or contain parabens or petrochemicals.</li>
            <li> I am afraid I find both new products extremely, in a word, horrible.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have found Eden&#x27;s Secret Garden.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had somehow accidentally cut myself behind the ear</li>
            <li> have never written to a company to express my disappointment until now.</li>
            <li> I am trying it out but disappointed this was not as shown.</li>
            <li> I tried to rub this awful lotion off my face with a washcloth</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have put so many different kinds of products on my face in my life, most of them filled with harsh chemicals created in a lab somewhere, and I&#x27;ve NEVER had an allergic reaction to a single one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever had an allergic reaction to, which is ironic considering that it&#x27;s all natural, organic, and calls itself \\&quot;calming, and non-irritating.\\&quot;  My face is currently BEET red and burning hot with blisters.  I&#x27;ve washed the product off and taken a benadryl and trying to calm down with an ice pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reading these reviews I see several other people had this same reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Beware.</li>
            <li> the Avalon Lavender Night cream and the daily moisture cream is excellent, it helps with wrinkles and also very nourishing for the facial skin.  I have used these creams for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has transformed my itchy, dry, fine-lined winter skin. I don&#x27;t know why, but a week after I began using this product, my skin tone became more even, lines began fading, and--most importantly--my face feels great. I was so impressed that I emailed the company, too.</li>
            <li> ***ETA July 2013: my most recent order of this product came with a terrible discovery: it&#x27;s been reformulated. No longer rich and creamy, it is now watery. It does not moisturize deeply, at all. The fragrance of lavender is almost nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, it broke me out. So I am giving up on this product and looking for a replacement. This is the second time Avalon has cheapened a product, I won&#x27;t try any new Avalon products.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this as a night cream for about 6 months now, and I can say with certainty that it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: very high-quality ingredients, extremely good for the skin, feels great going on, smells lovely. Read the ingredient list, you will see a host of things that protect and repair your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If my skin is irritated that day, it will sometimes sting when I first apply it. Also, I can really only find it at a good price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found this 2-pack. I&#x27;ve put one in the fridge for maximum freshness.</li>
            <li> This cream is REALLY good for sensitive skin. However,the lavender is too strong for my taste. I am also not sure that such strong fragrance is a good choice for the sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial moisturiser and cannot be without it!I like it even more than initially due to the improvement i see in my skintone.....I&#x27;m on my 3rd tub now ,have 1 spare at home and have just ordered another 4 so there is no chance of running out as I cannot purchase it locally.I use it day and night and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks much fresher than in the past and with a healthy glow.No breakouts or irritation ,feels very calming and relaxing on my skin-my favourite moisturiser ever,a great price and  the most wonderful lavender smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about two years now and I really love it.  I lived in the Rockies where it is very arid so I needed something very moisturizing for every day.  It absorbs quickly but hydrates for hours and hours.  I love the lavender because it is very calming for the skin (as well as the mind).  I used to work in a health foods store and I would recommend this product to a lot of customers who said they needed something really hydrating and balancing.  Now that I live in in the Northeast I only need it in the winter and as a night cream.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review to let everyone know that although the product states that it is the ultimate moisture cream (and even has the picture for that), when you click on it to order you will see that it is ultimate night cream. I bought this product thinking it was the ultimate moisture cream, but received the other instead. Believe me, these are totally different creams. I am very allergic to the night cream, but the moisture cream worked great. It seems as if avalon has discontinued the moisture cream bc I cannot find it anymore, so no more avalon for me. The only reason I gave it three stars is bc Amazon was so great at working with me with the problem. I hope they get this changed so no one else will be tricked. I had to quickly wash it off and take benadryl the previous time I thought I had bought the cream by mistake and used it anyway. I made sure I got the right cream this time, so I thought, but I didn&#x27;t think to check the ending order. This is why some of the reviewers are saying the cream has a different consistency and such. It&#x27;s a totally different cream in a \\&quot;similar\\&quot; container.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after looking everywhere unsuccessfully for the avalon night cream for sensitive skin.  Amazon shows the correct packaging so I believed that is what I would receive.  I didn&#x27;t.  In no place were the words for sensitive skin. I tried the product last night and my skin seems fine today.  The wonderful lavender scent is missing from this product. However, can&#x27;t beat the price and the free shipping and the ingredients appear the same.</li>
            <li> I absolutely have to agree this previous reviews This is Rich, Rich soft Moisture!  I LoooooooooVE it! My skin feels soft, smooth and  Super Hydrated. I feel like I have found Eden&#x27;s Secret Garden.  Wow! I took a chance on this product since the review were great! I will definitely purchase it again.  Thank you Avalon Organics you are doing great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years, but from this past delivery, I&#x27;ve found the cream consistancy is no longer&lt;br /&gt;one that melts into your skin as a hydrating formula (like high-end creams), but rather one that is creamier to the extent that it sits on the skin.  In addition, it gets used up more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It was before a very unique 5 star formula, but now has changed.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Avalon Organics for years and really like all their products.&lt;br /&gt;It has a thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> I am using this cream for almost two years on and off - but I always come back to it, the texture is ultra soft and absorbs very quickly, leaving the skin plumped, fresh and with a lovely lavender scent. I apply every day in the morning, after shower and before bed. It&#x27;s wonderful under make-up. I also use as a hand cream,  as I experience a lot of dryness and after using a good exfoliation glove and the Avalon Organics Ultimate Moisture Cream, I am experiencing lessening of my age spots. You will not regret trying it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the face.  The only lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy for this moisture night cream.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on it but it just does not feel right?</li>
            <li> Received product very quickly which is always a \\&quot;+\\&quot;. I was looking for a body cream, not face, and was surprised at how small the jars are. I obviously didn&#x27;t read enough about the product. The initial smell reminds me of Calamine lotion but then is softens out and is quiet pleasant. Overall, I like the product. As I said, I wasn&#x27;t looking for a face cream, but what I use as a face cream now - Ponds - I&#x27;ll use for body and keep the Avalon for face.</li>
            <li> It is very good that this cream is fragrance-free and can be used both during the day and at night.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, my skin more sensitive to give me better protection, especially in the winter to give me better protection, like lavender Avalon</li>
            <li> I like very much this moisture leaves your skin soft and the smell is very good</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product unless you want your face to be red, burning and splotchy. Thanks a lot, Avalon Organics. Five minutes after I applied this lousy product, my face was as red as a devil. I tried to rub this awful lotion off my face with a washcloth but it had already soaked in. I had to put my face in ice water to give me some relief. You would think \\&quot;organic\\&quot; might mean mild or natural - don&#x27;t be fooled. This chemical nightmare needs a warning label.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Finally a reasonably price, not animal tested products that work, From a dry face to soft after one nights use.</li>
            <li> This creme is luxurious. It absorbs beautifully into your skin. The smell of lavender is calming after a long day. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time, and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This cream is very good for my dry skin,I use it as a daily cream as well .</li>
            <li> I work in an office with a very large bank of computers.  So the air conditioning is always on to keep the computers cool.  As a consequence the office is very, very dry.  This past winter, the office air and the outside air was so dry that the skin behind my ears cracked.  I thought I had somehow accidentally cut myself behind the ear but I could not figure out why.  It took me a day or two to figure out it was dryness.  The reason it took me so long to figure it out is that I had been using this moisturizer on my face and neck but had never thought to put it behind my ears.  So my face and neck were not dried out even as the skin behind my ears was cracking.  This caused me to take a little longer to figure out it was dryness that was cracking my behind-the-ear skin but it is also a testament to how well this moisturizer works.</li>
            <li> This is a new formulation and very different from the original.  It is not the smooth velvety texture I was used to.  The reason is Avalon moving to 100% organic labeling.  Kudos for them on that but it should state re-formulation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Avalon&#x27;s Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream for years and have absolutely loved it. Super light, goes right into the skin, no heavy feel, and that luxurious lavender aroma!  It was totally worth the slightly higher price than other moisturizers. Sadly enough, the last time I ordered it, the product had been drastically changed.  It&#x27;s now called \\&quot;Lavender Luminosity Night Cream\\&quot;, although it no longer has any lavender smell.  (Luminosity? What&#x27;s that? Like we need to glow in the dark or something?) The cream is now heavy (pulls on my skin when I put it on) and greasy-feeling, makes my skin feel slightly burn-y, and smells just plain weird.  The Avalon company did not respond to my email comments and complaints, but I was told by another distributor (not Amazon) that the new product is what Avalon is sending them now (the distributor didn&#x27;t even know it had been changed) in place of the Ultimate Moisture Cream.  Apparently Avalon is no longer making a day cream, only this loser night cream. I won&#x27;t buy it anymore (and probably nothing more at all from Avalon in light of their poor judgment and lack of customer service) and I recommend you don&#x27;t buy it either.</li>
            <li> I have used Avalon Organics shampoo, hair conditioner, body lotion for years so had a basic trust in their products.  I bought this night cream and my face became beet red right after using it.  It stings after washing off, using remedies to soothe and anti-allergens.  I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any product which was this extreme. They should have warnings on the label and now I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;ve changed their other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with this one no matter how many people like it, obviously it&#x27;s not good for at least two of us.</li>
            <li> People are right - this product isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  It&#x27;s not creamy at all.  It&#x27;s some stiff mixture that you have to work at  to get the skin to absorb.  I don&#x27;t reach a saturation point in that I can keep putting on more and more and I never reach that dewey, moisturized feeling and I have very normal skin.  I&#x27;m so weary of manufacturers that tweak a product and end up ruining it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few months and just can&#x27;t seem to like it. The effects are not terribly noticable. The smell is very nice. The density of the cream is the real issue for me. It&#x27;s thick and heavy like a paste, not emollient at all. It soaks in fine, but it&#x27;s so dry it pulls my skin with every swipe. I was looking for something thick and moisturizing for winter nights which didn&#x27;t break me out or contain parabens or petrochemicals. Unfortunately, this stuff just isn&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li> In what far stretch of the imagination can citrus oils be considered &#x27;hypoallerginic&#x27; and suitable for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual ingredients of this product are not listed on the website and are in fact entirely inappropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included also are many flower products, very allergenic.  I put a minute amount on my chin and was immediately burning over my entire face and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a happy mom.</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream so it will keep your face hydrated even during the dry winter months. I use this in the evening but on an especially dry day, I will put this on before applying make-up. My husband uses this as well and he has been happy with it!</li>
            <li> While I think this product would probably work great for those without an allergy to it&#x27;s ingredients, I had a negative experience with it. Within minutes of putting it on, my face broke out in splotchy red rashes that burned and tingled. I&#x27;ve never had this reaction to another lotion, and was very disappointed that this product, which is cruelty free, all natural and affordable, had caused such a negative reaction. It may work great for those who aren&#x27;t allergic to the ingredients, but it seems as though several other reviewers have experienced the same problem.</li>
            <li> This is very good. Though the smell is not what I like, but the condition is very good. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> THEN: I used Avalon Organics Ultimate Moisture cream for over 10 years. It is the only product that really moisturized my skin here in the Rocky Mountains with nearly 350 days a year of unrelenting sunshine and wind at 8,000 feet above sea level. The original cream was a lovely and rich (without being heavy) cream that gave my skin a remarkable and noticeable glow often commented on by others. Fine lines were kept at bay, my face was never shiny or dry. Due to our extremely dry climate I would use approximately two 2 oz. containers a month. When I traveled to hot and tropical climates the amazing effect was an actual lessening of oiliness. I am at times prone to breakouts and this product never caused any. I would keep some in my purse to apply under my eyes once or twice during the day, and the effect was always a brightening lift of any appearance of fatigue, youth in a jar. No other cream (including several quite expensive ones) had ever been so remarkable. It was a quick to soak in, frothy souffle of intense moisture but with a feather light feel on the skin. I run out of adjectives trying to describe how perfect this cream was. I never broke out and my face felt and looked dewy and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW: The name and formula have both changed. If you purchase from this page you will be receiving \\&quot;Lavender Luminosity\\&quot; night cream instead. When I went to make a recent online purchase I saw more than one review of the product stating that if you had previously enjoyed this product to now beware. The new formula was an entirely different product and had suffered at the hand of the new \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot; formula. I note the company does not say what becomes \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot;. I am inclined to believe it has more to to with their cash flow and less to do with the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found a store I could test the new formula. I left without making a purchase because I found both the daily moisturizer and the night moisturizer, completely different products from their former selves. If this were an improvement I would have undoubtedly purchased in bulk. I am afraid I find both new products extremely, in a word, horrible. And it would be a gross waste of my money to purchase either one. I will also add he product turned my face dangerously red and stung like an angry hornet. A unique an unpleasant sensation no other product before or after has managed to produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbeknownst to me my mother did purchase both the daily moisturizer and the Ultimate Moisture night cream (based on my rave reviews to her of the previous formula), which she gave me (since she didn&#x27;t like it anyway). Braving a potentially hostile skin reaction, I wore the daily moisturizer for two days, and each day it felt like such a relief to wash my face. It leaves a completely unnatural \\&quot;mask\\&quot; like layer on top of the skin without actually sinking in or moisturizing in any way. It feels like a layer of plastic saran wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it not possible, but the night cream was even worse. It reminded me of some margarine I purchased during an extended stay in a third-world country once. I tried to melt it in a skillet and it never melted, even at very hot temperatures. It would never spread with any fluidity, nor would it soak in to any food item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lament the new night cream feels just as cheap and ineffectually formulated as third-world margarine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written to a company to express my disappointment until now. I wrote Avalon Organics to express to them my disillusionment with their new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; product. They have chosen not to reply or acknowledge my letter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is with a heavy heart that I find I must change my decade long and loyal romance with Avalon Organics to someone else. I am currently trying a bevy of products one after the other in my quest. None are as perfect as the one solitary jar I have left of the original formula \\&quot;Ultimate Moisture Cream\\&quot;. Good title that one, \\&quot;ultimate\\&quot; is absolutely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a user of the late lamented Ultimate Night cream and have found any product that compares favorably please let me know.mate\\&quot; is absolutely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a user of the late lamented Ultimate Night cream and have found any product that compares favorably please let me know.</li>
            <li> Love this product for dry climates.  Keeps my skin moisturized and even glows when I wake up.  Best price here too.</li>
            <li> This cream is kind of thick but it seem to improves the texture of my skin after I use it. I apply it at night. after I use Avalon Exfoliating scrub. Of course I only use the scrub 3X per week but I use the cream almost every night. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 months&lt;br /&gt;now.......I will let you know when all my wrinkles disapear.LOL</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this moisturizer. This stuff has been a miracle for my skin. It&#x27;s recommended as a night cream but I use it as a day cream in the winter. My skin gets so dry during the winter that it&#x27;s the only thing that will keep it moisturized. I also have acne prone skin, so finding a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t bother my acne is difficult. This cream seems to have nearly eliminated my break outs. This moisturizer has been a godsend!</li>
            <li> I was not lucky in buying this item. The cream itself is more of a stiff consistency and it made me break out. This is strange because I&#x27;ve used a jar of this for a year now and it wasn&#x27;t until I bought this second purchase online that I came across this odd mixture. I bought the single bottle &amp; will continue to buy them in singles because it seems you&#x27;re getting a deal on 2 for a reason. I&#x27;m thinking they might have a stock of old creams that they&#x27;re trying to get rid of...</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the Ultimate Moisture Cream which I have used for years and love.  I was surprised to receive the Ultimate Night Cream which is a much heavier consistency.  I am trying it out but disappointed this was not as shown.</li>
            <li> I love this. I used to have trouble remembering to wash my face at night, now that I have this night cream I haven&#x27;t missed a night! I love the smell and feel of this lotion. The fact that it is organic makes this a must have. I love falling asleep to the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li> This night cream is a non-greasy, fresh smelling way to moisturize your skin.  I use it daily, and sometimes use it as an under make-up moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I just love it. Keep using it for the past year. No plan on changing to anything else. Organic. Lavender. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer daily, both night and day. It moisturizes without feeling greasy and has a pleasant, subtle aroma. An added bonus is the container which allows you to use every bit of product with no waste.</li>
            <li> The light texture and luxurious feel without greasiness on my face was a major selling point of the old Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream, but I might have been able to do without that pleasant experience if the (all natural essential oil) lavender scent remained.  Because THAT&#x27;S what made me actually put the cr&amp;egrave;me on my face at night.  Oh sad, sad day--the beautiful aromatherapy is gone in this inferior \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; product!  This cream is okay, but it no longer has ANY of the features that made me love the old formula.  I need a waaaambulance!  I want to cry myself to sleep because I just can&#x27;t stand the thought of buying it anymore.  Unless and until they bring back the old formula.  (Hint, hint, Avalon Organics.)  If you loved the old Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream for the same reasons, don&#x27;t waste your money on this lesser, ho-hum cream that feels heavier to apply and wear, and barely even smells good.</li>
