    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Over all excellent product and service.</li>
            <li>Just as good as namebrand!</li>
            <li>Good product, excellent price.</li>
            <li>It works great for me</li>
            <li>Just what we needed at a good price</li>
            <li>while I can&#x27;t know whether it is doing as good a job as Muro, I don&#x27;t see any difference in the two.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product but the advertising inaccuracy turned me off.</li>
            <li>Love the pricing!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works fine, but the metal tube isn&#x27;t a great container.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they used plastic tubes like toothpaste has switched to that don&#x27;t crumple permanently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others, but this one is by far the very best.  </li>
            <li>a way better deal</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;Later,&lt;br /&gt;J</li>
            <li>Better than the Bausch &amp; Lomb version of this ointment.  </li>
            <li>AT CHEAP PRICE</li>
            <li>I have been using this medication for over 3 years now, and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>I feel I am finally getting my money&#x27;s worth, and the product is a great product.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, packaged well, priced competitively, will use this seller again.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, but when I received the package the box was pretty much destroyed and the tube was severely dented and dinged</li>
            <li>They look and feel the same, so I am ordering more.</li>
            <li>Arrived a little early, which is great.</li>
            <li>I recommend this very highly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know there was a generic version of Muro 128 ointment until Muro wasn&#x27;t available for a time.  </li>
            <li>He is almost 15 years old and, because of his age, we do not want to do an invasive procedure.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t mess with success.</li>
            <li>This medicine is used daily in my Golden Retriever who has a chronic corneal ulcer, typical of this breed.</li>

            <li> Same as expensive kind, but half the price</li>
            <li> Exact same medicine given to us by our dog&#x27;s ophthalmologist to slow his endothelial cornea</li>

            <li> I have a dry eye condition and need to use an eye ointment every evening.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry eyes.</li>
            <li> After you squeeze the tube, no matter how carefully, ointment continues to ooze out.</li>
            <li> Will not bother with any other brand ever again.  </li>
            <li> It wastes medicine and makes a mess out of the lid.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not entirely sure it was still sealed, so I bought another one at the store.</li>
            <li> The difference between the two is hardly perceivable.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what we needed at a good price</li>
            <li> My mother used this, she likes it!  Love the pricing!  Packaged well.  Over all excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> I just purchase this through her for my dog and it&#x27;s a way better deal then if I buy it at my vet.</li>
            <li> ummmm I use all the time</li>
            <li> Buying From Amazon is saving my over half from the local big box store. I have been using this product for several years now on a daily basis. It works great for me</li>
            <li> Came quickly, packaged well, priced competitively, will use this seller again.  I have a dry eye condition and need to use an eye ointment every evening.  I&#x27;ve tried many others, but this one is by far the very best.  Will not bother with any other brand ever again.  Won&#x27;t mess with success.</li>
            <li> Exact same medicine given to us by our dog&#x27;s ophthalmologist to slow his endothelial cornea degeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works fine, but the metal tube isn&#x27;t a great container. After you squeeze the tube, no matter how carefully, ointment continues to ooze out. It wastes medicine and makes a mess out of the lid. It would be nice if they used plastic tubes like toothpaste has switched to that don&#x27;t crumple permanently.</li>
            <li> I use this ointment every nite per my doctor&#x27;s orders.  It  keeps my eyes moist thru the nite.  I have really dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Just as good as namebrand!</li>
            <li> I use this brand all the time and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I use this for my dog.  Since using this, Ariel has not had an ulcer or blisters in her remaining eye.  I recommend this very highly.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dog&#x27;s opthomology vet.  I put it in my dog&#x27;s eyes to prevent ulcers on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know there was a generic version of Muro 128 ointment until Muro wasn&#x27;t available for a time.  I found this product and, while I can&#x27;t know whether it is doing as good a job as Muro, I don&#x27;t see any difference in the two.  They look and feel the same, so I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB AT CHEAP PRICE</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and says it does not work as well as Bausch and Lombs Muro-128.</li>
            <li> This medicine is used daily in my Golden Retriever who has a chronic corneal ulcer, typical of this breed. It has avoided an invasive surgery in my dog&#x27;s eye. He is almost 15 years old and, because of his age, we do not want to do an invasive procedure. I have been using this medication for over 3 years now, and so far, so good. BTW, it was prescribed by a veterinary who specialize in ophthalmology.</li>
            <li> This is the same bottle that I get at the pharmacy in our town and nearby towns for anywhere from $18.00 to $23.00.  I feel I am finally getting my money&#x27;s worth, and the product is a great product.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered...for my Buster Dog</li>
            <li> These are incorrectly advertised.  You only get 2 tubes instead of 3.  It is a good product but the advertising inaccuracy turned me off.</li>
            <li> Arrived a little early, which is great.</li>
            <li> Good product, excellent price.</li>
            <li> I have used well over 50 tubes of the B&amp;L version and find this to be easier to apply.  The difference between the two is hardly perceivable.  Same stuff cheaper price.  If you use Mura 128 give this stuff a try.  You will be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;Later,&lt;br /&gt;J</li>
            <li> Better than the Bausch &amp; Lomb version of this ointment.  I wish we&#x27;d known about the Akorn product years ago!</li>
            <li> I love the product, but when I received the package the box was pretty much destroyed and the tube was severely dented and dinged and I&#x27;m not entirely sure it was still sealed, so I bought another one at the store.</li>
            <li> Same as expensive kind, but half the price</li>
