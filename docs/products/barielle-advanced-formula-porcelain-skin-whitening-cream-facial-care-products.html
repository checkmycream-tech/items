            <li>It works ok but not as well as I was expecting.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this skin whitening cream, used it for a couple of weeks, didn&#x27;t see any visible result, so I&#x27;m not gonna use it again. I think it&#x27;s waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m strawberry blonde, very fair skin and freckles. I love my alabaster complexion and got this cream hoping it would lighten my freckles, even out pinkinsh tones and maybe lighten my dark undereye area some. I have been using the lotion about a month.  It did not cause acne (which I can be prone to with many creams) and it worked as a general day cream...but alas It has not lived up to its promises as a skin whitening cream. Maybe it&#x27;s just me and someone with different skin type may have better luck. I will finish using it as a regular lotion but not purchase again...and the hunt continues...</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great results. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The best on the market</li>
            <li> I am a 52 yr. old female and have tried everything under the sun from high end to this for undereye darkness. This is truely amazing and I love it. I have recommended it to several of my frinds whom as well, love it.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! My face looks so smooth!</li>
            <li> I have to give it just 2 stars so far since I have yet to see any improvements in dark spots.  I will continue to monitor and report back later.</li>
            <li> Works great! I don&#x27;t write positive reviews, but this time I would like to say that it works!!!! Thanks! People give me compliments about my skin!</li>
            <li> Super product...just have to use it routinely</li>
            <li> I love this lotion skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple weeks now. I&#x27;ve used it on scars, stretch marks, freckles, and dark acne spots. I can maybe tell a slight difference, but not enough that I would buy the product again. I did use it as directed, but used quite a bit on each place I put it. I&#x27;m not a fan of the ingredient list either. However, I do not regret trying it, especially since the price is affordable.</li>
            <li> Crap product. Feels like I&#x27;m rubbing glue into my skins</li>
            <li> this works for me, The only cream that does.</li>
            <li> This cream is the only one to fade the spots on my arms and hands and I have tried everything else. It is easy to use, I only used a dab twice a day and within a week those pesky spots were almost gone. I love this brand and I am glad it is available on Amazon as it is difficult to find elsewhere. The foot cream is fab. I am delighted with the results of this Barielle skin cream.  Try it...you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try to lighten age spots.  It works ok but not as well as I was expecting.  I use it twice a day and the lightening just is not happening as much as I wanted.</li>
            <li> After two weeks applying morning and evening I still can&#x27;t see the difference</li>
            <li> Excelent quality, it really fulfilled my expectations, It was a good start with this company&#x27;s products. I will consider them for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product on my face for about 1 week now. The box recommends twice daily ( morning and night) but I have only used it once a day. Just until my skin adapts to it. I&#x27;m using it on my face ( acne scars and sun spots) and they haven&#x27;t diminished as of yet but the skin around it seems to be clearing up nicely. Hoping to see better results in 2 or 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products out there for your skin. It makes your skin, just what it states, porcelain like and bright. I have been using this for a few years. It takes away age spots, blemishes and any discoloration. I even use it on my hands. I am a horse and dog loving person. And when working with the animals I get a few allergic reactions from their dander. This clears it up over night.  I do not bake in the sun, because I like the look of the porcelain skin. I am on the older side. And my skin is just beautiful. Thank you Barielle. THIS IS THE BEST.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream as a present and I have not delivered yet, so I can not say anything about it, but the reviews reveals that it is a good product and my relative is very anxious to receive it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK product. I&#x27;ve found better and quicker results. But this product does its job, just slowly. I would buy it again but only if I couldn&#x27;t purchase anything else</li>
