            <li>so far, so good</li>
            <li>This product is very useful now for all my hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Nice design, although the magnets don&#x27;t hold as well if the pockets are full, but is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>So worth the price!</li>
            <li>and it is easily accessible.  </li>
            <li>Fits lots of makeup and costume accessories in a easily accessible case.  </li>
            <li>Came fast and love everything about this bag.</li>
            <li>It would be cool if that clipped on and off.  </li>
            <li>I have filled this bag full and its not uncomfortable at all to carry around.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I needed a lighter weight large toiletry bag for a long international trip, and this bag fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>the clear material is perfect to find things quickly (or to avoid having someone else rifle through my bag to find what I need) and its heavy duty and washable.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Shoulder strap is useful when hauling stuff around.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Love the fact that this bag is clear, makes for finding things a lot easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large and sturdy!</li>
            <li>Easy to locate everything since it is completely see-thru.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of pockets and everything is easy to find, since it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>This bag is huge and clear so everyone can find everything.</li>
            <li>the clear bag makes things easier to see and is still pretty light when it has make up in it.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WAT</li>
            <li>It is not a double zipper, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Very durable and useful for set work</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Loved all the outside pockets, the short handles and the shoulder strap.</li>
            <li>After much searching, and trying various containers, I love this bag--not for cosmetics--but for watercolor painting supplies.</li>
            <li>what i love most about this products is that it has at least 6 pockets... plus the tissue holder and some compartment inside..</li>
            <li>I can easily see where I have tucked various supplies without digging through canvas bags, etc.</li>
            <li>Also, it is terrific for outdoor painting, because I can carry it easily over my shoulder or by the handles.</li>
            <li>Very practical, very fashion forward;-)</li>
            <li>And it is large, so check the dimensions.</li>
            <li>Very durable.  </li>
            <li>the fact that this bag is transparent, and fits absolutely everything, including having the hairspray bottles standing upright..</li>
            <li>so much so, that once i posted it on my timeline, now all the cheer moms want one and will be getting it.</li>
            <li>Basically I fill them with anything that will either leak or that I need fast and findable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with quality of this bag.</li>
            <li>Makes getting ready so much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like this bag ...</li>
            <li>I NEEDED THANKS.</li>
            <li>this delivery people &amp;#34;USPS&amp;#34; or so need to be more careful.</li>
            <li>Holds tons of makeup in a very organized way.</li>
            <li>No need to turn out the whole bag every time you are looking for something.</li>
            <li>Both are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I really like that I can organize so many smaller items in the outside pockets.  </li>
            <li>The main area hold three.</li>
            <li>Only criticism would be that the full size pencils and brushes do not fit into the outside pockets easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Outside pockets are handy for carrying things you need to get to frequently, without digging through the entire contents; there is a flap on each one closed with a snapper, but would not be ok for smaller contents because it is not a secure closure, larger things that won&#x27;t slip out during travel would be</li>
            <li>If for personal use, I think this bag is a quite large.</li>
            <li>The side pocket is large enough to place folded tracing and transfer paper when traveling to workshops and painting classes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have another travel bag large enough to put it in, so the clear cosmetic bag is held separately when we travel.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a clear makeup bag this is it.</li>
            <li>I was using a clear tote bag before, but even though it was clear still had to move things around to find</li>
            <li>they say to busy..</li>
            <li>The only drawback she sees is obviously others can see right through in case you have some unmentionables in the bag.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my long vacation!</li>
            <li>We strive hard to ensure every single person is satisfied with their purchase!</li>
            <li>My one criticism is the lack of double zipperheads on the main compartment zipper.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this bag, but wish it came in a slightly smaller size.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s going to fit everything I need to take with me on makeup artist jobs</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>although it could get heavy once its full..</li>
            <li>Double zipperheads are needed in a bag such as this - which is large and intended for for constant use.</li>
            <li>I had to get something to put my makeup in to make it portable, as my 10 year old daughter was constantly getting into my makeup, so I have to keep it out of the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Also, there are 2 full-length pockets inside, one with a zipper!  </li>
            <li>High quality, heavy duty plastic bag with strong stitching and heavy duty handles and snaps!</li>
            <li>Adding more bags was making it worse because at every hotel someone would stuff something in a different bag.</li>
            <li>When I have a big job I fill ithem with my extra z and refilled eye palettes a roll of paper towels and fill the pockets with my brush spray and any general mixing mediums.</li>
            <li>Not only does it look odd, but it also weighs one end of the bag down more than the other, so that carrying is off balance.</li>

            <li> what i love most about this products is that it has at least 6 pockets... plus the tissue holder and some compartment inside..</li>
            <li> I can easily see where I have tucked various supplies without digging through canvas bags, etc.</li>
            <li> Also, it is terrific for outdoor painting, because I can carry it easily over my shoulder or by the handles.</li>
            <li> Very practical, very fashion forward;-)</li>
            <li> And it is large, so check the dimensions.</li>
            <li> Very durable.  </li>
            <li> the fact that this bag is transparent, and fits absolutely everything, including having the hairspray bottles standing upright..</li>
            <li> so much so, that once i posted it on my timeline, now all the cheer moms want one and will be getting it.</li>
            <li> Basically I fill them with anything that will either leak or that I need fast and findable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with quality of this bag.</li>
            <li> Makes getting ready so much easier.</li>
            <li> I really like this bag ...</li>
            <li> I NEEDED THANKS.</li>
            <li> this delivery people &amp;#34;USPS&amp;#34; or so need to be more careful.</li>
            <li> Holds tons of makeup in a very organized way.</li>
            <li> No need to turn out the whole bag every time you are looking for something.</li>
            <li> Both are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can organize so many smaller items in the outside pockets.  </li>
            <li> The main area hold three.</li>
            <li> Only criticism would be that the full size pencils and brushes do not fit into the outside pockets easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Outside pockets are handy for carrying things you need to get to frequently, without digging through the entire contents; there is a flap on each one closed with a snapper, but would not be ok for smaller contents because it is not a secure closure, larger things that won&#x27;t slip out during travel would be</li>
            <li> If for personal use, I think this bag is a quite large.</li>
            <li> The side pocket is large enough to place folded tracing and transfer paper when traveling to workshops and painting classes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have another travel bag large enough to put it in, so the clear cosmetic bag is held separately when we travel.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a clear makeup bag this is it.</li>
            <li> I was using a clear tote bag before, but even though it was clear still had to move things around to find</li>
            <li> they say to busy..</li>
            <li> The only drawback she sees is obviously others can see right through in case you have some unmentionables in the bag.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my long vacation!</li>
            <li> We strive hard to ensure every single person is satisfied with their purchase!</li>
            <li> My one criticism is the lack of double zipperheads on the main compartment zipper.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bag, but wish it came in a slightly smaller size.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s going to fit everything I need to take with me on makeup artist jobs</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> although it could get heavy once its full..</li>
            <li> Double zipperheads are needed in a bag such as this - which is large and intended for for constant use.</li>
            <li> I had to get something to put my makeup in to make it portable, as my 10 year old daughter was constantly getting into my makeup, so I have to keep it out of the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Also, there are 2 full-length pockets inside, one with a zipper!  </li>
            <li> High quality, heavy duty plastic bag with strong stitching and heavy duty handles and snaps!</li>
            <li> Adding more bags was making it worse because at every hotel someone would stuff something in a different bag.</li>
            <li> When I have a big job I fill ithem with my extra z and refilled eye palettes a roll of paper towels and fill the pockets with my brush spray and any general mixing mediums.</li>
            <li> Not only does it look odd, but it also weighs one end of the bag down more than the other, so that carrying is off balance.</li>
            <li> It is too big for a tiny hotel counter, but is sturdy enough to use from the floor or toilet.</li>
            <li> Love magnetic snaps on front and think they will be less likely to wear poorly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of a heavy duty industrial plastic and the main compartment zipper is industrial material as well.</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected</li>
            <li> I work in an Amazon Fulfillment center and are required to go through security checks daily.</li>
            <li> We are taking a long road trip and I felt like I wouldn&#x27;t know where my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; was in our van...got this</li>
            <li> The size is extra wide.</li>
            <li> 3 on each long side.</li>
            <li> This bag is bigger than I expected!</li>
            <li> Just a little heavy even empty but not so much to keep me from buying it again.</li>
            <li> but hey, for the price I guess I should have expected that.</li>
            <li> It kept me extremely  organized .</li>
            <li> The plastic is thick enough that I can use the bag for other things beside make up.</li>
            <li> I can see everything and don&#x27;t have to dig around a dark bag or case looking for things I need.</li>
            <li> Has 2 small handle to carry by hand and a long strap to carry over shoulder.</li>
            <li> This is made out of thick heavy gauge plastic and it is definitely durable.</li>
            <li> even if its not full yet.. not to mention it doesnt have a shoulder strap</li>
            <li> bag is nice but came with two snaps broken on it :(</li>
            <li> The pocket cover flaps are still pretty rigid after a month&#x27;s use, but not too annoying overall.</li>
            <li> I will have to change a few things around so that the contents of that pocket are lighter.  </li>
            <li> I use this bag everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using them for make up, um using them for everyday.</li>
            <li> and i dont have the funds yet to get a rolling one.. and the aluminum traincase that i have is just too heavy for me..</li>
            <li> I like the inside pocket that can hold my mixing palettes and a small color wheel.  </li>
            <li> When I have a small job it will hold my brushes (I am a brush addict) and all that I need for that job.</li>
            <li> Everyone puts stuff back in the wrong place, but doesn&#x27;t matter because I can see it all.  </li>
            <li> I got this product bag for my small Makeup gig to put my stuff on..</li>
            <li> I did not like this for cosmetics; the plastic is so stiff that it&#x27;s hard to see what&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed with the quality of the material</li>
            <li> omg it&#x27;s insane.</li>

            <li> Very durable.  Lots of great compartments.  Love magnetic snaps on front and think they will be less likely to wear poorly.  Nice leather handles for hand carry straps.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this bag!! my daughter is a cheerleader. having to carry all the paraphernalia needed to do her poofs and curls.. omg it&#x27;s insane. the fact that this bag is transparent, and fits absolutely everything, including having the hairspray bottles standing upright.. it&#x27;s perfect, perfect, perfect. so much so, that once i posted it on my timeline, now all the cheer moms want one and will be getting it. i say where is my commission?  ha ha ha...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my trip to the UK. I was so glad I did. It kept me extremely  organized . Even the security at the Airlines complimented me on the bag . It was so easy to pack . It has so many compartments.  This is the best travel bag I have ever owned. I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Great bag I&#x27;m using it for waxing. I can fit all my waxing stuff in here and carry it around to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Came fast and love everything about this bag. So worth the price! For off site jobs it&#x27;s a must!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this bag and have two. When I have a big job I fill ithem with my extra z and refilled eye palettes a roll of paper towels and fill the pockets with my brush spray and any general mixing mediums. Basically I fill them with anything that will either leak or that I need fast and findable.  I like the inside pocket that can hold my mixing palettes and a small color wheel.  The main area hold three. MAC brush canisters as well with a roll of paper towels and a big bag of lashes.  It is also sturdier and thicker than it looks.  The zippers to close up the tissue or wipes pocket is awesome and the snaps stay closed.  When I have a small job it will hold my brushes (I am a brush addict) and all that I need for that job.</li>
            <li> hold ups very nice with all of my makeup and tools</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with quality of this bag. Doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheezy at all. Nice!!! Smaller than what I expected but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this bag for freelance makeup jobs. I can see everything and don&#x27;t have to dig around a dark bag or case looking for things I need. Just what I was hoping it would be. Feels like great quality to! Love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and quick delivery!!!</li>
            <li> Great for on set makeup touch ups! Easy to locate everything since it is completely see-thru. The handles are sturdy and I love the tissue dispenser :)</li>
            <li> I thought this thing would be bigger. Not sure if it&#x27;s going to fit everything I need to take with me on makeup artist jobs but we&#x27;ll see. A little disappointed with the quality of the material but hey, for the price I guess I should have expected that. It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> I work in an Amazon Fulfillment center and are required to go through security checks daily. I absolutely love this bag! I carry many items with me and they are able to see them easily which helps me go through with no problems. I would recommend this to anyone! Also, I received this item very quickly. Makes me proud to work for a company that is customer driven. We strive hard to ensure every single person is satisfied with their purchase!</li>
            <li> Bag was bought for a beginning stylist to get organized. Worked beautifully!</li>
            <li> bag is nice but came with two snaps broken on it :(</li>
            <li> I USED THIS FOR MY DAUGHTERS DANCE COMPETITION AND IT IS SO GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WHERE EVERYTHING IS!!</li>
            <li> Great quality bag.  I love having all of my make up items visible and organized.  Makes getting ready so much easier.</li>
            <li> Best seller and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> We are taking a long road trip and I felt like I wouldn&#x27;t know where my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; was in our van...got this and already I feel the peace of mind...I see everything and it is easily accessible.  Grab it and go into hotel/motel situation knowing what I need is at my fingertips....so far, so good</li>
            <li> I needed a lighter weight large toiletry bag for a long international trip, and this bag fit the bill perfectly. A well made quality product with lots of room and many nice pockets for organization.</li>
            <li> Nice bag love it . I put all my makeup is in one place, thank you</li>
            <li> I really like this bag ... the materials and workmanship are top notch!  I really like that I can organize so many smaller items in the outside pockets.  Also, there are 2 full-length pockets inside, one with a zipper!  The ONLY con to this bag is having an end pocket only on one end of the bag.  Not only does it look odd, but it also weighs one end of the bag down more than the other, so that carrying is off balance. And it is the only extended-height exterior pocket.  I will have to change a few things around so that the contents of that pocket are lighter.  Other than this one con, it&#x27;s the perfect bag!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this bag. The plastic is thick enough that I can use the bag for other things beside make up. The size is extra wide. Would recommend this bag.</li>
            <li> Yes, I LOVE THIS BAG!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in love with this bag ! i know i would have loved this over a metal make up train case. the clear bag makes things easier to see and is still pretty light when it has make up in it.</li>
            <li> so whoever distributed the mail for that day put my mail in another persons apartment instead of my house, but 2days after i got it from the owner of the house. we thank God. the bag was as displayed on the website and EXACTLY WAT I NEEDED THANKS. this delivery people &amp;#34;USPS&amp;#34; or so need to be more careful.</li>
            <li> great for traveling,  goes through TSA  no problems.</li>
            <li> perfect set bag for my costuming and wardrobe stuff on film sets. the clear material is perfect to find things quickly (or to avoid having someone else rifle through my bag to find what I need) and its heavy duty and washable. I have filled this bag full and its not uncomfortable at all to carry around. I am super rough with my set bags and this has held up wonderfully. I am getting more for each member of my crew!</li>
            <li> Large and sturdy! Holds all my make up and airbrushes!</li>
            <li> If for personal use, I think this bag is a quite large. I had to get something to put my makeup in to make it portable, as my 10 year old daughter was constantly getting into my makeup, so I have to keep it out of the bathroom. It has plenty of pockets and everything is easy to find, since it&#x27;s clear. The pocket cover flaps are still pretty rigid after a month&#x27;s use, but not too annoying overall. I highly recommend this bag, but wish it came in a slightly smaller size.</li>
            <li> This bag is the perfect size to fit essential products on the go. It&#x27;s made of a heavy duty industrial plastic and the main compartment zipper is industrial material as well. It is not a double zipper, but that&#x27;s okay. Very durable and useful for set work and the weight is evenly distributed once all my products are stored within the bag. This bag is bigger than I expected! Perfect for a makeup artist and hairstylist working on set. Oh and I received my bag in the mail  very quickly! A must have !</li>
            <li> Loved all the outside pockets, the short handles and the shoulder strap. Easy to find what you need. Just a little heavy even empty but not so much to keep me from buying it again. Holds tons of makeup in a very organized way. Great idea with the two end pockets being taller... For combs, brushes and tall bottles, etc.</li>
            <li> Nice design, although the magnets don&#x27;t hold as well if the pockets are full, but is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Bought this bag for hair supplies. Fits my blow dryer, mirrors, ect. Larger that I thought it was but it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product is very useful now for all my hair dryers. Good product!</li>
            <li> My wife love this bag, and at a fraction of the price of most cosmetic bags.  The quality is good.  The only drawback she sees is obviously others can see right through in case you have some unmentionables in the bag.  But these days, who cares anyway?</li>
            <li> Love this bag...No one else does.. they say to busy..you can see eveything in it.. so can a thief..Also bag much bigger than I though..</li>
            <li> High quality, heavy duty plastic bag with strong stitching and heavy duty handles and snaps! Perfect for lots of travel and the pockets are nice and deep, great for organizing!  Love this bag!</li>
            <li> I did not like this for cosmetics; the plastic is so stiff that it&#x27;s hard to see what&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> Perfect for vacation!!!</li>
            <li> After much searching, and trying various containers, I love this bag--not for cosmetics--but for watercolor painting supplies. I can easily see where I have tucked various supplies without digging through canvas bags, etc. The side pocket is large enough to place folded tracing and transfer paper when traveling to workshops and painting classes. Also, it is terrific for outdoor painting, because I can carry it easily over my shoulder or by the handles. It is lightweight and strong. A very worthwhile purchase--I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a clear makeup bag this is it. This is made out of thick heavy gauge plastic and it is definitely durable. This one will last.</li>
            <li> We travel a lot, having a transparent bag make it convenient to see at a glance where your items are. No need to turn out the whole bag every time you are looking for something. No need to unpack on a short stay, you can find everything so easily.&lt;br /&gt;Outside pockets are handy for carrying things you need to get to frequently, without digging through the entire contents; there is a flap on each one closed with a snapper, but would not be ok for smaller contents because it is not a secure closure, larger things that won&#x27;t slip out during travel would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;The bag is roomy, can hold quite a bit. Shoulder strap is useful when hauling stuff around.&lt;br /&gt;Also makes a great beach bag, pockets are very handy for all your beach needs.</li>
            <li> Love this bag. I was using a clear tote bag before, but even though it was clear still had to move things around to find/get what I needed. This has 7 outside compartments. 3 on each long side. And 1 on on short side, which is perfect for brush &amp; comb. Has 2 small handle to carry by hand and a long strap to carry over shoulder. Both are very sturdy. The bag is sturdy. And there is a lot of room on the inside. I use this bag everyday. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this bag.  Roomy and visible!</li>
            <li> Thought the wife would use it- - no dice, so their it sits in her closet.</li>
            <li> This bag is sturdily constructed and does not generate static electricity.  My one criticism is the lack of double zipperheads on the main compartment zipper.  Double zipperheads are needed in a bag such as this - which is large and intended for for constant use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, housewife doing spring cleaning , did,tknow i had so many place to store makeup, handbags, bags, boxes even in dresser draws, now i have one goeguse place to put my make up love it</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, quality made, lots of pockets, spacious good sized bag</li>
            <li> You can put all your extras in there and then put it in your suitcase.  Nice to see through and it carries more than I need.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! Arrived quickly. Item as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fits lots of makeup and costume accessories in a easily accessible case.  Easy wipe-down material and sturdy construction.  Only criticism would be that the full size pencils and brushes do not fit into the outside pockets easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my long vacation! Better than I expected it to be. Holds a ton of stuff!!</li>
            <li> Love this! I&#x27;m using for family toiletries in trips. Between my husband, two sons and myself our toiletries were becoming a pain. Adding more bags was making it worse because at every hotel someone would stuff something in a different bag. We share the same hotel room and there often is not enough counter space for multiple bags. This bag is huge and clear so everyone can find everything. Everyone puts stuff back in the wrong place, but doesn&#x27;t matter because I can see it all.  It is too big for a tiny hotel counter, but is sturdy enough to use from the floor or toilet. It doesn&#x27;t flop around. I&#x27;m sure it has other awesome applications, but that&#x27;s why I got it and it has worked great! Only criticism is the strap doesn&#x27;t detach and the strap is substantial. It would be cool if that clipped on and off.  And it is large, so check the dimensions. I don&#x27;t have another travel bag large enough to put it in, so the clear cosmetic bag is held separately when we travel. Since it is see-through that could be an issue for some people in some situations (there is no toiletry privacy). For us it is just what the traveler ordered!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;m not using them for make up, um using them for everyday. Very practical, very fashion forward;-)</li>
            <li> Very nice and a good service</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this bag is clear, makes for finding things a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I over looked was the size of this bag. It&#x27;s a big bag!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product.. I got this product bag for my small Makeup gig to put my stuff on.. I am a starting makeup artist and i dont have the funds yet to get a rolling one.. and the aluminum traincase that i have is just too heavy for me.. even if its not full yet.. not to mention it doesnt have a shoulder strap.. this is why i love this bag.. although it could get heavy once its full.. but because there&#x27;s a shoulder strap its not a biggie to carry it around.. what i love most about this products is that it has at least 6 pockets... plus the tissue holder and some compartment inside..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really love love love this bag.. i would buy a rolling case in the future but i would still use it... :D</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Will work great for my makeup kit storage. Separate compartments help keep my things organized.</li>
            <li> Superior bag for traveling.  Love to put my makeup in it when traveling.</li>
