            <li>I LOVE this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>I love jwow!</li>
            <li>Good for my tattoos and smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing..</li>
            <li>The lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>the color of my tan is amazing...</li>
            <li>Smells great, my skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>and it smells absolutely ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It is a really great bronzer that is lightly scented.</li>
            <li>smells amazing and no after tan smell</li>
            <li>And Amazon has an amazing price.</li>
            <li>Literally amazing.</li>
            <li>This really enhances your tan and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>I get a nice glow from it.</li>
            <li>the people that own the tanning salon said it would be.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li>nice lotion.</li>
            <li>I know you can still use the lotion until it begins to seperate, but it would have been nice to get a bottle still in date.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I currently own the JWOWW One and Done..</li>
            <li>has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>After two times in tanning bed had a nice tan.</li>
            <li>I am most happy about the awesome bargain buying it on Amazon versus the actual salon itself.</li>
            <li>Better deal on amazon than purchasing at the tanning salon for sure!</li>
            <li>I currently own JWOWW One and Done (silver bottle) and I love it</li>
            <li>One and done is great great smell and my color is a lovely natural color</li>
            <li>but by far not the best lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I work at a tanning salon and this is the best natural bronzer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The best thing about it being a natural bronzer is that it doesn&#x27;t contain DHA</li>
            <li>and I have had great success with this one.</li>
            <li>Got an excellent dark starter tan with this lotion and its smell is great.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Works fast smells good!</li>
            <li>This lotion worked great with my sensitive and fair skin</li>
            <li>Smells great, and no weird after-tan odor.</li>
            <li>Product works fairly well, took the full amount of time to arrive</li>
            <li>The lotion smells nice, not too strong.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and smells wonderful and works quickly.</li>
            <li>They offered me a cash refund or another bottle of jwoww free!</li>
            <li>I just received my free bottle today!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li>I tan at (just to be sure)</li>
            <li>This gave me excellent color in the bed after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li>love the smell and the color</li>
            <li>Jwoww lotion has always been my favorite will</li>
            <li>I love the jwoww lotion line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased lotions on Amazon many times and have never had an issue.</li>
            <li>love the smell and will buy again</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way it smells</li>
            <li>I find that this lotion goes on really well, smells great, enhances my tan and DOES NOT irritate my skin in any way.  </li>
            <li>and I was wishing I had asked for more time.  </li>
            <li>After using this lotion for a month I love it.</li>
            <li>Found it here for $25 :)</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to try it :)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for a couple years and with most the lotions I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion</li>
            <li>Love this stuff..</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and I can already see a lovely color difference.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m highly satisfied</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love love love the scent.</li>
            <li>I wound up spending the $25 here on Amazon for the lotion AND $75 for &amp;#34;fresh lotion,&amp;#34; at the salon anyway, so I paid more than what I was hoping for anyway.</li>
            <li>Mmmmm I love JWOWW Ink Drink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok tanner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything grand about it.</li>
            <li>Thank god for amazon:)</li>
            <li>I love it. :)</li>
            <li>is way better result.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>i love this lotion</li>
            <li>Love the tone my tan gets and my tattoo stays moisturized.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li>Love it and still am using its</li>
            <li>I was in love with this product until I quit tanning.</li>
            <li>Applies beautifully, nice and smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results--Eh it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I go to, and I fell in love with it when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff,</li>
            <li>The fragrance is just okay</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>It smells more like a perfume lotion than a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the color I&#x27;ve gotten since I started using it.</li>
            <li>and now people are noticing more.</li>
            <li>One of the better smelling lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>would def recommend! :)</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing tanning lotion since the original JWOWW.</li>
            <li>Chose this one for my tattoos and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, dark tanning results, and wonderful for tattoos.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right!!  :-)</li>
            <li>I like this lotion much better than the one and done, love that is has some kind of protection for all my tattoos and the price is right.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing-  smells great, moisturizes,  leaves a nice sheen, and after 1 session, knocks the other lotion out of the water.</li>
            <li>It arrived 4 days ahead of the original schedule!</li>
            <li>It has a strong coconut smell, which isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>Well worth the money esp since this runs for more than $60+ at my tanning salon!</li>
            <li>perfect just what was expected</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, goes on smoothly, and it does the job!</li>
            <li>This smells really good and there really isn&#x27;t much after tan odor at all.</li>
            <li>-it came quickly and there was a cute sample with it. :)</li>
            <li>I also could not get enough of the smell - soooo good!</li>
            <li>Definitely excited to keep using this and develop a darker tan :)</li>
            <li>Great product.....sealed properly, and a free pair of eye gear for the tanning bed!</li>
            <li>I tan easy</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best lotion I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one of the older JWOWW lotions and saw all the good reviews for this one</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a strong coconut sort of smell, it just smells tropical to me.</li>
            <li>smells great, makes your skin feel soft but not as much bronzer as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Because the lotion is fresher at the salon, it&#x27;s creamier, smells better, and the bronzers in this lotion are more effective than a nearly expired lotion.</li>
            <li>I am a avid tanner and have my own bed</li>
            <li>no hesitation about buying the full size bottle : )</li>
            <li>Nice bronzer, gives a pretty tan without any streaking.</li>
            <li>so it came pretty fast which I was happy about.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell like burnt tanning bed afterwards which is super important too!</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance, not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>This really smelled good going on and was not unpleasant at all after my tanning session was over.</li>
            <li>I do have tattoos, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in them.</li>
            <li>This one has a really nice smell And very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>have only been using 2 weeks and had great color from the start and had it 2 days after i ordered it.</li>
            <li>But with this lotion, I was so comfortable</li>
            <li>I also get fantastic color from it.</li>
            <li>a free sample at my gym.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>So, I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>; they have a bunch of expired lotions and are selling it for cheap, kinda like an outlet.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t leave me orange and my skin felt smooth afterwards...</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and leaves no streaks.</li>
            <li>i compair the smell to the cheap tanning lotion at walmart..</li>
            <li>The color it gives you is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I got a free trial of this at the tanning salon</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Smells ok that&#x27;s the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product so far.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my skin smooth and smelling like PEZ candy but not crazy strong just lightly.</li>
            <li>this may be my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>My first tanning lotion and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I got this originally because of the &amp;#34;ink drink&amp;#34; formula.</li>
            <li>However, they told me that it was originally 56 dollars and that they would give me a 50% discount because I&#x27;m a VIP member.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion excited about the color I would get.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is so much cheaper on Amazon than at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li>I better use it first before my others...</li>
            <li>Smells great but caused some minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li>If you have the real product why not sell it at top dollar instead of dirt cheap prices?</li>
            <li>I mixed it with Ruby and liked it better though.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing special that it does.</li>
            <li>right on time!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Good lotion, especially if you have tattoos!</li>
            <li>it smells good before and after and worked instantly.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how fast it made me tan..</li>
            <li>Love this lotion so much.</li>
            <li>Ive tried designer skins color bomb prior which gave a good tan but</li>
            <li>but not a bad lotion just didnt care for it</li>
            <li>I love tanning and enjoy trying new lotion</li>
            <li>Great for a starter lotion, good smell and decent coverage, but a bit thick.</li>
            <li>and she said it was more than likely fine!</li>
            <li>It smells great and not like other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I got my lotion quickly, but it was expired.</li>
            <li>So many reviews on so many tanning lotions, seems its all just a personal thing</li>
            <li>Just as advertised, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use this again plus the lotion was super runny</li>
            <li>It gives me instant color, plus I feel like it works better than most products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Super quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin super moisturized, 14 Karat did not.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; keeps my tan dark</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>My product was fresh and unopened and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Works fast and gives results very quickly.</li>
            <li>First tanning lotion that works for me!</li>
            <li>i will definitely be buying more of these products!</li>
            <li>The skin on your face is thinner and more sensitive!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Also, my arms are mostly tattooed (not sleeved) and They dont end up looking dull after tanning, it kinda gives them a good glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought some great lotions through amazon, but this one was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>Since using JWOWW I can tell a huge difference, so much darker.</li>
            <li>Skin feels refreshed and soft after leaving salon and great color results over a short time.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Helps me achieve a bronze, golden tan.</li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin, so some products bother me more than others.</li>
            <li>it gave me the golden look</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overwhelming bronzer but leaves a noticeable and natural looking color.</li>
            <li>It definitely works to keep my tan nice and bronzed in between visits.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results, so I purchased a bottle Smile</li>
            <li>I was just about to buy it at the tanning salon for $80 because I loved it so much, but then I found it on here for only $28!</li>
            <li>however this one only had 6 mos left....not an honest selling practice.....</li>
            <li>If you want that beautiful California girl golden brown tan, not sure this is for you.</li>
            <li>Item arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li>It might be the right lotion for some</li>
            <li>The salon wanted right around $90 for it.</li>
            <li>and I see color right away.</li>
            <li>It came sealed in plastic, and the consistency is right.</li>
            <li>Great if you want a dark tan and want to look like you&#x27;re straight from the islands.</li>
            <li>My legs have had issues catching up to the rest of me and this gave it a pretty big boost of color.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it actually helped me get darker, but it sure did smell good!</li>
            <li>The shipping is fast, it got here right on time!</li>
            <li>The JWOWW line is by far the best I have used in terms of seeing quick results that are long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too dark (I like a good tan but</li>
            <li>I glow in the dark and have found this to be a good tanning product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make me as dark as I was hoping smelt good though.</li>
            <li>Its a good product, just dont feel like my tan is a dark as it should be.  </li>
            <li>plus I got this super fast.</li>
            <li>thus far it takes about 3-4 days to develop real color and the color stays much better.</li>
            <li>Always been a fan of the Snooki Tanning Lotion line, but JWOWW gives super fast results.</li>
            <li>It gets you very tan very fast!</li>
            <li>This lotion made me see color very fast.</li>
            <li>The shipping was VERY fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>makes your tattoos really  pop with color!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely divine!</li>
            <li>and they seemed pretty much identical in color, smell and consistency!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I tend to burn the first few tanning sessions because my skin is so fair.</li>
            <li>I was noticly darker the first use.</li>
            <li>The first without lotion and then with this lotion.</li>
            <li>Plus it was so much cheaper than my tanning salon sells it for!</li>
            <li>Not gritty like the one and done, also love the smell..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten so much darker!</li>
            <li>So much cheaper buying it here than buying it at the salon!</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first lotion I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t give me that \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>:) It gets sold in our local tanning salon for $80+ a bottle!</li>
            <li>love it i only use jwows lotions now</li>
            <li>has dha tanners in it and did not give the up most color possible.</li>
            <li>, it will surely become part of my regular tanning lotion rotation.</li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only issue,  love the product.</li>
            <li>Just ordered several more</li>
            <li>More than enough time to use it.</li>
            <li>It smells good- very tropical, and is a thick, creamy texture that glides on well and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>and it gives me a nice deep natural looking color!</li>
            <li>Great tan for only two tries.</li>
            <li>This product is a great sunless tanning lotion for a good base tan.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and so much better than trying to buy for ten times the price at a salon.</li>
            <li>it gives a natural glow right off the Jersey Shore!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft and smells like a bowl of fruity pebbles,</li>
            <li>I got to a certain color and stopped.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion to anyone who wants to see color fast!</li>
            <li>Works amazing:) too expensive at the tanning place</li>
            <li>I use for indoor tanning at Palm Beach Tanning, much cheaper here than in the salon.</li>
            <li>why spend so much money at the tanning salon?  </li>
            <li>MUCH cheaper than buying from a tanning I&#x27;m a beginner at tanning and have used this product 5 times already</li>
            <li>I want fast.</li>
            <li>; I didn&#x27;t care for that smell as much as like this one.</li>
            <li>I really like the tattoo protection as well.</li>
            <li>I told them thanks that I would ask my hubby about it and see what he says.</li>
            <li>Then I came home to find out that it was only about $25 bucks and then free shipping with Prime.</li>
            <li>I really feel like I got a steal</li>
            <li>Smells very tropical.</li>
            <li>Vendor, the tan man, shipped immediately which was appreciated.</li>
            <li>I did the test so you wouldn&#x27;t have to, haha.</li>
            <li>I was getting ready to pay $79 for this lotion at the tanning salon and got this for 19.99 + shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much of a difference tanning with this lotion really makes.</li>
            <li>However, the last couple of times I have forgone the application and have been pimple free.  </li>
            <li>Is a very gd product.</li>
            <li>thanks to this lotion</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, didn&#x27;t make me sweat in the tanning bed either.</li>
            <li>it kinda has a stinky fruity smell that i dont really like..</li>
            <li>The price of it just sweetens the pot haha</li>
            <li>really out</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this and feel it works really well for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li>This is a much lighter color and much thinner consistency.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my tanning lotion</li>
            <li>The color this lotion leaves behind is very nice too.</li>
            <li>The smell is better then almost any other lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times but my skin is so smooth and I am definitely gaining a great natural brown tan.</li>
            <li>I got super dark super fast with this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>As far as tanning results I could tell within the first use I was shades darker.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was not expired for another 8 months, which is MORE than enough time for me to use the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>On the plus side it smells decent and gave decent color</li>
            <li>highlt reccommand this jwowline to anyone who wants a natural tan!</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and does not leave the weird streaks that are unavoidable with many dark tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t leave you all slick like, your tattoos like almost new.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using if you have color tats.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, and can&#x27;t beat amazons price +$$$</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I love the Mad hot tingle more.  </li>
            <li>and it always makes my half sleeve tattoo look darker and more vivid.</li>
            <li>As far as it rejuvenating my tattoos, I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li>It normally takes me forever to tan.</li>
            <li>The scent in natural black is one that I absolutely love and follow with jwowws one and done after tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best lotion if you want a natural looking tan (my skin is yellow pale, not blue pale, green pale, or red pale), great smelling skin, SUPER moisturized skin but not sticky, and still making sure your tattoos look great....</li>
            <li>It got me dark, but then I already tan easy.</li>
            <li>I live in the city</li>
            <li>but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda new at tanning</li>
            <li>I can say that every time I have used it, I get a new pimple.  </li>
            <li>It works and keeps you from getting burnt, even if you don&#x27;t take very well (like me) or it&#x27;s your first time tanning in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>same exact product that they offer.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle that i purchased from the salon and this is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I bought this from the seller Solarium and it came completely sealed!</li>
            <li>arrived on time, not past the expiration date.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving this product 4 stars for showing such fast results immediately and hope that maybe I&#x27;m just a little more sensitive to smells than others may be.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and while it is a slight brown color it does not leave any streaks.</li>
            <li>Only good thing is I&#x27;ll probably only go past expiration by a month or two by the time it&#x27;s used up...</li>
            <li>I was excited to see that Amazon had my tanning lotion for a great price on here after I had been accustom to the pretty outrageous prices at the Salon.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin, leaving it soft to touch.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>Smells old.</li>
            <li>It got me so much darker… and instantly!</li>
            <li>, then after tanning it is really the same,</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a totally natural tan that&#x27;s not streaky, and</li>
            <li>I ran out of both of my tanning lotions that I loved (the old JWOWW lotion &amp; Black Noir lotion), so I bought a small pack of this lotion to try at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>gets you dark quick</li>
            <li>You get super dark results and you don&#x27;t get that sticky feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it made me super dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I ordered from Solarium due to their 100% positive rating!</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t take long before I realized that I absolutely reeked.</li>
            <li>This lotion helps me get super dark!</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling when i get my snooki ultra dark black is going to be better then this...</li>
            <li>So far i have only tanned twice this year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already pretty dark.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick but light lotion</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but it was already outdated when it arrived.</li>
            <li>lotion itself is a little runnier than what I&#x27;m used to and didn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well right off the bat.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for this product, it just didn&#x27;t do what other products do for me, on the other hand shipment was good, just didn&#x27;t do anything for me, will go back to my other product!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that I absolutely adore the smell of this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not a good idea, the skin on your face is so sensitive and you need special lotion for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like key lime pie in a bottle :) after tanning there&#x27;s a slight odor that is akin to tanning without lotion, but it disappears in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Excellent JWOWW lotion base minus DHA with fruity coconut fragrance...</li>
            <li>Already, the smell wasn&#x27;t the same, I put it on one arm and my original lotion on the other arm, and I didn&#x27;t get nearly as tan as I usually do, and I smelled like burned skin on the amazon lotion arm as opposed to my salon lotion arm.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I had gone through a few other products (some cheap, some expensive) before I got to this J Woww lotion, which is absolutely AMAZING!!  </li>

            <li> Love JWOWW!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> I love jwow!</li>
            <li> Good for my tattoos and smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing..</li>
            <li> The lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> the color of my tan is amazing...</li>
            <li> Smells great, my skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li> and it smells absolutely ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It is a really great bronzer that is lightly scented.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and no after tan smell</li>
            <li> And Amazon has an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Literally amazing.</li>
            <li> This really enhances your tan and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I get a nice glow from it.</li>
            <li> the people that own the tanning salon said it would be.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li> nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I know you can still use the lotion until it begins to seperate, but it would have been nice to get a bottle still in date.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I currently own the JWOWW One and Done..</li>
            <li> has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> After two times in tanning bed had a nice tan.</li>
            <li> I am most happy about the awesome bargain buying it on Amazon versus the actual salon itself.</li>
            <li> Better deal on amazon than purchasing at the tanning salon for sure!</li>
            <li> I currently own JWOWW One and Done (silver bottle) and I love it</li>
            <li> One and done is great great smell and my color is a lovely natural color</li>
            <li> but by far not the best lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and this is the best natural bronzer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The best thing about it being a natural bronzer is that it doesn&#x27;t contain DHA</li>
            <li> and I have had great success with this one.</li>
            <li> Got an excellent dark starter tan with this lotion and its smell is great.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Works fast smells good!</li>
            <li> This lotion worked great with my sensitive and fair skin</li>
            <li> Smells great, and no weird after-tan odor.</li>
            <li> Product works fairly well, took the full amount of time to arrive</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice, not too strong.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and smells wonderful and works quickly.</li>
            <li> They offered me a cash refund or another bottle of jwoww free!</li>
            <li> I just received my free bottle today!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li> I tan at (just to be sure)</li>
            <li> This gave me excellent color in the bed after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> love the smell and the color</li>
            <li> Jwoww lotion has always been my favorite will</li>
            <li> I love the jwoww lotion line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased lotions on Amazon many times and have never had an issue.</li>
            <li> love the smell and will buy again</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way it smells</li>
            <li> I find that this lotion goes on really well, smells great, enhances my tan and DOES NOT irritate my skin in any way.  </li>
            <li> and I was wishing I had asked for more time.  </li>
            <li> After using this lotion for a month I love it.</li>
            <li> Found it here for $25 :)</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to try it :)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a couple years and with most the lotions I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and I can already see a lovely color difference.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m highly satisfied</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love love love the scent.</li>
            <li> I wound up spending the $25 here on Amazon for the lotion AND $75 for &amp;#34;fresh lotion,&amp;#34; at the salon anyway, so I paid more than what I was hoping for anyway.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm I love JWOWW Ink Drink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok tanner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything grand about it.</li>
            <li> Thank god for amazon:)</li>
            <li> I love it. :)</li>
            <li> is way better result.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion</li>
            <li> Love the tone my tan gets and my tattoo stays moisturized.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li> Love it and still am using its</li>
            <li> I was in love with this product until I quit tanning.</li>
            <li> Applies beautifully, nice and smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results--Eh it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I go to, and I fell in love with it when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,</li>
            <li> The fragrance is just okay</li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> It smells more like a perfume lotion than a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the color I&#x27;ve gotten since I started using it.</li>
            <li> and now people are noticing more.</li>
            <li> One of the better smelling lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> would def recommend! :)</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing tanning lotion since the original JWOWW.</li>
            <li> Chose this one for my tattoos and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, dark tanning results, and wonderful for tattoos.</li>
            <li> Yeah, right!!  :-)</li>
            <li> I like this lotion much better than the one and done, love that is has some kind of protection for all my tattoos and the price is right.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing-  smells great, moisturizes,  leaves a nice sheen, and after 1 session, knocks the other lotion out of the water.</li>
            <li> It arrived 4 days ahead of the original schedule!</li>
            <li> It has a strong coconut smell, which isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> Well worth the money esp since this runs for more than $60+ at my tanning salon!</li>
            <li> perfect just what was expected</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, goes on smoothly, and it does the job!</li>
            <li> This smells really good and there really isn&#x27;t much after tan odor at all.</li>
            <li> -it came quickly and there was a cute sample with it. :)</li>
            <li> I also could not get enough of the smell - soooo good!</li>
            <li> Definitely excited to keep using this and develop a darker tan :)</li>
            <li> Great product.....sealed properly, and a free pair of eye gear for the tanning bed!</li>
            <li> I tan easy</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best lotion I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one of the older JWOWW lotions and saw all the good reviews for this one</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a strong coconut sort of smell, it just smells tropical to me.</li>
            <li> smells great, makes your skin feel soft but not as much bronzer as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Because the lotion is fresher at the salon, it&#x27;s creamier, smells better, and the bronzers in this lotion are more effective than a nearly expired lotion.</li>
            <li> I am a avid tanner and have my own bed</li>
            <li> no hesitation about buying the full size bottle : )</li>
            <li> Nice bronzer, gives a pretty tan without any streaking.</li>
            <li> so it came pretty fast which I was happy about.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell like burnt tanning bed afterwards which is super important too!</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> This really smelled good going on and was not unpleasant at all after my tanning session was over.</li>
            <li> I do have tattoos, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in them.</li>
            <li> This one has a really nice smell And very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> have only been using 2 weeks and had great color from the start and had it 2 days after i ordered it.</li>
            <li> But with this lotion, I was so comfortable</li>
            <li> I also get fantastic color from it.</li>
            <li> a free sample at my gym.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> So, I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> ; they have a bunch of expired lotions and are selling it for cheap, kinda like an outlet.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t leave me orange and my skin felt smooth afterwards...</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and leaves no streaks.</li>
            <li> i compair the smell to the cheap tanning lotion at walmart..</li>
            <li> The color it gives you is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I got a free trial of this at the tanning salon</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Smells ok that&#x27;s the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product so far.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my skin smooth and smelling like PEZ candy but not crazy strong just lightly.</li>
            <li> this may be my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> My first tanning lotion and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I got this originally because of the &amp;#34;ink drink&amp;#34; formula.</li>
            <li> However, they told me that it was originally 56 dollars and that they would give me a 50% discount because I&#x27;m a VIP member.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion excited about the color I would get.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is so much cheaper on Amazon than at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I better use it first before my others...</li>
            <li> Smells great but caused some minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li> If you have the real product why not sell it at top dollar instead of dirt cheap prices?</li>
            <li> I mixed it with Ruby and liked it better though.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special that it does.</li>
            <li> right on time!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Good lotion, especially if you have tattoos!</li>
            <li> it smells good before and after and worked instantly.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how fast it made me tan..</li>
            <li> Love this lotion so much.</li>
            <li> Ive tried designer skins color bomb prior which gave a good tan but</li>
            <li> but not a bad lotion just didnt care for it</li>
            <li> I love tanning and enjoy trying new lotion</li>
            <li> Great for a starter lotion, good smell and decent coverage, but a bit thick.</li>
            <li> and she said it was more than likely fine!</li>
            <li> It smells great and not like other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I got my lotion quickly, but it was expired.</li>
            <li> So many reviews on so many tanning lotions, seems its all just a personal thing</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use this again plus the lotion was super runny</li>
            <li> It gives me instant color, plus I feel like it works better than most products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Super quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin super moisturized, 14 Karat did not.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; keeps my tan dark</li>
            <li> My new favorite.</li>
            <li> My product was fresh and unopened and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Works fast and gives results very quickly.</li>
            <li> First tanning lotion that works for me!</li>
            <li> i will definitely be buying more of these products!</li>
            <li> The skin on your face is thinner and more sensitive!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Also, my arms are mostly tattooed (not sleeved) and They dont end up looking dull after tanning, it kinda gives them a good glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought some great lotions through amazon, but this one was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Since using JWOWW I can tell a huge difference, so much darker.</li>
            <li> Skin feels refreshed and soft after leaving salon and great color results over a short time.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Helps me achieve a bronze, golden tan.</li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin, so some products bother me more than others.</li>
            <li> it gave me the golden look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overwhelming bronzer but leaves a noticeable and natural looking color.</li>
            <li> It definitely works to keep my tan nice and bronzed in between visits.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results, so I purchased a bottle Smile</li>
            <li> I was just about to buy it at the tanning salon for $80 because I loved it so much, but then I found it on here for only $28!</li>
            <li> however this one only had 6 mos left....not an honest selling practice.....</li>
            <li> If you want that beautiful California girl golden brown tan, not sure this is for you.</li>
            <li> Item arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li> It might be the right lotion for some</li>
            <li> The salon wanted right around $90 for it.</li>
            <li> and I see color right away.</li>
            <li> It came sealed in plastic, and the consistency is right.</li>
            <li> Great if you want a dark tan and want to look like you&#x27;re straight from the islands.</li>
            <li> My legs have had issues catching up to the rest of me and this gave it a pretty big boost of color.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually helped me get darker, but it sure did smell good!</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast, it got here right on time!</li>
            <li> The JWOWW line is by far the best I have used in terms of seeing quick results that are long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dark (I like a good tan but</li>
            <li> I glow in the dark and have found this to be a good tanning product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make me as dark as I was hoping smelt good though.</li>
            <li> Its a good product, just dont feel like my tan is a dark as it should be.  </li>
            <li> plus I got this super fast.</li>
            <li> thus far it takes about 3-4 days to develop real color and the color stays much better.</li>
            <li> Always been a fan of the Snooki Tanning Lotion line, but JWOWW gives super fast results.</li>
            <li> It gets you very tan very fast!</li>
            <li> This lotion made me see color very fast.</li>
            <li> The shipping was VERY fast.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> makes your tattoos really  pop with color!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely divine!</li>
            <li> and they seemed pretty much identical in color, smell and consistency!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I tend to burn the first few tanning sessions because my skin is so fair.</li>
            <li> I was noticly darker the first use.</li>
            <li> The first without lotion and then with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Plus it was so much cheaper than my tanning salon sells it for!</li>
            <li> Not gritty like the one and done, also love the smell..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten so much darker!</li>
            <li> So much cheaper buying it here than buying it at the salon!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the first lotion I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t give me that \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> :) It gets sold in our local tanning salon for $80+ a bottle!</li>
            <li> love it i only use jwows lotions now</li>
            <li> has dha tanners in it and did not give the up most color possible.</li>
            <li> , it will surely become part of my regular tanning lotion rotation.</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only issue,  love the product.</li>
            <li> Just ordered several more</li>
            <li> More than enough time to use it.</li>
            <li> It smells good- very tropical, and is a thick, creamy texture that glides on well and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> and it gives me a nice deep natural looking color!</li>
            <li> Great tan for only two tries.</li>
            <li> This product is a great sunless tanning lotion for a good base tan.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and so much better than trying to buy for ten times the price at a salon.</li>
            <li> it gives a natural glow right off the Jersey Shore!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft and smells like a bowl of fruity pebbles,</li>
            <li> I got to a certain color and stopped.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion to anyone who wants to see color fast!</li>
            <li> Works amazing:) too expensive at the tanning place</li>
            <li> I use for indoor tanning at Palm Beach Tanning, much cheaper here than in the salon.</li>
            <li> why spend so much money at the tanning salon?  </li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper than buying from a tanning I&#x27;m a beginner at tanning and have used this product 5 times already</li>
            <li> I want fast.</li>
            <li> ; I didn&#x27;t care for that smell as much as like this one.</li>
            <li> I really like the tattoo protection as well.</li>
            <li> I told them thanks that I would ask my hubby about it and see what he says.</li>
            <li> Then I came home to find out that it was only about $25 bucks and then free shipping with Prime.</li>
            <li> I really feel like I got a steal</li>
            <li> Smells very tropical.</li>
            <li> Vendor, the tan man, shipped immediately which was appreciated.</li>
            <li> I did the test so you wouldn&#x27;t have to, haha.</li>
            <li> I was getting ready to pay $79 for this lotion at the tanning salon and got this for 19.99 + shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much of a difference tanning with this lotion really makes.</li>
            <li> However, the last couple of times I have forgone the application and have been pimple free.  </li>
            <li> Is a very gd product.</li>
            <li> thanks to this lotion</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, didn&#x27;t make me sweat in the tanning bed either.</li>
            <li> it kinda has a stinky fruity smell that i dont really like..</li>
            <li> The price of it just sweetens the pot haha</li>
            <li> really out</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this and feel it works really well for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> This is a much lighter color and much thinner consistency.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my tanning lotion</li>
            <li> The color this lotion leaves behind is very nice too.</li>
            <li> The smell is better then almost any other lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but my skin is so smooth and I am definitely gaining a great natural brown tan.</li>
            <li> I got super dark super fast with this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> As far as tanning results I could tell within the first use I was shades darker.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was not expired for another 8 months, which is MORE than enough time for me to use the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> On the plus side it smells decent and gave decent color</li>
            <li> highlt reccommand this jwowline to anyone who wants a natural tan!</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and does not leave the weird streaks that are unavoidable with many dark tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t leave you all slick like, your tattoos like almost new.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using if you have color tats.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, and can&#x27;t beat amazons price +$$$</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but I love the Mad hot tingle more.  </li>
            <li> and it always makes my half sleeve tattoo look darker and more vivid.</li>
            <li> As far as it rejuvenating my tattoos, I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li> It normally takes me forever to tan.</li>
            <li> The scent in natural black is one that I absolutely love and follow with jwowws one and done after tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best lotion if you want a natural looking tan (my skin is yellow pale, not blue pale, green pale, or red pale), great smelling skin, SUPER moisturized skin but not sticky, and still making sure your tattoos look great....</li>
            <li> It got me dark, but then I already tan easy.</li>
            <li> I live in the city</li>
            <li> but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda new at tanning</li>
            <li> I can say that every time I have used it, I get a new pimple.  </li>
            <li> It works and keeps you from getting burnt, even if you don&#x27;t take very well (like me) or it&#x27;s your first time tanning in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> same exact product that they offer.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle that i purchased from the salon and this is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the seller Solarium and it came completely sealed!</li>
            <li> arrived on time, not past the expiration date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving this product 4 stars for showing such fast results immediately and hope that maybe I&#x27;m just a little more sensitive to smells than others may be.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and while it is a slight brown color it does not leave any streaks.</li>
            <li> Only good thing is I&#x27;ll probably only go past expiration by a month or two by the time it&#x27;s used up...</li>
            <li> I was excited to see that Amazon had my tanning lotion for a great price on here after I had been accustom to the pretty outrageous prices at the Salon.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin, leaving it soft to touch.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Smells old.</li>
            <li> It got me so much darker… and instantly!</li>
            <li> , then after tanning it is really the same,</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a totally natural tan that&#x27;s not streaky, and</li>
            <li> I ran out of both of my tanning lotions that I loved (the old JWOWW lotion &amp; Black Noir lotion), so I bought a small pack of this lotion to try at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> gets you dark quick</li>
            <li> You get super dark results and you don&#x27;t get that sticky feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it made me super dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Solarium due to their 100% positive rating!</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t take long before I realized that I absolutely reeked.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps me get super dark!</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling when i get my snooki ultra dark black is going to be better then this...</li>
            <li> So far i have only tanned twice this year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already pretty dark.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick but light lotion</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but it was already outdated when it arrived.</li>
            <li> lotion itself is a little runnier than what I&#x27;m used to and didn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well right off the bat.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product, it just didn&#x27;t do what other products do for me, on the other hand shipment was good, just didn&#x27;t do anything for me, will go back to my other product!!!</li>
            <li> Other than that I absolutely adore the smell of this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a good idea, the skin on your face is so sensitive and you need special lotion for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like key lime pie in a bottle :) after tanning there&#x27;s a slight odor that is akin to tanning without lotion, but it disappears in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Excellent JWOWW lotion base minus DHA with fruity coconut fragrance...</li>
            <li> Already, the smell wasn&#x27;t the same, I put it on one arm and my original lotion on the other arm, and I didn&#x27;t get nearly as tan as I usually do, and I smelled like burned skin on the amazon lotion arm as opposed to my salon lotion arm.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had gone through a few other products (some cheap, some expensive) before I got to this J Woww lotion, which is absolutely AMAZING!!  </li>
            <li> No streaking due to the natural bronzers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using paint it black for a while now but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> Since this is a natural black bronzer, you don&#x27;t have to worry about continuously getting tanner after getting out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I was using JWOWW One and Done before I purchased this lotion, and let me say the Natural Black Bronzer did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in, but if you take your time it will be well worth it!</li>
            <li> I used this to replace the JWow wedding white lotion that was limited edition</li>
            <li> With some of the other lotions, I found that they made my skin sting or burn in the bed (especially on my face and lower back), which made me want to jump out of the bed before even 8 minutes!  </li>
            <li> so I was feeling a little self conscious on my train ride</li>
            <li> I have freckles and its hard to find a lotion to get me really tan, this one works.</li>
            <li> I would differently recommend this product for other people to try</li>
            <li> so maybe I had used the same amount of other lotions too.</li>
            <li> I am only a little tan so far, and this did not make me look like I used &amp;#34;fake tanner&amp;#34; like some other brands of dark bronzers can do.</li>
            <li> I get dark at the same time my tattoo are protected.</li>
            <li> Almost half price actually!</li>
            <li> and I used this every day (along with Crystal Faces) and I came back SO dark is was ridiculous, and it looked natural!</li>
            <li> The only thing that threw me off a little was that the &#x27;manufacture date&#x27; was 8/02/2015 even though today is 6/08/2015.</li>
            <li> I guess, I noticed a little extra color afterwards</li>
            <li> Only one drawback is it is hard to get the last of the lotion out because of the sturdy plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> I started tanning recently to prep for a few trips to warm-weather destinations.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this lotion as an emergency after I spent $75 for another lotion at my salon that was junk.  </li>
            <li> Jwoww&#x27;s only tingle lotion is Mad Hot Tingle Bronzer!</li>
            <li> A lady at the tanning salon tried selling me this bottle for nearly $60 which is ridiculous</li>
            <li> After just a few sessions I am dark enough to look like I&#x27;ve been tanning for a month!</li>
            <li> Usually I feel like i have to go tanning last when i&#x27;m out running errands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s lasting after a shower..</li>
            <li> I havent used it yet due to the fact its til winter here</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to order this lotion after reading the reviews, however when I rcvd it, I used it for about a week and didn&#x27;t see any results :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times and it stinks, it smells absolutely nothing like the previous bottles I purchased from my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Just deep, dark, and sexxy!!!</li>
            <li> I was as dark as I wanted to be in about a week and a half of tanning every other day.</li>
            <li> the girl in the salon even commented on how dark i was already.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just because the lotion is dark</li>
            <li> Kept her dark.</li>
            <li> Not orange, but still dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so dark ..</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t get as dark as I prefer.</li>
            <li> I always give at least a couple of days to a week before writing a review to ensure that I am not giving out an opinion on something before giving it a proper chance.</li>
            <li> It takes me a while to get dark</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still thick enough to where it isn&#x27;t runny when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Paint it Black and decided to switch it up.</li>
            <li> I noticed some slight bronzing after tanning, but once you shower, it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li> I had the one previous to this &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m dark!</li>
            <li> hoping I can get dark!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about buying off here because some of the review.</li>
            <li> I am already a few shades darker.</li>
            <li> and I get a few shades darker each time I use this.</li>
            <li> I get a dark color almost immediately that lasts even with my pale freckely skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale but this gets me dark!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the lotion in general, or if there was something wrong with the bottle that I rcvd?</li>
            <li> Try a little bit of everything to see what works for you!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything really, although it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at 1st but definitely not anymore.</li>
            <li> not sure if maybe it was just the bottle I received or what.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have tattoos so not sure if the Ink~Drink works or not.</li>
            <li> Sadly I ran out, and I sampled this at the local salon, and I was insantly darker than before.</li>
            <li> and i usually dont tan in the winter</li>
            <li> not super awkward looking due to bronzers).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave smelling like I&#x27;ve tanned and my skin isn&#x27;t icky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also made with ink drink complex</li>
            <li> I mean seriously...</li>
            <li> my face felt like I was being pricked by thousands of needles to a point where I almost thought I was going to have to get out and put a cold wet towel on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because it&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, if I put it on my face my face starts to feel like I&#x27;m wearing a tingle which I hate because it feels like I&#x27;m burning when I&#x27;ve only been in the bed for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Conveniently behind the sticker is the expiration date....</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t just put bath and body works or Victoria&#x27;s Secret body lotion on your face, would you?</li>
            <li> I have a decent base tan already, but I used this twice in a level 2 bed, for 12 mins each...love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive products and this gives me the darkest color.</li>
            <li> So sad that I already ran out, but tanning almost 4-5 days a week, it has lasted for a while.</li>
            <li> I like it for tanning, but the scent is kinda weird.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, however, that my product was past the expiration date.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase online since I had heard horror stories about lotions being expired.</li>
            <li> When I run out ill defenitly buy it again.</li>
            <li> kinda sad about that...</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have garbage cans in each room to protect from evil people stealing empty bottles and replacing them with garbage product.</li>
            <li> My husband said I smelled like popcorn after using it, but I think he&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> to greasy made my face break out bad..</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a bad after tanning smell like some lotions have.</li>
            <li> Also, I got an expired bottle. :(</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expired :-(</li>
            <li> cause I hate that burnt nasty smell that tanning leaves you with.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known this lotion has tingle because I HATE tingle!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ordered this and it was expired. Went tanning twice with it and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Would buy this again..&lt;br /&gt;Gives great color.</li>
            <li> Great smell!  I got a lot of color after just one session. Great price!  Very fast shipping! Only 2 days!  WOW!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works fast smells good! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This lotion works great! I use for indoor tanning at Palm Beach Tanning, much cheaper here than in the salon. Almost half price actually! This smells very good and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky when applied. Ink Drink is what lured me into this product and I am very happy with it and so are my tattoos! Skin feels refreshed and soft after leaving salon and great color results over a short time.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion! It gets you very tan very fast! I had a problem with my order. I contacted customer service who were wonderful! They offered me a cash refund or another bottle of jwoww free! I just received my free bottle today! Great customer service, great lotion! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Very good. Smells delicious!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe the salon asks over double! same exact product that they offer. I have a bottle that i purchased from the salon and this is exactly the same. works great and isn&#x27;t overly greasy. makes your tattoos really  pop with color!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite tanning lotions of all time!</li>
            <li> so wowed!! this stuff smells like a dream. I dare you to not fall in love! if only she made shampoo and conditoner. . . plus I got this super fast. very impressed:-)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and smells great!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! It also smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion. I&#x27;ve used expensive products and this gives me the darkest color.</li>
            <li> Excellent will order from seller again</li>
            <li> This product is a great sunless tanning lotion for a good base tan. Only one drawback is it is hard to get the last of the lotion out because of the sturdy plastic bottle. I had to cut it open to get the rest of the lotion out.</li>
            <li> My first tanning lotion and I absolutely love it. So sad that I already ran out, but tanning almost 4-5 days a week, it has lasted for a while. I purchased it around Oct-Nov and it just ran out. It smells absolutely divine! I haven&#x27;t tanned without the lotion so I&#x27;m not quite sure how well it works compared with the lotion and without, but using a level 2 bed, it gets me pretttttty tan. Well worth the money esp since this runs for more than $60+ at my tanning salon!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.. Gives you great color and leaves your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> smells great, makes your skin feel soft but not as much bronzer as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother she loves it!</li>
            <li> Omg! I was skeptical at 1st but definitely not anymore. The lotion is amazing. Literally after just 1 use I noticed color. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Really great! Just got it and could not wait to use it lol! I even got a sample of the stuff at the salon I tan at (just to be sure) and they seemed pretty much identical in color, smell and consistency! The only thing that threw me off a little was that the &#x27;manufacture date&#x27; was 8/02/2015 even though today is 6/08/2015. I asked one of the girls at the counter about it and she said it was more than likely fine! Smells great, feels great, and is a great price!! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This gave me excellent color in the bed after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the seller Solarium and it came completely sealed! The color is good and it smells like pina colada. I haven&#x27;t even used it yet and I&#x27;m already extremely happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> love the smell and the color</li>
            <li> smells so good...does not leave your hands orange looking</li>
            <li> Been tanning for years and this did nothing for me at all.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Makes my skin super soft and smells like a bowl of fruity pebbles, yummy! Great bronzer that doesn&#x27;t look orange or streaky which I know many people are wary of. Helps me achieve a bronze, golden tan. Also wanted to say that the product you receive is NOT expired. The year on mine said 2014, which is the same year on the bottles in my local tanning salon. Don&#x27;t spend $70 or more buying in the store, save yourself a lot of money by buying it here! I am 100% satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Item arrived right on schedule. This is a great product...the color of my tan is amazing...the best part is the my tattoo&#x27;s look amazing no fading.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There is no such thing as an 18 year shelf life. I work in a tanning salon as a certified tanning consultant and an assistant manger and this is bs. Never ever buy lotion online. One women bought lotion online for a great price and it turns out there was motor oil in the lotion. Do not trust any online sellers. You must have a tanning license to purchase tanning lotions. We don&#x27;t have garbage cans in each room to protect from evil people stealing empty bottles and replacing them with garbage product. Almost all products have a 12 mo shelf life. If you have the real product why not sell it at top dollar instead of dirt cheap prices? You have been warned.</li>
            <li> love the smell! Jwoww lotion has always been my favorite will so  buy it again when it comes time.</li>
            <li> Product works fairly well, took the full amount of time to arrive</li>
            <li> This really enhances your tan and smells awesome. You can buy it at the salon for $80.</li>
            <li> I love the jwoww lotion line. This one has a really nice smell And very moisturizing. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t streak. Gives you a nice brown color, not orange!</li>
            <li> why spend so much money at the tanning salon?  perfect just what was expected</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! As described!</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome</li>
            <li> Love it, great price! MUCH cheaper than buying from a tanning I&#x27;m a beginner at tanning and have used this product 5 times already and I&#x27;m much more darker!!</li>
            <li> Very good for wht I needed it for u have several tattoos tht the ink has lightened up bc of the exposure to the uv lights.</li>
            <li> Not a fan, don&#x27;t like the scent and it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I like it for tanning, but the scent is kinda weird. I will keep using it, but not every time I go.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Paint it Black and decided to switch it up. I&#x27;ve used one of the older JWOWW lotions and saw all the good reviews for this one so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is a little runnier than what I&#x27;m used to and didn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well right off the bat. It&#x27;s still thick enough to where it isn&#x27;t runny when you apply it. The scent has a hint of coconut and a hint of something else I couldn&#x27;t quite pinpoint until after tanning. When I got out of the bed, I could already see results immediately. My legs have had issues catching up to the rest of me and this gave it a pretty big boost of color. However, it didn&#x27;t take long before I realized that I absolutely reeked. The after-tan smell is almost identical to butter popcorn. I live in the city so I was feeling a little self conscious on my train ride home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if maybe it was just the bottle I received or what. Others have referenced the production date and expiration date on their bottles but mine didn&#x27;t seem to have one anywhere. I&#x27;ve purchased lotions on Amazon many times and have never had an issue. I&#x27;m still giving this product 4 stars for showing such fast results immediately and hope that maybe I&#x27;m just a little more sensitive to smells than others may be.</li>
            <li> I tend to burn the first few tanning sessions because my skin is so fair. This lotion worked great with my sensitive and fair skin and I did not burn at all! It is very moisturizing and smells wonderful and works quickly. I will definitely be purchasing this again when my current bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> have only been using 2 weeks and had great color from the start and had it 2 days after i ordered it. the girl in the salon even commented on how dark i was already. love the smell and will buy again</li>
            <li> I currently own JWOWW One and Done (silver bottle) and I love it but I wanted to try something new. A lady at the tanning salon tried selling me this bottle for nearly $60 which is ridiculous so I came to Amazon to buy it for cheaper. Overall, I like this lotion. I LOVE the way it smells and it always makes my half sleeve tattoo look darker and more vivid.</li>
            <li> Great product with good outcomes</li>
            <li> I started tanning recently to prep for a few trips to warm-weather destinations.  I have relatively sensitive skin, so some products bother me more than others. Unfortunately, I had gone through a few other products (some cheap, some expensive) before I got to this J Woww lotion, which is absolutely AMAZING!!  I love the ingredients, which include lots of wonderful oils for your skin.  I find that this lotion goes on really well, smells great, enhances my tan and DOES NOT irritate my skin in any way.  With some of the other lotions, I found that they made my skin sting or burn in the bed (especially on my face and lower back), which made me want to jump out of the bed before even 8 minutes!  But with this lotion, I was so comfortable and it didn&#x27;t bother me.  Ten minutes got over and I was wishing I had asked for more time.  Feels great, looks great, smells awesome!  And definitely buy it here because my tanning salon wanted to charge me over $60 for it.  Yeah, right!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product, it just didn&#x27;t do what other products do for me, on the other hand shipment was good, just didn&#x27;t do anything for me, will go back to my other product!!!</li>
            <li> After using this lotion for a month I love it. Helps me get the tan I want fast. Smells great and so affordable. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using paint it black for a while now but wanted to try something new. Of course at the tanning salon they charge like 80 dollars for it, so i came to my ever-faithful website: Amazon!! Found it here for $25 :) This stuff is amazing!! I&#x27;m naturally very fair and it takes me a while to tan, but with the help of Jwowws lotion I&#x27;m the darkest i&#x27;ve ever been!! I will definitely be purchasing from her line again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, my skin feels really smooth. Fast shipping and so much better than trying to buy for ten times the price at a salon.</li>
            <li> I got this originally because of the &amp;#34;ink drink&amp;#34; formula. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything really, although it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I noticed some slight bronzing after tanning, but once you shower, it&#x27;s all gone. I couldn&#x27;t get any darker so I switched brands. Pros: It did help protect my tattoos so I didn&#x27;t have any fading. Cons: It doesn&#x27;t get you any darker. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I got my lotion quickly, but it was expired. it doesn&#x27;t bother me though. it smells really good and I can&#x27;t wait to try it :)</li>
            <li> I like this lotion much better than the one and done, love that is has some kind of protection for all my tattoos and the price is right. Beats paying what they try to charge in the tanning salons!!</li>
            <li> I got super dark super fast with this tanning lotion. Good smell and I experienced no tingle  with this lotion.</li>
            <li> This product was amazing!! I love it it gave me the golden look I was looking for!! I tryed a couple tanning products before this product and I was not getting tan, but when I started using this product I started seeing my skin get darker after I used it about 3 times. I would differently recommend this product for other people to try</li>
            <li> Love it. I get dark at the same time my tattoo are protected. I don&#x27;t look orange when I get out of the salon.</li>
            <li> this may be my new favorite lotion! After only tanning 2 times I was already getting compliments about how tan I was getting!! I was as dark as I wanted to be in about a week and a half of tanning every other day. Now I go every 3-4 days and I&#x27;m keeping my color with no issues! Great smell too! I don&#x27;t smell like burnt tanning bed afterwards which is super important too!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned in years, but I have my bachelorette party and wedding/honeymoon coming up, so I need some color. I was really impressed after just one tanning session - I feel a noticeably darker. I also could not get enough of the smell - soooo good! It smells like Pez candy - not at all like I just fried my skin for 15 minutes lol. I also like the idea that it is supposed to protect my tattoos. The only downside might be that it seemed like I had to use a lot of it, but again, I haven&#x27;t tanned in a while so maybe I had used the same amount of other lotions too. Can&#x27;t wait to continue using this!</li>
            <li> First tanning lotion that works for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for 70 dollars at the tanning salon...and it smells absolutely ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. But...I&#x27;ve gone tanning about 8 times and my colors just starting to come in...and a lot of the color goes away when I shower for some reason. I&#x27;ve been tanning for a couple years and with most the lotions I&#x27;ve bought thus far it takes about 3-4 days to develop real color and the color stays much better. Also, if I put it on my face my face starts to feel like I&#x27;m wearing a tingle which I hate because it feels like I&#x27;m burning when I&#x27;ve only been in the bed for 2 minutes. It might be the right lotion for some but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> This really smelled good going on and was not unpleasant at all after my tanning session was over. I used it quite often and am very happy with the results. I am most happy about the awesome bargain buying it on Amazon versus the actual salon itself. So happy with it!</li>
            <li> One and done is great great smell and my color is a lovely natural color</li>
            <li> Great smell before and after. No burnt smell. Love it. Gave me even more color! Id highlt reccommand this jwowline to anyone who wants a natural tan!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion I had the one previous to this &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t care for that smell as much as like this one. Smells very good sweet smell and works well! Have used it twice and I only tan a couple times of week to keep my color I have gotten darker since using it! Great price also!</li>
            <li> It works really good. I get a nice glow from it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..two times and I&#x27;m dark!</li>
            <li> Great!! Wasn&#x27;t expired like the people that own the tanning salon said it would be. Saved  30 bucks!! Ha ha</li>
            <li> One of my many favorite lotions!!</li>
            <li> Great product.....sealed properly, and a free pair of eye gear for the tanning bed!</li>
            <li> I was noticly darker the first use. I have tattoos and its wonderful for them! I haven&#x27;t had any fading or anything thing!</li>
            <li> So far i have only tanned twice this year. The first without lotion and then with this lotion. I could not be more impressed. I am already a few shades darker. I really noticed a difference a few hours after i got out of the tanning bed. It smells great, and applies nicely. I love it! i will definitely be buying more of these products!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It smells heavenly, goes on wonderful, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I also get fantastic color from it. I really like the tattoo protection as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!!!!! It&#x27;s like key lime pie in a bottle :) after tanning there&#x27;s a slight odor that is akin to tanning without lotion, but it disappears in a few minutes.  The color this lotion leaves behind is very nice too. It&#x27;s not too dark (I like a good tan but not super awkward looking due to bronzers).  In conclusion, I used to use Conceited and will not be going back. Really really really happy with this stuff! Bonus-it came quickly and there was a cute sample with it. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I have never been happier with a tanning lotion. After only two times of tanning I&#x27;m so my darker. It normally takes me forever to tan. Not with this lotion! Will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> The color this lotion gives my skin is great. I can go once a week &amp; still have great results. Shows immediately w/o that orange bronzer tint. Give it a shot.. you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Got an excellent dark starter tan with this lotion and its smell is great. Not overwhelming. Very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle tanning cream. Let me tell you why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells great! I mean seriously... Nothing like the traditional tanning/sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on you afterwards. You could literally go on with your day like nothing and still feel like a million bucks after you tan.&lt;br /&gt;3. It works and keeps you from getting burnt, even if you don&#x27;t take very well (like me) or it&#x27;s your first time tanning in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a free sample at my gym.  Loved it. However, they told me that it was originally 56 dollars and that they would give me a 50% discount because I&#x27;m a VIP member. So that put me at $28. Hmmmmmmmmm....... I told them thanks that I would ask my hubby about it and see what he says. Then I came home to find out that it was only about $25 bucks and then free shipping with Prime. I really feel like I got a steal and it&#x27;s a great product! I would def recommend it to anyone looking to get a tan!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s my favorite tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It even smells good! Plus it was so much cheaper than my tanning salon sells it for!</li>
            <li> This smells really good and there really isn&#x27;t much after tan odor at all. It&#x27;s not an overwhelming bronzer but leaves a noticeable and natural looking color. No stickiness after using either.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps me get super dark! I have freckles and its hard to find a lotion to get me really tan, this one works. The smell is a plus too!</li>
            <li> Smells good, gives a noticeable tan but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just because the lotion is dark and it makes you darker? Also, I got an expired bottle. :(</li>
            <li> Good lotion, especially if you have tattoos! Pleasant fragrance, not heavy or greasy. Absorbs into skin, leaving it soft to touch. Much better price on here than in salon!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! Usually I feel like i have to go tanning last when i&#x27;m out running errands so I don&#x27;t walk around smelling like &amp;#34;post tan&amp;#34; but this lotion makes you smell like you&#x27;ve sprayed a tropical body spray on your skin! Definitely excited to keep using this and develop a darker tan :)</li>
            <li> Product is great but was expired. I love JWOWW and is one of the best lotions on the market. I was disappointed, however, that my product was past the expiration date.</li>
            <li> Not gritty like the one and done, also love the smell..but I love the Mad hot tingle more.  This gives color.  I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s lasting after a shower..I&#x27;m already pretty dark.  I mixed it with Ruby and liked it better though.</li>
            <li> Smells great works great you definitely see a change within a week</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this online after it being suggested by an employee at my tanning salon. The salon wanted right around $90 for it. I was skeptical to purchase online since I had heard horror stories about lotions being expired. It arrived on time and was not expired for another 8 months, which is MORE than enough time for me to use the entire bottle. So far I like it. The bronzer works well and I see color right away. It smells good- very tropical, and is a thick, creamy texture that glides on well and is absorbed quickly. It leaves my skin feeling nice. I do have tattoos, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in them. Overall I would definitely buy again, and would recommend for the price!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today I ordered it last Friday so it came pretty fast which I was happy about. I don&#x27;t have tattoos so not sure if the Ink~Drink works or not. But I&#x27;ve only used this lotion once this morning at my local salon and I&#x27;m sitting at work and I can already see a lovely color difference. I&#x27;m kinda new at tanning but I&#x27;m highly satisfied and I&#x27;ll be using Jwoww products from now on. I tan easy but this is stepping it up and I like that. Oh and plus it smells like PEZ candy!!! And it leaves my skin smooth and smelling like PEZ candy but not crazy strong just lightly. I love it cause I hate that burnt nasty smell that tanning leaves you with. Great product and great price. :)</li>
            <li> Smell is good, like the feel, wish I was getting darker faster.  I&#x27;m so white I glow in the dark and have found this to be a good tanning product. So many reviews on so many tanning lotions, seems its all just a personal thing either you like it or you dont.  I like it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I&#x27;ve gotten so much darker! (I included a picture of my sticker tanline). I&#x27;m very pale but this gets me dark! It&#x27;s a wonderful price and it smells great! It doesn&#x27;t give you a tanning bed smell. I ordered from Solarium due to their 100% positive rating! The shipping is fast, it got here right on time!</li>
            <li> I love love love the scent. I don&#x27;t leave smelling like I&#x27;ve tanned and my skin isn&#x27;t icky. It definitely works to keep my tan nice and bronzed in between visits.</li>
            <li> Received an EXPIRED bottle of lotion!! Smells old.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make me as dark as I was hoping smelt good though.</li>
            <li> Smells good and is great for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it. Kept her dark. Would recommend to any guy buying for his wife or girlfriend.</li>
            <li> This has an instant bronzer effect that makes you look darker. It smells great and not like other tanning lotions. I can tell a difference by using this along with the I-bed.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to order this lotion after reading the reviews, however when I rcvd it, I used it for about a week and didn&#x27;t see any results :( Not sure if it is the lotion in general, or if there was something wrong with the bottle that I rcvd? I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results, so I purchased a bottle Smile You&#x27;re Darker lotion from my tanning salon and love it! Immediate results! I think it is the best lotion that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Great timing:) it smells good before and after and worked instantly. You have to et this product!!</li>
            <li> Gives great color! Not orange, but still dark. You can notice a difference in one tanning session. Leaves skin feeling moisturized and smooth. No after tan smell. Smells very tropical.</li>
            <li> It is a really great bronzer that is lightly scented. I am very satisfied with this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Woww is right this stuff is GREAT!!  I could tell a difference after my 1st use.  I just keep getting darker and darker!!  Has a really pleasant smell as well.  I didnt smell like I just baked in a tanning bed!!</li>
            <li> Great for a starter lotion, good smell and decent coverage, but a bit thick. I would highly recommend using if you have color tats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times and it stinks, it smells absolutely nothing like the previous bottles I purchased from my tanning salon. I&#x27;m very disappointed because it&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! So much cheaper buying it here than buying it at the salon!</li>
            <li> I get shades darker every time I use this.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion! It goes on smoothly and while it is a slight brown color it does not leave any streaks. I have only used it a few times but my skin is so smooth and I am definitely gaining a great natural brown tan. And it smells like a pina colada!</li>
            <li> smells amazing and no after tan smell</li>
            <li> I have a decent base tan already, but I used this twice in a level 2 bed, for 12 mins each...love it! Great color already!! and great smell... It&#x27;s a thick but light lotion and it&#x27;s the first lotion I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t give me that \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot;... Also, my arms are mostly tattooed (not sleeved) and They dont end up looking dull after tanning, it kinda gives them a good glow. It&#x27;s about $70 at my salon and this was a great deal! Try it!!</li>
            <li> nice lotion. Love the smell, but it was already outdated when it arrived. I know you can still use the lotion until it begins to seperate, but it would have been nice to get a bottle still in date.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! smells good, feels nice, works well. I am only a little tan so far, and this did not make me look like I used &amp;#34;fake tanner&amp;#34; like some other brands of dark bronzers can do.</li>
            <li> My new favorite. Smells amazing, dark tanning results, and wonderful for tattoos. :) It gets sold in our local tanning salon for $80+ a bottle!</li>
            <li> I just received mine in the mail and it&#x27;s expired :-( June 2014.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Ordered this lotion as an emergency after I spent $75 for another lotion at my salon that was junk.  Vendor, the tan man, shipped immediately which was appreciated. The product is amazing-  smells great, moisturizes,  leaves a nice sheen, and after 1 session, knocks the other lotion out of the water. Color is deep bronzed.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see that Amazon had my tanning lotion for a great price on here after I had been accustom to the pretty outrageous prices at the Salon. I was almost out and was worried about shelling out $75 for another bottle of lotion, so I tried to buy off here, even though my salon specialist told me not to do it. Conveniently behind the sticker is the expiration date.... Which was going to expire in 28 days. Already, the smell wasn&#x27;t the same, I put it on one arm and my original lotion on the other arm, and I didn&#x27;t get nearly as tan as I usually do, and I smelled like burned skin on the amazon lotion arm as opposed to my salon lotion arm. I did the test so you wouldn&#x27;t have to, haha. Because the lotion is fresher at the salon, it&#x27;s creamier, smells better, and the bronzers in this lotion are more effective than a nearly expired lotion. I wound up spending the $25 here on Amazon for the lotion AND $75 for &amp;#34;fresh lotion,&amp;#34; at the salon anyway, so I paid more than what I was hoping for anyway. So, I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap; they have a bunch of expired lotions and are selling it for cheap, kinda like an outlet. Good luck, people! This is seriously the best lotion if you want a natural looking tan (my skin is yellow pale, not blue pale, green pale, or red pale), great smelling skin, SUPER moisturized skin but not sticky, and still making sure your tattoos look great.... Mmmmm I love JWOWW Ink Drink.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Good for my tattoos and smells pretty good! I get a dark color almost immediately that lasts even with my pale freckely skin!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how fast it made me tan..&lt;br /&gt; Gave me a gorgeous color!</li>
            <li> smells like a berry pie!</li>
            <li> great smell! gets you dark quick</li>
            <li> Love it! But the 14Karat makes me darker. Chose this one for my tattoos and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Excellent JWOWW lotion base minus DHA with fruity coconut fragrance... I&#x27;ve been using it as a body lotion instead of for tanning.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Great tan for only two tries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok tanner. I don&#x27;t see anything grand about it. However, I do like jwoww&#x27;s line. This is not her greatest one.</li>
            <li> Ok people for one you DO NOT put this lotion on your face! The skin on your face is thinner and more sensitive! You need to use an actual facial lotion! You aren&#x27;t going to put a body scrub on your face! So why use body lotion on your face!? And for two this lotion is NOT a tingle! So if your lotion is causing tingling then you have been ripped off! Jwoww&#x27;s only tingle lotion is Mad Hot Tingle Bronzer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not extraordinary. There&#x27;s nothing special that it does. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my tanning experience with then without it.</li>
            <li> Works amazing:) too expensive at the tanning place I go to!  So save alot of money.. Thank god for amazon:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! It smells so good before and after you get out of the tanning bed. It has given me great color also!</li>
            <li> I ran out of both of my tanning lotions that I loved (the old JWOWW lotion &amp; Black Noir lotion), so I bought a small pack of this lotion to try at my tanning salon. I instantly loved it! It got me so much darker… and instantly! Since this is a natural black bronzer, you don&#x27;t have to worry about continuously getting tanner after getting out of the tanning bed. It works instantly and gets you the darkest possible in the tanning bed. Therefore, I do not have to worry about waiting to shower or workout or anything. I was just about to buy it at the tanning salon for $80 because I loved it so much, but then I found it on here for only $28! The girls that work at my tanning salon rolled their eyes when I told them, but whatever it was a GREAT DEAL!!!!! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known this lotion has tingle because I HATE tingle! As soon as I got into the bed my face felt like I was being pricked by thousands of needles to a point where I almost thought I was going to have to get out and put a cold wet towel on my face. On the plus side it smells decent and gave decent color but by far not the best lotion I&#x27;ve used. Also, since the tingle wasn&#x27;t advertised I now have an entire bottle of lotion that I won&#x27;t be using again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion so much. The smell is better then almost any other lotion I&#x27;ve used. You get super dark results and you don&#x27;t get that sticky feeling afterwards. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Always been a fan of the Snooki Tanning Lotion line, but JWOWW gives super fast results. I love it. :)</li>
            <li> Was expired already when i received it. Did nothing for my tan.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion excited about the color I would get. I am a avid tanner and have my own bed so I tan a lot. With this lotion I swear I lost color using it, the ingredients aren&#x27;t even the same as the bottle you purchase in the salon. I&#x27;ve bought some great lotions through amazon, but this one was a waste of time and money. I have to give it a big ZERO!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good bronzer that helped save color in tattoo work. Haven&#x27;t noticed any color fading, but than again that takes time. As far as tanning results I could tell within the first use I was shades darker. Also, has a wonderful smell and stays that way even after the tanning bed session. Highly recommend, and can&#x27;t beat amazons price +$$$</li>
            <li> I was getting ready to pay $79 for this lotion at the tanning salon and got this for 19.99 + shipping. So very happy.</li>
            <li> smells like heaven. works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Great smelling lotion.</li>
            <li> love it i only use jwows lotions now</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with my skin tone..I bought Kardashians accelerator is way better result.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Goes on smooth and smells Amazing!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and give a nice moisture enriched tan as well !</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Does not streak or leave you orange.  Just deep, dark, and sexxy!!!</li>
            <li> As always this gives the best tan. Ive tried designer skins color bomb prior which gave a good tan but has dha tanners in it and did not give the up most color possible. The scent in natural black is one that I absolutely love and follow with jwowws one and done after tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> Smells good...didn&#x27;t leave me orange and my skin felt smooth afterwards...hoping I can get dark!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much of a difference tanning with this lotion really makes. I used it and I&#x27;m tan but that could be the bed, the tanning routine, the lotion or all of the above.  I can say that every time I have used it, I get a new pimple.  However, the last couple of times I have forgone the application and have been pimple free.  This girl jwon&#x27;t be using the rest my jwoww tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Just like the sample size.. It was so inexpensive, under $30 and came in 2 days!! smells like lime and coconut lotion from bath and body works. i love this lotion</li>
            <li> Excellent bronzer for tattoos</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! I would order from this seller again!</li>
            <li> It got me dark, but then I already tan easy. What I thought it would be helpful for is to get rid of my tan lines. I used it for about a month and I still have tan lines. Also the smell is not that grate. smells like silicone. But it did work for just your basic tanning bed lotion.</li>
            <li> I love tanning and enjoy trying new lotion this lotion did nothing for me it hurt the skin on my face I did have a couple pimples on my chin and it burned when I put the lotion on. After tanning my skin felt sticky and when I touched it the tanning lotion clumped up on my skin I won&#x27;t use this again plus the lotion was super runny</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! I swear it helps me tan faster.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I currently own the JWOWW One and Done.. Sadly I ran out, and I sampled this at the local salon, and I was insantly darker than before. I figured I would give this a try, and I am amazed! .. There isn&#x27;t any thing I dislike!</li>
            <li> Love the tone my tan gets and my tattoo stays moisturized.  Not a big fan of the smell but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> Love it and still am using its I recommend it</li>
            <li> This is a great indoor tanning lotion! I think it has a wonderful smell and it gives me a nice deep natural looking color! Just what i wanted</li>
            <li> I was in love with this product until I quit tanning. I got to a certain color and stopped. Smell is alright.</li>
            <li> Is a very gd product. When I run out ill defenitly buy it again. It has made my tanning experience an awesome experience.</li>
            <li> Been using this as well as another lotion back and forth just to compare them. Thus gets me alot of color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so dark .. thanks to this lotion</li>
            <li> Smells great, and no weird after-tan odor. Applies beautifully, nice and smooth and not greasy. Very moisturizing, didn&#x27;t make me sweat in the tanning bed either. No streaking due to the natural bronzers. It helped me develop a beautiful tan and this is one I will keep using on a regular basis, it will surely become part of my regular tanning lotion rotation. Love it!!! And Amazon has an amazing price. My product was fresh and unopened and arrived quickly. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love this JWOWW lotion! Highly recommend. After just a few sessions I am dark enough to look like I&#x27;ve been tanning for a month! The smell is tropical and fruity but not overpowering. I love the fact that it is so much cheaper on Amazon than at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> Smells ok that&#x27;s the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li> Didnt like it...to greasy made my face break out bad..but thats just me..but not a bad lotion just didnt care for it</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner. This lotion made me see color very fast. It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in, but if you take your time it will be well worth it! I highly recommend this lotion to anyone who wants to see color fast!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing tanning lotion since the original JWOWW. It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands orange and it moisturizers your tattoos without fading them.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell it was doing anything after 2 weeks. Stopped using. Started to tan.</li>
            <li> Sticker was conveniently over where product indicates shelf life...good thing I already know it&#x27;s good for 18 months....however this one only had 6 mos left....not an honest selling practice.....Only good thing is I&#x27;ll probably only go past expiration by a month or two by the time it&#x27;s used up...</li>
            <li> has a nice smell.  makes my skin feel soft and not dry.  but doesn&#x27;t get as dark as I prefer.</li>
            <li> Product has an expiration date of July 6th 2015, I will not have it used in that time frame. That&#x27;s the only issue,  love the product.</li>
            <li> Love this! After two times in tanning bed had a nice tan. Love the smell. Great price fast shipping  and awesome product. Even works great in sun too!</li>
            <li> I was using JWOWW One and Done before I purchased this lotion, and let me say the Natural Black Bronzer did not disappoint. The shipping was VERY fast. It arrived 4 days ahead of the original schedule! It came sealed in plastic, and the consistency is right. The smell is fruity and scrumptious. It goes on smooth and leaves no streaks. I saw great results after one use! Two uses, and I surpassed my tanning plateau. I always give at least a couple of days to a week before writing a review to ensure that I am not giving out an opinion on something before giving it a proper chance. The JWOWW line is by far the best I have used in terms of seeing quick results that are long lasting.This lotion steps up to the hype. I would recommend this to a beginning tanner, or someone who is experienced and knows what they like. I don&#x27;t think I will be going back to Designer Skin anytime soon! Now remember, everyone is different, and some products may work and some may not. Try a little bit of everything to see what works for you!</li>
            <li> I just received this item...right on time! I love this product, it wasn&#x27;t expired, doesnt expire til 2016 and the product smells so good! I havent used it yet due to the fact its til winter here and i usually dont tan in the winter, definitely cant wait to try it though!!!</li>
            <li> I have not used this at the tanning salon yet.... my only concern is the smell... it kinda has a stinky fruity smell that i dont really like.. i compair the smell to the cheap tanning lotion at walmart.. im going tanning tomorrow i hope this lives up to its expectaions. also... it expires in October 2014 kinda close dont you think? I better use it first before my others... kinda sad about that... I have a feeling when i get my snooki ultra dark black is going to be better then this... MAYBE... it will grow on me... i just want to get darker....</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best lotion I have used so far. It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t leave you all slick like, your tattoos like almost new. The color it gives you is fantastic. I got darker in one session with this then I did in a month with my $130 bottle. The price of it just sweetens the pot haha</li>
            <li> Scent--It has a strong coconut smell, which isn&#x27;t my favorite but it&#x27;s alright. Smells the same after you tan which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Results--Eh it&#x27;s ok I guess, I noticed a little extra color afterwards but I don&#x27;t think it made me super dark. I prefer JWOWW One &amp; Done, but this would be my second choice.</li>
            <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t turn you or your hands orange.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Great for tanning beds! I will def be purchasing more! Love JWOWW! lol great buying experience! JWOWW really out did her self on this! Smells great to!</li>
            <li> I got a free trial of this at the tanning salon I go to, and I fell in love with it when I put it on. It smells fantastic, goes on smoothly, and it does the job! I love this stuff, no hesitation about buying the full size bottle : )</li>
            <li> Nice bronzer, gives a pretty tan without any streaking. The fragrance is just okay, then after tanning it is really the same, just okay.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product so far. I have used it and it does well. It has a date on it that is out of date in 2014.</li>
            <li> Great product. It gives me instant color, plus I feel like it works better than most products I&#x27;ve used. Especially for the price. And I like the fragrance too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this tanning lotion! It smells AMAZING! It smells more like a perfume lotion than a tanning lotion. It works great on my skin. It takes me a while to get dark and I get a few shades darker each time I use this. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Best product I have found to date</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was expecting.  Smells great but caused some minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I liked this product for it&#x27;s smell and results!</li>
            <li> Not that great. But smells good.</li>
            <li> Love the color I&#x27;ve gotten since I started using it. I tan quite a bit and now people are noticing more. One of the better smelling lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. As far as it rejuvenating my tattoos, I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet. I have already ordered my next bottle.</li>
            <li> Its a good product, just dont feel like my tan is a dark as it should be.  Will continue using it and see what happens though.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this and feel it works really well for indoor tanning. Better deal on amazon than purchasing at the tanning salon for sure!</li>
            <li> arrived on time, not past the expiration date. great smell and results.  great price.</li>
            <li> Literally amazing. My friend told me about JWOWW lotions so I tried it out and I&#x27;m sooo impressed. Just ordered several more</li>
            <li> I love jwow! I work at a tanning salon and this is the best natural bronzer I&#x27;ve used. I use it in a tanning bed and outside. I went camping for a week in the summer when it was 100 degrees and I used this every day (along with Crystal Faces) and I came back SO dark is was ridiculous, and it looked natural! It&#x27;s also made with ink drink complex so it&#x27;s good if you have tattoos, which I do.&lt;br /&gt;I saw people posting that it made their faces break out and I just want to say that NO ONE SHOULD BE USING BODY LOTION ON THEIR FACE. It&#x27;s just not a good idea, the skin on your face is so sensitive and you need special lotion for it. You wouldn&#x27;t just put bath and body works or Victoria&#x27;s Secret body lotion on your face, would you? I don&#x27;t think so. Other than that I absolutely adore the smell of this, it&#x27;s a strong coconut sort of smell, it just smells tropical to me. The best thing about it being a natural bronzer is that it doesn&#x27;t contain DHA so it&#x27;s a totally natural tan that&#x27;s not streaky, and it won&#x27;t just wash off.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is also NOT a tingle, tingles will always specifically say on the bottle if they are or not. I love this lotion and I personally recommend it to everyone! I actually used it today when I went tanning!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually helped me get darker, but it sure did smell good! My husband said I smelled like popcorn after using it, but I think he&#x27;s crazy. I used it for a month 6 days a week and I still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; keeps my tan dark</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice, not too strong. Works fast and gives results very quickly. Great if you want a dark tan and want to look like you&#x27;re straight from the islands. If you want that beautiful California girl golden brown tan, not sure this is for you. Hope that helped! 😊</li>
            <li> Received item in only a day!!! Super quick shipping. Product smells great, and gives great color. Doesnt leave you feeling or smelling Like tan all day. Expires in June of 2015. More than enough time to use it. Overly impressed with the lotion and quickness of the seller, will purchase again</li>
            <li> We bought the same lotion in the same bottle at the tanning salon. This is a much lighter color and much thinner consistency.</li>
            <li> Had been using 14 karat by Designer Skin, then decided to switch. Had heard a lot of good things and decided to give it a try. I was a little worried about buying off here because some of the review. Specifically the ones stating it was expired, I found no evidence of this however with my bottle!! Since using JWOWW I can tell a huge difference, so much darker. The scent is amazing! There isn&#x27;t a bad after tanning smell like some lotions have. It also leaves my skin super moisturized, 14 Karat did not. Will def keep buying!!</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my tanning lotion and I have had great success with this one. I used this to replace the JWow wedding white lotion that was limited edition and I love it. It has a great smell and does not leave the weird streaks that are unavoidable with many dark tanning lotions. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a JWoww lady, people say it turns them orange, I could not disagree more!!  it gives a natural glow right off the Jersey Shore!</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I have used in a while. Smells amazing &amp; gives you great color. would def recommend! :)</li>
