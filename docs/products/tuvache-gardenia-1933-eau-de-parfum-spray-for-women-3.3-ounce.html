            <li>A bit on the pillow cases - on my night clothes, and I&#x27;m happy as can be!</li>

            <li>The price is great too!</li>
            <li>That stuff was wonderful..</li>
            <li>It smells great!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome purfume!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I was so looking forward to having something wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO happy I did!</li>
            <li>Gardenia is breathtakingly beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am a very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>this is a great parfum,hope to get it soon.it smells wonderful.i used it as a girl cant wait</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>But it is good and I like it.</li>
            <li>Good news:</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>Purchased this item based on the &#x27;Jungle Gardenia&#x27; worn in the 80&#x27;s but does not quite smell as good as that one by Tuvache.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>most of the scents we happily remember have undergone reformulations and too many haven&#x27;t fared well.</li>
            <li>My own signature perfume became unrecognizable after fifteen years of blissfully wearing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as good as the fragrance I buy for about 3 times the price, so I can use this more often and more freely at home.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many gardenia scents trying to find something that smells as good as the original Jungle Gardenia.  </li>
            <li>I knew it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just lovely.  </li>
            <li>This parfum  spray smells better than the Jungle Gardenia.</li>
            <li>Big bottle with a great, long-lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li>Also Chanel Gardenia is way much better than this</li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews for this product I assumed that someone was able to duplicate the wonderful scent that I fell in love with some years earlier</li>
            <li>I will  keep looking for a perfume that&#x27;s more gardenia-like.</li>
            <li>No fragrance can be like it used to dur to so many regulations.  </li>
            <li>It is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>THE PACKAGING WAS ARTFUL &amp; CREATIVE.</li>
            <li>This is beautiful, heady, well-made, and exactly like the original.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you; this is very good quality.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the Tuvache fragrance, light and floral smell.  </li>
            <li>If you never had the original, you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There may be some who like a really strong fragrance, I am just not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this will be a good substitute from my old Tuvache favorite, Nectaroma.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle for a good price.</li>
            <li>Not for you if you prefer a light, barely-there scent.</li>
            <li>It is a superbly balanced perfume, heady but rounded, with no cheap synthetic notes.  </li>
            <li>I loved wearing tiny amounts on very special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to see Tuvache Gardenia.  </li>
            <li>was reading online at perfume sites and a poster said this 1933 is as close to the original as she could find, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find them?</li>
            <li>it was nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li>I thought the original one smelled sweeter with no musky smell.</li>
            <li>This is in no way the original Jungle Gardenia people.  </li>
            <li>Its staying power may be diminished in some degree (most perfumes today are the same way) but even after hours of having it on it still smells lovely!</li>
            <li>It has the exotic tropical heaviness that I liked in the former product.</li>
            <li>Have only tried this once so far, but feel that it is going to be wonderful</li>
            <li>My sweet hubby bought it for me, so I wouldn&#x27;t ever tell him, but IF you think this is the original think again; frankly this isn&#x27;t even a fragrance I would buy at all.  </li>
            <li>I loved this fragrance for its connotations with Bob Barker and Price is Right show which I watched in the early 60s.</li>
            <li>(what the heck, the price was right)!</li>
            <li>If you want baby powder then get this, but if you want a true Gardenia scent then buy Tocca Florence.</li>
            <li>That is a true Gardenia.</li>
            <li>Thought I would get a sweet, floral aroma resembling the Gardenia flower.  </li>
            <li>It is a very tinny and strong lingering smell.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it on Amazon which is much more reasonably priced than many other retailers.</li>
            <li>because I know I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s a rare thing.</li>
            <li>I would have sent it back,but it wasnt worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I remember loving the perfume one of my sisters used to wear back in the day.</li>
            <li>I saved up enough for my own bottle and continued to wear this fragrance for years after.</li>
            <li>this is very close to the original scent.  </li>
            <li>They were right.  </li>
            <li>from Price is Right.</li>
            <li>Right into the garbage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive but it beautiful</li>
            <li>but Tocca and Chanel are quite a bit higher in price but worth it.  </li>
            <li>the scent is very much like I remembered.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, not this reincarnation.</li>
            <li>I was given Jungle Gardenia perfume as a teen and fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitivity to many commercial perfumes.</li>
            <li>This eau de parfum smells enough like the original Jungle Gardenia that I can&#x27;t tell the difference!</li>
            <li>I love it, thanks for bringing it back.</li>
            <li>Smells very floral at first</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on me very long, a problem that I find with many fragrances.</li>
            <li>Thank You for keeping it available, I finally got my &amp;#34;consolation prize&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>THIS however, is a real winner.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li>However to me it doesn&#x27;t really smell like gardenia.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>Heard so much about this one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve come to the real thing</li>
            <li>Will keep it though I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Cheap enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the real gardenia perfume.</li>
            <li>However, it does have a nice smell, but not for everyday.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t last on the skin like the original</li>
            <li>Back in the day, when I wore the original Jungle Gardenia made by Tuvache, people stopped me on the street and asked me what I was wearing.  </li>
            <li>I need to use quite a bit to achieve the aura I desire, while the original required only one well-placed spritz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of ordering the Tuvache (a lot more money) comparing the two and then returning one or the other.</li>
            <li>Sorry, if anyone finds the real original would love to know where.</li>
            <li>After so many years if looking for this discontinued fragrance, and having to pay so much for the vintage version, imagine my amazement not only to see tuvache up and running, but the exact--exact!--gorgeous fragrance back at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is not strong or overpowering, and I love the gentle fragrance of gardenia.  </li>
            <li>It is a heavy, sultry, long lasting, sexy fragrance which I love.</li>
            <li>I only hope this perfume will be popular enough not to be discontinued at some point in the future,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that several spritzes on your body won&#x27;t gas your colleges/friends and seems to invoke gardenias at a distance.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same scent as I remember buying years ago under the name Jungle Gardenia.</li>
            <li>, I am sad to say because I have purchased Tuvache Gardenia in the past, in different packaging and sold by a different source and it was wonderful, but the 2 &amp;#34;parfums&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t be more different.</li>
            <li>Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product.  </li>
            <li>I spent years just wearing essential oils because of this chemical reaction but gardenia is not an essential oil even though I love it.</li>
            <li>With all the new rules that have been introduced regarding the sale and manufacturing of perfumes (thank the European Union for that)</li>
            <li>The sultriness of the original is there in momentary flashes but then dissipates into an ordinary cologne.</li>
            <li>The other one last all day and the clothes keep the fresh aroma of gardenias.</li>
            <li>The perfume reminds me the old Gardenia de Tuvache, but never the same.  </li>
            <li>When I was a young girl back in what seems like the dawn of recorded history I received a tiny bottle of &amp;#34;Tuvache Jungle Gardenia.&amp;#34;  I was thrilled because at that time (1970 or so) it was quite expensive-- a high-end department store scent.  </li>
            <li>I first began using this fragrance when I was 16, now I&#x27;m 64 and couldn&#x27;t find it for a few years.</li>
            <li>A few years ago I saw a fragrance by the same (&amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>i wore this in high school and wanted a trip down memory lane.  </li>

            <li> When I was a young girl back in what seems like the dawn of recorded history I received a tiny bottle of &amp;#34;Tuvache Jungle Gardenia.&amp;#34;  I was thrilled because at that time (1970 or so) it was quite expensive-- a high-end department store scent.  </li>
            <li> I first began using this fragrance when I was 16, now I&#x27;m 64 and couldn&#x27;t find it for a few years.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I saw a fragrance by the same (&amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> i wore this in high school and wanted a trip down memory lane.  </li>
            <li> : read the fine print, which I failed to do......</li>
            <li> Over the years since, I&#x27;ve seen it introduced in various incarnations, sadly, none of which bore a fleeting resemblance to the original.</li>
            <li> a VERY long</li>
            <li> and of course it does not linger very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the old Jungle Gardenia from years past.</li>
            <li> Essentially any fragrance comes down to whether it should be announced or discovered.</li>
            <li> I was searching for s omething close to original scent and hoped that the formula passed down would come close; very disappointing so I will continue to purchase the copy from Vermont country store which is very pricey yet does resemble the original.i</li>
            <li> It disappeared a few years later</li>
            <li> Really not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> And just as I remember, a little will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a true gardenia scent.</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> As an alcohol-based perfume, this formulation is a little lighter than the bath oil (discontinued) which I used, but all the notes are there.  </li>
            <li> This gardenia spray smells like the horrible cheap cologne sprays that you may find at your local \\&quot;five and dime store.\\</li>
            <li> Our local drug store kept it on the other side of the counter behind glass...until you paid for it!</li>
            <li> Bad news: it doesn&#x27;t last longer than it takes to cross the room.  </li>
            <li> I used it once and even after washing it off, the smell lingered until I was nauseated.  </li>
            <li> Very subtle scent, spray in my closets, on my blankets and throws.  </li>
            <li> am sorry, but I would not purchase this again</li>
            <li> STALE FOOD- HAD A DISAGREEABLE ODOR.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hate this scent, just doesn&#x27;t even seem to have a whiff of gardenias at least to me..</li>
            <li> What a disappointment and non-returnable.</li>
            <li> THE EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY SMELLED BAD LIKE</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of the perfume</li>
            <li> I tried it but was disappointed--</li>
            <li> But if you want to trail in the footsteps of Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth and Natalie Wood, you probably will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells very floral at first but I wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see Tuvache Gardenia.  I wore this perfume for years from the 60&#x27;s to the 80&#x27;s.  At that point it had been discontinued and I was buying it up from any where I could. I even called Tuvache. They told me yes, they still made Tuvache Gardenia, but it wasn&#x27;t the same formula.  They were right.  It just doesn&#x27;t have the same smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not Jungle Gardenia. I was disappointed in the quality of the perfume and  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same scent as I remember buying years ago under the name Jungle Gardenia. It is a heavy, sultry, long lasting, sexy fragrance which I love. Not for you if you prefer a light, barely-there scent.</li>
            <li> I was searching for s omething close to original scent and hoped that the formula passed down would come close; very disappointing so I will continue to purchase the copy from Vermont country store which is very pricey yet does resemble the original.i don&#x27;t hate this scent, just doesn&#x27;t even seem to have a whiff of gardenias at least to me..</li>
            <li> I first began using this fragrance when I was 16, now I&#x27;m 64 and couldn&#x27;t find it for a few years. I love it, thanks for bringing it back.</li>
            <li> I loved this fragrance for its connotations with Bob Barker and Price is Right show which I watched in the early 60s. He always gave away &amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34; by Tuvache...it sounded so elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reading online at perfume sites and a poster said this 1933 is as close to the original as she could find, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!!!!!!!!  Gardenia is breathtakingly beautiful fragrance. It&#x27;s just lovely.  Thank You for keeping it available, I finally got my &amp;#34;consolation prize&amp;#34; ha ha! from Price is Right. Bob Barker gave away a lotta Hawaiian Isle trips, too.</li>
            <li> This parfum  spray smells better than the Jungle Gardenia. The smell is closer to what I remember! I was so excited to find them?</li>
            <li> The perfume reminds me the old Gardenia de Tuvache, but never the same.  It don&#x27;t last on the skin like the original one.&lt;br /&gt;It has the gardenia aroma ,for a short time.  The other one last all day and the clothes keep the fresh aroma of gardenias.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as good as the fragrance I buy for about 3 times the price, so I can use this more often and more freely at home.  A bit on the pillow cases - on my night clothes, and I&#x27;m happy as can be!</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon and chose it because I used to like Tuvache Jungle Gardenia, which I wore I think in the &#x27;60s. This fragrance is very similar. It has the exotic tropical heaviness that I liked in the former product. It doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on me very long, a problem that I find with many fragrances. But it is good and I like it.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit lasts for way too long.&lt;br /&gt;There may be some who like a really strong fragrance, I am just not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry, but I would not purchase this again, I am sad to say because I have purchased Tuvache Gardenia in the past, in different packaging and sold by a different source and it was wonderful, but the 2 &amp;#34;parfums&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t be more different.</li>
            <li> When I was a young girl back in what seems like the dawn of recorded history I received a tiny bottle of &amp;#34;Tuvache Jungle Gardenia.&amp;#34;  I was thrilled because at that time (1970 or so) it was quite expensive-- a high-end department store scent.  I loved wearing tiny amounts on very special occasions.  It disappeared a few years later but I always remembered it.  A few years ago I saw a fragrance by the same (&amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34;) name marketed by Evyan.  I tried it but was disappointed-- it was nothing like the original.  THIS however, is a real winner.  A little goes a VERY long way-- so be judicious with it.  But it is absolutely wonderful and identical to the memory.  And that&#x27;s a rare thing.</li>
            <li> This does not even have a similarity in svent of the tuvache jungle gardenia i use to wear.I would have sent it back,but it wasnt worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Good news: the scent is very much like I remembered.  Bad news: it doesn&#x27;t last longer than it takes to cross the room.  Back in the day, when I wore the original Jungle Gardenia made by Tuvache, people stopped me on the street and asked me what I was wearing.  My clothes retained the scent as did my closet.  Sadly, not this reincarnation.</li>
            <li> Have only tried this once so far, but feel that it is going to be wonderful this will be a good substitute from my old Tuvache favorite, Nectaroma.</li>
            <li> Big bottle with a great, long-lasting fragrance! People complimented me and asked where I got it. It also arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I am a very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to smell like Gardenia. This has a lot of Baby Powder scent to it. If you want baby powder then get this, but if you want a true Gardenia scent then buy Tocca Florence. That is a true Gardenia. Also Chanel Gardenia is way much better than this but Tocca and Chanel are quite a bit higher in price but worth it.  Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many gardenia scents trying to find something that smells as good as the original Jungle Gardenia.  Tuvache Gardenia 1933 is the closest I&#x27;ve found.  The price is great too!</li>
            <li> I was given Jungle Gardenia perfume as a teen and fell in love with the scent.  I have searched diligently for this fragrance but learned to my dismay that the company that made this perfume is no longer in business.  After reading some of the reviews for this product I assumed that someone was able to duplicate the wonderful scent that I fell in love with some years earlier but I could not have been more wrong.  This gardenia spray smells like the horrible cheap cologne sprays that you may find at your local \\&quot;five and dime store.\\&quot;  I used it once and even after washing it off, the smell lingered until I was nauseated.  Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product.  FYI: read the fine print, which I failed to do......this item is non-returnable and non refundable, so you will be throwing your money away should you order it as I did.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Tuvache fragrance, light and floral smell.  However to me it doesn&#x27;t really smell like gardenia.  Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t mix so well with my chemistry.  I will  keep looking for a perfume that&#x27;s more gardenia-like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the old Jungle Gardenia from years past. My granny used to wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> Really not what I was expecting.  Thought I would get a sweet, floral aroma resembling the Gardenia flower.  Not so much.</li>
            <li> this is a great parfum,hope to get it soon.it smells wonderful.i used it as a girl cant wait ti get some again..</li>
            <li> Simply dont&#x27; like it l  Doesn&#x27;t smell like Gardenia that that I know.</li>
            <li> I used Tuvache Jungle Gardenia in the 1970&#x27;s, and it became my signature.  As an alcohol-based perfume, this formulation is a little lighter than the bath oil (discontinued) which I used, but all the notes are there.  It is a superbly balanced perfume, heady but rounded, with no cheap synthetic notes.  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you; this is very good quality.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Gardenia.  I was expecting something to last longer and have a Jungle Gardenia Smell.  My husband does like it.</li>
            <li> Heard so much about this one. No fragrance can be like it used to dur to so many regulations.  Smells good but mine does not last. Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Tuvache Gardenia 1933 Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 3.3 Ounce~~~ it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve come to the real thing but it&#x27;s still not TUVACHE from the 70&#x27;s. That stuff was wonderful.. this one can give you a headache and of course it does not linger very long.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this purfume forever!!! It is my all time favorite. It smells great!!! Just like I remember!! Awesome purfume!! Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does smell like gardenia. But smells musky/ woody. I thought the original one smelled sweeter with no musky smell. Will keep it though I really don&#x27;t like it. Cheap enough. But buyer beware!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment and non-returnable. I was so looking forward to having something wonderful. Lost money. Smells horrible. Right into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitivity to many commercial perfumes. I spent years just wearing essential oils because of this chemical reaction but gardenia is not an essential oil even though I love it. I took a gamble on this and it turned out well. It&#x27;s light enough that several spritzes on your body won&#x27;t gas your colleges/friends and seems to invoke gardenias at a distance.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle for a good price. The sultriness of the original is there in momentary flashes but then dissipates into an ordinary cologne. I need to use quite a bit to achieve the aura I desire, while the original required only one well-placed spritz. If you never had the original, you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this. But if you want to trail in the footsteps of Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth and Natalie Wood, you probably will be disappointed. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering the Tuvache (a lot more money) comparing the two and then returning one or the other. Essentially any fragrance comes down to whether it should be announced or discovered.</li>
            <li> I knew it was too good to be true.  I&#x27;ll stick to the real gardenia perfume. It&#x27;s more expensive but it beautiful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still my favorite.  Very subtle scent, spray in my closets, on my blankets and throws.  It is not strong or overpowering, and I love the gentle fragrance of gardenia.  I realize this a personal, individual choice, but this is the one for me.  So glad I found it on Amazon which is much more reasonably priced than many other retailers.</li>
            <li> Not a true gardenia scent. It is a very tinny and strong lingering smell.  I do not suggest you purchanse this.</li>
            <li> This is in no way the original Jungle Gardenia people.  My sweet hubby bought it for me, so I wouldn&#x27;t ever tell him, but IF you think this is the original think again; frankly this isn&#x27;t even a fragrance I would buy at all.  Sorry, if anyone finds the real original would love to know where.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item based on the &#x27;Jungle Gardenia&#x27; worn in the 80&#x27;s but does not quite smell as good as that one by Tuvache.  However, it does have a nice smell, but not for everyday.</li>
            <li> THE PACKAGING WAS ARTFUL &amp; CREATIVE. THE EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY SMELLED BAD LIKE STALE FOOD- HAD A DISAGREEABLE ODOR.</li>
            <li> this is very close to the original scent.  i wore this in high school and wanted a trip down memory lane.  will buy a second bottle</li>
            <li> I remember loving the perfume one of my sisters used to wear back in the day. It was Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache. Our local drug store kept it on the other side of the counter behind glass...until you paid for it! I saved up enough for my own bottle and continued to wear this fragrance for years after. Unfortunately, as it seems with most things we become attached to, this heady scent and the company that produced it faded away...sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Over the years since, I&#x27;ve seen it introduced in various incarnations, sadly, none of which bore a fleeting resemblance to the original. Currently, there is a version being offered as \\&quot;Jungle Gardenia\\&quot;, but in my opinion it&#x27;s in name only! From what I understand, the rights to that name were awarded to one company while the rights to the name \\&quot;Tuvache\\&quot; went to another. I&#x27;m guessing whoever got the Tuvache title also received the rights to the formula!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  With all the new rules that have been introduced regarding the sale and manufacturing of perfumes (thank the European Union for that) most of the scents we happily remember have undergone reformulations and too many haven&#x27;t fared well. My own signature perfume became unrecognizable after fifteen years of blissfully wearing it. I&#x27;ve yet to run across another to take its place. But I happened upon Tuvache 1933 Gardenia and started reading some of the reviews and decided to take a chance (what the heck, the price was right)! I&#x27;m SO happy I did! This eau de parfum smells enough like the original Jungle Gardenia that I can&#x27;t tell the difference! Its staying power may be diminished in some degree (most perfumes today are the same way) but even after hours of having it on it still smells lovely! And just as I remember, a little will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I only hope this perfume will be popular enough not to be discontinued at some point in the future, because I know I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> After so many years if looking for this discontinued fragrance, and having to pay so much for the vintage version, imagine my amazement not only to see tuvache up and running, but the exact--exact!--gorgeous fragrance back at a reasonable price. This is beautiful, heady, well-made, and exactly like the original. Thank you!!! If you have been looking for the discontinued dream of a fragrance, this is indeed it.</li>
