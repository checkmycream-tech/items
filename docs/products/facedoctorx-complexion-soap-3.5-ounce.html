    <ol>
            <li>This is the best product ever made for clearing your skin.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it has been the best soap for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Put some in your mug and brush and you are on your way to the best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I have the best results when I lather up and leae on my face for about a minute.</li>
            <li>Great Soap for breakouts!  </li>
            <li>but my complexion is beautiful ...</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a beautiful glow..</li>
            <li>Everyone I recommend it to has seen great results.</li>
            <li>Works great without drying my skin out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very strongly fragranced!  </li>
            <li>Good by razor burns and skin problems from oily shave cream.</li>
            <li>Good luck...</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it, despite its good price.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a good product...</li>
            <li>I have bought this soap for 3 people and they love it!</li>
            <li>I have to say thank you for this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It equals more than a dozen cans of shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;and works much better!</li>
            <li>My first bar lasted from 4-25-13, and is still not completelygone after almost 4 1/2 mos, so it is a great purchase for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More people need to know this is the end all cure for any of your skin problems.</li>
            <li>And most made it even worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is overwhelming and I am allergic to perfumes in soaps and laundry detergents.  </li>
            <li>and I have purchased this through Amazon many, many times.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap along with face surgeon soap which totaled more than $25.</li>
            <li>and I love it..</li>
            <li>It does more than what it says...</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the soap is so strong that it immediately triggered my allergies, my nose started running</li>
            <li>but this is the best soap I ever had because of its strong cleaning effect while being gentle at the same time.</li>
            <li>I am not an precisely an expert</li>
            <li>I have used FaceDoctor Complexion Soap for many years with lots of success.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when it arrived, and tried it immediately.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>This product is not the original product I have been using.  </li>
            <li>Made with Non-Organic materials that irritate the pores and wont help you get clear skin you deserve, There are much better alternatives that are organic and healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li>and I certainly wish someone had warned me ahead of time as I am out over $30!!</li>
            <li>Melted quickly, turned to mush.  </li>
            <li>And it made my skin super oily and caused my face to break out .</li>
            <li>This soap along with increased water intake (no sodas) and healthy eating has nearly knocked out my rosacea.</li>
            <li>Just like another reviewer, I noticed right away that the color and smell had both changed dramatically.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was right on time and all is well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made for sensitive skin &amp; is oil free with an SPF 15.</li>
            <li>This soap is not very well milled and doesn&#x27;t make a lather that lasts the required 2 minutes for effective treatment.</li>
            <li>Years ago when I first started using it, it also seemed to work with redness I had on my face associated with seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I think so too!&lt;br /&gt;It last for a long time too, so a great value.</li>
            <li>Some of these products have lye and are made in China where certain unwanted chemicals are still used.</li>
            <li>Um...not really working for me yet.</li>
            <li>and I get very nervous when I start to run out because I feel as though&lt;</li>
            <li>The moisturizer I use with it is Simple protecting light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and this soap is gentle and does help.  </li>
            <li>I developed a redness on my face right around the time I turned 50, and was going through para-menopause.  </li>
            <li>A little controversial</li>
            <li>Following the instructions of leaving it on for only 10 seconds the first time, my face felt smooth, and my skin felt calmed of the redness.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I feel that I have wasted my money and went and ordered it from the original person I ordered from on Amazon and got the right soap.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, any important ingredients that are present are in very small quantities.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more little red rosea nose and perfect for acne.</li>
            <li>This new formulation is clearly causing damage to my skin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t broken out in many years!  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything to clear my skin from acne.</li>
            <li>and you will have clear skin.</li>
            <li>Use this and you will have clear skin.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, no matter what products I used stating they relieved or calmed redness of the face, nothing seemed to clear it up.  </li>
            <li>day over lunch, my cousin and I were discussing the topic of redness on her face, and she told me about this soap that she found, and how it made her rosacea clear up.</li>
            <li>I too snickered at the mite thing, but decided for the price, $13.49 ($8.50 + 4.99 shipping direct from FaceDoctoR)</li>
            <li>Since this is supposed to help with sensitive skin, why on earth would they put any fragrance in it?  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it every night and loves how soft it leaves her face.</li>
            <li>typically do NOT write reviews, but felt if I could help someone else relieve their Rosacea problems</li>
            <li>I bought three new bars in February and finally broke out one of the new bars last week as I  finished the last of my old bars.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times; but after each time, I seem to look and feel a little better!</li>
            <li>I am happy my kids won&#x27;t have to deal with having skin as bad as I had it.</li>
            <li>(pores had not closed up).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seabuckthorn went from the second most to the second least.</li>
            <li>It is a different color and smells different and made my face breakout whereas the one I have been buying for years on Amazon has kept my skin clear.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Besides different colour, scent, and feel of the soap on my face, it left my face extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy not to have that red, swollen and very painful nose.</li>
            <li> So many people have sensitivity to artificial scents.</li>
            <li> Skin was smoother but did not clear up or prevent breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and use it on my face as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Face did feel clean and refreshed but a less expensive cleanser could have done the same thing.</li>
            <li> My rosacea is not completely gone, but it has drastically improved the look of my complexion &amp; skin tone, and I have only a little redness on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a period of a few short weeks, I noticed my skin changing.  </li>
            <li> Then after a few days I noticed I was breaking out in several places!  </li>
            <li> My pores seemed smaller, my breakouts were getting to be less and less, and the redness was clearing up.</li>
            <li> After all, I&#x27;d already spent lots of money on other products and had gotten no results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a hormonal change related thing or not.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Does nothing different than ordinary soap from any retail store.  </li>
            <li> I have to be very careful what is used on my face because of Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cost of returning (shipping &amp; handling) is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a waste of money .</li>
            <li> Supposedly it controls little bugs, or something.  </li>
            <li> Was recommended this soap by a friend and after weeks of use it works no better than any other soap</li>
            <li> I have been getting the very nasty red yucky huge Rosacea bumps on my nose for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Very frustrated to have been misled and did more damage to my skin because of it.</li>
            <li> This is not the original facedoctorx soap that I have previously ordered on Amazon and am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I read about Seabuckthorn helping to cure or at least control it, so I tried this soap (and matching cream).  </li>
            <li> This stuff will melt your face and make you feel worse than you already do.</li>
            <li> Ive tried everything for acne, just another failed test.</li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have had bad acne since I was 13.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i have used this  type of soap for years.  It clears the reddening on both sides  of my nose on my face.  Been using it for 15 years.</li>
            <li> This stuff will melt your face and make you feel worse than you already do. Made with Non-Organic materials that irritate the pores and wont help you get clear skin you deserve, There are much better alternatives that are organic and healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li> Um...not really working for me yet. Don&#x27;t like that it leaves a soap film on my skin - even when I rinse with a cloth.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to clear my skin from acne. I discovered this a few years ago. Even after my acne cleared up from my teenage years, I still got the occasional breakout. This is the best product ever made for clearing your skin. Nothing compares. It kills off whatever bacteria you have that causes acne. Use this and you will have clear skin. I am happy my kids won&#x27;t have to deal with having skin as bad as I had it. More people need to know this is the end all cure for any of your skin problems. Use this and you will have clear skin. Everyone I recommend it to has seen great results. Buy this!!</li>
            <li> This is not the same FaceDoctor Soap that I have been using and ordering from Amazon for 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;This box and the bar looked different and this soap made my face feel like it was burning.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have been getting the very nasty red yucky huge Rosacea bumps on my nose for quite a while.  I read about Seabuckthorn helping to cure or at least control it, so I tried this soap (and matching cream).  Miracle of miracles, within a week it was about gone and it has stayed gone with regular usage (about three times a week).  Supposedly it controls little bugs, or something.  A little controversial (google it yoursel) but in my case it worked, whatever it did!  I am so happy not to have that red, swollen and very painful nose. Oh yeah!</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful what is used on my face because of Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this soap for several years now and I get very nervous when I start to run out because I feel as though&lt;br /&gt;it has been the best soap for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it on my face twice a day. I do not use it as a body wash but I don&#x27;t see why a person couldn&#x27;t if they wanted to.</li>
            <li> Put some in your mug and brush and you are on your way to the best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;You think 10.00 is allot for a bar of soap? It equals more than a dozen cans of shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;and works much better! Good by razor burns and skin problems from oily shave cream.</li>
            <li> I developed a redness on my face right around the time I turned 50, and was going through para-menopause.  Not sure if this is a hormonal change related thing or not.  Nonetheless, no matter what products I used stating they relieved or calmed redness of the face, nothing seemed to clear it up.  And most made it even worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day over lunch, my cousin and I were discussing the topic of redness on her face, and she told me about this soap that she found, and how it made her rosacea clear up. She gave me the website, and I checked it out.  I too snickered at the mite thing, but decided for the price, $13.49 ($8.50 + 4.99 shipping direct from FaceDoctoR), what did I have to lose?  After all, I&#x27;d already spent lots of money on other products and had gotten no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when it arrived, and tried it immediately.  Following the instructions of leaving it on for only 10 seconds the first time, my face felt smooth, and my skin felt calmed of the redness.  I was so excited, I used it twice a day.  I ended up having to stop using it for a couple of days because it was too drying.  When I resumed using it, I decided to use it only once in the evening,right before bed.  I would wait for 10-15 minutes before putting on a moisturizer because it would burn otherwise (pores had not closed up). The moisturizer I use with it is Simple protecting light moisturizer.  It&#x27;s made for sensitive skin &amp; is oil free with an SPF 15. This regimen seems to be working well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a period of a few short weeks, I noticed my skin changing.  My pores seemed smaller, my breakouts were getting to be less and less, and the redness was clearing up. I hadn&#x27;t seen my face like this for years! My rosacea is not completely gone, but it has drastically improved the look of my complexion &amp; skin tone, and I have only a little redness on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I am making my second purchase.  My first bar lasted from 4-25-13, and is still not completelygone after almost 4 1/2 mos, so it is a great purchase for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically do NOT write reviews, but felt if I could help someone else relieve their Rosacea problems, I should write one.  I would HIGHLY recommend it.  Just make sure you follow the instructions.  Read the product info on their website, and adapt it to your routine as necessary.  Good luck...I wish you clearer skin &amp; a happier smiling face!</li>
            <li> Skin was smoother but did not clear up or prevent breakouts.  Ive tried everything for acne, just another failed test.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my rosacea and have yet to use it.  I missed the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; listed as one of the ingredients.  My fault.  The perfume is overwhelming and I am allergic to perfumes in soaps and laundry detergents.  For that reason,  I will give it away.  The cost of returning (shipping &amp; handling) is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am not an precisely an expert but this is the best soap I ever had because of its strong cleaning effect while being gentle at the same time. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> An aesthetician turned me on to this soap years ago and I have purchased this through Amazon many, many times.  I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it.  My face tends to breakout and I believe that it kills the bacteria or demodex that lives on our skin. I have the best results when I lather up and leae on my face for about a minute.</li>
            <li> It is very strongly fragranced!  Since this is supposed to help with sensitive skin, why on earth would they put any fragrance in it?  So many people have sensitivity to artificial scents.</li>
            <li> This soap is not very well milled and doesn&#x27;t make a lather that lasts the required 2 minutes for effective treatment. It is grainy (a sign of improper milling). I would not recommend it, despite its good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap along with face surgeon soap which totaled more than $25. They did not help with the redness as claimed. Face did feel clean and refreshed but a less expensive cleanser could have done the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have used FaceDoctor Complexion Soap for many years with lots of success.  I have never used it for acne, but to relieve itchy skin.  I bought three new bars in February and finally broke out one of the new bars last week as I  finished the last of my old bars.  Just like another reviewer, I noticed right away that the color and smell had both changed dramatically.  I shrugged it off and used it anyway.  Then after a few days I noticed I was breaking out in several places!  Let&#x27;s just say this...I am no teenager!!  I haven&#x27;t broken out in many years!  This new formulation is clearly causing damage to my skin and I certainly wish someone had warned me ahead of time as I am out over $30!!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers.  This product is not the original product I have been using.  Besides different colour, scent, and feel of the soap on my face, it left my face extremely dry.  I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good product...I have only used it a few times; but after each time, I seem to look and feel a little better!</li>
            <li> I have just purchased this soap from what a friend told me. I have to say thank you for this amazing product. It has cleared up my rosacea in about a week. WOW</li>
            <li> You will not get the bar described. On top of that, any important ingredients that are present are in very small quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon listing here says that the ingredients are: Neat Soap Flakes, Seabuckthorn (hippophae rhamnoides) oil, coconut oil, aloe barbadensis (aloe vera), glycerin, sodium silicate, astragalus membranaceus, spirodela polyrrhiza, tocopherol (vitamin E), protein hydrolysate, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual ingredients are: Water, glycerin, solid soap, sodium silicate, tetrasodium edta, aloe vera, tocopherol, astragalus membranaceus, coconut oil, spirodela polyrrhiza, seabuckthorn oil, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seabuckthorn went from the second most to the second least. I don&#x27;t think a \\&quot;bait and switch\\&quot; was intended here but Amazon needs to check into this.</li>
            <li> Great Soap for breakouts!  24 hour recovery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this product.  Does nothing different than ordinary soap from any retail store.  Melted quickly, turned to mush.  Horrible smell.  Check product ingredients before you use.  Some of these products have lye and are made in China where certain unwanted chemicals are still used.Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is not the original facedoctorx soap that I have previously ordered on Amazon and am very disappointed.  It is a different color and smells different and made my face breakout whereas the one I have been buying for years on Amazon has kept my skin clear.  I feel that I have wasted my money and went and ordered it from the original person I ordered from on Amazon and got the right soap.  Very frustrated to have been misled and did more damage to my skin because of it.</li>
            <li> Works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and use it on my face as an exfoliator. It works well. Years ago when I first started using it, it also seemed to work with redness I had on my face associated with seborrheic dermatitis. It does nothing for it now.</li>
            <li> I use this soap along with face surgeon and I love it.. This soap not only stop my acne breakouts but my complexion is beautiful ... I have darkskin and it has evened my skin tone ! I have bought this soap for 3 people and they love it! It does more than what it says... I always use a bar for my body only.. It gives my skin a beautiful glow.. This soap works for all skin tones and this soap is permanent in my beauty regimen</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this product. No more little red rosea nose and perfect for acne. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years.  I have rosacea and this soap is gentle and does help.  It has reduced the redness and the size of my rosacea bumps.  This soap along with increased water intake (no sodas) and healthy eating has nearly knocked out my rosacea.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it every night and loves how soft it leaves her face. I think so too!&lt;br /&gt;It last for a long time too, so a great value.</li>
            <li> I order this over and over. I like this product. Delivery was right on time and all is well.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Works great without drying my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by a friend and I would also recommened it.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 1 star because I did receive it on time . Other than that its a waste of money . The smell of the soap is so strong that it immediately triggered my allergies, my nose started running and I started sneezing . And it made my skin super oily and caused my face to break out .</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can use on my face! I have had bad acne since I was 13. This is the only thing that helps! I can never go without! It is a must in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Was recommended this soap by a friend and after weeks of use it works no better than any other soap</li>
