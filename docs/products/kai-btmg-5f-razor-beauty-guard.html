            <li>Best quality in a facial razor I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Without an effort the hair is gone, skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>Used even more hesitatingly.  </li>
            <li>I love these razors.</li>
            <li>and yes, it leaves your face just as smooth!</li>
            <li>Not quite sure what possessed me to try these.</li>
            <li>These work well much better than simular products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>These can be used more than once.</li>
            <li>I have tried other razor blades for my face and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to use will not cut your face like men&#x27;s razor&#x27;s will.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to hold, and can be used anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li>It makes applying make-up so easy.</li>
            <li>Love these razors, I will certainly buy more of these.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth, making my make-up application easier, and well set.</li>
            <li>just brush it lightly</li>
            <li>These are great for all you girls out there with facial hair and don&#x27;t want to have it..  </li>
            <li>they were cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>My face is not as smooth as when I have it done at a salon with the straightedge razor</li>
            <li>Never tried anything like this before but it was very effective at removing unwanted facial hair and peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done, I wipe my face with a warm washcloth and apply my toner then moisturizer as normal</li>
            <li>doesnt wear out fast and its really easy to use!</li>
            <li>Anyways, the performance of this razor is amazing, my skin was soft, smooth, and there was no irritation.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants good razors at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Works so good, I love it than any other shavers.</li>
            <li>Hoping they were another good Japanese razor brand, I tried them.    </li>
            <li>Why am I just now finding out about these amazing facial hair scrappers?!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think I&#x27;d ultimately rather just pay the $35.00 to the esthetician to derma-plane me.</li>
            <li>A couple of days after use my skin always looks fresh and dewy.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it removed peach fuzz and exfoliated to make my face look much brighter and clean.</li>
            <li>the quality is fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The Japanese make a great facial razor so sometimes one must demand the import version.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, got them in 2 days after thanksgiving weekend too!</li>
            <li>these are higher quality</li>
            <li>I was interested in using these for dermaplaning.  </li>
            <li>First time ordering.  </li>
            <li>bought these as a first time &amp;#34;face shaver&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>more than likely I will repurchase these again.</li>
            <li>However, I think the last time I bought these there were more in the box</li>
            <li>All I do is gently move the razor across my face and the fuzz comes right off.</li>
            <li>The razors are sharp and durable with a nice handle and cover.</li>
            <li>I got the hang of it pretty quickly and was confident with the product after the first few swipes on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It is too easy to nick facial skin,</li>
            <li>Really works well--</li>
            <li>The blue handles are comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>I am now ordering the eyebrow version... a much shorter blade</li>
            <li>These were much better than some other brands.</li>
            <li>much more so than other brands sold on Amazon</li>
            <li>These razors are sharp but they feel safe.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t cut myself in a long while and will continue to use these for the fine light-colored hair on my face.</li>
            <li>Sharp but easy to handle because its arm grip.</li>
            <li>Before I start shaving, I prep my face by massaging it with a little bit of sweet almond oil first</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but using this method, I do not have ANY irritation or issues after.</li>
            <li>Half the box was either dull or lost sharpness after a couple of uses, and the other half was just great, amazing and exactly what I wanted, but I am not paying full price just to have half a decent product.</li>
            <li>May have to use twice a week for a little while but can easily go a week.  </li>
            <li>Just tilt the blade a little and make short smooth flicks and bam!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s super sharp.</li>
            <li>Your face will be a little red after using but after a few days it is very fresh and smooth!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the ones commonly available at places like Meijer, Target, Walmart, etc.  </li>
            <li>End piece really sharp and cuts you - other than that, great and last long.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s akin to the mens&#x27; old fashioned, straight-edge shave....</li>
            <li>After now trying many other brands, this one wins hands down!!!  </li>
            <li>These work great, was not happy with other tinkle etc.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s not in English, it&#x27;s simple and very sturdy and lasts for months (each razor)!  </li>
            <li>Reviewers are right, the blade is sharp.  </li>
            <li>an actually return the product.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the sharp/edge issue, they feel welt built and are not your everyday cheap beauty</li>
            <li>Having a little trouble getting used to this concept, I always think I am doing it right, but then I get into different light and see that I didn&#x27;t get them all.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a modified &amp;#34;dermaplane&amp;#34; blade and this is the complete opposite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 1 blade so far</li>
            <li>Only used 2 blades so far.</li>
            <li>Much better than other ones i&#x27;ve had in past.</li>
            <li>Will burn a little if you put a toner on right after but not a big deal.  </li>
            <li>Others I&#x27;ve used dull quickly.</li>
            <li>(I have dry and sensitive skin.).</li>
            <li>I had several Shiseido brand razors that I bought in Taipei (where Japanese products are widely available) about 10 years ago and was on my last one which was very dull.  </li>

            <li> Much better than other ones i&#x27;ve had in past.</li>
            <li> Will burn a little if you put a toner on right after but not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Others I&#x27;ve used dull quickly.</li>
            <li> (I have dry and sensitive skin.).</li>
            <li> I had several Shiseido brand razors that I bought in Taipei (where Japanese products are widely available) about 10 years ago and was on my last one which was very dull.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the Personna brand of razors for quite a long time to get rid of unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I use short, careful strokes (it&#x27;s a razor</li>
            <li> Searching at stores in the US resulted in several brands that were neither sharp or shaped well for my use.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s sharp), and wipe the blade on a dry washcloth in between.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s to be expected from a razor.</li>
            <li> You have to be really careful because the corners don&#x27;t have safety guards</li>
            <li> I was careful and slow and used a shave cream from lush.</li>
            <li> I also have to mention that with this razor there is no need to press down hard, these blades are sharp enough so that you dont have to press hard on your skin or hold the razor at a certain angle.</li>
            <li> The blades glide through hair such as eyebrows with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of other KAI products and I find this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I had no cuts with these like the other brands I tried and</li>
            <li> yes the blade is sharp, but that makes for a painless deplaning.</li>
            <li> They have a safety guard for those of you that are worried about them being too sharp.</li>
            <li> and these didn&#x27;t seem quite as sharp as the other ones.</li>
            <li> need to be very careful as the blade is extremely sharp, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how someone raved about these (and was a sucker to buy because of it!)</li>
            <li> Very smooth an efficient to remove that annoying peachfuzz.</li>
            <li> They can leave the skin red and scratched if you press down too hard on them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to get them as an add-on.</li>
            <li> Less irritation that way.</li>
            <li> Inexplicably, despite being almost too dull to actually shave away any hair, these left my skin sore and actually bleeding in a few places.</li>
            <li> They come with little protectors to avoid mishaps when not in use.</li>
            <li> The curved corners of the blade are also VERY sharp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never nicked myself on the face using this razor, but I have had a few times on my legs (usually when I&#x27;m impatient).</li>
            <li> These razors work very well on my face and they have a safety guard so it would be very difficult to cut yourself with them.  </li>
            <li> too expensive to keep going back</li>
            <li> Works so easily no need to maneuver and try hard.</li>
            <li> you have to press down VERY hard to get this to work</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to press hard at all to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my face, apply layer of Ponds cold cream, and then use this razor to shave my entire face.</li>
            <li> Use it at a 45 degree angle and go slow---</li>
            <li> Extremely painful way to remove facial hair...</li>
            <li> Razor seems very dull.</li>
            <li> however, one of the boxes had three blades missing from it!!!????</li>
            <li> Not a good idea :(</li>
            <li> these are the worst because the blade is so thick that it does do what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Maybe mine was a part of a defective batch :(  </li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> doesnt wear out fast and its really easy to use!</li>
            <li> Works so good, I love it than any other shavers.</li>
            <li> These razors are the best I&#x27;ve ever used for that never ending peach fuzz on my face! My face is so smooth, making my make-up application easier, and well set. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, got them in 2 days after thanksgiving weekend too! These work great, was not happy with other tinkle etc. these are higher quality</li>
            <li> Really works well--need to be very careful as the blade is extremely sharp, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was interested in using these for dermaplaning.  The curved corners of the blade are also VERY sharp! The 1st time I tried to use these, I cut the c**p out of my face! And ALL of the writing (instructions ) on the box was in Chinese. Which of course I couldn&#x27;t read.</li>
            <li> Reviewers are right, the blade is sharp.  Having a little trouble getting used to this concept, I always think I am doing it right, but then I get into different light and see that I didn&#x27;t get them all.  Honestly, I think I&#x27;d ultimately rather just pay the $35.00 to the esthetician to derma-plane me.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product in japan. The pruduct we received on this order was the same product we used in Japan and it is great.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome best facial razors I have ever used one easy swipe bam hairs are gone you don&#x27;t need to apply pressure just brush it lightly and it works great they do not look cheap either good quality and perfomance</li>
            <li> these are the best quality I have found so far, pretty good for that peach fuzz on your face ladies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and I use this type of razor to keep my eyebrows groomed.  I had several Shiseido brand razors that I bought in Taipei (where Japanese products are widely available) about 10 years ago and was on my last one which was very dull.  Searching at stores in the US resulted in several brands that were neither sharp or shaped well for my use.  I decided to order some more Shiseido ones but saw these for a lower price.  Hoping they were another good Japanese razor brand, I tried them.    These are great!  These might even be the best ones I&#x27;ve used.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the ones commonly available at places like Meijer, Target, Walmart, etc.  The Japanese make a great facial razor so sometimes one must demand the import version.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! Very smooth an efficient to remove that annoying peachfuzz. Your face will be a little red after using but after a few days it is very fresh and smooth! You don&#x27;t have to press hard at all to remove the hair. Just tilt the blade a little and make short smooth flicks and bam! Hair is gone! Love these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the instructions came in english too.</li>
            <li> Here is the thing, I gave it 2 stars because product inconsistency. Half the box was either dull or lost sharpness after a couple of uses, and the other half was just great, amazing and exactly what I wanted, but I am not paying full price just to have half a decent product. Maybe mine was a part of a defective batch :(  whatever that is I was left disappointied  an actually return the product.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the sharp/edge issue, they feel welt built and are not your everyday cheap beauty razor.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the title says 1 pc, but you actually get a box with 5 razors.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, someday, I&#x27;ll try them again and update this accordingly.</li>
            <li> Love use all the time.</li>
            <li> I ordered five boxes of the Razor Beauty Blade Guards.  All five boxes arrived on schedule however, one of the boxes had three blades missing from it!!!????</li>
            <li> I am a fan of other KAI products and I find this is no exception. This package includes five (5) blades, which is a great deal.  The blades glide through hair such as eyebrows with very little effort. The blue handles are comfortable to hold and use. These are made in Japan to the highest standards. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Why am I just now finding out about these amazing facial hair scrappers?!</li>
            <li> First time ordering.  these rocked.  End piece really sharp and cuts you - other than that, great and last long.</li>
            <li> Best quality in a facial razor I have purchased.</li>
            <li> These are great for all you girls out there with facial hair and don&#x27;t want to have it..  Easy to use will not cut your face like men&#x27;s razor&#x27;s will.  Will burn a little if you put a toner on right after but not a big deal.  May have to use twice a week for a little while but can easily go a week.  I will be reordering when I need to.</li>
            <li> Oh my. These work so great! Without an effort the hair is gone, skin so smooth! Much better than other ones i&#x27;ve had in past. Works so easily no need to maneuver and try hard. But it&#x27;s super sharp. I cut above my eyebrow without even realizing. But that&#x27;s to be expected from a razor. Just need to be cautious.</li>
            <li> bought these as a first time &amp;#34;face shaver&amp;#34;. I was impressed. I was careful and slow and used a shave cream from lush. I got the hang of it pretty quickly and was confident with the product after the first few swipes on my cheeks. I feel like it removed peach fuzz and exfoliated to make my face look much brighter and clean.</li>
            <li> These were much better than some other brands. I had no cuts with these like the other brands I tried and more than likely I will repurchase these again.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how someone raved about these (and was a sucker to buy because of it!) these are the worst because the blade is so thick that it does do what I was looking for.  I wanted a modified &amp;#34;dermaplane&amp;#34; blade and this is the complete opposite.  I&#x27;m not returning them &#x27;cause they were cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These razors work very well on my face and they have a safety guard so it would be very difficult to cut yourself with them.  My face is not as smooth as when I have it done at a salon with the straightedge razor but then again I&#x27;m doing it myself and it costs $3 instead of $35.  So yes I will keep buying these, and de fuzzing my own face. Very good value.</li>
            <li> Never tried anything like this before but it was very effective at removing unwanted facial hair and peach fuzz. The razors are sharp and durable with a nice handle and cover.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Skips, scrapes and does not cut hair.  Razor seems very dull.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  After now trying many other brands, this one wins hands down!!!  So, it&#x27;s not in English, it&#x27;s simple and very sturdy and lasts for months (each razor)!  Use it at a 45 degree angle and go slow---yes the blade is sharp, but that makes for a painless deplaning.</li>
            <li> Works great and came to me lightening quick! Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> I bought these last year and still use it today. I&#x27;ve only used 1 blade so far and it&#x27;s still in good condition. I use these razors on my entire face and neck. Before I start shaving, I prep my face by massaging it with a little bit of sweet almond oil first and then I add on another layer of oil (I have dry and sensitive skin.). Less irritation that way. I brush it very lightly and it manages to take off all the hair.   Update 3/23/16: Only used 2 blades so far. Instead of using with the oil, I now use it with Goat Milk Stuff&#x27;s Cedarwood Vanilla shaving soap (since 2015). I&#x27;ll never go back to using anything else. I&#x27;ve never nicked myself on the face using this razor, but I have had a few times on my legs (usually when I&#x27;m impatient).</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking it was just one piece, just one razor when in fact five come in this pack. I was pleasantly surprised. Anyways, the performance of this razor is amazing, my skin was soft, smooth, and there was no irritation. I also have to mention that with this razor there is no need to press down hard, these blades are sharp enough so that you dont have to press hard on your skin or hold the razor at a certain angle. They are easy to hold, and can be used anywhere on the body. Love these razors, I will certainly buy more of these.</li>
            <li> I was scared.  I had dermablading done... &amp;#34;professionally.&amp;#34;  loved it.  too expensive to keep going back and then I found these.  I ordered hesitatingly.  Used even more hesitatingly.  VOILA  wonderful.  I am now ordering the eyebrow version... a much shorter blade</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of this product. I have tried other razor blades for my face and this is the best. the quality is fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is too easy to nick facial skin, much more so than other brands sold on Amazon</li>
            <li> Sharp but easy to handle because its arm grip. I use it on my eyebrows as well as my upper lip and have not had razor burn.</li>
            <li> I love these razors. I bought them to defuzz my face and I don&#x27;t regret it for a second. They have a safety guard for those of you that are worried about them being too sharp. All I do is gently move the razor across my face and the fuzz comes right off. They are great for exfoliation as well. It makes applying make-up so easy. My only complaint is that I have to get them as an add-on. I wish I could just purchase them separately.</li>
            <li> Also exfoliates!!!!! I&#x27;m so happy I tried this. These razors are sharp but they feel safe. They come with little protectors to avoid mishaps when not in use.</li>
            <li> Extremely painful way to remove facial hair...you have to press down VERY hard to get this to work and then you are left with very red and sore skin....Not a good idea :(</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors after trying the Tinkle razors. I love these and find they work much better!  I wash my face, apply layer of Ponds cold cream, and then use this razor to shave my entire face. It&#x27;s akin to the mens&#x27; old fashioned, straight-edge shave....and yes, it leaves your face just as smooth! I use short, careful strokes (it&#x27;s a razor, it&#x27;s sharp), and wipe the blade on a dry washcloth in between. I have very sensitive skin but using this method, I do not have ANY irritation or issues after. When I&#x27;m done, I wipe my face with a warm washcloth and apply my toner then moisturizer as normal</li>
            <li> Pass on these. I&#x27;ve been a user of the Personna brand of razors for quite a long time to get rid of unwanted facial hair. Not quite sure what possessed me to try these. Inexplicably, despite being almost too dull to actually shave away any hair, these left my skin sore and actually bleeding in a few places. They&#x27;re big and unwieldy, so if you&#x27;re planning to use them on eyebrows you&#x27;re going to end up eyebrowless. Sometimes you should just stick with what works, I suppose.</li>
            <li> These definitely do the job. However, I think the last time I bought these there were more in the box and these didn&#x27;t seem quite as sharp as the other ones. You have to be really careful because the corners don&#x27;t have safety guards and you can cut yourself. However, I haven&#x27;t cut myself in a long while and will continue to use these for the fine light-colored hair on my face.</li>
            <li> These work well much better than simular products I&#x27;ve used. Others I&#x27;ve used dull quickly. These can be used more than once. They can leave the skin red and scratched if you press down too hard on them. A couple of days after use my skin always looks fresh and dewy.  I would recommend to anyone who wants good razors at a reasonable price.</li>
