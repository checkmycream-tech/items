            <li>Great toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Great value for saving</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s state-of-the-art and very effective in cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it felt good to brush with.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than using my dogs&#x27; toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Sharing with a dog is so much more stressful than you would believe!</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>this world this particular toothbrush is great!</li>
            <li>Clean well and have good durability.</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>These brushes are the best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing the Sensodyne soft brushes through Amazon and they are great and softer as needed.</li>
            <li>Great brush, a bit soft to my opinion.</li>
            <li>Cool Oral-b brushes:-)</li>
            <li>Even my wife made some good comments on those, she&#x27;s normally using whatever available to her without any complains, yet she did stated that they cleaning nicely and noticeably gentle with pressure points....</li>
            <li>but I actually enjoy brushing with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Nice and gentle.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth and are comfortable..</li>
            <li>I am very happy with these toothbrushes, make my teeth look super clean with less effort.</li>
            <li>but it does clean well.</li>
            <li>And my teeth do feel clean after use.</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>skeletonized neck seems kind of neat, but the gel grip is very soft and the ridges provide some traction.</li>
            <li>I like the large pro health tooth brushes better.</li>
            <li>Just fit and work right for my mouth structure.</li>
            <li>feel quickly buy still works.</li>
            <li>We liked it enough to put it on our subscription deliveries.</li>
            <li>Amazon wins again.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer using the Oral B electric brush with the Sensitive teeth soft bristle head for a deep cleaning, but the Pro-Health is perfect for my morning wakeup brushing and</li>
            <li>Love the way the bristles are soft but work well.</li>
            <li>My first time with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t show it ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleans everything, never hurts my gums, and those flexible parts provide a funny feeling</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much more affordable these were online than they were at the local grocery.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is too large.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what toothbrush I had gotten until it arrived</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>This prevents applying too much pressure to your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>and you are ready for a sleepover.....</li>
            <li>Very bendy forms to the shape of your mouth.</li>
            <li>We got one purple and one blue, so that&#x27;s good for telling each other&#x27;s brushes apart.</li>
            <li>The Pro-Health toothbrush seems to be another gimmick, but upon closer inspection, it uses a unique soft horseshoe-like suspension for the soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Works good, but too small of a head for larger mouths.  </li>
            <li>I live in a world where my toothbrush doesnt need a motor and batteries.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>At first the ridges felt slippery because of how they are grooved, but I’ve yet to have an issue with it slipping in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, follows the contours of my teeth very well, very soft bristles (just the way I like them), and doesn’t irritate my teeth or gums</li>
            <li>Oral-B Pro-Health Clinical Pro-Flex Soft Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too bad it took so many years to develop such a fine toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t think they were soft.  </li>
            <li>I skipped using my Sonicare at all the first few days.</li>

            <li> Seriously, I got a two pack of the same model from Amazon for less than a single brush of the same type costs at the store.  </li>
            <li> As Expected!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve used Oral B dental products for decades and have preferred their designs over other brands (toothbrushes, floss, electronic brushes, bristle heads).</li>
            <li> For soft bristles, this was really hard!</li>
            <li> Extra toothpaste is hard to get out of the bristles</li>
            <li> The threads are too thick and too hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a muncher unfortunately when it comes to my toothbrushes and these ones</li>

            <li> They are toothbrushes... They clean my teeth and are comfortable.. What else could I want?</li>
            <li> I think this brush is a little too big for me. And it is not as soft as I expected.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush and it does what you expect.</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective. The colors vary. These toothbrushes stand the test of time. I&#x27;m a muncher unfortunately when it comes to my toothbrushes and these ones don&#x27;t show it ;)</li>

            <li> This may sound weird but I actually enjoy brushing with this toothbrush. Maybe it&#x27;s the honeymoon effect but it does clean well. I skipped using my Sonicare at all the first few days.</li>

            <li> Oral-B Pro-Health Clinical Pro-Flex Soft Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used Oral B dental products for decades and have preferred their designs over other brands (toothbrushes, floss, electronic brushes, bristle heads). The Pro-Health toothbrush seems to be another gimmick, but upon closer inspection, it uses a unique soft horseshoe-like suspension for the soft bristles. This prevents applying too much pressure to your teeth and gums. The ultra soft bristles felt like they mapped my teeth extremely well. I still prefer using the Oral B electric brush with the Sensitive teeth soft bristle head for a deep cleaning, but the Pro-Health is perfect for my morning wakeup brushing and after-meal brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skeletonized neck seems kind of neat, but the gel grip is very soft and the ridges provide some traction. At first the ridges felt slippery because of how they are grooved, but I’ve yet to have an issue with it slipping in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, follows the contours of my teeth very well, very soft bristles (just the way I like them), and doesn’t irritate my teeth or gums</li>
            <li> The head of the brush containing the bristles detached from the handle after only 1 week of use.  Otherwise, it felt good to brush with.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my Hunny and I&#x27;s and these are great.</li>
            <li> I live in a world where my toothbrush doesnt need a motor and batteries.&lt;br /&gt;In this world this particular toothbrush is great!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes.  Love the way the bristles are soft but work well.</li>
            <li> I use these for travel.  One of these and some floss and you are ready for a sleepover.....</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth. Nothing fancy. Feels like it loses it new brush feel quickly buy still works. Great value for saving</li>
            <li> Cool Oral-b brushes:-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s number one health toot brush of oral b</li>
