    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect sized disposable exfoliating buffers!</li>

            <li>I have always loved the product!  </li>
            <li>People always complement me on my beautiful skin at age 62.</li>
            <li>I use them once a week and can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore, so this was a great find.</li>
            <li>Does a great job.  </li>
            <li>You have to use 3 at a time to get any good out of them at all.</li>
            <li>I tend to wash out the cleanser and use my own, but the cleanser in the sponge is good too.</li>
            <li>I love the product--but beware!  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>These things are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is the best product ever that thoroughly buffs all the dead skin for a perfect canvas for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>Handy to keep at my desk at work.  </li>
            <li>or they changed the formula, but they&#x27;re just okay.</li>
            <li>This is one of many sellers trying to gouge people since buf-singles are no longer made.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I absolutely love using the buff puff singles and even signed up for the subscribe and save</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t find them in the stores any more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the product.</li>
            <li>and I love that soap is already on them.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>but I was under the impression I was purchasing more than one 40 count package.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find them in stores any more, and I LOVE them.  </li>
            <li>I love these Buf-Puf singles...</li>
            <li>so no disgusting microbiology experiments on your face scrubber.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is I love them</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found them</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>Love Buf Pufs.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good that way.</li>
            <li>And best of all they are single use</li>
            <li>These pads are not made of a cotton type material like most of them are, I use them to clean my oily face</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are perfect for scrubbng the dead skin all away and makes your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>Well, today I just received notice that it&#x27;s no longer available for the subscribe and save</li>
            <li>Loved using this product for many years, but not enough to pay $25 a box.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love them that much!  </li>
            <li>The original picture had 2 in the picture</li>
            <li>plus I can&#x27;t tell if I got my face really clean like with the cotton ones</li>
            <li>Fortunately I can get several good uses with a stack of 3.</li>
            <li>These single use sponges work great</li>
            <li>i ordered the gentle ones and i am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed using the product until I was able to use again.  </li>
            <li>To be honest my skin has to mature for me to get the full benefit out of them.</li>
            <li>Make skin feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li>The product needs to be three times thicker to be useful.</li>
            <li>And since I am getting low, I thought I&#x27;d look into getting more.  </li>
            <li>They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone who likes to have their face not only look clean but feel clean as well.</li>
            <li>I do love these and think nothing works as well as getting off the dry, flaky skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>But more money for one single box...</li>
            <li>Made a huge improvement to facial acne.</li>
            <li>and these are not too much for me.</li>
            <li>The things are very flimsy and I can even get any traction out of them if I wrap them around my finger.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Makes my face smooth and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find any that actually were rough enough to buff.  </li>
            <li>Too much hassle to send back!</li>
            <li>This is very misleading, I can purchase 1 package at a local drug store for a lot less.  </li>

            <li> This is very misleading, I can purchase 1 package at a local drug store for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> It has quickly become part of my routine at least 4-5 times weekly!</li>
            <li> but like alot of things I like they are becoming increasingly difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Nothing removes facial scaling and dry flakes as this product.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for exfoliation, but I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad box</li>
            <li> But it appears as though they are charging $30+ for one single box.  </li>
            <li> One single will work up to a week if just using it once a day.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll use them up since I don&#x27;t want to send them back, not worth it to do that.</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing because this is one of our favorite facial cleansing products out there.</li>
            <li> In the past, they got very foamy once you wet them, but these have very little foam/soap.</li>
            <li> Buf puf are great, but the price was utterly outrageous!  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t keep them from slipping out of my grip.</li>
            <li> These are harder and harder to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Buf-Puf pads for a long time, but they seem to have less cleanser in them than they used to.</li>
            <li> this product is as described, i used one and found i needed something less abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Other sellers were charging less!  </li>
            <li> This listing is selling one box for 33 some odd dollars!  </li>
            <li> I think this picture is EXTREMELY MISLEADING!!!  </li>
            <li> I have skin issues and use these in the shower every day for the past 17+ years.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> but as I stated, they are hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> I use mine at least 3 times before I throw away!</li>
            <li> Very hard to get now that the company discountinued making them.  </li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>

            <li> this product is as described, i used one and found i needed something less abrasive.  i ordered the gentle ones and i am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and as promised.</li>
            <li> 3M does not make this product any longer and this is price gouging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Buf-Puf pads for a long time, but they seem to have less cleanser in them than they used to. In the past, they got very foamy once you wet them, but these have very little foam/soap. I have to add a seperate cleansing product to get them to work properly. They&#x27;re great for exfoliation, but I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad box or they changed the formula, but they&#x27;re just okay.</li>
            <li> I love the product--but beware!  This listing is selling one box for 33 some odd dollars!  Crazy.</li>
            <li> $20.00 some $$ for just 1 box of these.  They were sent back.</li>
            <li> Buf puf are great, but the price was utterly outrageous!  If I didn&#x27;t require them I wouldn&#x27;t have paid such an unreal price!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of many sellers trying to gouge people since buf-singles are no longer made.  Loved using this product for many years, but not enough to pay $25 a box.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in any of my local stores like Wal-Mart, etc.  So I ordered on line.  Didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed using the product until I was able to use again.  People always complement me on my beautiful skin at age 62.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the product!  And since I am getting low, I thought I&#x27;d look into getting more.  But it appears as though they are charging $30+ for one single box.  I won&#x27;t be buying these again.  My last purchase of these was about $25 buck for a case of them.  But more money for one single box...I don&#x27;t love them that much!  These sellers are nuts.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I absolutely love using the buff puff singles and even signed up for the subscribe and save so they come regularly. Well, today I just received notice that it&#x27;s no longer available for the subscribe and save and you can&#x27;t find them in the stores any more. This is very disappointing because this is one of our favorite facial cleansing products out there. I hope 3M starts making them again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the product. It has quickly become part of my routine at least 4-5 times weekly! Made a huge improvement to facial acne. I wish i could reach my back acne...</li>
            <li> These single use sponges work great and I love that soap is already on them.  I use them once a week and can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore, so this was a great find.</li>
            <li> I love the product but I was under the impression I was purchasing more than one 40 count package.  This is very misleading, I can purchase 1 package at a local drug store for a lot less.  I will not buy this again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find them in stores any more, and I LOVE them.  They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love these Buf-Puf singles...but like alot of things I like they are becoming increasingly difficult to find.  Neither of the stores I used to buy them in carry them any longer.  So, thank you Amazon you always come through!</li>
            <li> Who needs a battery operated $200 scrub brush?  These things are amazing.  And best of all they are single use so no disgusting microbiology experiments on your face scrubber.  Adjust the amount of pressure to your liking.  I have very sensitive skin and these are not too much for me. I tend to wash out the cleanser and use my own, but the cleanser in the sponge is good too.</li>
            <li> Hard to find don&#x27;t know why you can;t find these in stores.  I use them over and over again to get maximum use.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for buff pads in store FOR-EVER.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find any that actually were rough enough to buff.  These are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have been using buf-puf every since I was a teenager. All I can say is I love them they do everything they claim on their website at a lot cheaper product. I got two boxes I want them to last . The only thing I would they buff or polish your skin so take that into consideration when you use them daily. To be honest my skin has to mature for me to get the full benefit out of them. I use them two  to three times a week.</li>
            <li> I have always used Buff Puff and could not find them in the stores&lt;br /&gt;anymore. I am so glad I found them online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are perfect for scrubbng the dead skin all away and makes your skin feel smooth&lt;br /&gt;and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.  Excellent product.  Does a great job.  Would highly recommend to anyone who likes to have their face not only look clean but feel clean as well.</li>
            <li> These are perfect sized disposable exfoliating buffers!</li>
            <li> These pads are not made of a cotton type material like most of them are, I use them to clean my oily face and I can&#x27;t keep them from slipping out of my grip. plus I can&#x27;t tell if I got my face really clean like with the cotton ones but I&#x27;ll use them up since I don&#x27;t want to send them back, not worth it to do that.</li>
            <li> Love these! Make skin feel clean and fresh and they do not irritate my skin at all! Would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I love these things. Makes my face smooth and they last a long time. I use mine at least 3 times before I throw away!</li>
            <li> I have skin issues and use these in the shower every day for the past 17+ years.  One single will work up to a week if just using it once a day.</li>
            <li> Love Buf Pufs.  Very hard to get now that the company discountinued making them.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nothing removes facial scaling and dry flakes as this product.  Nothing.</li>
            <li> I hope they continue to make these forever. It is the best product ever that thoroughly buffs all the dead skin for a perfect canvas for applying makeup. And these are disposable rather than using something that traps bacteria.</li>
            <li> These are harder and harder to find in the store.  The original picture had 2 in the picture so I thought I was paying for 2 boxes, but only received 1.  It was double the price of the store (which is why I thought it might be 2) but as I stated, they are hard to find in the store.  I do love these and think nothing works as well as getting off the dry, flaky skin on my face.  Product arrived well packaged and timely. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The things are very flimsy and I can even get any traction out of them if I wrap them around my finger. You have to use 3 at a time to get any good out of them at all. Fortunately I can get several good uses with a stack of 3. I would have given them no stars if I had not discovered this. The product needs to be three times thicker to be useful. So use three pads. Works pretty good that way.</li>
            <li> Handy to keep at my desk at work.  Work well!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product I have been using for years &amp; love it!!!  The seller is what I rated!!  I think this picture is EXTREMELY MISLEADING!!!  I thought I was purchasing four of what is shown!!  That was not the case.  I would not purchase anything from this seller again.  Other sellers were charging less!  Too much hassle to send back!</li>
