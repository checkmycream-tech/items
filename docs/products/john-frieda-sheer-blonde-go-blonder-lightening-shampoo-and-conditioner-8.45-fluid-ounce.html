            <li>Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing!</li>
            <li>This is a good way to gradually lighten and minimize frying risk.</li>
            <li>Loved being able to get both shampoo and conditioner in one package for a great price.</li>
            <li>I love this set!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, but don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell and seems to lighten up my hair a bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shampoo and conditioner......</li>
            <li>It gives off a good feeling on the scalp when you&#x27;re applying it, but after, while your hair is damp or even dry, you will have to use the best comb you have to battle the knots taking over your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better.</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for a better duo.</li>
            <li>We love thee products</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Pretty good shampoo &amp; conditioner, but</li>
            <li>Really a great product - I love how it smells and makes my hair feel soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and easy to style.</li>
            <li>Overall this product was a good investment and the product has a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that strong),</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I am happy they made a shampoo and conditioner product for blondes only.</li>
            <li>I search for hair products which will leave it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed my hair lighten at all more than it normally does in the summer</li>
            <li>IT WILL TANGLE YOUR HAIR MORE THAN NO OTHER!</li>
            <li>Even though my hair turned slightly orange after 2 weeks, I loved how soft and shiny it made my hair feel :)</li>
            <li>Im light brown natural</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for me!</li>
            <li>Not seeing much results after about a month of use.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell all that much.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I am a natural dishwater blonde and it&#x27;s fairly healthy as I don&#x27;t use much heat on it.</li>
            <li>Lightens gradually, although I did see a difference straight away, it seemed to lift my colour.</li>
            <li>definitely works with lightening your hair, again, just don&#x27;t use it on really dark hair, unless you want strawberry blonde hair, lol XD</li>
            <li>A high price (the knots) to pay.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is not super thick or too light, a good every day conditioner.</li>
            <li>A new favorite, the conditioner leaves my hair silky and smooth without that usual conditioner residue or extra weight.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks every single day and my hair isn&#x27;t one bit lighter, and I&#x27;m naturally a dishwater blonde.</li>
            <li>I can say that this shampoo and conditioner has a little bit more of an effect on your hair as it would sitting in the sun.</li>
            <li>It decreased the brassiness and gives my hair a clean healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>I alternate rare use of the spray (w/o sun or heat...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d guess if you piled all three products on at once for a longish periods of time, your hair would suffer more or as much as a harsh all-at-once bleach treatment.</li>
            <li>My blonde was noticeably lighter after the first couple washes.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any change after using it for several months...</li>
            <li>What really works is the spray, but it&#x27;s obviously damaging whereas shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t seem to be.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is dark brown, my new growth is also lighter making my roots more subtle.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a try for my natural blond high lights but its not worth it.</li>
            <li>This combo really brings out my natural highlights and makes me look like I have had time at the beach year round.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally a dark dark blonde, practically light brunette</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve only used it for about 3 weeks, &amp; my full highlights are getting slightly blonder.</li>
            <li>and I did see a slight increase in blong but not enough to really matter</li>

            <li> I was tired of highlighting my hair in a salon: spending too much money &amp; not having my hair look natural.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking a little damaged after several uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go bleach blonde, even though I had really dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> These products plus the spray have made my dull blond hair looked sun kissed &amp; feels soft.</li>

            <li> This is not worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> and it maybe maid me a few shades lighter</li>
            <li> The product dried my hair, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to be lighter...</li>
            <li> I would recommend using another shampoo every few washes.</li>
            <li> but I highlight my hair every few months.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days there was noticeable difference in the color of my roots</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very harsh on my hair</li>
            <li> : Do NOT use this if you have hair thats darker than dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> My son has dirty blonde hair and it hasn&#x27;t not gotten any lighter with this shampoo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to expensive</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not seeing much results after about a month of use. Im light brown natural and it maybe maid me a few shades lighter but I really can&#x27;t tell all that much. I&#x27;d just stick with sun in or something.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any change after using it for several months... oh well. I now use the conditioner as a shaving cream haha.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for me! My blonde was noticeably lighter after the first couple washes. My natural hair color is dark brown, my new growth is also lighter making my roots more subtle. Overall this product was a good investment and the product has a nice scent to it as well. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Product smells great and makes my hair silky but I guess my highlights are too dark to be lightened</li>
            <li> Worked well and came still packaged!</li>
            <li> Hair feels great and does indeed lighten it!</li>
            <li> I love my hair with this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Pro tip: Do NOT use this if you have hair thats darker than dirty blonde. I remember using this stuff along with the spray in 7th grade thinking I&#x27;d go bleach blonde, even though I had really dark brown hair. Even though my hair turned slightly orange after 2 weeks, I loved how soft and shiny it made my hair feel :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works with lightening your hair, again, just don&#x27;t use it on really dark hair, unless you want strawberry blonde hair, lol XD</li>
            <li> Really a great product - I love how it smells and makes my hair feel soft and manageable.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The bottles had split open in shipping. The product dried my hair, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to be lighter...</li>
            <li> I like how well it cleans</li>
            <li> Pretty good shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I&#x27;ve seen better. The scent is amazing, but don&#x27;t be fooled. IT WILL TANGLE YOUR HAIR MORE THAN NO OTHER! It gives off a good feeling on the scalp when you&#x27;re applying it, but after, while your hair is damp or even dry, you will have to use the best comb you have to battle the knots taking over your hair. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve only used it for about 3 weeks, &amp; my full highlights are getting slightly blonder. A high price (the knots) to pay. I will keep looking for a better duo.</li>
            <li> It does lighten my hair but it also dries it out quite a bit. I would recommend using another shampoo every few washes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed my hair lighten at all more than it normally does in the summer</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try for my natural blond high lights but its not worth it. It&#x27;s to expensive and I did see a slight increase in blong but not enough to really matter, also I had an increase in my hair falling out in the shower and out of the shower. This is not worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell and seems to lighten up my hair a bit. The conditioner leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> We love thee products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very harsh on my hair I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a dark dark blonde, practically light brunette but I highlight my hair every few months.  This is an in-betweeen appointment life saver!  Within a few days there was noticeable difference in the color of my roots (you can&#x27;t even tell I have them now) and the overall tone of my hair.  It decreased the brassiness and gives my hair a clean healthy feeling. The conditioner is not super thick or too light, a good every day conditioner.</li>
            <li> Only received conditioner.</li>
            <li> Loved being able to get both shampoo and conditioner in one package for a great price. I&#x27;ve used Sheer Blonde for years as my go-to daily shampoo/conditioner. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo and conditioner......does it make my hair blonder? No, maybe a bit brighter.</li>
            <li> Hair is shinny and swingy with this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps the blonde  - blonde.&lt;br /&gt; Didnt notice that it actually added any blonde.</li>
            <li> This stuff sort of actually works. What really works is the spray, but it&#x27;s obviously damaging whereas shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t seem to be. I alternate rare use of the spray (w/o sun or heat...it&#x27;s that strong), occasional use of shampoo/conditioner, and reviving/moisturizing/ash toning shampoo/conditioner in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d guess if you piled all three products on at once for a longish periods of time, your hair would suffer more or as much as a harsh all-at-once bleach treatment. This is a good way to gradually lighten and minimize frying risk.</li>
            <li> I am happy they made a shampoo and conditioner product for blondes only. This combo really brings out my natural highlights and makes me look like I have had time at the beach year round. A new favorite, the conditioner leaves my hair silky and smooth without that usual conditioner residue or extra weight. I love this set!</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair shiny and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I am a natural dishwater blonde and it&#x27;s fairly healthy as I don&#x27;t use much heat on it. I can say that this shampoo and conditioner has a little bit more of an effect on your hair as it would sitting in the sun. Every summer my hair gets a lot lighter from the sun, I would say if you are looking for minimal damage from a lightening product, go with this one. Does leave your hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> My son has dirty blonde hair and it hasn&#x27;t not gotten any lighter with this shampoo</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product. Lightens gradually, although I did see a difference straight away, it seemed to lift my colour.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I just realized that the shampoo was opened.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner work like a regular shampoo and conditioner. I can honestly say, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks every single day and my hair isn&#x27;t one bit lighter, and I&#x27;m naturally a dishwater blonde. If anything, it&#x27;s gotten darker. Who knows.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking a little damaged after several uses. Sort of like cradle cap in a baby. I search for hair products which will leave it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I was tired of highlighting my hair in a salon: spending too much money &amp; not having my hair look natural. These products plus the spray have made my dull blond hair looked sun kissed &amp; feels soft. Love it! Will purchase again!</li>
