    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product when paired with the shampoo!</li>
            <li>this product is great, but not from Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner that I have used plenty of times before, however the conditioner I received from Amazon smells like the inside of a balloon.</li>
            <li>best conditioner for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>saw another reviewer say that it smells like gasoline, and while anything to do with the senses is subjective, I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;d love whatever gasoline that person is using LOL.  </li>
            <li>Completely in love with this product, has transformed my hair!</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bottle of delicious-smelling magic potion that would turn my hair into a glossy waterfall of silk!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>that I used it my hair transformed into a simply amazing mane.</li>
            <li>leaves hair shiny, full of body, beautiful.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers nice</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about my hair, and my hair is now consistently at the place that I would call its best.</li>
            <li>Good clean smell.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I have purchased this product, it&#x27;s a great leave in product for curly hair to control frizz as well</li>
            <li>I decided to try it because I love the way her hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I also love the shampoo and finishing treatment.</li>
            <li>But for $34 I wasn&#x27;t expecting an okay conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Oh how I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I think part of the price tag comes from ingredients from the rainforest, but I believe it is harvested sustainably and then the price is even more worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I do like it but don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my hair darker, shinier, fuller, and just all around more healthier then ever before.</li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;d welcome a lower price for the Rahua, I don&#x27;t think $34 is too much to ask considering what you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li>It was okay,</li>
            <li>I have been a happy Biolage shampoo and conditioner user for years but wanted to switch to natural hair products without chemical additives.</li>
            <li>I think because my hair is fine, not all products penetrate, but this one does.</li>
            <li>and I think this will keep my hair super healthy.</li>
            <li>I pick my products based on ingredients (naturalness being a huge aspect) and how well they work for me.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Such a great product that just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>works great as a deep conditioning mask.</li>
            <li>At over $40 a pot, it too is filled with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I only use it as a leave-in conditioner / moisturizer (which it is also intended to be used as) at night when I twist my hair, and it gives me with great twist</li>
            <li>However, on the flip side, the natural scents that I absolutely LOVE and find relaxing, most people do not enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike others, for $34 I expect a conditioner that is all natural (which doesn&#x27;t always smell great) and that works really well.</li>
            <li>nothing really special.</li>
            <li>It leaves my feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the shampoo, but the conditioner is ok.</li>
            <li>but I like to keep it in for the full duration of my shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for a more reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner without chemicals because these are WAY overpriced.</li>
            <li>As a vegan, knowing that it&#x27;s animal testing free and has quality organic ingredients is worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has really helped make my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>:) I have long, fine straight hair which most people think is problem free, but the one area that has always given me problems is conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely purchase when my gifted bottle is finished!</li>
            <li>I put oil in afterwards to calm it.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, springy, shiny every day, all day, until i go to bed, then I apply more before bed.</li>
            <li>But to me, it is a natural, plant/forest scent, and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you get it thru Rahua, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, I have tried this conditioner as a leave in and Co washing and the latter is better.</li>
            <li>No conditioner was ever enough to really moisturize or condition my hair, I feel like they wanted to provide some kind of half-baked detangling function, but actually nourishing my hair so it could reclaim its silky smooth consistency</li>
            <li>is that good because your mixed with Native American.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner and the only hair product I use for my long really long hair (for a guy)</li>
            <li>But the ingredients are natural, no bad ingredients but does leave my hair a bit frizzy....</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells OK (not really much scent at all, kind of an oily smell), and I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural but don&#x27;t expect any improvement in your hair over a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; commercial conditioner.</li>
            <li>) enjoy spending ten minutes combing tangles out of your hair as though you hadn&#x27;t used conditioner in the first place.</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s important and am willing to pay extra for ethical practices.</li>
            <li>was never their priority, no matter how much I used, no matter what company I purchased from.</li>
            <li>The product also includes an ingredient called Palo Santo (a tree extract) that promotes a mood-calming experience; and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>It smelled rancid and not at all like the real thing, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked, I tried every drugstore brand and pretty much every natural brand.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s so much better than other products I&#x27;ve tried and $34 is a high price point.  </li>
            <li>Its not just about the look which is super important, but the comfort of being able to brush my hair without getting into a traffic jam of knots, and with my hair being longer, super concentrated care is the only way for my hair to be cared for and not end up ragged and angry.</li>
            <li>This is an okay conditioner, but not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I had given up and was using different oils that I had found, which was better but left a bit of residue on my hair that I wasn&#x27;t a fan of.</li>
            <li>I think part of the price tag comes from ingredients from the rainforest, but I believe it is harvested sustainably and then the price is even more worthwhile.ing able to brush my hair without getting into a traffic jam of knots, and with my hair being longer, super concentrated care is the only way for my hair to be cared for and not end up ragged and angry.</li>
            <li>As for the price, it is high, but my hair likes the quality ingredients</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if its curly, poufy, or straight and slick, it will work, and it will make you remember how to love your hair again.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if its curly, poufy, or straight and slick, it will work, and it will make you remember how to love your hair again.</li>
            <li>As I said this conditioner is pricey, but it is really is worth it, and I have purchased this conditioner before other things at times because it means that much to me.</li>
            <li>I know the price tag is high, but let me tell you, if you have problems with every other conditioner you have ever used ever, than its really worth it</li>
            <li>But truth be told, I&#x27;ve realized as I&#x27;ve been on my natural journey (I use all natural skin and hair care products whenever possible) that my tolerance for certain smells has changed.  </li>
            <li>Heavenly goodness of natural nuts and what not packed in this bottle...divine smell..</li>
            <li>after seeing how much fuller my hair has become with this one I want to try the volumizing conditioner next to see what that one does in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner is $34, completely natural, and lasts me five to eight months depending on how often I use it.  </li>
            <li>Also, I see lots of natural ladies promoting Miss Jessies.  </li>
            <li>The smell is completely natural.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s overpriced and far too overrated.</li>
            <li>Even my husband, who isn&#x27;t into \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;, preferes this brand over his old drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>But if you want an all natural conditioner that will improve the quality of your hair, this is it.</li>
            <li>This product got good reviews, so I bought both the Rahua Shampoo and Conditioner even though they are expensive.</li>
            <li>I should add, that using it carefully, (you really don&#x27;t need alot, and massaging it into your hair, makes it go faarrr!)</li>

            <li>This product, the shampoo and finishing treatment were given to me as a gift, and I&#x27;m really glad I received them, as that may have been the only way I would have tried them since they are pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li>When I rinse after conditioning, there is little conditioner to rinse out, it&#x27;s like my hair absorbed it.</li>
            <li>but this is a natural product that finally works as well as chemically-derived products.</li>
            <li>To really get the most out of it, I apply to my wrung hair while in the shower, and then let it sit as I go about and do other things for at least 15 minutes, this really solidifies the silkiness and the moisture content, but its NEVER greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>I find most conditioners so drying, they are pumped full of alcohols and other ingredients that have nothing to do with actually preserving and caring for my hair but more about drying up and destroying it :(</li>
            <li>The heavily perfumed scent of most conventional products are now unbearable for me, give me headaches and actually burn my nose and lungs.  </li>
            <li>i do not chemically straighten it, I do not flat iron it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Completely in love with this product, has transformed my hair!</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner that I have used plenty of times before, however the conditioner I received from Amazon smells like the inside of a balloon.</li>
            <li> Heavenly goodness of natural nuts and what not packed in this bottle...divine smell..Nothing to beat it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for my thick dry hair.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Hair smells terrible afterwards. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I learned about this on CurlyNikki.com because Corrine Bailey Rae uses it. It was also in InStyle magazine&#x27;s hair issue, which featured Corrine Bailey Rae.  I decided to try it because I love the way her hair looks.  my hair is unprocessed african american hair. i do not chemically straighten it, I do not flat iron it. It consists tight spirals  and when pulled back looks like waves. my hair is normally dry and requires lots of of moisture, moisture every day. This product is perfection. I use it in the shower, I use it as a deep conditioner, I use it as a leave in. My hair is soft, springy, shiny every day, all day, until i go to bed, then I apply more before bed. I also love the shampoo and finishing treatment. I think because my hair is fine, not all products penetrate, but this one does. When I rinse after conditioning, there is little conditioner to rinse out, it&#x27;s like my hair absorbed it. As for the price, it is high, but my hair likes the quality ingredients and I like consistency. I have a product line for life. I&#x27;m going to flat iron my hair at some point and I think this will keep my hair super healthy.</li>
            <li> If this was a $5 conditioner, I&#x27;d give it 4 stars, say I didn&#x27;t like the smell but it conditioned well enough, and be done.  But for $34 I wasn&#x27;t expecting an okay conditioner.  I was expecting a bottle of delicious-smelling magic potion that would turn my hair into a glossy waterfall of silk!  Instead I get a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t even work as well as the Suave stuff I used to use, with a heavy, cloying gasoline-y scent.  The only way I&#x27;d recommend this is if you are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) a millionaire and like buying expensive vegan beauty products on principle,&lt;br /&gt;B) like the smell of gasoline and want to get a whiff of it every time your hair moves, and/or&lt;br /&gt;C) enjoy spending ten minutes combing tangles out of your hair as though you hadn&#x27;t used conditioner in the first place.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for curly hair. I use it as a leave in conditioner and just add a little gel.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. It leaves my feeling nice and soft. Good clean smell. Overall I would definitely recommend this product. It is a bit on the pricey side and may choose to try other shampoo&#x27;s just based on that.</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair that has been straightened and colored. I love this product. Recommended to me by a California hair salon.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I received a sample and in the month that I used it my hair transformed into a simply amazing mane. It finally had volume, added strength and shine like nobody&#x27;s business. Oh how I love this conditioner. Unfortunately, after using it for a month my scalp has broken out with thick while scales. This is the ONLY thing I have changed that I put in my hair and after I stopped using it for a week, the scales started to go away. So so very sad. Such a great product that just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> After discovering this brand and item over a year ago, this is the ONLY conditioner I use, and I mean the ONLY conditioner I use. I know the price tag is high, but let me tell you, if you have problems with every other conditioner you have ever used ever, than its really worth it :) I have long, fine straight hair which most people think is problem free, but the one area that has always given me problems is conditioner. No conditioner was ever enough to really moisturize or condition my hair, I feel like they wanted to provide some kind of half-baked detangling function, but actually nourishing my hair so it could reclaim its silky smooth consistency was never their priority, no matter how much I used, no matter what company I purchased from. I find most conditioners so drying, they are pumped full of alcohols and other ingredients that have nothing to do with actually preserving and caring for my hair but more about drying up and destroying it :( I had given up and was using different oils that I had found, which was better but left a bit of residue on my hair that I wasn&#x27;t a fan of. This really saved, I mean saved my hair! I can use a little bit and it goes a long way. To really get the most out of it, I apply to my wrung hair while in the shower, and then let it sit as I go about and do other things for at least 15 minutes, this really solidifies the silkiness and the moisture content, but its NEVER greasy or heavy. I get so many compliments about my hair, and my hair is now consistently at the place that I would call its best. I&#x27;m not someone who runs after every brand name &amp;#34;care item&amp;#34; or who buys $35 lipstick. I pick my products based on ingredients (naturalness being a huge aspect) and how well they work for me. As I said this conditioner is pricey, but it is really is worth it, and I have purchased this conditioner before other things at times because it means that much to me. Its not just about the look which is super important, but the comfort of being able to brush my hair without getting into a traffic jam of knots, and with my hair being longer, super concentrated care is the only way for my hair to be cared for and not end up ragged and angry. So if you have any I mean ANY problems with other conditioners you have used, I would really give this a try. I recommend it for all hair types because its just so nourishing to any type of hair. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its curly, poufy, or straight and slick, it will work, and it will make you remember how to love your hair again. &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw I should add, that using it carefully, (you really don&#x27;t need alot, and massaging it into your hair, makes it go faarrr!) that one bottle usually lasts me at least a couple months, and my hair is pretty long at this point. So know that it&#x27;s an investment, and it will really last. I think part of the price tag comes from ingredients from the rainforest, but I believe it is harvested sustainably and then the price is even more worthwhile.ing able to brush my hair without getting into a traffic jam of knots, and with my hair being longer, super concentrated care is the only way for my hair to be cared for and not end up ragged and angry.

            <li> Best conditioner and the only hair product I use for my long really long hair (for a guy)</li>
            <li> I do like it but don&#x27;t love it &amp; it&#x27;s not awesome. But the ingredients are natural, no bad ingredients but does leave my hair a bit frizzy....I put oil in afterwards to calm it. On the up side I have wavy hair and this does help keep my waves for 2-3 days in between washing.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the shampoo, but the conditioner is ok.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and oily skin. No residue, no break outs... I use it every day and some days leave it in.</li>
            <li> Only four stars because it definitely does smell like gasoline and has the consistency of lotion which makes it hard to get into your hair, but it works really well. Has never made my hair greasy and moisturizes evenly.</li>
            <li> Great product when paired with the shampoo!</li>
            <li> This is an okay conditioner, but not worth the price.  It&#x27;s creamy and thick, and conditions well enough.  However, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s so much better than other products I&#x27;ve tried and $34 is a high price point.  The scent is pungent, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite like gasoline, but I can understand why the others make that comparison.  I&#x27;m hoping this bottle improves my hair and makes it softer/healthier, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Black American, male. my hair was thinning in the front but it is a lot less noticeable now. The conditioner makes my hair darker, shinier, fuller, and just all around more healthier then ever before. I get compliments on my hair often with people saying your hair is that good because your mixed with Native American. after seeing how much fuller my hair has become with this one I want to try the volumizing conditioner next to see what that one does in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I have tried this conditioner as a leave in and Co washing and the latter is better. I think the conditioner works hand in hand with the water to nourish your hair. immediately when getting in the shower wet your hair and apply the conditioner and rinse it before you get out. I say that cause you want the conditioner to stay in your hair for at least 3 solid minuets before rinsing but I like to keep it in for the full duration of my shower.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I have purchased this product, it&#x27;s a great leave in product for curly hair to control frizz as well</li>
            <li> best conditioner for my fine hair. works great as a deep conditioning mask. leaves hair shiny, full of body, beautiful.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this conditioner.  I have thick, natural 3C/4A afro textured hair past my shoulders.  This product, the shampoo and finishing treatment were given to me as a gift, and I&#x27;m really glad I received them, as that may have been the only way I would have tried them since they are pretty expensive.  But then, I paused for a second and thought about it.  Expense really is relative.  When I had relaxed hair, I&#x27;d pay anywhere from $65 to $120 every six weeks for a relaxer that was loaded with chemicals and left me with a burnt scalp.  This conditioner is $34, completely natural, and lasts me five to eight months depending on how often I use it.  Also, I see lots of natural ladies promoting Miss Jessies.  At over $40 a pot, it too is filled with chemicals.  So while I&#x27;d welcome a lower price for the Rahua, I don&#x27;t think $34 is too much to ask considering what you&#x27;re getting.  My hair and body deserve the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have to admit, I do not use it for deep conditioning.  So that&#x27;s probably why I don&#x27;t mind paying the $34 for it.  If I did, it would probably only last me 3 to 4 weeks tops (my hair is like a sponge and would soak it up), and I DEFINITELY could NOT afford that.  I only use it as a leave-in conditioner / moisturizer (which it is also intended to be used as) at night when I twist my hair, and it gives me with great twist outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw another reviewer say that it smells like gasoline, and while anything to do with the senses is subjective, I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;d love whatever gasoline that person is using LOL.  But truth be told, I&#x27;ve realized as I&#x27;ve been on my natural journey (I use all natural skin and hair care products whenever possible) that my tolerance for certain smells has changed.  The heavily perfumed scent of most conventional products are now unbearable for me, give me headaches and actually burn my nose and lungs.  However, on the flip side, the natural scents that I absolutely LOVE and find relaxing, most people do not enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not \\&quot;fragranced\\&quot;.  In the cosmetics industry, that means no synthetic fragrances (perfume) have been added.  The smell is completely natural.  The product also includes an ingredient called Palo Santo (a tree extract) that promotes a mood-calming experience; and it really does work.  Whenever I catch a whiff of my hair, I&#x27;m totally zenned out!  I suspect it&#x27;s either the Palo Santo or the Japanese Honeysuckle extract that the reviewer (who said it smells like gasoline) does not like.  But to me, it is a natural, plant/forest scent, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase when my gifted bottle is finished!</li>
            <li> This smells like black licorice, which, I don&#x27;t like eating but I don&#x27;t mind the smell. It was okay, nothing really special. It slightly made my hair softer than anything I&#x27;ve used before but I think it&#x27;s overpriced and far too overrated.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner changed my hair for the bestest when I lived in NYC. It&#x27;s yet to be seen whether it has the same effect in humid-ass Houston.</li>
            <li> I have been a happy Biolage shampoo and conditioner user for years but wanted to switch to natural hair products without chemical additives. This product got good reviews, so I bought both the Rahua Shampoo and Conditioner even though they are expensive. I&#x27;ve been using both products for a week. This conditioner smells OK (not really much scent at all, kind of an oily smell), and I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural but don&#x27;t expect any improvement in your hair over a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; commercial conditioner. The shampoo lathers nice but you have to use a lot. I&#x27;ll keep looking for a more reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner without chemicals because these are WAY overpriced.</li>
            <li> I use this as a leave-in conditioner for my curly hair. I usually use it over damp or semi-damp hair. If I use it in the shower, I only rinse part way. It doesn&#x27;t have any build-up or an obnoxious perfume smell. I just wish it came in an economy size or was cheaper!</li>
            <li> this product is great, but not from Amazon! It smelled rancid and not at all like the real thing, so I returned it. But if you get it thru Rahua, it&#x27;s totally worth it. Pricey, but this is a natural product that finally works as well as chemically-derived products. As a vegan, knowing that it&#x27;s animal testing free and has quality organic ingredients is worth the price tag. Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> Unlike other people I don&#x27;t think this smells like gasoline...and anyways the scent doesn&#x27;t linger. Unlike others, for $34 I expect a conditioner that is all natural (which doesn&#x27;t always smell great) and that works really well. This is both. I have long thick wavy hair that would get very frizzy. Nothing worked, I tried every drugstore brand and pretty much every natural brand. This conditioner has really helped make my hair more manageable. It&#x27;s less frizzy, shinier, and softer. Even my husband, who isn&#x27;t into \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;, preferes this brand over his old drugstore brand. If you&#x27;re just looking for something that \\&quot;smells great\\&quot; this isn&#x27;t for you. But if you want an all natural conditioner that will improve the quality of your hair, this is it. I might add that the $34 is going towards giving a sustainable living to the native women that harvest the oils used in this...and I think that&#x27;s important and am willing to pay extra for ethical practices.</li>
