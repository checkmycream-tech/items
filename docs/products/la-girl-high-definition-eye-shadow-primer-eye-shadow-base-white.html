            <li>I wish I had more stars to give this one.</li>
            <li>More like oily eyelids.</li>
            <li>but I have to say out of all the primers I have looked at this one made the most sense.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use with my LA Colors eyeshadow pallets and it makes blending a breezev and colors brighter and more pigmented than ever.</li>
            <li>i love how it makes my eyeshadow look when i wear it</li>
            <li>once blended LOVE</li>
            <li>This primer is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, does the job it should do</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>The pencil like shape is easy and convenient and is easy to tote around with you without worrying about it leaking out or something.</li>
            <li>The primer apples easily and blends well.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow looks more bold and lasts longer when I apply this under it.</li>
            <li>Its great at applying and reduces the risk of wrinkles for your eyes, since your not directly applying eye shadow on your eyes.</li>
            <li>but its okay nice consistency may be to white for me though</li>
            <li>The coverage is nice too, and the colors (I purchased a white primer) were so intense and vivid after using this, it really is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>So far I love it, it keep my eyeshadow on all day and</li>
            <li>Everyone is always wondering how I keep my eyeshadow looking flawless all day, well this is the secret!</li>

            <li>first primer ive ever ordered.</li>
            <li>For the price it was decent, and the seller got it to me quick.</li>
            <li>I order more thing three days before this and this is the only thing that&#x27;s came sooner which I love and the fact that this is primer in a stick and white.</li>
            <li>At first, I put too much &amp; it looked like cream eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I really thought since it was LA COLORS  </li>
            <li>The 1st time I tried this I used to much and looked.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and the white color brings out the eye shadow color.  </li>
            <li>It really does make your eye</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>It came more earlier then I expected.</li>
            <li>, here&#x27;s my secret to an amazing almost-white base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds eye shadow for a few hours like eight hours top, not like urban decay.</li>

            <li> It holds eye shadow for a few hours like eight hours top, not like urban decay.</li>
            <li> I like LA Girl High Definition Eye Shadow Primer eye Shadow Base White because when I apply it to my skin, it covers smoothly and completely.  </li>
            <li> This is similar to a crayon - difficult to rub on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Even with my Too Faced Shadow Insurance and eyeshadow on top, that thing creases like crazy.</li>
            <li> I mean very oily.</li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL other brands and nothing comes close to this.</li>
            <li> Love the stick version instead of ploy version such as nyx white base where you need a brush.</li>
            <li> The only problem i would say is that after a few hours it looks like you have sweat on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> After I left the primer on for a few minutes, it went to a powder-like effect.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow only lasted a few hours before creasing.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The LA Girl HD Primer Base in White is a little better than NYX Milk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use it when I am using dark colors though because it does show through.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow base is okay.</li>
            <li> For very little money, this was an all day primer that worked just as well as my other stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> does not really go on smoothly</li>
            <li> So a little does go a loooong way!</li>
            <li> It ends up being too thick or too thin, or uneven.</li>
            <li> It was broken up and unuseable looked like it was mishandled.</li>
            <li> that the quality was going to be bad</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate NYX Milk.</li>

            <li> I like this eyeshadow primer. It does what it needs to do without creasing. I don&#x27;t like to use it when I am using dark colors though because it does show through. But this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I wish I had more stars to give this one. Works great! Love it! For very little money, this was an all day primer that worked just as well as my other stuff.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, does the job it should do and it&#x27;s easy to remove.  What else should it do?  I like it</li>
            <li> This eye shadow base is okay. The only problem i would say is that after a few hours it looks like you have sweat on your eyelids. More like oily eyelids. Its great at applying and reduces the risk of wrinkles for your eyes, since your not directly applying eye shadow on your eyes. Great texture, smooth and easy to use, also looks great alone.</li>
            <li> I have never used eye primer before to put under my eye shadow but I have to say out of all the primers I have looked at this one made the most sense. The pencil like shape is easy and convenient and is easy to tote around with you without worrying about it leaking out or something. The coverage is nice too, and the colors (I purchased a white primer) were so intense and vivid after using this, it really is amazing stuff. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best primer I have ever used. Everyone is always wondering how I keep my eyeshadow looking flawless all day, well this is the secret! I have tried SEVERAL other brands and nothing comes close to this. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeshadow base/primer I have ever used so I cannot compare it to anything else but it works pretty well. My eyeshadow looks more bold and lasts longer when I apply this under it. It also wasn&#x27;t expensive and you know how they say you get what you pay for, well with this I feel like I got more than what I payed for.</li>
            <li> Shipping is amazing got it in  2 business days! And the product is outstanding! I really thought since it was LA COLORS  that the quality was going to be bad but NO the quality is great! works just like NYX milk jumbo pencil! Some people say its oily when you apply it, yes it is but the trick is to, and this is what A LOT of makeup artist do, use your finger to blend it when you blend it TRUST me it&#x27;ll make your eyeshadow flawless and doesn&#x27;t wear out in the end of the day! Will totally recommend this product to friends!</li>
            <li> Great product! A little goes a long way. The 1st time I tried this I used to much and looked. If you like a casket look use a lot. My shadow was perfect all day and night. Almost looked air brushed. Also used it highlighting when contouring.</li>
            <li> This primer is pretty good.  It goes on smooth and the white color brings out the eye shadow color.  I have no creasing and my eye shadow stays on all day without fading.</li>
            <li> first primer ive ever ordered. i like it. i dont have any issues with it. makes my eyeshadows pop! im definatly gonna order more!</li>
            <li> Very low quality! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Love this. I bought this to use with my LA Colors eyeshadow pallets and it makes blending a breezev and colors brighter and more pigmented than ever.</li>
            <li> This is similar to a crayon - difficult to rub on smoothly. It ends up being too thick or too thin, or uneven.</li>
            <li> This eye primer is great. It comes in a pen like tube, where you can twist the white primer in and out. The primer apples easily and blends well. It holds eye shadow for a few hours like eight hours top, not like urban decay. For the price it was decent, and the seller got it to me quick.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing to happen to my eyelids! i love how it makes my eyeshadow look when i wear it</li>
            <li> good product would buy again does make your eye shadow color true to the color</li>
            <li> It came more earlier then I expected. I order more thing three days before this and this is the only thing that&#x27;s came sooner which I love and the fact that this is primer in a stick and white. Love the stick version instead of ploy version such as nyx white base where you need a brush. So far I love it, it keep my eyeshadow on all day and I oily lids I mean very oily.</li>
            <li> this is a nicer product and i recommend it..it glides on so smoothly and it feels great..its bright to....it well make your eyeshadow/s pop...get it</li>
            <li> This stuff works great keeps my eyeshadow on all day and looks very nice once blended LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definatly continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know it was gonna be a pencil but its okay nice consistency may be to white for me though</li>
            <li> It was broken up and unuseable looked like it was mishandled. I had to just throw away. I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> does not really go on smoothly but i guess i does it job as primer.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have ever brought as far as makeup goes! My eye make does not smudge or wear off at all when I use this. I wish i would have known about this years ago!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this primer! At first, I put too much &amp; it looked like cream eye shadow. So a little does go a loooong way! It really does make your eye shadow(s) look great. The shipping was really fast. I got it way before the estimated delivery date. So yes I&#x27;d definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> I like LA Girl High Definition Eye Shadow Primer eye Shadow Base White because when I apply it to my skin, it covers smoothly and completely.  It is a great product!</li>
            <li> The LA Girl HD Primer Base in White is a little better than NYX Milk. I hate NYX Milk. Even with my Too Faced Shadow Insurance and eyeshadow on top, that thing creases like crazy. The LA Girl Primer still creases after 4 hours. The packaging itself is great: a twisting pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s my secret to an amazing almost-white base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Jar and/or squeeze tube&lt;br /&gt;2. Too Faced Shadow Insurance&lt;br /&gt;3. Titanium Dioxide (from TKB Trading or Coastal Scents)&lt;br /&gt;4. Mix Too Faced and bit by bit Titanium Dioxide into a jar and (optional) into a squeeze tube for your own DIY primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a white primer that makes eyeshadow colors pop and never creases.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a jar products it&#x27;s a pencil</li>
            <li> To be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t get it again. The primer comes in a crayon like tube. The key is to not use a lot of the primer or it will look like cream eyeshadow on your eyelids. After I left the primer on for a few minutes, it went to a powder-like effect. The eyeshadow looked lighter after applying it. The eyeshadow only lasted a few hours before creasing.</li>
