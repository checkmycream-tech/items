            <li>Good pricing and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>always smelled incredible and finally I had to ask her what it was, and she told me about this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much I decided to purchase it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is so sophisticated and unique</li>
            <li>and she found it to be very bold and don&#x27;t think that she will be wearing it.  </li>
            <li>It is sweet, sexy, yummy.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this fragrance on a paper sample in a magazine, and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Not too strong , not too light and it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>At first the smell was very strong</li>
            <li>a number of occasions duty free.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully light and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Narciso Rodriguez filled all requirements.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li>Fabulous, everyone you pass will notice what a vamp you are</li>
            <li>I enjoy it on her as well</li>
            <li>I gave it away as a Christmas present, as my friends told me that it would be a great gift for someone her age.</li>
            <li>It has all right ingredients without being over the top.</li>
            <li>I know I am not the first reviewer to note the off scent!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for any woman it definitely makes you feel and smell great!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I smelled this originally from a magazine sample.</li>
            <li>When I received this item i was excited.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy a subtle but wonderful fragrance, this is one to try.  </li>
            <li>wait).&lt;br /&gt;The scent is worth every penny and has a musky lovely scent that will keep you and your company very much into you.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is edgy an unforgettable!</li>
            <li>I love this fragance, and arrived on time thanks</li>
            <li>It has an unusual scent.. just love.</li>
            <li>I think the smell would be a lovely scent, but cannot really tell.  </li>
            <li>True to size.</li>
            <li>True to smell.</li>
            <li>Most perfumes give me a headache within several seconds/minutes, so I avoid wearing perfume for the most part.  </li>
            <li>The floral smell faded very fast and left the woodsy smell which wasn&#x27;t pleasant by itself.  </li>
            <li>I am a fragrance junky and have a lot of perfumes including many of the high priced name brands ones</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite go to perfume.</li>
            <li>The price was fine as it is a large sized bottle  </li>
            <li>It smells very soft and extremely elegant.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is rare.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved the little sample card scent.  </li>
            <li>The first application lasted all day.  </li>
            <li>Great scent for year round even in the summer when you want light and simple.</li>
            <li>Point on my favor! ;-)</li>
            <li>Only thing is you have to put more on after about 4 or 5 hrs.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order this fragrance again:)</li>
            <li>She wears Cashmere my Donna Karen and thought this would be a 2nd favorite.  </li>
            <li>Make sure it is EDP because EDT is different.</li>
            <li>I tried Amazon to see if they offer it, and sure enough!</li>
            <li>This is her current favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite parfum for several years.</li>
            <li>It arrived on the exact day</li>
            <li>though it smelled good for the first few days</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only perfume I use! :)  </li>
            <li>Have seen same bottle in retail store for $40.00 more.  </li>
            <li>This is my first perfume purchase from Amazon and the first time writing a review here after buying a ton of stuff from them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We love it, is very lasting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of those situations where I&#x27;m really sad because a scent that so many see as very sophisticated just does not work on me at all.</li>
            <li>It had strange sound and sprayed a lot immediately at the first use.</li>
            <li>Wondering if it really is EDP?  </li>
            <li>Tried looking for deals on the product in stores here in the US and it is a very pricey perfume.</li>
            <li>love the pink color of bottle.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is just my skin, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as Tom Ford&#x27;s Noir or Tory Burch.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the smell, but if I had to try</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>And this really surpassed all of my expectations.</li>
            <li>Stays with you the whole day.</li>
            <li>it suit me  as perfum can be very personnal .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the highly rated reviews!</li>
            <li>It s very cloying, a scent that gives you headaches.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We are very please and we recomend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>It goes fast though.</li>
            <li>Really like this fragrance though, and have gotten compliments on it as well.</li>
            <li>This is my Girlfriend&#x27;s favorite perfume and to my advantage, it&#x27;s the only one so far that I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
            <li>It smells great but is crazy expensive and I shopped all over to find the best buy.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very fast and was well packed to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li>After trying many perfumes, some too &#x27;sweet&#x27; some too heavy, many fade after a few minutes....</li>
            <li>I cannot fall in love with any other fragrance since discovering this one in an airport store.</li>
            <li>I smelled this originally in a magazine fold out and ordered it immediately, I have to say that it was not the same.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this then any other I have worn.  </li>
            <li>One of my new go to fragrances!</li>
            <li>It is definitely an older woman&#x27;s scent, but don&#x27;t think grandma.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fragrance to appeal to the woman in you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really nice mixed with other fragrances.</li>
            <li>Normally this size is $99.00 at Sephora or other fine department stores.  </li>
            <li>Just bought a second one to replace the first.</li>
            <li>, the wife loves it and wears it almost everyday! :)</li>
            <li>this is the second one that I buy, the first one was all right, but the second  doesn&#x27;t  have any fixative, it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see that Amazon charged less than Nordstrom&#x27;s does.  </li>
            <li>How do I rate the product and the product did not I receive so far, and I bought it from a year ago</li>
            <li>This is definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li>So soft and so feminine selling.</li>
            <li>I would say it is a scent for a woman that is from around 35 to 50 years old.</li>
            <li>Again, I filled out a review before and this is redundant.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the real deal.</li>
            <li>I like more beginning or the dry down.</li>
            <li>Love this soft and subtle feminine floral scent, its sillage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very sweet and deep muscy smell which will probably not fit everybody.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very subtle and nice perfume.</li>
            <li>It was a little pricey, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money because at department stores, this perfume is around $130.</li>
            <li>Now, I can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>It must be the young generation with a different olfactory poi t.  </li>
            <li>and I had to be careful to use the spray very sparingly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It gets better as you wear it and the scent gets nicer and stays with you throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and it is my favorite perfume that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I was able to create perfume this what I would create.</li>
            <li> Once you know what you like there is no reason to shop and pay for more at dept stores</li>
            <li> I work around men in my field of work , I received many comments from all my girl friends.....</li>

            <li> I fell in love and made my mother buy it</li>
            <li> One of her favorite and she was running out.</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> Love the Smell, and it stays all day.</li>
            <li> better go to the store and buy it..</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li> It smells so lovely.  </li>
            <li> ordered this lovely EDP after finding it in Vogue April issue.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon but get yours from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I really love, I can&#x27;t edxplain what it smells like</li>
            <li> It lasts, I love this fresh clean scent its great in and out of the office</li>
            <li> This fragnance is very unique.</li>
            <li> Good pricing and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> always smelled incredible and finally I had to ask her what it was, and she told me about this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much I decided to purchase it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is so sophisticated and unique</li>
            <li> and she found it to be very bold and don&#x27;t think that she will be wearing it.  </li>
            <li> It is sweet, sexy, yummy.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this fragrance on a paper sample in a magazine, and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Not too strong , not too light and it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> At first the smell was very strong</li>
            <li> a number of occasions duty free.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light and fragrant.</li>
            <li> Narciso Rodriguez filled all requirements.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, everyone you pass will notice what a vamp you are</li>
            <li> I enjoy it on her as well</li>
            <li> I gave it away as a Christmas present, as my friends told me that it would be a great gift for someone her age.</li>
            <li> It has all right ingredients without being over the top.</li>
            <li> I know I am not the first reviewer to note the off scent!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for any woman it definitely makes you feel and smell great!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I smelled this originally from a magazine sample.</li>
            <li> When I received this item i was excited.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a subtle but wonderful fragrance, this is one to try.  </li>
            <li> wait).&lt;br /&gt;The scent is worth every penny and has a musky lovely scent that will keep you and your company very much into you.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is edgy an unforgettable!</li>
            <li> I love this fragance, and arrived on time thanks</li>
            <li> It has an unusual scent.. just love.</li>
            <li> I think the smell would be a lovely scent, but cannot really tell.  </li>
            <li> True to size.</li>
            <li> True to smell.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes give me a headache within several seconds/minutes, so I avoid wearing perfume for the most part.  </li>
            <li> The floral smell faded very fast and left the woodsy smell which wasn&#x27;t pleasant by itself.  </li>
            <li> I am a fragrance junky and have a lot of perfumes including many of the high priced name brands ones</li>
            <li> It is my new favorite go to perfume.</li>
            <li> The price was fine as it is a large sized bottle  </li>
            <li> It smells very soft and extremely elegant.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is rare.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Pretty bottle and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> My wife loved the little sample card scent.  </li>
            <li> The first application lasted all day.  </li>
            <li> Great scent for year round even in the summer when you want light and simple.</li>
            <li> Point on my favor! ;-)</li>
            <li> Only thing is you have to put more on after about 4 or 5 hrs.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order this fragrance again:)</li>
            <li> She wears Cashmere my Donna Karen and thought this would be a 2nd favorite.  </li>
            <li> Make sure it is EDP because EDT is different.</li>
            <li> I tried Amazon to see if they offer it, and sure enough!</li>
            <li> This is her current favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite parfum for several years.</li>
            <li> It arrived on the exact day</li>
            <li> though it smelled good for the first few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only perfume I use! :)  </li>
            <li> Have seen same bottle in retail store for $40.00 more.  </li>
            <li> This is my first perfume purchase from Amazon and the first time writing a review here after buying a ton of stuff from them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We love it, is very lasting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of those situations where I&#x27;m really sad because a scent that so many see as very sophisticated just does not work on me at all.</li>
            <li> It had strange sound and sprayed a lot immediately at the first use.</li>
            <li> Wondering if it really is EDP?  </li>
            <li> Tried looking for deals on the product in stores here in the US and it is a very pricey perfume.</li>
            <li> love the pink color of bottle.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is just my skin, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as Tom Ford&#x27;s Noir or Tory Burch.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the smell, but if I had to try</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> And this really surpassed all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> Stays with you the whole day.</li>
            <li> it suit me  as perfum can be very personnal .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the highly rated reviews!</li>
            <li> It s very cloying, a scent that gives you headaches.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We are very please and we recomend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> It goes fast though.</li>
            <li> Really like this fragrance though, and have gotten compliments on it as well.</li>
            <li> This is my Girlfriend&#x27;s favorite perfume and to my advantage, it&#x27;s the only one so far that I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
            <li> It smells great but is crazy expensive and I shopped all over to find the best buy.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very fast and was well packed to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> After trying many perfumes, some too &#x27;sweet&#x27; some too heavy, many fade after a few minutes....</li>
            <li> I cannot fall in love with any other fragrance since discovering this one in an airport store.</li>
            <li> I smelled this originally in a magazine fold out and ordered it immediately, I have to say that it was not the same.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this then any other I have worn.  </li>
            <li> One of my new go to fragrances!</li>
            <li> It is definitely an older woman&#x27;s scent, but don&#x27;t think grandma.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this fragrance to appeal to the woman in you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really nice mixed with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Normally this size is $99.00 at Sephora or other fine department stores.  </li>
            <li> Just bought a second one to replace the first.</li>
            <li> , the wife loves it and wears it almost everyday! :)</li>
            <li> this is the second one that I buy, the first one was all right, but the second  doesn&#x27;t  have any fixative, it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see that Amazon charged less than Nordstrom&#x27;s does.  </li>
            <li> How do I rate the product and the product did not I receive so far, and I bought it from a year ago</li>
            <li> This is definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li> So soft and so feminine selling.</li>
            <li> I would say it is a scent for a woman that is from around 35 to 50 years old.</li>
            <li> Again, I filled out a review before and this is redundant.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the real deal.</li>
            <li> I like more beginning or the dry down.</li>
            <li> Love this soft and subtle feminine floral scent, its sillage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very sweet and deep muscy smell which will probably not fit everybody.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very subtle and nice perfume.</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money because at department stores, this perfume is around $130.</li>
            <li> Now, I can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li> It must be the young generation with a different olfactory poi t.  </li>
            <li> and I had to be careful to use the spray very sparingly.</li>
            <li> If you try it try to test the fragrance from the cup of the fragrance where it already developed not freshly sprayed.</li>
            <li> For a long time my signature perfumes were Chanel Coco, Allure, Samsara, Hermes Elixir De Marviollus Shalimar Initial, but all of them fall in the shadow of Nardico Rodrigues For Her EDP.</li>
            <li> but I gave it a 4 because the smell doesn&#x27;t  seem to last very long at all.</li>
            <li> I also think it would not fit well very young women, like 16-20.</li>
            <li> I expected the sent to last longer on the body since parfume and not toilette.</li>
            <li> Sexiest smelling stuff I have smelt in a long time....</li>
            <li> They probably had this on the shelf for a long time.</li>
            <li> You should not be selling perfumes that have been sitting on the shelf for a long time.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and for a lesser price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite scents &amp; quite a bit less expensive purchasing through Amazon</li>
            <li> love the fragrance , but I find the bottle shape a little uncomfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> NOW WONDERING IF THIS IS THE ORIGINAL OR A FAKE.</li>
            <li> I used this fragrance for a long time and this is a not real one..</li>
            <li> So the only thing is it&#x27;ll be hard to tell when I&#x27;m running low!!!  </li>
            <li> Delivered before expected date.</li>
            <li> It was well packaged and came as expected.  </li>
            <li> pink bottle looks like pepto bismol</li>
            <li> Even if I spritz 8 times the scent doesn&#x27;t last longer that a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Although I am a loyal amazon prime fan, this experience, and inability to return what I believe is inauthentic product, has left a bad taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the slight premium over over-advertized, mediocre perfumes.</li>
            <li> I find that whenever I wear it I get tons of compliments on my perfume over other perfumes I wear day to day.</li>
            <li> I bought the first one, which says 3.3oz (for ~77$ sold by Amazon, not Sephora) but it is a fake.</li>
            <li> It smelled like leaning agent, bathroom earner ad other household products.  </li>
            <li> Despite the number of pumps I apply, I can hardly smell the scent an hour later.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money - buy one of those instead.</li>
            <li> It barely has a faint smell, and  when I sprayed it on the scent only lasted about 10-20 minutes on me.</li>
            <li> THE SENT ONLY LASTED A SHORT WHILE, AND IT IS FAINT.  </li>
            <li> Usually have to spray it behind my knees (far away from my face) if I wear any...</li>
            <li> I would say it is a little earthy with some fruity undertones to balance it out.  </li>
            <li> So watered down!</li>
            <li> The only thing that threw me was, it comes in a pink (like shown) bottle, I thought they sent me the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon because it is not available in my town.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong or overbearing scent.</li>
            <li> not strong and always get compliments.</li>
            <li> like modern scents but the rating on this is very disturbing.  </li>
            <li> It is complex and it changes and develops from the time you apply it and as it dries down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - or buy it in a major store so if something is wrong at least you can return it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to rate a perfume since it is a matter of personal taste</li>
            <li> The smell initially is not my favorite</li>
            <li> have it been wearing it now for the past 10 years</li>
            <li> I wish i would&#x27;ve gotten a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I do not like this perfume at all, the smell make me sick, sorry I am not trying to be mean but is true</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a Christmas gift and although I ordered it late, it should have arrived at its destination on January 2, 2013.</li>
            <li> but then it got sickening since its a very unusual smell.</li>
            <li> My mom is actually very delicate to smells, and usually gets headaches from wearing perfumes.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on January 7, 2013 and broken.</li>
            <li> Using this was not a pleasant experience, so needless to say, I won&#x27;t be doing so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really HATE the Pepto pink bottle.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this purchase, which I believe is not genuine EDP Narciso Rodriguez.  </li>
            <li> The bottom of the bottle, and the sides, and everything looks fake, it has asymmetrical lines.</li>
            <li> I never thought that Amazon would sell the fake perfume.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles and as soon as I opened and used one of them I realized it was fake.</li>
            <li> It was not as expensive as it was in the store.</li>
            <li> Hoping that Amazon will refund and try and deal with the recurring incidents of fake perfumes.</li>
            <li> this is fake.</li>
            <li> this is how fake it is..</li>
            <li> This smells weird on me-</li>
            <li> really, really weird.</li>
            <li> I was so crazy about the scent that I used it sparingly and still have it.</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m stuck with bad product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m thinking maybe a bad batch or  </li>
            <li> I got a sample from a department store and was disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it and looked at the bottle I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Soo disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am sooooooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> This item is fake!!!</li>
            <li> and it is clearly a fake.!!!</li>
            <li> like to try again but skeptical!!!</li>
            <li> Ugh!!!!! The Smell was horrible!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Still on the fence with this - because I really love this perfume.  The first application lasted all day.  Now, I can barely smell it.  Wondering if it really is EDP?  I guess next time I&#x27;ll order from Macys.</li>
            <li> great seller good items /&lt;br /&gt;everything is good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very subtle and nice perfume. The perfect combination of musky and girlie. It&#x27;s my go-to scent.  &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 it!</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a subtle but wonderful fragrance, this is one to try.  It&#x27;s been a staple for me for several years.  It&#x27;s not a strong or overbearing scent.</li>
            <li> I smelled this fragrance on a friend and had to have it for myself. It is so sophisticated and unique and I love it. Great scent for year round even in the summer when you want light and simple.</li>
            <li> Excellence again! Thank you for the speedy delivery and great pricesâ™¥</li>
            <li> This fragrance is me.  I cannot fall in love with any other fragrance since discovering this one in an airport store. I cannot find this fragrance in any department store so and please to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This item is fake!!! Do not buy. Smell goes away in like 15 mins</li>
            <li> One of my Favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Very Impressed. I have been using this perfume every since my BF and now hubby bought to for me about 5years ago in the UK. I was so crazy about the scent that I used it sparingly and still have it. Tried looking for deals on the product in stores here in the US and it is a very pricey perfume. Then I waited on amazon and got a real good deal(worth the wait).&lt;br /&gt;The scent is worth every penny and has a musky lovely scent that will keep you and your company very much into you. It hits the senses and perfect for that romantic evening.</li>
            <li> Not as fragrant as I remembered! Pretty bottle and shipped quickly.  Always want to hear, &amp;#34;what perfume are you wearing?&amp;#34;.  Not with this one</li>
            <li> Just the perfect product for me. Good price! It was delivery on time! o received in perfect condition. I&#x27; just too happy with my perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife love it! Point on my favor! ;-)</li>
            <li> This fragnance is very unique. It smells so good and I feel sooooo sexy when I am wearing it. This is truly sex in a bottle!</li>
            <li> I am a fragrance junky and have a lot of perfumes including many of the high priced name brands ones and I think narcisco is heads above all of them.  The fragrance is perfect! Not too strong , not too light and it lasts for hours. The price was fine as it is a large sized bottle  I will be ordering again soon !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to rate a perfume since it is a matter of personal taste but I find this one to be very good and classy.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very sweet and deep muscy smell which will probably not fit everybody. I also think it would not fit well very young women, like 16-20. I also like the fact that this perfume has nothing to do with some celebrity which makes it a great gift for every woman and is not embarassing to wear yourself.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance , but I find the bottle shape a little uncomfortable in your hand. love the pink color of bottle. since and sutle</li>
            <li> Bought this on a recommendation and my wife loves it! Smells amazing and is long-lasting. Just bought a second one to replace the first. This one&#x27;s for keeps. Totally worth the slight premium over over-advertized, mediocre perfumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite scents &amp; quite a bit less expensive purchasing through Amazon</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance and got a great buy on it after searching the Internet! This fragrance is edgy an unforgettable!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance! Only thing is you have to put more on after about 4 or 5 hrs. Got nice compliments! I will definitely order this fragrance again:)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume: very light and good for summer. Delivered before expected date.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the little sample card scent.  I bought a bottle and she found it to be very bold and don&#x27;t think that she will be wearing it.  She wears Cashmere my Donna Karen and thought this would be a 2nd favorite.  Not so much.</li>
            <li> This is my scent of choice. I fell in love with this perfume! It gets better as you wear it and the scent gets nicer and stays with you throughout the day. I find that whenever I wear it I get tons of compliments on my perfume over other perfumes I wear day to day. Definitely worth the price! (:</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it.  It is my new favorite go to perfume.</li>
            <li> How do I rate the product and the product did not I receive so far, and I bought it from a year ago</li>
            <li> Very good perfume, the wife loves it and wears it almost everyday! :)&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with product and shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from a department store and was disappointed with it.  The floral smell faded very fast and left the woodsy smell which wasn&#x27;t pleasant by itself.  Perhaps this is just my skin, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as Tom Ford&#x27;s Noir or Tory Burch.  Not worth the money - buy one of those instead.</li>
            <li> this is the second one that I buy, the first one was all right, but the second  doesn&#x27;t  have any fixative, it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> I chose this cologne because I initially received a magazine with a fold back flop with this scent and I loved it. Then about two months later I opened the flop again and the scent was still there. I finally ordered it and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s a beautiful fresh and clean scent. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this fragance, and arrived on time thanks</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter&#x27;s birthday,she loves it</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!  I am a teacher and one of the moms always smelled incredible and finally I had to ask her what it was, and she told me about this stuff.  I went home and purchased it immediately and it is my favorite perfume that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I get compliments on it all the time and people ask me what I am wearing.  I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the smell, but if I had to try I would say it is a little earthy with some fruity undertones to balance it out.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Was dissapointed. I expected the sent to last longer on the body since parfume and not toilette.</li>
            <li> Sexiest smelling stuff I have smelt in a long time....loved it X100</li>
            <li> OMG. This perfume is out of the world. I I was able to create perfume this what I would create. It is sweet, sexy, yummy. It has all right ingredients without being over the top. It is complex and it changes and develops from the time you apply it and as it dries down. And it is wonderful from the beginning to the end. I still cannot decide which part I like more beginning or the dry down. I think the development part. If you try it try to test the fragrance from the cup of the fragrance where it already developed not freshly sprayed. It is different from anything you ever smelled and no one will smell quiet like you. I read about this perfume (I collect perfumes) I went into the store to buy another perfume and saw this one. I asked to smell the cup. I was in shock. I ordered sample from Amazone and I could not stop smelling it. I went back to the store next day and got the biggest bottle. For a long time my signature perfumes were Chanel Coco, Allure, Samsara, Hermes Elixir De Marviollus Shalimar Initial, but all of them fall in the shadow of Nardico Rodrigues For Her EDP. Make sure it is EDP because EDT is different.</li>
            <li> I bought the first one, which says 3.3oz (for ~77$ sold by Amazon, not Sephora) but it is a fake. When I opened it and looked at the bottle I was so disappointed. The bottom of the bottle, and the sides, and everything looks fake, it has asymmetrical lines. Even the sprayer, when you push on it, is not solid. It had strange sound and sprayed a lot immediately at the first use. I had the same perfume in smaller bottle which I got in a gift set and it is completely different. The smell is the same though. I never thought that Amazon would sell the fake perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and it has been a great success. It smells awesome and I got praised for it nonstop.</li>
            <li> This is one of my fav. Once you know what you like there is no reason to shop and pay for more at dept stores</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles and as soon as I opened and used one of them I realized it was fake. The smell is different (the alcohol scent is stronger) and the box was made by unprofessional people.&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase this product!</li>
            <li> It lasts, I love this fresh clean scent its great in and out of the office being  I work around men in my field of work , I received many comments from all my girl friends.....Great Buy ...</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I bought this. It was not as expensive as it was in the store. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> THE SENT ONLY LASTED A SHORT WHILE, AND IT IS FAINT.  I AM NOW WONDERING IF THIS IS THE ORIGINAL OR A FAKE.</li>
            <li> Quality purchase. This is definitely the real thing. It smells amazing. It has the perfect mixture of sexy, sophisticated, and powerful. It lasts all day and I would recommend it for everyone. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I smelled this originally in a magazine fold out and ordered it immediately, I have to say that it was not the same. The smell initially is not my favorite but it smells so much better the longer it&#x27;s on. I like it closer to the end of the day than i do in the beginning. It&#x27;s also really nice mixed with other fragrances. It&#x27;s light and floral, great for the day or night.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this purchase, which I believe is not genuine EDP Narciso Rodriguez.  Every time I would spray this EDP on in a department store the scent would stay on my clothing for days.  I loved it so much I decided to purchase it through Amazon.  Despite the number of pumps I apply, I can hardly smell the scent an hour later.  Although I am a loyal amazon prime fan, this experience, and inability to return what I believe is inauthentic product, has left a bad taste in my mouth.  Looks like I&#x27;m stuck with bad product.</li>
            <li> I adore this product and have purchased it on  a number of occasions duty free. I received this and it is clearly a fake.!!! Soo disappointed. Hoping that Amazon will refund and try and deal with the recurring incidents of fake perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER seen this size 3.3oz on Eau Da Parfum for $38.50 before.  Normally this size is $99.00 at Sephora or other fine department stores.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> This fragrance was introduced to me by a friend who knows fragrances. And this really surpassed all of my expectations. So soft and so feminine selling. It too is a head turner.I highly recommend this fragrance to appeal to the woman in you.</li>
            <li> One of my new go to fragrances! People stop me all the time and I ordered the perfume because I like staying power!!</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law loves this perfume so I purchased it for her for Christmas.  She loved it.  It was well packaged and came as expected.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is rare. It has an unusual scent.. just love. have it been wearing it now for the past 10 years</li>
            <li> Most perfumes give me a headache within several seconds/minutes, so I avoid wearing perfume for the most part.  Usually have to spray it behind my knees (far away from my face) if I wear any... but this one... my friend wore it and every time we hugged, I smelled this AMAZING fragrance!  I wanted to bury my face in her hair - ha.  So after asking what the fragrance is, she pointed me to Narciso Rodriguez For Her.  I tried Amazon to see if they offer it, and sure enough! Here it is... Wonderful!  I LOVE this perfume. I wear it every day to work now. Very Happy.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light and fragrant. Perfect summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> After trying many perfumes, some too &#x27;sweet&#x27; some too heavy, many fade after a few minutes....Narciso Rodriguez filled all requirements.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, everyone you pass will notice what a vamp you are</li>
            <li> It is absolutely great, love the perfume.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Got it for my fianc&amp;eacute; as a Christmas gift. This is her current favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s original and very nice</li>
            <li> Smells so good, I could just throw up confetti or eat myself! Love it!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous fragrance.  I get tons of compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> After searching and searching for the best price on this fragrance this was THE best price!  I adore this fragrance and always get compliments when I wear it!  I highly recommend for any woman it definitely makes you feel and smell great!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume. I bought this as gift for my wife&#x27;s birthday. Totally satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite parfum for several years. Stays with you the whole day. I get more compliments on this then any other I have worn.  Good pricing and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Loved the scent but I gave it a 4 because the smell doesn&#x27;t  seem to last very long at all.</li>
            <li> Its Rossi smell so freshy n sexy n elegant if ull try it u wont stop wearing it if u r the person who likes attention try it</li>
            <li> I love anything from Narciso Rodriguez..... This fragrance is the &amp;#34;bomb&amp;#34;, is has the most delicious and sensual smell ever.....</li>
            <li> it suit me  as perfum can be very personnal . pink bottle looks like pepto bismol but so nice!! just love it</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine and was instantly in love with it.  I bought this from Amazon because it is not available in my town.  I was excited to see that Amazon charged less than Nordstrom&#x27;s does.  It arrived on the exact day Amazon said it would, and in perfect condition.  I have received many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> I smelled this originally from a magazine sample. I fell in love and made my mother buy it lol. I though it smelled good for the first few days but then it got sickening since its a very unusual smell. I wish i would&#x27;ve gotten a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mom. It is a very nice scent. It is definitely an older woman&#x27;s scent, but don&#x27;t think grandma. I would say it is a scent for a woman that is from around 35 to 50 years old. It smells very soft and extremely elegant. My mom is actually very delicate to smells, and usually gets headaches from wearing perfumes. if you have this problem then i would definitley say that this perfume is perfect for you. It was a little pricey, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money because at department stores, this perfume is around $130. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift. One of her favorite and she was running out. Great surprise! I enjoy it on her as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only perfume I use! :)  Best scent ever!! I Love it!  Very Happy.. Will order again and again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  It smells great but is crazy expensive and I shopped all over to find the best buy.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very fast and was well packed to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a Christmas gift and although I ordered it late, it should have arrived at its destination on January 2, 2013. The item arrived on January 7, 2013 and broken. I had the box shipped to my mom, she said the box was drenched inside, her Christmas gift was ruined.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite scent!!!  I feel so feminine and like I&#x27;m surrounded by luxury.</li>
            <li> I smelled it in an mail ad. I loved it and bought it for my wife for Christmas. She wears it all the time now.</li>
            <li> Again, I filled out a review before and this is redundant. I knew I wanted this perfume from the time I smelled it from a magazine. It arrived on-time. I still love it. No problems with the product or source.&lt;br /&gt;Really HATE the Pepto pink bottle.</li>
            <li> My sister loves it. It smells really nice and the price is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;The box came out perfectly and we are very happy.</li>
            <li> love this fragrance! not strong and always get compliments.</li>
            <li> I gave it away as a Christmas present, as my friends told me that it would be a great gift for someone her age. It smelt good at the&lt;br /&gt;department store. Only time will tell. Can&#x27;t give it a honest rating more by what friends reported.</li>
            <li> I smelled this scent in a magazine and fell in love! The bottle is beautiful, the scent is wonderful. I have another Narciso Rodriguez scent, &amp;#34;Essence,&amp;#34; which I love as well, but The NR for Her is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Good size for the money.  Have seen same bottle in retail store for $40.00 more.  Love the Smell, and it stays all day.</li>
            <li> this is fake. Definitely not the real deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the highly rated reviews! It must be the young generation with a different olfactory poi t.  It smelled like leaning agent, bathroom earner ad other household products.  It s very cloying, a scent that gives you headaches.&lt;br /&gt;I like modern scents but the rating on this is very disturbing.  I know I am not the first reviewer to note the off scent!!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this purchase. They probably had this on the shelf for a long time. It barely has a faint smell, and  when I sprayed it on the scent only lasted about 10-20 minutes on me. I think the smell would be a lovely scent, but cannot really tell.  You should not be selling perfumes that have been sitting on the shelf for a long time. I will probably purchase this and any perfume from the store. Not through Amazon. Irma</li>
            <li> The color and the weight of the Bottle is extremely nice. The packaging lovely,&lt;br /&gt;and the perfume smells absolutely amazing. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> This was an extravagant indulgence for me. At first the smell was very strong and I had to be careful to use the spray very sparingly. The scent lasted all day and I loved it. But after 6 weeks the smell evaporated in 2 seconds! Even if I spritz 8 times the scent doesn&#x27;t last longer that a few minutes. The smell stays on my clothes - but not on me. I am sooooooo disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money - or buy it in a major store so if something is wrong at least you can return it.</li>
            <li> Love this soft and subtle feminine floral scent, its sillage. People tell me I smell good when I pass by.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good seller. Recomended.</li>
            <li> I used this fragrance for a long time and this is a not real one.. better go to the store and buy it.. it does not even smell.. this is how fake it is.. I have been buying this fragrance for over 3 years..</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It was a gift from my husband.  It smells so lovely.  I always get compliments when I am wearing it.  He got it on Amazon for a VERY good price.</li>
            <li> The scent is gorgeous and feminine</li>
            <li> This is my first perfume purchase from Amazon and the first time writing a review here after buying a ton of stuff from them!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this lovely EDP after finding it in Vogue April issue. However I can&#x27;t smell it 5minutes after spraying it on.&lt;br /&gt;Even the scent in the magazine flap lasts longer than this entire bottle.. So watered down! I love Amazon but get yours from Sephora.</li>
            <li> The best perfume in my opinion</li>
            <li> Love this!!  I get so many compliments when I wear this perfume!  I&#x27;m not that great at describing smells, all I can say is that it smells intoxicating!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 2 years now....</li>
            <li> When I received this item i was excited. Ugh!!!!! The Smell was horrible!!!  I smelled this fragrance on a gril friend and it was great so I&#x27;m thinking maybe a bad batch or  knock off.would like to try again but skeptical!!!</li>
            <li> We love it, is very lasting. the wife puts it in the morning and after a full day at the office shes still smells good in the afternoon. Since she started using it her female coworkers are asking what is parfum is she wearing and giving her compliments. We are very please and we recomend it to everyone. No cons.</li>
            <li> muy buena esta colonia no la conocia ahora es una de las favoritas de las mujeres de mi familia muy buena</li>
            <li> This smells weird on me- really, really weird. I think the notes are floral but they smell like plastic on me. The fragrance is described as musky, but I can&#x27;t smell a bit of musk. Using this was not a pleasant experience, so needless to say, I won&#x27;t be doing so again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those situations where I&#x27;m really sad because a scent that so many see as very sophisticated just does not work on me at all.</li>
            <li> The best perfume I&#x27;ve ever ordered online, clean, refreshing scent, not overpowering. Ordered the additional purse size later. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and for a lesser price. Lovely and convenient!</li>
            <li> This is great perfume.  It goes fast though.</li>
            <li> Gorges  smell  A++++ seler</li>
            <li> I first smelled this fragrance on a paper sample in a magazine, and I really liked it. I had hung onto that sample forever then I finally ordered it! I really love, I can&#x27;t edxplain what it smells like but I want to wear it all the time! The only thing that threw me was, it comes in a pink (like shown) bottle, I thought they sent me the wrong thing. I thought it was lotion! So the only thing is it&#x27;ll be hard to tell when I&#x27;m running low!!!  Really like this fragrance though, and have gotten compliments on it as well.</li>
            <li> This is my Girlfriend&#x27;s favorite perfume and to my advantage, it&#x27;s the only one so far that I&#x27;m not allergic to. So any chance I&#x27;ll get, I&#x27;ll continue getting this one.</li>
            <li> True to size. True to smell.</li>
            <li> I do not like this perfume at all, the smell make me sick, sorry I am not trying to be mean but is true the smell is repulsive to me.</li>
