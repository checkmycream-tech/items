            <li>I love Essie polish because it lasts.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>and it looks better than Essie&#x27;s Turquoise and Caicos.  </li>
            <li>I love the color but something is off about the consistency.</li>
            <li>Goes on well used 3 coats and a top coat</li>

            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>Such a beautiful color!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this nail polish after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and a good price.</li>
            <li>So make sure you use a strong protective top coat</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color and covers very well!</li>
            <li>Deep, bright, gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying another bottle of this gorgeous color!</li>
            <li>It was so bright and vibrant</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, Essie is by far the best nail polish quality.</li>
            <li>Love the color and its a great buy when you can only find this brand for $8 at the stores!</li>
            <li>and it goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t stain your cuticles and comes off fairly easy.  </li>
            <li>Paints on well and evenly, dries just fine.</li>
            <li>By far the best Essie color I&#x27;ve come across thus far!</li>
            <li>Fabulous color.</li>
            <li>The lasting power of this nail polish isn&#x27;t that great however, it chips after a couple days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about my nail polish, too and Essie is such a great brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s goopy and does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>you really aren&#x27;t going to find a shade of blue this perfect</li>
            <li>Polish glides on perfectly and only 2 coats required, unlike many of the other lighter shades so popular this season.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth and dries in a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It is so rich and goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a bright, beautiful blue!!</li>
            <li>Long-lasting rich color.</li>
            <li>The first time I saw this color I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>The coat went on well, and after two applications was streak free and full.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this color</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re familiar with Essie&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This color looks fantastic and true to bottle color as shown.</li>
            <li>An amazingly perfect sky, baby, soft blue!</li>
            <li>this is a nice bright color maybe a little to bright color for my very white skin ton</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone that likes bright colors</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite color.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t say in the description, this is a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>and it really is that cute turqoise.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nail polish junkie and not only is Essie my favorite nail polish brand, &#x27;In the Cab-Ana&#x27; is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cute blue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a very stunning blue.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite color.  </li>
            <li>New favorite color.</li>
            <li>White accents or silver makes it pop for sure!  </li>
            <li>It is okay on med-long nails, but would be far too bright on very long nails.</li>
            <li>Essie is a nice brand especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice sky blue all summer</li>
            <li>This color is fun and flirty.</li>
            <li>It will be worth it.</li>
            <li>I like this fun color</li>
            <li>fun for summer color.</li>
            <li>but I have to say this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It came fast and good packaging, I&#x27;ve recommended this color to several friends</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and even and no issues with chipping or peeling like many other brands.</li>
            <li>Lasted 2 or 3 days before chipping - more than most other polishes I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and bright!</li>
            <li>It was much much darker and instead of being excited about the color</li>
            <li>Received compliments on this color right away.</li>
            <li>It came super fast.</li>
            <li>Better than trying to buy it local.</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast!</li>
            <li>More of a darker shade of sky blue if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Still pretty though</li>
            <li>I saw this color at my local store and fell in love.</li>
            <li>&amp; it came really fast!  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still a pretty shade of blue and looks better on than it does in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have many blue nail polishes</li>
            <li>But still a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The color is so pretty</li>
            <li>I think that is is a bit more blue on the nail than this image indicates.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, it appears a totally different hue when applied to your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those looking for a bright and fun light blue with less drama, Where&#x27;s My Chauffeur might be the way to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t chip right away like other, cheaper, nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product especially if you like light/slightly bright blue nails.</li>
            <li>This arrived fast and is the exact shade it appears to be on screen.  </li>
            <li>I looked high and low at many stores for this color</li>
            <li>When I finally received it in the mail and used it, the color looked so vibrant and bright blue.</li>
            <li>When I received this nail polish the color was absolutely not the color I had fallen in love with at the store.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter and she loves it ,This color really pops out at you ,a lot of people would probably consider this a summer color</li>
            <li>It is more blue where as aquadelic is more green in it.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite blue!</li>
            <li>During the summer its perfect, and during the winter it really brightens up your nails in the dreary cold weather.</li>
            <li>im excited to try it out again later in the summer..</li>
            <li>It last long and color stays nice.</li>
            <li>*should* be able to wear it through summer provided I file my nails down.</li>
            <li>color was very glossy when it dried , although I did add a top coat for some added protection.</li>
            <li>that this polish is no where near as light as it appears in the image above or in the magazine ads.</li>
            <li>but this is a very pretty baby blue color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Online it appears a little more aqua than in person.</li>
            <li>Cute color, though not as vibrant as pictured, takes a few coats to get the color pay off</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how fast I got the product.</li>
            <li>Just right in the middle.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t live without it,</li>
            <li>It dries quick and lasts much longer then other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really pretty blue</li>
            <li>A little more sky blue than I expected, but still fabulous.</li>
            <li>Put a clear coat of essie on top every other day and  your manicure will last.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is pretty but its more blue than I hoped, I had expected it to be a little more green</li>
            <li>The formula was a bit thick, but it wasn&#x27;t  difficult to work with , and that single coat provided a streak free perfect finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite being a color from the previous year&#x27;s line, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>This color is actually a little more blue.</li>
            <li>I love this color plus it stays on very long time unlike other Essie polishes.</li>
            <li>I frequently check for essie colors I might like on pinterest &amp; order them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is the third bottle I have of it because I use it so much.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s been opened and is old.</li>
            <li>It kinda seemed like an old polish to me because of how it went on.</li>
            <li>its very close to tiffany blue!</li>
            <li>It is a very beachy blue color that is very opaque and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>No odd application quirks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a nail art gal, but this color certainly got my imagination</li>
            <li>Searched high and low  for this color and finally found it on Amazon...</li>
            <li>Honestly what an ugly color, It does not look like the display or a real Cab-ana Essie nail polish.</li>
            <li>I generally use OPI and Zoya, and have never used a color that required only one coat.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was going to be a bit green</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li> and it looks better than Essie&#x27;s Turquoise and Caicos.  </li>
            <li> I love the color but something is off about the consistency.</li>
            <li> Goes on well used 3 coats and a top coat</li>
            <li> Love my product.</li>

            <li> Such a beautiful color!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this nail polish after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and a good price.</li>
            <li> So make sure you use a strong protective top coat</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and covers very well!</li>
            <li> Deep, bright, gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying another bottle of this gorgeous color!</li>
            <li> It was so bright and vibrant</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, Essie is by far the best nail polish quality.</li>
            <li> Love the color and its a great buy when you can only find this brand for $8 at the stores!</li>
            <li> and it goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t stain your cuticles and comes off fairly easy.  </li>
            <li> Paints on well and evenly, dries just fine.</li>
            <li> By far the best Essie color I&#x27;ve come across thus far!</li>
            <li> Fabulous color.</li>
            <li> The lasting power of this nail polish isn&#x27;t that great however, it chips after a couple days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about my nail polish, too and Essie is such a great brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goopy and does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> you really aren&#x27;t going to find a shade of blue this perfect</li>
            <li> Polish glides on perfectly and only 2 coats required, unlike many of the other lighter shades so popular this season.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth and dries in a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It is so rich and goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a bright, beautiful blue!!</li>
            <li> Long-lasting rich color.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw this color I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> The coat went on well, and after two applications was streak free and full.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this color</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re familiar with Essie&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This color looks fantastic and true to bottle color as shown.</li>
            <li> An amazingly perfect sky, baby, soft blue!</li>
            <li> this is a nice bright color maybe a little to bright color for my very white skin ton</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone that likes bright colors</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite color.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t say in the description, this is a full size bottle.</li>
            <li> Love it so much.</li>
            <li> and it really is that cute turqoise.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail polish junkie and not only is Essie my favorite nail polish brand, &#x27;In the Cab-Ana&#x27; is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cute blue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a very stunning blue.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite color.  </li>
            <li> New favorite color.</li>
            <li> White accents or silver makes it pop for sure!  </li>
            <li> It is okay on med-long nails, but would be far too bright on very long nails.</li>
            <li> Essie is a nice brand especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice sky blue all summer</li>
            <li> This color is fun and flirty.</li>
            <li> It will be worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this fun color</li>
            <li> fun for summer color.</li>
            <li> but I have to say this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It came fast and good packaging, I&#x27;ve recommended this color to several friends</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and even and no issues with chipping or peeling like many other brands.</li>
            <li> Lasted 2 or 3 days before chipping - more than most other polishes I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and bright!</li>
            <li> It was much much darker and instead of being excited about the color</li>
            <li> Received compliments on this color right away.</li>
            <li> It came super fast.</li>
            <li> Better than trying to buy it local.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast!</li>
            <li> More of a darker shade of sky blue if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Still pretty though</li>
            <li> I saw this color at my local store and fell in love.</li>
            <li> &amp; it came really fast!  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still a pretty shade of blue and looks better on than it does in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have many blue nail polishes</li>
            <li> But still a pretty color.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty</li>
            <li> I think that is is a bit more blue on the nail than this image indicates.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, it appears a totally different hue when applied to your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those looking for a bright and fun light blue with less drama, Where&#x27;s My Chauffeur might be the way to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t chip right away like other, cheaper, nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product especially if you like light/slightly bright blue nails.</li>
            <li> This arrived fast and is the exact shade it appears to be on screen.  </li>
            <li> I looked high and low at many stores for this color</li>
            <li> When I finally received it in the mail and used it, the color looked so vibrant and bright blue.</li>
            <li> When I received this nail polish the color was absolutely not the color I had fallen in love with at the store.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it ,This color really pops out at you ,a lot of people would probably consider this a summer color</li>
            <li> It is more blue where as aquadelic is more green in it.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite blue!</li>
            <li> During the summer its perfect, and during the winter it really brightens up your nails in the dreary cold weather.</li>
            <li> im excited to try it out again later in the summer..</li>
            <li> It last long and color stays nice.</li>
            <li> *should* be able to wear it through summer provided I file my nails down.</li>
            <li> color was very glossy when it dried , although I did add a top coat for some added protection.</li>
            <li> that this polish is no where near as light as it appears in the image above or in the magazine ads.</li>
            <li> but this is a very pretty baby blue color.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> Online it appears a little more aqua than in person.</li>
            <li> Cute color, though not as vibrant as pictured, takes a few coats to get the color pay off</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how fast I got the product.</li>
            <li> Just right in the middle.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t live without it,</li>
            <li> It dries quick and lasts much longer then other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really pretty blue</li>
            <li> A little more sky blue than I expected, but still fabulous.</li>
            <li> Put a clear coat of essie on top every other day and  your manicure will last.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is pretty but its more blue than I hoped, I had expected it to be a little more green</li>
            <li> The formula was a bit thick, but it wasn&#x27;t  difficult to work with , and that single coat provided a streak free perfect finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite being a color from the previous year&#x27;s line, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This color is actually a little more blue.</li>
            <li> I love this color plus it stays on very long time unlike other Essie polishes.</li>
            <li> I frequently check for essie colors I might like on pinterest &amp; order them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is the third bottle I have of it because I use it so much.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s been opened and is old.</li>
            <li> It kinda seemed like an old polish to me because of how it went on.</li>
            <li> its very close to tiffany blue!</li>
            <li> It is a very beachy blue color that is very opaque and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> No odd application quirks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a nail art gal, but this color certainly got my imagination</li>
            <li> Searched high and low  for this color and finally found it on Amazon...</li>
            <li> Honestly what an ugly color, It does not look like the display or a real Cab-ana Essie nail polish.</li>
            <li> I generally use OPI and Zoya, and have never used a color that required only one coat.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was going to be a bit green</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure how this color will look after I&#x27;ve really started to tan</li>
            <li> Last long doesn&#x27;t chip</li>
            <li> but I noticed that Essie polish doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> it last long.</li>
            <li> The formula is thin/runny and takes either a good white base coat or multiple layers to build it up.</li>
            <li> The color is a little different than in the picture, but not different enough that I was bothered by it.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time like all Essie nail polishes.</li>
            <li> It took so long to dry too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall...(as stated by several other reviewers)</li>
            <li> Not too blue not too green.</li>
            <li> It took me 4 days to receive it and it was carefully wrapped.</li>
            <li> This is just what i expected.</li>
            <li> This is a scam and not real Essie.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like my other Essie polish that&#x27;s been bought in stores.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m constantly washing bottles, the polish would not chip after few days like others do!</li>
            <li> The formula goes on and comes off well, unlike some other Essie polishes.  </li>
            <li> I hardly needed a second coat.</li>
            <li> It was so hard to find last summer.</li>
            <li> Where&#x27;s My Chauffeur, In the Cab-ana is like its naughty twin.</li>
            <li> I received endless amounts of compliments wearing this color!</li>
            <li> The polish dries quickly, so I&#x27;m not waiting around.</li>
            <li> The color is underwhelming compared to what I had previously seen of it.</li>
            <li> My brush is a little messed up, but it doesn&#x27;t effect the way the nail polish goes on.</li>
            <li> Also, it was a little thicker than I</li>
            <li> Adding some OPI polish thinner seemed to help a little bit.</li>
            <li> Color was a little darker than I thought.</li>
            <li> I bought this color for a gift for a colleague who loves to change her nail color every few days.  </li>
            <li> I received it less than 4 days after I placed to order!</li>
            <li> Initially I was not impressed by this color as it looks blah in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have a small baby</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it enough to get rid of it, but it was definitely a bummer for me.</li>
            <li> Apparantly it is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> She bought the pink afterward but was very disappointed that it was not the same quality.  </li>
            <li> I did have two coats of a ridge filling base coat on prior to adding the color, and  perhaps that helped.</li>
            <li> but the polish is very thick and sloppy while applying.</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with essie.</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t go wrong with Essie&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> it was depressing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fabulous color. Not too blue not too green. Just right in the middle. Not too bright and out there that you can&#x27;t wear it and look goofy. Good color for that summer pedicure. Pricing is great. Better than trying to buy it local.</li>
            <li> This color reminds me of the beach and thus why I wanted to add it to my polish collection.  One coat is great, two coats are fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love the color. Its officially my color of the season! Essie polish is the only brand I use!  It last long and color stays nice.</li>
            <li> absolutely in LOVE with this color!!!!! it arrived before time and its perfect. love it love it love it. def recommend</li>
            <li> I frequently check for essie colors I might like on pinterest &amp; order them on Amazon.  Despite being a color from the previous year&#x27;s line, I was not disappointed.  Goes on great!</li>
            <li> I love Essie and all of their colors.  This one received lots of compliments.  Beautiful bright color that&#x27;s perfect for spring/summer.</li>
            <li> The IT color for this spring/summer. Polish glides on perfectly and only 2 coats required, unlike many of the other lighter shades so popular this season.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast! I love this color and have gotten so many compliments on it. Apparantly it is hard to find in stores so I am thankful I found it here. The color lasted for almost 3 weeks as well.</li>
            <li> Not as turquoise as I&#x27;d hoped. More of a darker shade of sky blue if that makes sense. Still pretty though</li>
            <li> My fav color for the toes</li>
            <li> Love the essie brand. Long-lasting rich color. Great for spring or summer. Put a clear coat of essie on top every other day and  your manicure will last.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw this color I fell in love with it. It&#x27;s a very cute blue. By far my favorite blue! Getting so many uses out of it. I always get a compliment when I wear it on my nails.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> My brush is a little messed up, but it doesn&#x27;t effect the way the nail polish goes on. Great color, I can see why it&#x27;s sold out aroun town.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite color. Last long doesn&#x27;t chip quickly looks great with mani or pedi. Very fast shipping and a good price. Local places wanted $8-10 for this color.</li>
            <li> Essie is a nice brand especially for the price. I would recommend this product especially if you like light/slightly bright blue nails.</li>
            <li> Cute color, though not as vibrant as pictured, takes a few coats to get the color pay off I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I saw this color at my local store and fell in love. It was so bright and vibrant I knew I had to have it. I decided to find it on here instead and boy was that a mistake. When I received this nail polish the color was absolutely not the color I had fallen in love with at the store. It was much much darker and instead of being excited about the color it was depressing. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great color! A little more sky blue than I expected, but still fabulous. The coat went on well, and after two applications was streak free and full.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and this nail polish came in great shape.  It is one of my favorite colors for the summer.</li>
            <li> I love this color!! I get so many compliments on it. I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice sky blue all summer and then I discovered this shade. Online it appears a little more aqua than in person. I looked high and low at many stores for this color but they were always sold out. I was ecstatic to find this online. The seller Salon Supply Store not only had this color, but sold it cheaper than the stores. Although it doesn&#x27;t say in the description, this is a full size bottle. It took me 4 days to receive it and it was carefully wrapped. I will definitely be buying another bottle of this gorgeous color!</li>
            <li> The polish is a perfect summer color! It&#x27;s so cute. I was so surprised at how fast I got the product. I received it less than 4 days after I placed to order!</li>
            <li> I love the color.&lt;br /&gt;Its so bright and fun and its perfect for summer and spring. Its a very unique kind of color and its&lt;br /&gt;Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is just what i expected. the color is awsome!! &amp; it came really fast!  I cant wait to buy more colors.</li>
            <li> Perfect summer color for the toes and fingers. The polish dries quickly, so I&#x27;m not waiting around. I prefer Essie over OPI.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all things Etsy. This color is fun and flirty. It&#x27;s very easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t chip right away like other, cheaper, nail polishes.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect. Deep, bright, gorgeous. The formula is perfect. I hardly needed a second coat. Everyone needs this color!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Essie colors. It was so hard to find last summer. I am so glad I checked on Amazon and found it. It came super fast. I absolutely love it and wear it often.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly...actually sooner than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I first saw this color on a picture on Pinterest and loved it! I was also glad to see that it received good reviews on here. In the cab-Ana is a tad darker and brighter than the Tiffany blue.  The color looks different in person than it does online...However, it&#x27;s still a pretty shade of blue and looks better on than it does in the bottle. It actually looks brighter on my nails. Also, it was a little thicker than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Overall...(as stated by several other reviewers) it&#x27;s a great color for spring and summer, or as a pick-me-up color for the winter!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and covers very well! Great spring and summer color, almost as bright as the picture. Got tons of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> This arrived fast and is the exact shade it appears to be on screen.  Tiffany Blue - and perfect for a beach vacation.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is pretty but its more blue than I hoped, I had expected it to be a little more green but this is a very pretty baby blue color. The lasting power of this nail polish isn&#x27;t that great however, it chips after a couple days.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find this color everywhere! This is a scam and not real Essie. Save your money on here and spend it in a store and pay regular price. It will be worth it.</li>
            <li> This color is actually a little more blue. At first I thought it was going to be a bit green but it&#x27;s a bright aqua/blue. It&#x27;s very pretty and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments with it! Very great for spring or summer.</li>
            <li> Brag brand, great colour! What more can I say? I will be buying this shade again. Particularly nice for summer wear, or cruising season.</li>
            <li> this is a nice bright color maybe a little to bright color for my very white skin ton im excited to try it out again later in the summer..cant go wrong with essie.</li>
            <li> This is a great summer color! I&#x27;m in love! I&#x27;m picky about my nail polish, too and Essie is such a great brand.</li>
            <li> great spring/summer pallet</li>
            <li> This is one of the colors my daughter had been looking for.  I found it on Amazon and she was delighted to receive it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Perfect aqua water summer color. Shipping was fast, Essie is by far the best nail polish quality. Love it so much.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this nail polish after reading the reviews. Honestly what an ugly color, It does not look like the display or a real Cab-ana Essie nail polish. Mine is a baby blue.</li>
            <li> Great color. Opaque in 2 coats</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect summer shade. Reminds me of pool every time I look at my nails. Lasts a long time like all Essie nail polishes.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color but I noticed that Essie polish doesn&#x27;t last as long. My color chipped within TWO DAYS. So make sure you use a strong protective top coat so your color won&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> By far the best Essie color I&#x27;ve come across thus far! It is adorable and looks great on toes too! I received endless amounts of compliments wearing this color!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colors. I will wear this color any time. I love Essie polish because it lasts.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. It is so rich and goes on so smooth. Received compliments on this color right away.</li>
            <li> this color is just so gorgeous! i got a lot of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;stands out even more with a top coat!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great, it is a beautiful color and has a great strong lacquer to it, so it last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail polish junkie and not only is Essie my favorite nail polish brand, &#x27;In the Cab-Ana&#x27; is my favorite. This is the third bottle I have of it because I use it so much. I get wonderful compliments while wearing it and it&#x27;s the perfect shade of blue/green/teal/aqua. During the summer its perfect, and during the winter it really brightens up your nails in the dreary cold weather. Wearable no matter time of year and you&#x27;ll be getting compliments no matter what.</li>
            <li> Yet another great Essie color! My favorite nail polish brand!</li>
            <li> Perfect summer nail polish, I have lots of Essie nail polishes and this one definitely one of my top favorites!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite color.  Initially I was not impressed by this color as it looks blah in the bottle.  I used it for a pedicure and it looks better than Essie&#x27;s Turquoise and Caicos.  And you can&#x27;t go wrong with Essie&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my collection. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I saw this color on Pinterest and decided my polish collection and I couldn&#x27;t live without it, but I was wrong. The color is underwhelming compared to what I had previously seen of it. The formula is thin/runny and takes either a good white base coat or multiple layers to build it up. I don&#x27;t hate it enough to get rid of it, but it was definitely a bummer for me. I&#x27;ve had it a while and I honestly think I&#x27;ve used it once.</li>
            <li> I love the color but something is off about the consistency. It doesn&#x27;t feel like my other Essie polish that&#x27;s been bought in stores. It&#x27;s goopy and does not go on smoothly. Perhaps it&#x27;s been opened and is old. Adding some OPI polish thinner seemed to help a little bit.</li>
            <li> Love this!  it&#x27;s a beautiful teal color and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.  I would definitely recommend to anyone that likes bright colors</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it on for spring. I love essie polishes and this one is beautiful. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this fun color and it really is that cute turqoise.  Great price too for Essie.  fun for summer color.</li>
            <li> I searched about 7 stores in NYC and could NOT find this color anywhere!  I found it here on Amazon and received it in just 3 days!  This Essie color from the Resort 2013 collection is so pretty for the summer; looks great on toes that want some attention in sandals and open-toe wedges.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this color and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  One of those blues that&#x27;s a perfect fit for the summer.  Good quality, good price!</li>
            <li> New favorite color. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on it!!</li>
            <li> Thanks-Great price. Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it ,This color really pops out at you ,a lot of people would probably consider this a summer color but I think its whatever the mood your in to me its a happy color.Goes on well used 3 coats and a top coat and she was very happy looks like the picture even better</li>
            <li> Love this shade!  Great for summer and a beachy look.  White accents or silver makes it pop for sure!  Essie is great!</li>
            <li> An amazingly perfect sky, baby, soft blue! A must have in any collection. you really aren&#x27;t going to find a shade of blue this perfect</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color!  I was looking for a Tiffany blue and this is almost it.  I love Essie polishes; they&#x27;re vibrant and durable and so beautiful.  I&#x27;m definitely a fan.</li>
            <li> The actual color is a tad bit lighter then it appears in the picture BUT it is a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> I have many blue nail polishes but I have to say this is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s such a bright, beautiful blue!!</li>
            <li> Searched high and low  for this color and finally found it on Amazon... Awesome website. Will definitely keep ordering from you!!</li>
            <li> Love the color and its a great buy when you can only find this brand for $8 at the stores!</li>
            <li> Color was a little darker than I thought. But still a pretty color.</li>
            <li> Love my product. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty but the polish is very thick and sloppy while applying. It kinda seemed like an old polish to me because of how it went on. It took so long to dry too. Even after drying it was still squishy. woke up the next day with indents on my nails.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get this nail polish for a while now, but they either didn&#x27;t have it at the store it was out of stock. When I finally received it in the mail and used it, the color looked so vibrant and bright blue. I love it! It&#x27;s a perfect summer color! Prettiest color blue nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this color for a gift for a colleague who loves to change her nail color every few days.  She loves how well this color goes on and stays.  She bought the pink afterward but was very disappointed that it was not the same quality.  Back to the blue, YES! try it, you will be happy .</li>
            <li> I love this cheerful turquoise color! I think that is is a bit more blue on the nail than this image indicates. It&#x27;s a perfect Spring and Summer color! What  I had not anticipated was the perfect, fully  opaque coverage in just ONE coat. I did have two coats of a ridge filling base coat on prior to adding the color, and  perhaps that helped. I am totally impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I generally use OPI and Zoya, and have never used a color that required only one coat. The formula was a bit thick, but it wasn&#x27;t  difficult to work with , and that single coat provided a streak free perfect finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was very glossy when it dried , although I did add a top coat for some added protection. I have read many reports about Essie colors that are not as flattering, and it may be that I chose the perfect color to start with! but I WILL be buying more.</li>
            <li> gorgeous color. very bright and eye catching. i love teals/blues/greens so much and if you love them too then this is the perfect color to have in your collection</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely beautiful!  Goes on very smooth and even and no issues with chipping or peeling like many other brands.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing!! I love love love it! Highly recommend it to anyone.  It is perfect for Spring and Summer ;o))</li>
            <li> I really love this color...its very close to tiffany blue!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure how this color will look after I&#x27;ve really started to tan, it&#x27;s gorgeous now! It is okay on med-long nails, but would be far too bright on very long nails. It&#x27;s just a very stunning blue. Paints on well and evenly, dries just fine. No odd application quirks. It&#x27;s a winner! This has to be one of my favorites of the funky colors by Essie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have brown skin and *should* be able to wear it through summer provided I file my nails down. For those into nail art and all the fancy lines and dots, this is def a color to add to your arsenal. I&#x27;m not really a nail art gal, but this color certainly got my imagination working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know that this polish is no where near as light as it appears in the image above or in the magazine ads. Truthfully, it appears a totally different hue when applied to your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re familiar with Essie&#x27;s Where&#x27;s My Chauffeur, In the Cab-ana is like its naughty twin. For those looking for a bright and fun light blue with less drama, Where&#x27;s My Chauffeur might be the way to go. It&#x27;s actually closer in color to the polish in the picture above.</li>
            <li> Essie has done it again! This is a beautiful aqua blue color that is perfect for spring and summer.I thought it was going to be a dupe for china  glaze aquadelic... when you compair the two side by side they look almost identical.. but its NOT. It is more blue where as aquadelic is more green in it. I love this color</li>
            <li> I love this color.  It is a very beachy blue color that is very opaque and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> This color looks fantastic and true to bottle color as shown. It dries quick and lasts much longer then other brands.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this pollish it reminds me of summer and beaches.  It can go well with any color you have and it goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t stain your cuticles and comes off fairly easy.  Its a must have color for your collection.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful color! I receive tons of compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color. It&#x27;s a really pretty blue that&#x27;s perfect for summer or spring. It came fast and good packaging, I&#x27;ve recommended this color to several friends</li>
            <li> I love this color plus it stays on very long time unlike other Essie polishes. It&#x27;s thick and bright! I have a small baby and I&#x27;m constantly washing bottles, the polish would not chip after few days like others do!</li>
            <li> Perfect for summer.  The formula goes on and comes off well, unlike some other Essie polishes.  Needs about two coats to make it look perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail polish!  The color is a little different than in the picture, but not different enough that I was bothered by it.  It goes on nice and smooth and dries in a decent amount of time.  Lasted 2 or 3 days before chipping - more than most other polishes I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    </ol>
