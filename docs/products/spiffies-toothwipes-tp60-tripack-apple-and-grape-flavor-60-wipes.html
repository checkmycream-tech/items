    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Spiffies is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these with all 3 of my kids and our dentists have all been very happy.</li>
            <li>I am very happy I purchased these.</li>
            <li>The dentist did say they are perfect until we start using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Very good item.   </li>
            <li>If your child likes the flavors, though, I think it would be an excellent item to have on hand and be great for your baby/toddler.</li>
            <li>Was really happy to find these</li>
            <li>This is great for cleaning the kids teeth when we are on the go.  </li>
            <li>We use all the time and are great.</li>
            <li>This was a great way for him to get used to cleaning his teeth and now he has no issues brushing his teeth.  </li>
            <li>These wipes are a great way to introduce oral hygiene to an infant or for toddlers that are adverse to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but they were great.</li>
            <li>these were great to wipe out her mouth.</li>
            <li>I assume they taste great since my son smiles when he sees the paper and opens up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good idea to give your kids xylitol gum/mints or have them rinse with xylitol after eating.  </li>
            <li>I loved the idea of this product.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Good idea</li>
            <li>Not to mention she loved them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, these wipes wrap around your finger PERFECTLY and stick to themselves pretty well.</li>
            <li>a brush can&#x27;t reach effectively.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known about xylitol and how effective it is at preventing cavities.  </li>
            <li>but it is great to clean her teeth when eating out.</li>
            <li>These taste great, easy to use, and kids love them.</li>
            <li>Priced good, work very well, taste great.</li>
            <li>They love it, it prevents decay and cavities.  </li>
            <li>My boy love both grape flavor and apple flavor.</li>
            <li>, that we were able to treat with prescription flouride gel.    </li>
            <li>She does love the grape flavor, however.</li>
            <li>off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to finally do a more thorough cleanup and to my relief the stains went away..</li>
            <li>Grape is my daughters favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>Spiffies are great to use once in a while probably not everyday</li>
            <li>Good wipes and gentle on the baby.</li>
            <li>We were able to get the baby&#x27;s gums clean with them, but it was a fight every time.</li>
            <li>So easy to swipe my baby&#x27;s mouth out in the night after a feeding or after a meal.</li>
            <li>I like that the wipes are easy to use -</li>
            <li>Another reviewer talked about making her own wipes - reusable and cheaper - which is a smart idea.</li>
            <li>Great for kids training to brush regularly.</li>
            <li>Keeps his teeth free of decay and cavities and freshens breath.</li>
            <li>He was a bit hesitant at first but very quickly enjoyed the flavor of the wipe and let us clean his teeth.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s dentist recommended these to clean her teeth while out and about or when you can&#x27;t get to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>I like it because it can clean areas</li>
            <li>As you can&#x27;t use mouthwash on young babies, this is indeed the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Nice to have some wet wipes handy or the sink as the liquid is sticky like syrup.</li>
            <li>Our newest pediatric dentist told us that, so now I&#x27;m on a program to clean my mouth of the bacteria as well.  </li>
            <li>Then use a clean washcloth to wash your baby&#x27;s gums with it.  </li>
            <li>The book is actually just a good guide to preventative oral health.)    </li>
            <li>They are a good alternative to tooth brushing (and may help get an infant used to the basic feeling of dental hygiene, with someoneelse&#x27;s fingers poking around).</li>
            <li>The xylitol makes the wipes more effective than just using a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li>but like this brand far better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to learn that it costs more here while it&#x27;s made in US, compared to halfway across the globe, don&#x27;t they incur steep shipping charges over there?</li>
            <li>A good pre-test idea is get a paper towl wet</li>
            <li>Not as useful or convenient as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>Dental caries is the most frequently occurring disease in preschool age children.</li>
            <li>I have seen countless 2 and 3 year olds with so many cavities, that they needed to be sedated to have their cavities filled.</li>
            <li>Im sure I could use a towel also, but this is much easier, he doesnt fight as much.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen these in retail stores but first came across it on an overseas vacation.</li>
            <li>First off, my daughter just likes having the choice - brush or wipe? -</li>
            <li>But as she was older the less fights was nice to!</li>
            <li>I started using them with my sons first teeth and still use them now that he is 14 months.</li>
            <li>They leave his mouth smelling fresh and I can only assume they are getting his teeth clean since I have no way of measuring.</li>
            <li>He likes it so much.</li>
            <li>They leave a very sticky residue on your hand after use</li>
            <li>She is 18 months and really doesn&#x27;t like me putting a brush in her mouth..</li>
            <li>she seems to really like these</li>
            <li>still use the toothbrush, but more for getting her used to it until she is old enough to understand and do it herself.</li>
            <li>We bought these as a way to clean our son&#x27;s teeth because he initially did not like the feel of a toothbrush in his mouth.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also expensive, but you can actually make your own xylitol solution by dissolving a packet of xylitol (or spoonful) in some warm water.  </li>
            <li>My son is 19 and I tried using both flavors of tooth wipes and he wouldn&#x27;t let me near him after the first time.</li>
            <li>At this point, about three weeks after introducing them, she opts for the toothbrush (&amp;#34;wif paste!&amp;#34;) about 30% of the time, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>do like the portability of the individually wrapped wipes (e.g., for toting along to use after a birthday party&#x27;s sweet cake, or cookies at grandma&#x27;s house),</li>
            <li>If your child is 2 or older</li>
            <li>and I think that helps her feel a little more in control.</li>
            <li>just wrap around your finger and rub - which I also think allows me to be a little more thorough with an uncooperative squirmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like a bit more texture (like that of a washcloth) for everyday cleaning too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So instead of opening wide, she would clamp her jaw shut, scream, kick and cry each time anyone tried to clean her teeth.</li>
            <li>Yes, that makes your fingers or baby&#x27;s face slightly sticky but it is easily cleaned away with water.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be sold on buying more for at home use.</li>
            <li>I guess a cheaper alternative is using a wet wash rag but spiffies have flavor and since they are much thinner than a rag it is easier to clean his entire mouth.</li>
            <li>My 18 month old daughter fights me every time I brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>(We have a history of soft enamel in our family.)</li>
            <li>I brushed as much and in a way SHE would let me without bringing her to tears.</li>
            <li>I am a mother of a 9 month old (that has 8 teeth), as well as a Registered Dental Hygienist.</li>
            <li>My son refuses to let me brush his teeth or get a toothbrush anywhere near his mouth.</li>
            <li>This product is probably better for a younger baby or toddler with few teeth.</li>
            <li>After a few uses he would get very excited about us wiping his teeth with these wipes and would ask for it several times a day.  </li>
            <li>the wipes are a little bit sweet and sticky.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the high price.</li>
            <li>They do not taste very good :(</li>
            <li>Unfortunately she has a full set of teeth and like to chomp on my fingers as I try and clean her teeth and her gums.</li>
            <li>These are a bit pricey, however I think that they are worth it, if you are concerned about cavities with your little ones.</li>
            <li>Apparently, my kids got infected with the bacteria that causes cavities from me.  </li>
            <li>OBVIOUSLY they need to be used by a parent--the wipe could be eaten by a toddler or would be a choking hazard it not controlled by an adult.</li>
            <li>As much as I tried to be the model of a calm, serene and endlessly patient mama, my little cherub didn&#x27;t want to follow my lead on tooth brushing.</li>

            <li> The sticky, weird feeling other reviewers complain about is very real, but will wash away easily in the sink or even with a wet wipe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price for this product is a little bit high.</li>
            <li> MUCH easier to keep them on your finger even when the little one tries sucking/chewing them</li>
            <li> I tried myself when the kids would not let me use them on them strange texture also.</li>
            <li> Back then I would tear a spiffy in half to make the batch last</li>
            <li> I bought these for my fourth child and wish I would have purchased them for my other three kids.  </li>
            <li> They work great and they must not taste horrible because she doesn&#x27;t mind the flavor.</li>
            <li> We tried several attempts over a few months at both the Apple and Grape flavors, room temp and frozen/refrigerated.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands</li>
            <li> I practically have to hold him down to wipe his teeth.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with your finger because our son wanted to eat the wipe and bit our finger a few times.</li>
            <li> It feels a little sticky on your finger when you wrap it around</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because of me, my eldest son had two small cavities and my other two kids had early stage cavities</li>
            <li> but they should tell you to buy a finger protector as the kids like to chow down on your finger!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my daughter doesn&#x27;t really seem crazy about the wipes&#x27; flavor.</li>
            <li> Some moms think it messy, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to see if I can return the unopen box because it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also leaves our hands messy.</li>
            <li> I know of a few toddlers with cavities, and it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;d rather not have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Spiffies is the best. Use it for my kids. They love it, it prevents decay and cavities.  I tried other brands but like this brand far better.  Very good item.   I even use it myself or carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 18 months boy. He likes it so much. The yellow stain on his teeth is almost gone after using this product a couple of times. Some moms think it messy, but I don&#x27;t. My boy love both grape flavor and apple flavor. He hasn&#x27;t try mango flavor yet.</li>
            <li> Priced good, work very well, taste great. But you will get bit.</li>
            <li> Good wipes and gentle on the baby. My son uses this himself these days along with the brush! Great for kids training to brush regularly.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dentist recommended these to clean her teeth while out and about or when you can&#x27;t get to brush her teeth. They work great and they must not taste horrible because she doesn&#x27;t mind the flavor. It feels a little sticky on your finger when you wrap it around but it is great to clean her teeth when eating out. I do plan to buy them again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on myself before giving it to my 7mons old son and I hated it.  I&#x27;m trying to see if I can return the unopen box because it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen these in retail stores but first came across it on an overseas vacation. I&#x27;m surprised to learn that it costs more here while it&#x27;s made in US, compared to halfway across the globe, don&#x27;t they incur steep shipping charges over there? Spiffies are great to use once in a while probably not everyday or you have the money to burn. I use it on DS once a month. Keeps his teeth free of decay and cavities and freshens breath. I like it because it can clean areas a brush can&#x27;t reach effectively. As you can&#x27;t use mouthwash on young babies, this is indeed the next best thing. Nice to have some wet wipes handy or the sink as the liquid is sticky like syrup.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my fourth child and wish I would have purchased them for my other three kids.  Apparently, my kids got infected with the bacteria that causes cavities from me.  Our newest pediatric dentist told us that, so now I&#x27;m on a program to clean my mouth of the bacteria as well.  Unfortunately, because of me, my eldest son had two small cavities and my other two kids had early stage cavities, that we were able to treat with prescription flouride gel.    I wish I had known about xylitol and how effective it is at preventing cavities.  You can learn a lot about it in the book \\&quot;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye\\&quot;.  (Although we have no intention of kissing our dentist goodbye. The book is actually just a good guide to preventative oral health.)    I will say that these wipes are a bit sticky--so be prepared to wash your hands after.  They&#x27;re also expensive, but you can actually make your own xylitol solution by dissolving a packet of xylitol (or spoonful) in some warm water.  Then use a clean washcloth to wash your baby&#x27;s gums with it.  It&#x27;s also a good idea to give your kids xylitol gum/mints or have them rinse with xylitol after eating.  Various studies have shown that in 5 weeks it can dramatically reduce the amount of the bacteria which causes cavities in their mouths.</li>
            <li> I was recommended these for my baby to help prevent tooth decay. I like the ease of use, but she hates them!  It&#x27;s a screaming fight every time I use them.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of this product. However, neither son can stand them. We tried several attempts over a few months at both the Apple and Grape flavors, room temp and frozen/refrigerated. Our baby did not want them in his mouth and remained fussy, and our toddler actually gags when he sees them now! We were able to get the baby&#x27;s gums clean with them, but it was a fight every time. Also leaves our hands messy. So for us, this product is a bust. If your child likes the flavors, though, I think it would be an excellent item to have on hand and be great for your baby/toddler.</li>
            <li> My son is 19 and I tried using both flavors of tooth wipes and he wouldn&#x27;t let me near him after the first time. I practically have to hold him down to wipe his teeth. He didn&#x27;t like the taste and the wipes are sticky.</li>
            <li> My 18 month old daughter fights me every time I brush her teeth. I thought these would be a good alternative. Unfortunately she has a full set of teeth and like to chomp on my fingers as I try and clean her teeth and her gums. She does love the grape flavor, however. This product is probably better for a younger baby or toddler with few teeth.</li>
            <li> My baby loves these. They&#x27;re easier to take around than a toothbrush. So easy to swipe my baby&#x27;s mouth out in the night after a feeding or after a meal. I&#x27;ve used these with all 3 of my kids and our dentists have all been very happy.</li>
            <li> Was really happy to find these but my son (10 months) will not use them.  They do not taste very good :(</li>
            <li> If your child is 2 or older I would pass on these. A good pre-test idea is get a paper towl wet it w/ childrens mouth wash and see if they will let you wipe they&#x27;re teeth. Not gonna happen. I am giving these to a coworker who has an infant cutting teeth since I can&#x27;t return them.</li>
            <li> This is great for cleaning the kids teeth when we are on the go.  We use all the time and are great.</li>
            <li> As much as I tried to be the model of a calm, serene and endlessly patient mama, my little cherub didn&#x27;t want to follow my lead on tooth brushing. So instead of opening wide, she would clamp her jaw shut, scream, kick and cry each time anyone tried to clean her teeth. Every night, without fail. The toothbrushing standoff of the century had no winners - she was mad, I felt bad, and her teeth weren&#x27;t getting terribly clean from my efforts besides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Spiffies, the xylitol-based tooth cleaning wipes in toddler-friendly flavors like grape and apple. Were they the answers to all our problems? Well, no. But they&#x27;re a definite improvement. First off, my daughter just likes having the choice - brush or wipe? - and I think that helps her feel a little more in control. I like that the wipes are easy to use - just wrap around your finger and rub - which I also think allows me to be a little more thorough with an uncooperative squirmer. It&#x27;s a faster cleaning process than brushing, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my daughter doesn&#x27;t really seem crazy about the wipes&#x27; flavor. At this point, about three weeks after introducing them, she opts for the toothbrush (&amp;#34;wif paste!&amp;#34;) about 30% of the time, which surprised me. The sticky, weird feeling other reviewers complain about is very real, but will wash away easily in the sink or even with a wet wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the portability of the individually wrapped wipes (e.g., for toting along to use after a birthday party&#x27;s sweet cake, or cookies at grandma&#x27;s house), but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be sold on buying more for at home use. Another reviewer talked about making her own wipes - reusable and cheaper - which is a smart idea. I&#x27;d like a bit more texture (like that of a washcloth) for everyday cleaning too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do recommend Spiffies if you&#x27;re at a tooth brushing impasse. They are a good alternative to tooth brushing (and may help get an infant used to the basic feeling of dental hygiene, with someoneelse&#x27;s fingers poking around).</li>
            <li> We bought these as a way to clean our son&#x27;s teeth because he initially did not like the feel of a toothbrush in his mouth.  He was a bit hesitant at first but very quickly enjoyed the flavor of the wipe and let us clean his teeth.  After a few uses he would get very excited about us wiping his teeth with these wipes and would ask for it several times a day.  This was a great way for him to get used to cleaning his teeth and now he has no issues brushing his teeth.  There are only two downsides to using these tooth wipes:&lt;br /&gt;1.  They leave a very sticky residue on your hand after use&lt;br /&gt;2.  Be very careful with your finger because our son wanted to eat the wipe and bit our finger a few times.</li>
            <li> These are a bit pricey, however I think that they are worth it, if you are concerned about cavities with your little ones. (We have a history of soft enamel in our family.) I know of a few toddlers with cavities, and it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;d rather not have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started buying these when my daughter was about 1, and she had about 6 or so teeth. Back then I would tear a spiffy in half to make the batch last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have a sticky feel to them and a weird aftertaste, but it&#x27;s no biggie.</li>
            <li> I have been brushing my toddler&#x27;s teeth daily and she still had yellow-ish stains.. She is 18 months and really doesn&#x27;t like me putting a brush in her mouth.. I brushed as much and in a way SHE would let me without bringing her to tears. That&#x27;s the last thing you want to do because then they wont let you brush at all. Well I ordered these wipes because she DOES let me rub my finger on her teeth.. so I figured the friction of the wipes would help - I tried using thin cotton but its too thick and its hard to keep it on the finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these wipes wrap around your finger PERFECTLY and stick to themselves pretty well. MUCH easier to keep them on your finger even when the little one tries sucking/chewing them right off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to finally do a more thorough cleanup and to my relief the stains went away.. they had not set in yet.. YAY!! The liquid that comes on the wipes is a bit of the sticky side when it dries so do have a baby wipe or damp towel nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the toothbrush, but more for getting her used to it until she is old enough to understand and do it herself.</li>
            <li> the wipes are a little bit sweet and sticky. My baby dislike apple flavor but like grape flavor. The price for this product is a little bit high.</li>
            <li> These taste great, easy to use, and kids love them. The only problem is the high price. Grape is my daughters favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> Not as useful or convenient as I was hoping. Had to wait for baby to fall asleep to apply.</li>
            <li> Frozen, these are my son&#x27;s teething savior!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately... These did not work. If your baby is like mine... She hates having anything forced.. She would move her head away, prevented me from cleaning with these wipes. It was a waste of money. I would not recommend this. Good idea but just doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Taste is awful I tried myself when the kids would not let me use them on them strange texture also.</li>
            <li> I am a mother of a 9 month old (that has 8 teeth), as well as a Registered Dental Hygienist. Dental caries is the most frequently occurring disease in preschool age children. I have seen countless 2 and 3 year olds with so many cavities, that they needed to be sedated to have their cavities filled. It is almost impossible to use a toothbrush on an infant&#x27;s teeth! With a wipe on my finger, I can actually feel the teeth that I am cleaning. I am not just blindly gagging her with a toothbrush that she bites down on. These wipes are a great way to introduce oral hygiene to an infant or for toddlers that are adverse to the toothbrush. OBVIOUSLY they need to be used by a parent--the wipe could be eaten by a toddler or would be a choking hazard it not controlled by an adult. The xylitol makes the wipes more effective than just using a wet wash cloth. Yes, that makes your fingers or baby&#x27;s face slightly sticky but it is easily cleaned away with water. We use a wipe after any meal or snack! My baby loves the taste of these wipes and she smiles and opens as soon as she sees the package.</li>
            <li> Omg I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews sayin how goid they were but they were great. My daughter didn&#x27;t like getting her teeth brushed for the longest time so it was always a fight! So I purchased these to use one time durin the day so I didn&#x27;t hsve a fight in my hands twice a day nd being a newborn after drinkin formula or milk these were great to wipe out her mouth. But as she was older the less fights was nice to! Not to mention she loved them.</li>
            <li> My son refuses to let me brush his teeth or get a toothbrush anywhere near his mouth. Somehow though I can get the wipes in and wipe around. Im sure I could use a towel also, but this is much easier, he doesnt fight as much. I think he likes the grape flavoring. Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> I am very happy I purchased these. They make teeth cleaning a breeze. I started using them with my sons first teeth and still use them now that he is 14 months. I assume they taste great since my son smiles when he sees the paper and opens up. They leave his mouth smelling fresh and I can only assume they are getting his teeth clean since I have no way of measuring. The dentist did say they are perfect until we start using the toothbrush. I guess a cheaper alternative is using a wet wash rag but spiffies have flavor and since they are much thinner than a rag it is easier to clean his entire mouth.</li>
            <li> My daughter hated brushing her teeth simply because she hated the taste of the toothpaste.  This was recommended by her dentist in an email and it made all the difference in the world.  She loves them!  I can use these on here teeth and then afterwards use a fluoride mouthwash with a toothbrush to help keep her teeth even cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with small children</li>
            <li> she seems to really like these but they should tell you to buy a finger protector as the kids like to chow down on your finger!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these spiffies. She has had a problem with her teeth since she was nine months&lt;br /&gt;and cleaning them was so hard at that age. They have truly helped out.</li>
