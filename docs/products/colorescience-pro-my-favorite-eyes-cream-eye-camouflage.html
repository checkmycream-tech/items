            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is warm honey</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they made a medium shade.</li>
            <li>Really does a great job to make the eyes look brighter!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply too!</li>

            <li>and it was way too light for me.</li>
            <li>Way to light.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is too light (and I have light skin).  </li>
            <li>I just add bronzing powder lightly over face after I apply..</li>
            <li>Any clean make up brush can be used to apply.</li>

            <li>and you must really take your time to blend it</li>

            <li>Adding the Queen Bee powder made my grand total around $61, which exceeds the retail price of the Colorscience applicator, but gives me at several times as much sunscreen product to apply.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this product for its convenient application and use as sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use sun protective clothing because I&#x27;ve never found a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t break my skin out terribly. All chemical sunscreens have an odor that gives me headaches. Even creams with minerals as the active ingredients are too heavy for my sensitive (yet primarily oily) skin. I have to be careful about shampoo, even, because my skin breaks out along the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d tried mineral makeup before (Bare Escentuals and a small, locally made brand) but found something in them irritating. I now suspect bismuth oxy(?chloride?) but I&#x27;m not sure what the ingredient was that made me itch. (An Amazon listing for Colorscience Sunforgettable lists bismuth oxychloride for the product, but the brand website does not, so I can&#x27;t give a definitive answer for whether that ingredient is in these products at this time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added an exfoliation step ([[ASIN:B00KOAMZCW Paula&#x27;s Choice Resist Daily Pore-Refining Treatment 2% BHA - 3 oz]]) to my skin care over the past six months or so, and, while I love what it is doing for my skin, I&#x27;m concerned that winter is over and my exfoliated facial skin needs more protection from the sun as UV levels increase into the summer. I&#x27;m trying two brands of powder mineral sunscreens in hope I will finally have a workable solution to regular sun protection that doesn&#x27;t lead to pimples or painful allergic bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is hands down the easiest thing to apply. Untwist the cap, pull out the brush, rub on the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this like eye shadow, and the color looks fine that way with no other makeup. My normal day face is washed, toned &amp; exfoliated. I use lip balm, but usually that isn&#x27;t even tinted. When I say NO MAKE UP, I mean zero cosmetics on top of my facial skin. I could wear this all alone in an eye shadow position and I wouldn&#x27;t look weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushed over the underye area, too, I felt the need to apply the other mineral sunscreen on top to even out the coverage. I bought a refill of the Colorscience brush on sun screen [[ASIN:B00819QMXQ Colorescience Pro Sunforgettable SPF 50 Brush Refill-Tan]] and a less expensive, un-tinted formula [[ASIN:B00BZ8QFMI Bee Sunny Sport SPF 35 Mineral Powder Sunscreen Zinc Oxide &amp; Titanium Big Jar from Queen Bee]] to mix my own lighter shade and fill several small shakers to keep in every car and bathroom at home. After applying this home-mixed mineral sunscreen on top, I didn&#x27;t look particularly made up and I didn&#x27;t find the Eye Camoflage product noticeable anymore. Outdoors on a walk with my husband, he claimed my face looked \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having just started with these products, it&#x27;s a little early to tell if I will react badly, but my face isn&#x27;t itchy at the end of the day as it was with Bare Escentuals makeup. I&#x27;ll update this review if irritation develops after a couple of weeks&#x27; trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these pots ([[ASIN:B00K8B87CY Coastal Scents 10 Gram Round Sifter Jar (25 Pack)]]) and these brushes ([[ASIN:B00GMDIKV0 Change Makeup Tools Foundation Brush Bamboo Handle Brush]]) for storing and applying my homemade mineral sunscreen mix. This combination gave me three full sets of brush-on sun screen for less than one applicator tube of the Sunforgettable product by Colorscience at its normal price.

            <li> Just a tad too white, but great coverage. I do need to use an eye cream with it as it is a little drying.</li>
            <li> works great as a base for dark circles under eyes.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and come across skin care products all the time and 10 to be a little under well made by most of them.  a fellow at the esthetician recommended this to me for dark circles and it has been a real help you only need a very small amount and you must really take your time to blend it well but it is a great brightener-! sometimes I will wear it by itself but often i layer a little foundation on top to blend the color in well.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it.  My skin tone is warm honey and it was way too light for me. This product is better for fair to light skin tone customers.</li>
            <li> Color and coverage for under-eye area is excellent. I have sensitive skin and have no problems with this product. Leaves skin surface slightly moist - good base for foundation. I top with mineral powder foundation to finish.</li>
            <li> It might be my skin shade. It seemed grayish on m application. Texture is abosolutely great not shiny, not dry, does not make wrinkles deeper, does not sit on wrinkles. You might want to tray if you have  a&amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; skin shade.</li>
            <li> Feels good on face, it&#x27;s the color that&#x27;s the problem.  Way to light. No other choice for colors though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Lasts forever. Just takes a pea size amount for both eyes. I use this after I put on my mineral powder and blush. I just wish it had spf! Would make it even more awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is too light (and I have light skin).  Would be nice if they made a medium shade.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the colorescience pro eye brighter. I love them together. I usually wear NARS under eye cream. I like this just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> Product reduced the dark circles under my eyes and brightened my eyes. I would recommend it. It is easy to apply too!</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding an under eye concealer that doesnt settle in the creases under my eyes.  I&#x27;m 39 and have plenty of wrinkles under my eyes due to sun damage.  I also have really bad under eye circles and this is the only thing that covers them.  I have tried plenty of eye creams from Bobby Brown and Mac to Cover Girl and many many more.  This is the only one I use that works.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes to cover dark circles but did not work for me. Goes on very wet and settles into lines. Yellowish shade works to cancel dark circles but lightens up too much and looks unnatural. Wears poorly after hours on and reveals fine lines. Will probably work with a makeup powder and setting powder on top but was not worth my trouble.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job to make the eyes look brighter!</li>
            <li> I like the camouflage, but I have to apply my foundation over it so it will blend; otherwise, I would have light grayish yellow circles.  Also, I like I only need to use a very very small amount!</li>
            <li> Just like all the other colorscience products I&#x27;ve purchased this is better than expected.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this.</li>
            <li> I normally use a powder concealer but lately my skin has been dry so the powder started looking cakey.  I saw this product when ordering the skin bronzer from the same company.  I love it!  It goes on evenly and you only use a tiny bit on under eye circles and red spots.  It does the job well and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love colorscience products.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit is all you need.. Works great.. Very light in color, and I think it needs to be.. I just add bronzing powder lightly over face after I apply.. One of the very few products that can cover my dark circles..</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Awakens your whole face. Start at the inter corners of your eyes with a dot. Put it over the dark circles under you eyes and then pat it all onto your skin blending it in.</li>
