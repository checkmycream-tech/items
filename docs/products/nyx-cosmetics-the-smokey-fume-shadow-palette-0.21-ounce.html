            <li>Love my eye-shadow, it has really good pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Nice product nice color mix.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still nice</li>
            <li>5.Neutral warm tan, closer to a frost</li>
            <li>A great pallet for going out to do a quick smokey eye or bring along to use to make transform day to night.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product nice very sexy for the eye and for the price</li>
            <li>They are so pretty.. and look great.  </li>
            <li>I find that using my brushes is more suitable for achieving that smoked out look (MAC 217).</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this palette.</li>
            <li>I love the brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love NYX products anyway</li>
            <li>In love</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I am a huge NYX fan and I own mostly lip glosses, lip butters and lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I suppose you can use this with an angled brush as an eyeliner and it would show off the sparkles a bit more since it is patted on as opposed to being swiped on.    </li>
            <li>In the photograph, it looks a lot brighter and more violet than it does in person.</li>
            <li>And I also think this warm color is so important when creating a smokey eye with dimension and interest.</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>The palette is okay.</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I had hoped for but it&#x27;s build able.</li>
            <li>Overall it was an excellent use of  colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to order more!!!  </li>
            <li>Rich colors that go on smoothly at a nice price.</li>
            <li>this palette was so nice and fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>Also they aren&#x27;t all that easy to blend</li>
            <li>Kind of disheartening since it is so pretty in the palette.</li>
            <li>It might be fine for someone else.</li>
            <li>Had been looking for a shadow palette like this everywhere- colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the greys and charcoal colors of the shadows they compliment.</li>
            <li>This one would be great in the inner corners of your eyes to brighten things up.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this palette to anyone who wants a beautiful smokey eye on the budget!</li>
            <li>Eyeshadows are perfect but there also was a crack on the glass, so it couldn&#x27;t be open normally.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re working just on your lid, you should be just fine, but if you want to achieve a true smokey effect with a fade, I would consider using a brush.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this smokey set.</li>
            <li>Wow... I love these colors!  </li>
            <li>, started applying right away!  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a true frost because it lacks pearlescence.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t call this a true frost.</li>
            <li>Thank order came quickly</li>
            <li>In High School, She Loves The Colors!!!</li>
            <li>I like this color a lot although I find that the sparkly bits come right off even with a primer.</li>
            <li>but with some patience and the right brushes it gets</li>
            <li>The palette is exactly as the picture.</li>
            <li>my first time buying NYX, i bought a lip cream too.</li>
            <li>Looks brighter and more blue in the photograph.</li>
            <li>I like the navy blue, which looks more like charcoal on my brown eyes.</li>
            <li>I also expected the sparkly black one to be more sparkly, but there aren&#x27;t many sparkles in it, it&#x27;s more just greyish.</li>
            <li>though even if it isn&#x27;t very pigmented, probably the most important in this palette because it works great as a base color.</li>
            <li>The color selection is great, it&#x27;s not just a black smokey eye, you can also do purple or blue.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cost much, so I just threw it away.</li>
            <li>I really like it, just not when I&#x27;m smoking out a color.    </li>
            <li>and it seems very out of place.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for my new item to my collection!</li>
            <li>The colors are a lot more dark</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, but something in the formula disagreed with my sensitive skin and irritated my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I will ordering more of the other color kits!  </li>
            <li>I love that it also has the blending shade, highlight, and a glitter black.</li>
            <li>I would also highly all of the these colors</li>
            <li>, it shows up nicely, and isn&#x27;t translucent like some other white shadows.</li>
            <li>A gorgeous white, light brown, blue, purple, matte black, and a sparkling grey.</li>
            <li>I needed a new smoky eye compact &amp; gave this one a try.</li>
            <li>I really wish this palette had come with a soft brush along with the sponge applicator, which accumulates too much product and doesn&#x27;t allow you to build in intensity or fade a color properly.</li>
            <li>A little cheap, but it is acceptable color and coverage</li>
            <li>Colors seem to look very similar but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.     </li>
            <li>Very deep, vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>colors just did nothing - even when applied wet - still very blah ......</li>
            <li>Does go on pretty dark though.    </li>
            <li>I might give a worse review if I was better with makeup in general-</li>
            <li>This item is quite good quality, bul it was broken when I recieved it and white color was completly missing.</li>
            <li>has a very sparkly black shade (on the far left, not just gray), a matte black, dark blue and purple to mix it up and a  matte light brown for blending the edges and a matte white for an inner eye and brow bone highlight.</li>

            <li> I might give a worse review if I was better with makeup in general-</li>
            <li> This item is quite good quality, bul it was broken when I recieved it and white color was completly missing.</li>
            <li> has a very sparkly black shade (on the far left, not just gray), a matte black, dark blue and purple to mix it up and a  matte light brown for blending the edges and a matte white for an inner eye and brow bone highlight.</li>
            <li> The true color is a deep plum/dark gray, with not very impressive color saturation.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t create a smokey eye without a hint of warmth because it ends up looking flat and soulless.</li>
            <li> The colors are rich &amp; the compact is small enough for my everyday make up bag in my purse.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot except that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I like.</li>
            <li> Somehow no matter what eyeshadow I use and how light I try and be with it it turns into a big black uneven mess.</li>
            <li> then I thought they were going to be, but they do stay on for as long as you need.</li>
            <li> This set also comes with a long, two-ended, sponge-tipped applicator wand.</li>
            <li> Deep carbon gray, almost black without the sparkles.</li>
            <li> A little too white</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and package came wrapped so none of the colors would be broken.</li>
            <li> not very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Matte, which I prefer for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Lots of crumbling with fall-down of eyeshadow onto face with quite a bit of creasing after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, nothing  was broken upon arrival and well packaged.</li>
            <li> 1.Deep carbon gray, satin texture, almost black with shimmer and very small sparkly flecks.   </li>
            <li> Not entirely in love with this one.</li>
            <li> 4.Deep, dirty, royal blue.</li>
            <li> Ends up looking like a dirty dark gray with a hint of plum, which I like.</li>
            <li> so not happy with this palette</li>
            <li> Sad because of that</li>
            <li> Saturation not impressive.    </li>
            <li> I have become obsessed with.</li>

            <li> A beautiful collection, with colors that match anything, Too Faced or Urban Decay put out!  The only difference this is a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> This item is quite good quality, bul it was broken when I recieved it and white color was completly missing.</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I ordered my product on December 9 and got it on the 13! Fast shipping, and package came wrapped so none of the colors would be broken. I love the colors in this palette. A gorgeous white, light brown, blue, purple, matte black, and a sparkling grey. I did swatches of all the colors and they&#x27;re beautiful. I definitely recommend this palette to anyone who wants a beautiful smokey eye on the budget! Thank you so much for my new item to my collection!</li>
            <li> Love my eye-shadow, it has really good pigmentation. A little goes a long way, nothing  was broken upon arrival and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a shadow palette like this everywhere- colors are fantastic. Matte, which I prefer for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Very good cosmetic. Makeup excellent, durable and has nice range of colors. I recommend it to everyone. I love the brand</li>
            <li> This Was Actually Purchased As A Gift, However When It Was Received.. They Loved It!!! It Was Purchased For A Senior In High School, She Loves The Colors!!!</li>
            <li> Love this palette! The color selection is great, it&#x27;s not just a black smokey eye, you can also do purple or blue. I love that it also has the blending shade, highlight, and a glitter black. The shadows don&#x27;t have the best pigmentation, but they are amazing for the price. I use this a lot, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> colors just did nothing - even when applied wet - still very blah ...... so not happy with this palette - don&#x27;t know if it was the colors or the brand but will not purchase again</li>
            <li> Nice product nice color mix.</li>
            <li> Lots of crumbling with fall-down of eyeshadow onto face with quite a bit of creasing after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> NYX is a great brand, and their products are always great (: this palette was so nice and fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. The colors are a lot more dark then I thought they were going to be, but they do stay on for as long as you need. I also expected the sparkly black one to be more sparkly, but there aren&#x27;t many sparkles in it, it&#x27;s more just greyish. I do like the white one though, it shows up nicely, and isn&#x27;t translucent like some other white shadows.</li>
            <li> Wow... I love these colors!  They are so pretty.. and look great.  I&#x27;m back to order more!!!  So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows are perfect but there also was a crack on the glass, so it couldn&#x27;t be open normally. Sad because of that</li>
            <li> The palette is exactly as the picture. The pigments are excellent. I&#x27;ts my first time buying NYX, i bought a lip cream too. Both products are recommended.</li>
            <li> I wish it had browns but it&#x27;s still nice</li>
            <li> I like this palette! It&#x27;s pigmented and nice! I love NYX products anyway and this one is no difference! In love</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the greys and charcoal colors of the shadows they compliment. My eyes I would also highly all of the these colors</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but something in the formula disagreed with my sensitive skin and irritated my eyes.  It didn&#x27;t cost much, so I just threw it away. It might be fine for someone else.</li>
            <li> Just received my Smokey Eyes kit from NYC and I love it, started applying right away!  Colors go on smoothy w/o caking and they blend wonderfully, I simply love the effect!  I will ordering more of the other color kits!  I love them!</li>
            <li> I needed a new smoky eye compact &amp; gave this one a try. I like it a lot except that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I like. The colors are rich &amp; the compact is small enough for my everyday make up bag in my purse.</li>
            <li> not very pigmented.  on my lids it fades to nothing in about 4 hours.  won&#x27;t repurchase</li>
            <li> The product is really good. It was exactly what I expected. Presents a lot of quality. I am very pleased with this acquisition.</li>
            <li> I am a huge NYX fan and I own mostly lip glosses, lip butters and lipsticks. But I decided to give the eyeshadows a try. I was really excited about this smokey set. I was hesitant to purchase it online because I wanted to see it in person. I purchased this at Target and I&#x27;ve been using it for a while with Too Faced Shadow Insurance. This set also comes with a long, two-ended, sponge-tipped applicator wand. I don&#x27;t use it though. I find that using my brushes is more suitable for achieving that smoked out look (MAC 217). I really wish this palette had come with a soft brush along with the sponge applicator, which accumulates too much product and doesn&#x27;t allow you to build in intensity or fade a color properly. If you&#x27;re working just on your lid, you should be just fine, but if you want to achieve a true smokey effect with a fade, I would consider using a brush. I do want to mention though, this sponge applicator is unlike any I have worked with. I really like it, just not when I&#x27;m smoking out a color.    I&#x27;ll try to describe the colors here in the order that they appear in the palette.    1.Deep carbon gray, satin texture, almost black with shimmer and very small sparkly flecks.   I like this color a lot although I find that the sparkly bits come right off even with a primer. Kind of disheartening since it is so pretty in the palette.I suppose you can use this with an angled brush as an eyeliner and it would show off the sparkles a bit more since it is patted on as opposed to being swiped on.    2. Deep carbon gray, almost black without the sparkles. Satin texture. Same color as 1 if you ask me. Great pigmentation.    3. Deep plum, satin texture. In the photograph, it looks a lot brighter and more violet than it does in person. The true color is a deep plum/dark gray, with not very impressive color saturation. Ends up looking like a dirty dark gray with a hint of plum, which I like. Does go on pretty dark though.    4.Deep, dirty, royal blue. Satin texture. Looks brighter and more blue in the photograph. Saturation not impressive.    5.Neutral warm tan, closer to a frost but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a true frost because it lacks pearlescence. Very nice color though even if it isn&#x27;t very pigmented, probably the most important in this palette because it works great as a base color. I use this one all the way up to my brow bone. And I also think this warm color is so important when creating a smokey eye with dimension and interest. Personally, I don&#x27;t create a smokey eye without a hint of warmth because it ends up looking flat and soulless. Just a touch of warmth makes all the difference in the world.    6.Pearl white, closer to a frost but I wouldn&#x27;t call this a true frost. Not entirely in love with this one. A little too white and it seems very out of place. I would not use this as a brow bone highlighter. Number 5 would work great though. This one would be great in the inner corners of your eyes to brighten things up. :)    Overall, I like this palette. Colors seem to look very similar but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.     Background info:  I&#x27;m brunette. fair olive skin with warm undertones. MAC NC20-NW20    Hope this helped!!</li>
            <li> The palette is okay. The colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I had hoped for but it&#x27;s build able. Also they aren&#x27;t all that easy to blend but with some patience and the right brushes it gets the job done</li>
            <li> Great makeup for the price.  Use is every day.  Good smokey colors.</li>
            <li> I like the colors but I never understood why the applicator are junk.</li>
            <li> The color popped, use with a primer to make then even brighter and it&#x27;ll last you all day. Overall it was an excellent use of  colors.</li>
            <li> I might give a worse review if I was better with makeup in general- Somehow no matter what eyeshadow I use and how light I try and be with it it turns into a big black uneven mess.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product nice very sexy for the eye and for the price not bad NYX, I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> Rich colors that go on smoothly at a nice price. I like the navy blue, which looks more like charcoal on my brown eyes. Looks great with the NYX mascara I have become obsessed with.</li>
            <li> Very deep, vibrant colors.  They stayed on, until I washed them off.  Very nice.</li>
