    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>This stuff if awesome!  </li>
            <li>However, this one is also tasting very good.</li>
            <li>He can eat his beloved spicy food now!</li>
            <li>Switched to Sensodyne and all is good!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have an experienced opinion, however, this is what I noted so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My tooth and gum sensitivities have lessened greatly and I think it&#x27;s an absolutely wonderful product :)</li>
            <li>Nice change!</li>
            <li>product has a pleasant, minty flavor.</li>
            <li>Pleasant minty taste with gel consistency..</li>
            <li>This had some good reviews, I know it is not strictly labeled for that issue</li>
            <li>so I thought this was a good choice.  </li>
            <li>The product tastes and smells good.  </li>
            <li>Tastes really good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results - healthier gums.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to avoid toxins in toothpaste but don&#x27;t want to make your own, this is a good options.</li>
            <li>Refreshing taste!</li>
            <li>The flavor is great, I don&#x27;t like toothpastes that have too strong a flavor.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>The tube is nice, it&#x27;s not the plastic squishy type.</li>
            <li>No safety seal of any kind.</li>
            <li>Being natural (which I am very happy about)</li>
            <li>This is the best I have used so far...</li>
            <li>The Weleda Plant Gel Toothpaste is okay</li>
            <li>but I like the Salt Toothpaste better.  </li>
            <li>For someone who hates a salty taste, the Plant Gel is a better choice.  </li>
            <li>but I will surely repurchase the Salt toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love the minty taste of this...</li>
            <li>I tried the salt flavor too, and like this better.</li>
            <li>My kids love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love everything they make.</li>
            <li>Well I love Weleda, being from Germany</li>
            <li>even my 7 and 2 year olds love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste for more than a year.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li>I get the feeling that if I were to swallow it, that it would be absolutely safe to do so.</li>
            <li>It tastes great, and I have had great dental checkups and it doesn&#x27;t make me gag like other toothpastes do.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>I really love this toothpaste it gentle on the teeth and good flavor.</li>
            <li>Excellent fluoride and other junk-free toothpaste, kids love it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gentle toothpaste to help with sensitivity and take good care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but I don&#x27;t seem to need as much of the product to get the suds for a good cleaning as compared to my Tom&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural, and has a good taste.</li>
            <li>It may not be as strong</li>
            <li>Not overly strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>That being said I love this toothpaste, it doesn&#x27;t foam, and leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying that it is, but that I can taste that it is free of junk - which is one reason why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>OK, I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is mild in flavor and does suds up easily.</li>
            <li>I was familiar with this brand and one of their skincare products</li>
            <li>I am still getting used to the no foam feel, I often wash them twice because I just do not feel clean or rather my teeth do not.</li>
            <li>Did not like this one, my teeth did not feel clean.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a good product that leaves your teeth feeling clean</li>
            <li>It was mild on my teeth and seemed to get them squeaky clean, literally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets 4 stars since the taste really could be a bit better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not spicy or sweet and they didn&#x27;t complain when I made the switch from the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand we used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much more gentle than drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>The taste is decent (better than baking soda types but not as good as regular mint gel toothpaste).</li>
            <li>It was my own fault, I should have read the ingredients more carefully.  </li>
            <li>tube is metal which is great and even though this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, I am finding it lasts longer since you don&#x27;t seem to need to use as much as with other pastes (like T of Maine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste with a lot less chemicals, but you have to like the taste of salt.</li>
            <li>I also researched natural dental care in general and see great reviews here.  </li>
            <li>So very Veggie!! ...</li>
            <li>My teeth never felt fresh.</li>
            <li>I had to brush much longer with this one to make my mouth feel as clean as I like.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild flavor and refreshing, I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>Very gentle  and efficient.</li>
            <li>This last time, the reaction was the most severe.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The gel looks kind of dark</li>
            <li>As he started using this, he says that it&#x27;s really gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip the gums of its outer layers &amp; protects them.</li>
            <li>(really something between a gel and a paste).  </li>
            <li>Also has a very chalky feel that lingers after rinsing.</li>
            <li>It also has a rather unusual color, kinda red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t really know what did the trick</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I think there should be more in there due to me washing once or twice</li>
            <li>The packaging was a bit damaged but that is more Amazon than Weleda&#x27;s fault as they packed it in with two other products.</li>
            <li>only gave it a 3 because we have not had long term use, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>This product seemed very gentle, and natural.</li>
            <li>I brush at night with a more conventional product, and I use this as my after-breakfast brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer this healthy alternative to conventional toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Main reason why I bought</li>
            <li>and I actually like it more than regular toothpaste now.</li>
            <li>Inside my mouth became very sensitive , gum and all.</li>
            <li>Mother has cancer and want her to use a natural product that would refresh and add moisture to her mouth because of chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li>Completely natural-</li>
            <li>Not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>It tastes like the natural ingredients of which it is composed.  </li>
            <li>The label pictured is the old formulation.</li>
            <li>It looks like this is a natural healthier toothpaste, which I wanted.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I developed mouth sores after using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but I can say that it is fresh, uplifting, without being bitter, sour, spicy, or overwhelming in any other way.</li>
            <li>Possibly an allergic reaction since I developed nasal symptoms and a sore throat.  </li>
            <li>and if I was not careful to not  breathe some fume it will irritate my breathing pipe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sick of using strong chemicals to clean my mouth.</li>
            <li>It is a little weird at first how it doesn&#x27;t foam up like most toothpastes do</li>

            <li> It is a little weird at first how it doesn&#x27;t foam up like most toothpastes do</li>
            <li> my dad has sensitive gums due to long-term diabetes.</li>
            <li> I chose this after reading a bit on natural tooth pastes and having used Weleda&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> and it will not last as long as others.</li>
            <li> but I wanted a toothpaste that helped a little with my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, I just prefer the Weleda Salt Toothpaste and the fresh, clean taste that it leaves in my mouth, so I will not repurchase the Plant Gel</li>
            <li> Kinda strange.</li>
            <li> it was due to the Silica content (as silica helps with collagen and tooth quality - our teeth are not mineralized properly) so on this I want to see a long term improvement.  </li>
            <li> three star is really only due to the steep price.</li>
            <li> I used it only a few times and always had the sensitivity increase.  </li>
            <li> I like switching out toothpastes now and then, so was curious to try this type of tooth cleaning gel.</li>
            <li> MSG is a common ingredient apparently?!</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t eat anything spicy when using any other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Also, I like that it does not create foam in your mouth like other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as conventional toothpaste, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Weleda is one of the few brands that can be trusted; high-quality products without the hype.  </li>
            <li> My teeth started turning yellow(er) a few days after I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually applied it to my toothbrush 2 or 3 times during each brushing.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea, until recently, how much scary stuff is in toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe taste</li>
            <li> My friends all call me &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; for using it, but I figure if you&#x27;re putting it in your mouth at least twice a day you should know what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this toothpaste did not work at all for me and caused me extreme pain and burning in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This is a little weird because I was used to the foaming type that gave me the feeling that my teeth were truly being scrubbed.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m a bit bored with the usual &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Too expensive for small tube.  </li>
            <li> The thing I noticed was there seemed to be a residue left on the base of my bristles of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just not great, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-CTK</li>
            <li> Has a weird taste till you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I started to develop gingivitis about a month after using it.  </li>
            <li> This tooth gel is not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that this product has aluminum (magnesium aluminum silicate) in it.  </li>

            <li> Great toothpaste with a lot less chemicals, but you have to like the taste of salt.</li>
            <li> The Weleda Plant Gel Toothpaste is okay but I like the Salt Toothpaste better.  The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) which is very important to me.  And, obviously, it doesn&#x27;t lather because it has no SLS.  For someone who hates a salty taste, the Plant Gel is a better choice.  I had to brush much longer with this one to make my mouth feel as clean as I like.  I usually applied it to my toothbrush 2 or 3 times during each brushing.  I don&#x27;t hate it, I just prefer the Weleda Salt Toothpaste and the fresh, clean taste that it leaves in my mouth, so I will not repurchase the Plant Gel but I will surely repurchase the Salt toothpaste. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Mother has cancer and want her to use a natural product that would refresh and add moisture to her mouth because of chemotherapy.  No alcohol in product.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> my dad has sensitive gums due to long-term diabetes. He can&#x27;t eat anything spicy when using any other toothpastes. As he started using this, he says that it&#x27;s really gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip the gums of its outer layers &amp; protects them. He can eat his beloved spicy food now!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Completely natural- no carrageenan!  Not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that this product has aluminum (magnesium aluminum silicate) in it.  It was my own fault, I should have read the ingredients more carefully.  I&#x27;ve never before found a Weleda product that I would not use.</li>
            <li> Did not get rid of plaque at all.</li>
            <li> I love the minty taste of this...teeth feel terrific after brushing! I tried the salt flavor too, and like this better.</li>
            <li> My kids love this toothpaste. I love that it&#x27;s natural, and has a good taste.</li>
            <li> I had no idea, until recently, how much scary stuff is in toothpaste. MSG is a common ingredient apparently?! I chose this after reading a bit on natural tooth pastes and having used Weleda&#x27;s other products. It&#x27;s a mild flavor and refreshing, I will definitely order again. My friends all call me &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; for using it, but I figure if you&#x27;re putting it in your mouth at least twice a day you should know what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> This tooth gel is not too bad. It was mild on my teeth and seemed to get them squeaky clean, literally. It&#x27;s in a metal tube. The thing I noticed was there seemed to be a residue left on the base of my bristles of my toothbrush. Possibly because it doesn&#x27;t seem to lather when you brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by reddish color of the gel (really something between a gel and a paste).  It tastes like the natural ingredients of which it is composed.  Weleda is one of the few brands that can be trusted; high-quality products without the hype.  I love everything they make.</li>
            <li> Well I love Weleda, being from Germany and I know their prices are steep but I wanted a toothpaste that helped a little with my sensitive teeth. This had some good reviews, I know it is not strictly labeled for that issue but I wanted to try it. I am still getting used to the no foam feel, I often wash them twice because I just do not feel clean or rather my teeth do not. I like the taste. I think there should be more in there due to me washing once or twice and it will not last as long as others. My sensitivity is still there. It may not be as strong I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three star is really only due to the steep price. The packaging was a bit damaged but that is more Amazon than Weleda&#x27;s fault as they packed it in with two other products. The tube is nice, it&#x27;s not the plastic squishy type. If you have to have bubbles, suds and/or foam in your mouth this is not for you. Being natural (which I am very happy about) it just does not do that.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have used so far...even my 7 and 2 year olds love it. My tooth and gum sensitivities have lessened greatly and I think it&#x27;s an absolutely wonderful product :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentle toothpaste to help with sensitivity and take good care of my teeth.  I was familiar with this brand and one of their skincare products so I thought this was a good choice.  I also researched natural dental care in general and see great reviews here.  Unfortunately, this toothpaste did not work at all for me and caused me extreme pain and burning in my mouth.  Possibly an allergic reaction since I developed nasal symptoms and a sore throat.  I used it only a few times and always had the sensitivity increase.  This last time, the reaction was the most severe.  I have tossed this product out.</li>
            <li> Pricing is a bit higher than your usual paste, I switched over to this since Colgate bought Tom&#x27;s. That being said I love this toothpaste, it doesn&#x27;t foam, and leaves your mouth fresh. If you care about what you put in your mouth, then get this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for more than a year. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results - healthier gums. My dentist agrees. Also, I like that it does not create foam in your mouth like other toothpastes. I can keep on using this after I got veneer for my front teeth since it&#x27;s not abrasive.</li>
            <li> Contains magnesium aluminum silicate!!! The label pictured is the old formulation. Also has a very chalky feel that lingers after rinsing. No safety seal of any kind. Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Has a weird taste till you get used to it. Kinda strange.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothpaste because I wanted something without all the detergents and flouride.  Unfortunately, I started to develop gingivitis about a month after using it.  When I returned to regular toothpaste, the gingivitis went away.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> OK, I really wanted to love this product. I&#x27;m sick of using strong chemicals to clean my mouth. I guess I&#x27;m a bit bored with the usual &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; alternatives (Tom&#x27;s, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a pleasant, minty flavor. Not overly strong. It also has a rather unusual color, kinda red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No flouride, no foaming detergents. I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s not harmful to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, I&#x27;m not convinced that it actually works. My teeth started turning yellow(er) a few days after I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I brush at night with a more conventional product, and I use this as my after-breakfast brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars. Not bad. Just not great, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-CTK</li>
            <li> Nice change! This toothpaste is mild in flavor and does suds up easily. I like switching out toothpastes now and then, so was curious to try this type of tooth cleaning gel. It is a bit pricey, but I don&#x27;t seem to need as much of the product to get the suds for a good cleaning as compared to my Tom&#x27;s toothpaste. It is a product I will keep in my rotation for dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Excellent fluoride and other junk-free toothpaste, kids love it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is exactly what I was looking for. Very gentle  and efficient. Inside my mouth became very sensitive , gum and all. Any toothpaste on the US market, even the so call &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; will irritate my gums, throat, tongue and if I was not careful to not  breathe some fume it will irritate my breathing pipe. Thank Weleda!</li>
            <li> The product tastes and smells good.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as conventional toothpaste, but it does the job.  I prefer this healthy alternative to conventional toothpaste.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> keeps my gums from getting sore</li>
            <li> It tastes great, and I have had great dental checkups and it doesn&#x27;t make me gag like other toothpastes do.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to avoid toxins in toothpaste but don&#x27;t want to make your own, this is a good options. It doesn&#x27;t foam up like regular toothpaste which takes a bit of getting used to. The taste is decent (better than baking soda types but not as good as regular mint gel toothpaste). The gel looks kind of dark pinkish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is metal which is great and even though this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, I am finding it lasts longer since you don&#x27;t seem to need to use as much as with other pastes (like T of Maine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets 4 stars since the taste really could be a bit better but overall it&#x27;s a good product that leaves your teeth feeling clean and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It looks like this is a natural healthier toothpaste, which I wanted. However, this one is also tasting very good. It is hard to describe taste but I can say that it is fresh, uplifting, without being bitter, sour, spicy, or overwhelming in any other way. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out... I just started using it so I don&#x27;t have an experienced opinion, however, this is what I noted so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My kids like it.  It&#x27;s not spicy or sweet and they didn&#x27;t complain when I made the switch from the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand we used before.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t foam.  This is a little weird because I was used to the foaming type that gave me the feeling that my teeth were truly being scrubbed.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It feels &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.  The ingredients do.  I get the feeling that if I were to swallow it, that it would be absolutely safe to do so. I&#x27;m not saying that it is, but that I can taste that it is free of junk - which is one reason why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Main reason why I bought it was due to the Silica content (as silica helps with collagen and tooth quality - our teeth are not mineralized properly) so on this I want to see a long term improvement.  We are also taking silica so I won&#x27;t really know what did the trick but it helps my mind that I&#x27;m helping from the outside and inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it a 3 because we have not had long term use, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste after my traditional toothpaste began making my mouth peel. This product seemed very gentle, and natural. Unfortunately I developed mouth sores after using this toothpaste. Switched to Sensodyne and all is good!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for small tube.  My teeth never felt fresh.</li>
            <li> I really love this toothpaste it gentle on the teeth and good flavor.</li>
            <li> ...So very Veggie!! ...No Sodium Laurel Sulfate or cheater&#x27;s ingredients like Tom&#x27;s.. Pleasant minty taste with gel consistency.. No guilt in this product..</li>
            <li> This stuff if awesome!  It is much more gentle than drugstore brands.  It leaves my mouth feeling clean without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> The flavor is great, I don&#x27;t like toothpastes that have too strong a flavor. It is a little weird at first how it doesn&#x27;t foam up like most toothpastes do but once you get used to it you won&#x27;t miss it at all.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmmm my gums aren&#x27;t being destroyed and I don&#x27;t have chemicals in my mouth. Tastes really good and I actually like it more than regular toothpaste now.</li>
            <li> Great tasting toothpaste. Refreshing taste!</li>
            <li> Did not like this one, my teeth did not feel clean. I&#x27;m now using Redmond Clay toothpaste.</li>
