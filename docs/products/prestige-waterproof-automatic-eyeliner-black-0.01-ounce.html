            <li>because of the great reviews and loved them.</li>

            <li>Faced Perfect Eyes Waterproof Eyeliner, Perfect Black, 0.04 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>This is by far the best pencil eye liner I&#x27;ve tried in the 15</li>
            <li>I actually have use eye makeup remover on the Prestige eye pencile at the end of the day because it is still perfect after 10 hours!  </li>
            <li>I think it glides better than the Revlon Colorstay</li>
            <li>but I just have to make sure I remove makeup before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think these and the Revlon Colorstay have slightly better staying power and that is their appeal</li>
            <li>I think the Too Faced works better for smudging applications and maybe Revlon and Prestige work better when you want a starker line that stays put.ade</li>
            <li>I think the Too Faced works better for smudging applications and maybe Revlon and Prestige work better when you want a starker line that stays put.</li>
            <li>This is the second time that I have ordered these and they are the best eyeliners I have used.</li>
            <li>I needed to keep checking my eyes to make sure the liner was&#x27;nt running on my lower lid</li>
            <li>Retractable, waterproof (I literally had to scrub my eyes at night to remove this), unbelievably smooth, and best of all, only $11 for 3 of them?!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is not just a 5 star product, in addition is cheap &amp; I received not one but three pencils!.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These pencils are great for a smudged smokey eye look, however it is not quite waterproof and if you&#x27;re not careful can leave you looking mildly like a panda.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and stays fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>Works just like the Revlon ones, and way better than Lancôme which comes off as fast as I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Swivels up smoothly, applies easily, and doesn&#x27;t smudge much.</li>
            <li>I am no longer able to find this eyeliner in the city that I live in.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m starting to think there is no one perfect eyeliner that stays ALL day long without some touch ups to do.</li>
            <li>It really stays on all day!!</li>
            <li>So I found I had to take eyeliner with me at all times to make sure it was still on in the middle of the day or before important client meetings.  </li>
            <li>I &#x27;m happy to give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Smudge free, long lasting,</li>
            <li>I wore my Prestige on a hot NY day and it did smudge a little in the outer corner of my eye after about 5 hours but for me it was ok and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>When I read the other reviews, I had to try this eyeliner because I didn&#x27;t think it could possibly be as good as they claim.. and still be so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great pencil, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day long.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is easy to remove and the retractable pencil is easy to grab on the go.</li>
            <li>Too Faced definitely has the most intense color, easiest application</li>
            <li>And I love that it is true black!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like the application as much as the Too Faced eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>This product holds up very well and does not run or smudge throughout the day.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really give away pencils and say, you may like these but also they may leave your eyes looking like two burnt holes in a blanket.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall they are pretty good, the color is deep, but as an other reviewer mentioned, it seems to go on more as a grayish/bluish black.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I do have more raccoon eyes than I do with the other two</li>
            <li>It just easier to apply and looks so much better than the other two, there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li>The color stated was black, it goes on more like gray-</li>
            <li>Between these and the Revlon Colorstay, I prefer Revlon, mainly for the color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Prestige and Revlon still fade a little at the end of the night but its more even.  </li>
            <li>a little at the end of the night but its more even.  </li>
            <li>It stays put with the least smudging by the end of the day of all the pencils I&#x27;ve ever used -- including popular brand &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; styles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any problems applying it, if you don&#x27;t want a stark line, they are easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>The color is intense, a deep, true black.  </li>
            <li>NOT BLACK / GRAY.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a true deep black.  </li>
            <li>Great black eyeliner, even compared to expensive ones.</li>

            <li> When I read the other reviews, I had to try this eyeliner because I didn&#x27;t think it could possibly be as good as they claim.. and still be so reasonably priced.  I doubt no more.  I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different eyelners, and they all seem to wear off in a very short time.  So I found I had to take eyeliner with me at all times to make sure it was still on in the middle of the day or before important client meetings.  I actually have use eye makeup remover on the Prestige eye pencile at the end of the day because it is still perfect after 10 hours!  I just hope Amazon continues to carry it forever!</li>

I liked the price of these and the reviews were good so I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they are pretty good, the color is deep, but as an other reviewer mentioned, it seems to go on more as a grayish/bluish black. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a true deep black.  I think it glides better than the Revlon Colorstay but, maybe because I apply over eye shadow, I have a hard time applying it.  I don&#x27;t know if it gets coated or something and it doesn&#x27;t seem to go on smoothly. I have to keep sharpening it. Again, this may have to do with my application. Between these and the Revlon Colorstay, I prefer Revlon, mainly for the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02/20/13 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided to splurge and tried these [[ASIN:B0057VH8QQ Too Faced Perfect Eyes Waterproof Eyeliner, Perfect Black, 0.04 Ounce]] because of the great reviews and loved them. They are almost twice as expensive but they are waxier and they just glide on.  I don&#x27;t have any problems applying it, if you don&#x27;t want a stark line, they are easy to blend.  The color is intense, a deep, true black.  In the morning, I do have more raccoon eyes than I do with the other two but I just have to make sure I remove makeup before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these and the Revlon Colorstay have slightly better staying power and that is their appeal but I don&#x27;t like the application as much as the Too Faced eyeliner.  It just easier to apply and looks so much better than the other two, there is no comparison.  I am going to stick with these.  I am going to try wearing one of each around the house (it would be noticeable so I don&#x27;t want to wear out) to compare and I&#x27;ll try to upload some pictures later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo of all three of them for comparison.  The Too Faced definitely has the most intense color, easiest application (It just glides on) but smudges easier.  The Prestige and Revlon still fade a little at the end of the night but its more even.

            <li> I am no longer able to find this eyeliner in the city that I live in. When I found this at Amazon I was ecstatic!!! This is the best eyeliner ever, it stays on through out the day. And I love that it is true black! NOT BLACK / GRAY. And the price is the best part of all. Give this a try!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is AMAZING! I took a BIG chance by buying this eyeliner without having read any previous reviews or used any of the brand&#x27;s products. The eyeliner is unbelievably wonderful! Retractable, waterproof (I literally had to scrub my eyes at night to remove this), unbelievably smooth, and best of all, only $11 for 3 of them?! Forget Sephora&#x27;s $12 eyeliner, I&#x27;m buying this for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased both Stila smudge stick and the Prestige automatic waterproof pencil. I swatched both behind my hand. Neither smudged but with water, the stila did rub off a bit. I let each one sit for about 2-3 minutes before I tested them. Maybe the stila needed another minute? I wore my Prestige on a hot NY day and it did smudge a little in the outer corner of my eye after about 5 hours but for me it was ok and easy to clean. it is waterproof and equal to the stila in color and intensity.</li>
            <li> These pencils are great for a smudged smokey eye look, however it is not quite waterproof and if you&#x27;re not careful can leave you looking mildly like a panda. Other than that, it is easy to remove and the retractable pencil is easy to grab on the go.</li>
            <li> This product holds up very well and does not run or smudge throughout the day. It&#x27;s hard to find a liner that works this well for the price. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great pencil, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day long.  I work long days and I do have to touch it up in the afternoon.  But I&#x27;m starting to think there is no one perfect eyeliner that stays ALL day long without some touch ups to do.</li>
            <li> Sharpening eyeliners is a pain, so this mechanical pencil is a great thing! One less thing to travel with (no sharpener). They last awhile and work well.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I have ordered these and they are the best eyeliners I have used. It really stays on all day!! Its great</li>
            <li> Love the line it gives and the great color.  It is easy to apply and stays fresh all day.  It does however, smudge a bit from the bottom lid as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Top notch eyeliner in my opinion! It&#x27;s waterproof and stays on all day. It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> looked like a raccoon at the end of the day.  I needed to keep checking my eyes to make sure the liner was&#x27;nt running on my lower lid</li>
            <li> The color stated was black, it goes on more like gray-black.&lt;br /&gt;It also smears, I woldn&#x27;t say I have oily eye lids.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of these pencils and I thought, these would be great and I can also give a couple away, win win.  However, I juts like these OK, not the perfect pencil in my mind, so I can&#x27;t really give away pencils and say, you may like these but also they may leave your eyes looking like two burnt holes in a blanket.</li>
            <li> After years buying a lot of different brands looking for an eyeliner which could stand all day  I found this one! It is not just a 5 star product, in addition is cheap &amp; I received not one but three pencils!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy I do not need to touch up my eyes anymore and I do not longer look like a ratcoon in the end of the day!</li>
            <li> Great price, great product. Swivels up smoothly, applies easily, and doesn&#x27;t smudge much. Great black eyeliner, even compared to expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Works just like the Revlon ones, and way better than Lancôme which comes off as fast as I put it on.  Great value at $10 for 3 and from Germany.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best pencil eye liner I&#x27;ve tried in the 15+ years I&#x27;ve been wearing eyeliner. It stays put with the least smudging by the end of the day of all the pencils I&#x27;ve ever used -- including popular brand &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; styles. This is definitely a great bargain for the price and quality!</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m happy to give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Smudge free, long lasting, great price.&lt;br /&gt;will order again and again........!</li>
