            <li>My teeth love it.</li>
            <li>Wish I had purchased this many years ago.</li>
            <li>Sure beats water glass for soaking dentures.</li>
            <li>better then the ones at drugstore or walmart.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My husband and I are pleased with the 2-pk dental bath.  </li>
            <li>but it is much better than the covered bowl he bought from the dollar store.</li>

            <li>I love them</li>

            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>My husband love them,fast shipping</li>
            <li>Great, and many item to have around; it makes using Retainer Brite so much easier.</li>
            <li>Remove able strainer basket makes rinsing denture or retainer easy</li>
            <li>The lift out tray is handy (no hands in the cleaning solution) &amp; it is easy to keep everything clean.  </li>
            <li>Filled to the top</li>
            <li>Over all great buy, has lasted a over a month thus far with out</li>
            <li>The hinges break easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to take out without dipping fingers in liquid.</li>

            <li>The bathing cup makes it easy to drain and remove my retainers after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does, however, spill easily.</li>

            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>

            <li>snaps secure</li>
            <li>Very convenient and looks nice on my bath countertop</li>
            <li>This container does not close securely, thus is leaks all over.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth having!</li>
            <li>I use it to clean and store my Invisalign.</li>
            <li>and after I clean it.</li>
            <li>I have a spare case to clean my retainers at night now.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Retainer Brite tablets in water to clean them.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my night mouth guard and sports guard.</li>
            <li>Use it to clean my mouth guard and appliances.</li>
            <li>clean mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer this kind to the vibrating ones, which dentures don&#x27;t need in the first place.</li>
            <li>wish they were bigger, but my dentures felt good in them</li>
            <li>After using for about a week, I think that it is good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the tray with handle; makes &amp;#34;in and out&amp;#34; much easier.</li>
            <li>Good idea, could be smaller size.</li>
            <li>As I have only a lower denture, I use the other bath to clean my portable nebulizer parts, and again the removable basket is perfect for more sanitary handling.  </li>
            <li>smart design, easy to use &amp; clean</li>
            <li>give the bath itself a quick rinse</li>
            <li>Prompt and Safe Undamaged Delivery Sealed Safe for Dentures and Invisalign Braces with using polident/efferdent tablets to keep them properly.</li>
            <li>This really helps keep my Invisalign Retainers clean!  </li>
            <li>Glad I hadn&#x27;t thrown the old one away yet.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have two, one for my present dentures, one for my backup.</li>
            <li>It was a nice surprise to know they come in different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this product alot, worth the price</li>
            <li>Otherwise, useful product.</li>
            <li>Super cheap, latch broke pretty much upon arrival.</li>
            <li>It is very large for what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and works great.  </li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, cover is hinged, the second one I use when I travel.</li>
            <li>Two for less than $10.00 was a good deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple but truly innovative.</li>
            <li>I love that you can lift the tray out without having to put your fingers in the water, and the price was terrific.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the size, color and design that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This is my first denture bath.</li>
            <li>it was a better price then the smaller cleaning tray.</li>
            <li>More than enough room for my night guard and the lift out basket is really convenient when cleaning my guard with Retainer Brite.</li>
            <li>Simple, fast and secure!</li>
            <li>one of the two items arrived damaged and the depth of the denture bath is not deep enough to allow good submersion of both dentures.</li>
            <li>The ones I received were white, but they are easy to handle, and as pretty as a denture holder can be.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to have the price taken down and just be for one bath.  </li>
            <li>but I keep lotion on my dry hands so more of deal for me.</li>
            <li>Has a nice little handle on the strainer insert piece.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to worry as much if they are going to fall out.</li>
            <li>I received 2 very well made denture holder/bath.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really all you need to leave soaking with a cleaning tablet when not in use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It holds water very well for soaking your Dentures.</li>
            <li>My dad really likes this.</li>
            <li>so i can just grab the handle and lift it straight out without having to put my fingers in.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep my clear retainer trays fresh (when paired with cleaning tablets) &amp; removes stains.</li>
            <li>Both hold my dentures in a reasonable water-tight container.  </li>
            <li>then I really need but</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they had a smaller size of the same thing for stayplates, maybe they could bundle one of each.</li>
            <li>A nice change to the light blue or pink or yellow</li>
            <li>(I have Invisaline retainers, not dentures) that I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use them -- a plastic cup is smaller and easier to store and clean, particularly when traveling.  </li>
            <li>If anything negative happens with this item, I will update in the future (but so far, so good)! ^^</li>
            <li>I love this little gadget.</li>
            <li>The size is large enough to fit, if needed, both an upper and lower denture.  </li>
            <li>arrived one dark blue and one violet, nice undescript colors.</li>
            <li>I have used the old stand-by of plain baking soda, but I like the bubbles and the minty freshness most washes have.</li>
            <li>Kids got retainers or adult with dentures!</li>
            <li>Easy to just hoist up the little basket and rinse them...</li>
            <li>Good deal on something I had trouble finding online at my typical shopping sites.</li>
            <li>Also, they sent two in white, which certainly wouldn&#x27;t have been my color choice, but you don&#x27;t get to pick.</li>
            <li>Needed something not too large for soaking my Invisilign trays when I travel, a daily necessity.  </li>
            <li>The denture baths seem to be well made &amp; are large enough for my husband to soak his dentures overnight without worry they aren&#x27;t getting covered.</li>
            <li>Large enough for two mouthpieces.</li>
            <li>I got two of these (and both had the clear dipping basket thingies also).  </li>
            <li>I bought this item to use for my Clear Correct retainers.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to receive two of these when I thought I&#x27;d purchased one.</li>
            <li>I cant vouch for dentures (haven&#x27;t reached that point yet), but I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far.</li>
            <li>Even though I can only use one I still really like the product.</li>
            <li>It was not easy to fine in the store</li>
            <li>but I am not sure air/water tight would be good for all cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>Fits full upper and partial lower.</li>
            <li>The basket in it makes it so much easier to remote or rinse out your Dentures.</li>
            <li>Closes securely but will leak if flipped (not surprising)</li>
            <li>it barely covers my upper and lower.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My teeth love it.</li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased this many years ago.</li>
            <li> Sure beats water glass for soaking dentures.</li>
            <li> better then the ones at drugstore or walmart.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are pleased with the 2-pk dental bath.  </li>
            <li> but it is much better than the covered bowl he bought from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Much better than using a paper cup.  </li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> Otherwise, ok.</li>
            <li> (top rack)</li>
            <li> safe</li>
            <li> With a 2-pack, I can keep one in the car for traveling (never know when you might need a denture case :-) )</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> My husband love them,fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great, and many item to have around; it makes using Retainer Brite so much easier.</li>
            <li> Remove able strainer basket makes rinsing denture or retainer easy</li>
            <li> The lift out tray is handy (no hands in the cleaning solution) &amp; it is easy to keep everything clean.  </li>
            <li> Filled to the top</li>
            <li> Over all great buy, has lasted a over a month thus far with out</li>
            <li> The hinges break easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to take out without dipping fingers in liquid.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, dishwasher safe.</li>
            <li> The bathing cup makes it easy to drain and remove my retainers after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does, however, spill easily.</li>
            <li> so you can easily lift your dentures out of the water or cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> One came broken which I was upset about, but honestly it&#x27;s a great holder for my invisalign and a great size.</li>
            <li> snaps secure</li>
            <li> Very convenient and looks nice on my bath countertop</li>
            <li> This container does not close securely, thus is leaks all over.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth having!</li>
            <li> I use it to clean and store my Invisalign.</li>
            <li> and after I clean it.</li>
            <li> I have a spare case to clean my retainers at night now.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Retainer Brite tablets in water to clean them.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my night mouth guard and sports guard.</li>
            <li> Use it to clean my mouth guard and appliances.</li>
            <li> clean mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer this kind to the vibrating ones, which dentures don&#x27;t need in the first place.</li>
            <li> wish they were bigger, but my dentures felt good in them</li>
            <li> After using for about a week, I think that it is good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the tray with handle; makes &amp;#34;in and out&amp;#34; much easier.</li>
            <li> Good idea, could be smaller size.</li>
            <li> As I have only a lower denture, I use the other bath to clean my portable nebulizer parts, and again the removable basket is perfect for more sanitary handling.  </li>
            <li> smart design, easy to use &amp; clean</li>
            <li> give the bath itself a quick rinse</li>
            <li> Prompt and Safe Undamaged Delivery Sealed Safe for Dentures and Invisalign Braces with using polident/efferdent tablets to keep them properly.</li>
            <li> This really helps keep my Invisalign Retainers clean!  </li>
            <li> Glad I hadn&#x27;t thrown the old one away yet.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have two, one for my present dentures, one for my backup.</li>
            <li> It was a nice surprise to know they come in different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this product alot, worth the price</li>
            <li> Otherwise, useful product.</li>
            <li> Super cheap, latch broke pretty much upon arrival.</li>
            <li> It is very large for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and works great.  </li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, cover is hinged, the second one I use when I travel.</li>
            <li> Two for less than $10.00 was a good deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple but truly innovative.</li>
            <li> I love that you can lift the tray out without having to put your fingers in the water, and the price was terrific.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the size, color and design that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This is my first denture bath.</li>
            <li> it was a better price then the smaller cleaning tray.</li>
            <li> More than enough room for my night guard and the lift out basket is really convenient when cleaning my guard with Retainer Brite.</li>
            <li> Simple, fast and secure!</li>
            <li> one of the two items arrived damaged and the depth of the denture bath is not deep enough to allow good submersion of both dentures.</li>
            <li> The ones I received were white, but they are easy to handle, and as pretty as a denture holder can be.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to have the price taken down and just be for one bath.  </li>
            <li> but I keep lotion on my dry hands so more of deal for me.</li>
            <li> Has a nice little handle on the strainer insert piece.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry as much if they are going to fall out.</li>
            <li> I received 2 very well made denture holder/bath.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really all you need to leave soaking with a cleaning tablet when not in use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It holds water very well for soaking your Dentures.</li>
            <li> My dad really likes this.</li>
            <li> so i can just grab the handle and lift it straight out without having to put my fingers in.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep my clear retainer trays fresh (when paired with cleaning tablets) &amp; removes stains.</li>
            <li> Both hold my dentures in a reasonable water-tight container.  </li>
            <li> then I really need but</li>
            <li> Would be nice if they had a smaller size of the same thing for stayplates, maybe they could bundle one of each.</li>
            <li> A nice change to the light blue or pink or yellow</li>
            <li> (I have Invisaline retainers, not dentures) that I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use them -- a plastic cup is smaller and easier to store and clean, particularly when traveling.  </li>
            <li> If anything negative happens with this item, I will update in the future (but so far, so good)! ^^</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget.</li>
            <li> The size is large enough to fit, if needed, both an upper and lower denture.  </li>
            <li> arrived one dark blue and one violet, nice undescript colors.</li>
            <li> I have used the old stand-by of plain baking soda, but I like the bubbles and the minty freshness most washes have.</li>
            <li> Kids got retainers or adult with dentures!</li>
            <li> Easy to just hoist up the little basket and rinse them...</li>
            <li> Good deal on something I had trouble finding online at my typical shopping sites.</li>
            <li> Also, they sent two in white, which certainly wouldn&#x27;t have been my color choice, but you don&#x27;t get to pick.</li>
            <li> Needed something not too large for soaking my Invisilign trays when I travel, a daily necessity.  </li>
            <li> The denture baths seem to be well made &amp; are large enough for my husband to soak his dentures overnight without worry they aren&#x27;t getting covered.</li>
            <li> Large enough for two mouthpieces.</li>
            <li> I got two of these (and both had the clear dipping basket thingies also).  </li>
            <li> I bought this item to use for my Clear Correct retainers.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to receive two of these when I thought I&#x27;d purchased one.</li>
            <li> I cant vouch for dentures (haven&#x27;t reached that point yet), but I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far.</li>
            <li> Even though I can only use one I still really like the product.</li>
            <li> It was not easy to fine in the store</li>
            <li> but I am not sure air/water tight would be good for all cleaning products.  </li>
            <li> Fits full upper and partial lower.</li>
            <li> The basket in it makes it so much easier to remote or rinse out your Dentures.</li>
            <li> Closes securely but will leak if flipped (not surprising)</li>
            <li> it barely covers my upper and lower.  </li>
            <li> ; so I expected to receive two different colors which would help distinguish &amp;#34;his&amp;#34; from &amp;#34;hers&amp;#34;, received two of the same color.</li>
            <li> It works as expected, will hold both upper and lower plates at the same time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big because it&#x27;s made for dentures, but it&#x27;s not THAT big either.  </li>
            <li> One order had a blue and white one, another order had a green teal and purple one.  </li>
            <li> Not very convenient.</li>
            <li> Also they stay closed</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I was using one that the lid would stay closed.  </li>
            <li> But for my money it is far too shallow.  </li>
            <li> Too small for upper and lower dentures together.</li>
            <li> I have idea what to do with the other one.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected but isn&#x27;t water tight.</li>
            <li> I add water, cleaning solution, click the lid closed and give a little side to side shake to mix/activate cleaner with out any spills.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to stick my fingers down into the tray, just pull out the mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Lift the tray, grab the guard without sticking your fingers down in the water.</li>
            <li> Not being water tight would be my only complaint</li>
            <li> One caveat; it is not water tight and it will leak if turned upside down.</li>
            <li> -TIGHT</li>
            <li> The bath has room for both; it does not break if dropped into the sink; and the lid fits tightly</li>
            <li> Lids snap tight so if box is knocked off, nothing falls out.  </li>
            <li> The little finger-lift hole means you can lift out the appliance without having to dip into the soaking liquid - just rinse it, the little tub, and your appliance, and away you go.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it for her retainer and my son uses the other for his football mouthpiece.!!</li>
            <li> Before that I was brushing with soap and a toothbrush since my orthodontist said toothpaste is too harsh for them.</li>
            <li> 1 out of 2 works properly 1 of the containers were broken.</li>
            <li> The plastic hinge is weak and broke after limited use.  </li>
            <li> Now that I ordered this, I&#x27;m not sure why:  </li>
            <li> you have almost any small dental apparatus, you need this for cleaning.</li>
            <li> To small for dentures.</li>
            <li> Does the trick, not much more to say.</li>
            <li> He found it hard to find in stores....</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it leaks if you move it around.</li>
            <li> When they say random color, they mean it!  </li>
            <li> I do not like it and am sorry I bought it.</li>

            <li> Works great for cleaning your invisalign braces! I add bright tabs for cleaning dentures and leave it a while. Then rinse with water over the inner tray. They come out all clean, smooth, and nice! Much better than brushing alone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a denture bath, attractive color.  But for my money it is far too shallow.  Filled to the top it barely covers my upper and lower.  Not very convenient. Glad I hadn&#x27;t thrown the old one away yet.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t received yet. But have a similar. Just different color. Perfect for sink vanity or bedside table. Buy your preferred effervescent wash.  I have used the old stand-by of plain baking soda, but I like the bubbles and the minty freshness most washes have. The remove able strainer is great to rinse off solution. And it&#x27;s drk blue or purple. A nice change to the light blue or pink or yellow you might find in grocers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just arrived one dark blue and one violet, nice undescript colors. Remove able strainer basket makes rinsing denture or retainer easy</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB; 3 STARS AS IT&#x27;S NOT WATER -TIGHT AT ALL</li>
            <li> Thea Denure boxes are GREAT. The basket in it makes it so much easier to remote or rinse out your Dentures. Also they stay closed so you don&#x27;t have to worry as much if they are going to fall out. I Deffently recommend them to EVERYONE. They as came on time &amp; plg. Perfectly. I would buy them again but I think they will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Mary Lou</li>
            <li> Great idea for my daughters retainer and my invaslign. Love the idea of the basket. Now i don&#x27;t have to keep cups on our sink with the risk of breaking them in the bathrooms. Great product and idea. Than You!</li>
            <li> Now that I ordered this, I&#x27;m not sure why:  You have to buy two at a time (I only needed one) and they&#x27;re so big (I have Invisaline retainers, not dentures) that I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use them -- a plastic cup is smaller and easier to store and clean, particularly when traveling.  Also, they sent two in white, which certainly wouldn&#x27;t have been my color choice, but you don&#x27;t get to pick.</li>
            <li> The hinges break easy.</li>
            <li> A really nice product. One can lift the cup and wash off their teeth without touching them.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning my daughter&#x27;s plastic retainers!</li>
            <li> bought these for my 97 yr old mother, she is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose but I wasnt expecting it to leak water out the back everytime I move it.</li>
            <li> I received 2 very well made denture holder/bath. Item as described. I would purchase again</li>
            <li> thanks--perfect for invisiline braces</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I have no idea why it comes with two, though.</li>
            <li> My kids prefer this unit to the one that&#x27;s battery operated (which over-foams its borders when you put the cleanser tablet in). This one is basic - but it&#x27;s really all you need to leave soaking with a cleaning tablet when not in use. The little finger-lift hole means you can lift out the appliance without having to dip into the soaking liquid - just rinse it, the little tub, and your appliance, and away you go.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean and store my Invisalign. Works perfectly and is great when sharing a bathroom with other family members that have Invisalign. I always know which one is mine.</li>
            <li> Been using for 6 months. Easy to take out without dipping fingers in liquid.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Invisalign.  I use it with Retainer Brite every morning!</li>
            <li> More than enough room for my night guard and the lift out basket is really convenient when cleaning my guard with Retainer Brite.</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget. The inner tray allows me to rinse my mouth guard before and after I clean it. I don&#x27;t have to stick my fingers down into the tray, just pull out the mouth guard. Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this is called a &amp;#34;denture&amp;#34; bath. But forget that. It&#x27;s great for retainers, mouth guards (for sports or night time grinding of teeth), and dentures too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have almost any small dental apparatus, you need this for cleaning. It&#x27;s simple but truly innovative.</li>
            <li> Good Value and meet the requirement to keep dentures clean and safe. Does the job well.</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it with Efferdent Plus.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Closes securely but will leak if flipped (not surprising)</li>
            <li> I was surprised to receive two of these when I thought I&#x27;d purchased one. I have a spare case to clean my retainers at night now. I use this with the Retainer Brite tablets in water to clean them. I like that I can shut the lid. Before that I was brushing with soap and a toothbrush since my orthodontist said toothpaste is too harsh for them. (They are like the Invisalign braces.)</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning my retainer.</li>
            <li> This was excellent for my college student to clean his retainer after his braces came off!</li>
            <li> Works great for our retainer. Now we don&#x27;t need to worry about our pets getting in. W 4 x D 4 x H 3. Bit bigger than retainer case and thicker by 2 inces.</li>
            <li> I love that you can lift the tray out without having to put your fingers in the water, and the price was terrific.</li>
            <li> To small for dentures. They need to be taller the material that their made from is good and it has a drainer inside  that works well.</li>
            <li> My teeth love it. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I got two of these (and both had the clear dipping basket thingies also).  Both come with their own box and for the price they&#x27;re an excellent deal!  If anything negative happens with this item, I will update in the future (but so far, so good)! ^^</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my night mouth guard and sports guard. It works as expected but isn&#x27;t water tight.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the size, color and design that I was looking for.  The tray allows one to lift and rinse the partials with ease.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased this many years ago. Sure beats water glass for soaking dentures.</li>
            <li> Use it to clean my mouth guard and appliances. Work great!</li>
            <li> Fits full upper and partial lower. snaps secure</li>
            <li> I got this for son&#x27;s retainer. And 1 for my denture at the price you get 2. better then the ones at drugstore or walmart.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean. Love this product.</li>
            <li> 1 out of 2 works properly 1 of the containers were broken. And was shipped like that for some reason.</li>
            <li> Works for soaking my night guard</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use! Kids got retainers or adult with dentures! Simple, fast and secure!</li>
            <li> Lifting tray pulls out so you don&#x27;t have to stick your fingers in the chemicals. Easy to clean, cover is hinged, the second one I use when I travel.</li>
            <li> Works well, good value for the money</li>
            <li> There are actually two in one order. I guess I will save the second. I bought this for my my night guard I where when sleeping( teeth grinding). Lift the tray, grab the guard without sticking your fingers down in the water. Not a big deal but I keep lotion on my dry hands so more of deal for me. Sturdy plastic. Recommend</li>
            <li> I have a night guard and this is working perfectly to keep it clean and in a special place.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are pleased with the 2-pk dental bath.  Good deal on something I had trouble finding online at my typical shopping sites.</li>
            <li> Needed something not too large for soaking my Invisilign trays when I travel, a daily necessity.  This fills the bill!</li>
            <li> This really helps keep my Invisalign Retainers clean!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!!!</li>
            <li> This works great for Dentures. It holds water very well for soaking your Dentures. It has a removable tray that is great for cleaning and dumping out the water. This is a great buy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> perfect for storing and soaking my retainers</li>
            <li> My dad really likes this. He said it leaks a tiny bit but it is much better than the covered bowl he bought from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and looks nice on my bath countertop</li>
            <li> actually using these for my retainers. Still does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> As advertised., Works well. Inexpensive</li>
            <li> everything was perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use for my Clear Correct retainers.  I love it!  It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and works great.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Too small for upper and lower dentures together.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to soak and keep my night guard in especially when I travel.  This is perfect.  It&#x27;s a little big because it&#x27;s made for dentures, but it&#x27;s not THAT big either.  It comes in a 2 pack and both had a lift out basket in them so i can just grab the handle and lift it straight out without having to put my fingers in.  Happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li> I thought the 2-Pack would include two different color baths.  Nope -- both blue.</li>
            <li> one of the two items arrived damaged and the depth of the denture bath is not deep enough to allow good submersion of both dentures.</li>
            <li> Much better than using a paper cup.  Easy to clean, dishwasher safe.</li>
            <li> smart design, easy to use &amp; clean</li>
            <li> Helps keep my clear retainer trays fresh (when paired with cleaning tablets) &amp; removes stains. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for soaking and cleaning mouthguards and retainers. I cant vouch for dentures (haven&#x27;t reached that point yet), but I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far. One caveat; it is not water tight and it will leak if turned upside down.</li>
            <li> Very good idea to keep retainers clean! Absolutely worth having!</li>
            <li> good quality-does the job</li>
            <li> Got this for myself for my retainer and one for the husband for his teeth. I love them</li>
            <li> Two for less than $10.00 was a good deal. Good product but it claimed &amp;#34;random color&amp;#34; so I expected to receive two different colors which would help distinguish &amp;#34;his&amp;#34; from &amp;#34;hers&amp;#34;, received two of the same color. Has a nice little handle on the strainer insert piece.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived on time</li>
            <li> Does the job! Discreet and the tray makes it convenient. ..I have no complaints at all and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for electric toothbrush heads and retainers.  Comes in a two pack and you don&#x27;t get a color choice.</li>
            <li> Does the trick, not much more to say.</li>
            <li> One came broken which I was upset about, but honestly it&#x27;s a great holder for my invisalign and a great size. Even though I can only use one I still really like the product. Good price too</li>
            <li> It works as expected, will hold both upper and lower plates at the same time.</li>
            <li> The size is large enough to fit, if needed, both an upper and lower denture.  Wonderful item.</li>
            <li> The plastic hinge is weak and broke after limited use.  Otherwise, ok.</li>
            <li> Great bath for my sleep apnea mouth guard.</li>
            <li> This container does not close securely, thus is leaks all over.  I do not like it and am sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> wish they were bigger, but my dentures felt good in them</li>
            <li> Great size; does what I need it to do.  I like the inner basket feature.</li>
            <li> Good product. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> They are nice denture baths and they are good for soaking and then rinsing my dentures.</li>
            <li> This is my first denture bath. After using for about a week, I think that it is good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I use these to soak/clean my retainers. Lots of room for both. Easy to just hoist up the little basket and rinse them...give the bath itself a quick rinse and I&#x27;m done. The 2 pack gives me an extra for travel.</li>
            <li> Good purchase well made</li>
            <li> I have two.  Best way to clean Invisalign braces.</li>
            <li> In this two-pack, the pictures show a blue bath with a strainer.  When the product arrived, I received a blue bath and a white bath.  The blue bath contained a strainer, while the white bath did not. Although this does not effect the operation of the bath, do not expect both to have a strainer.  Both hold my dentures in a reasonable water-tight container.  These are larger than what my dentist gave me to hold my dentures.  It is nice to have two, one for my present dentures, one for my backup.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if they had a smaller size of the same thing for stayplates, maybe they could bundle one of each.</li>
            <li> Prompt and Safe Undamaged Delivery Sealed Safe for Dentures and Invisalign Braces with using polident/efferdent tablets to keep them properly.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these denture cases / bath!  I would recommend them to others to try.  Very good for the price!</li>
            <li> I ordered these expecting two blues, but one was white. It was a nice surprise to know they come in different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This denture bath has been great for cleaning my retainers. They don&#x27;t keep any smell and they feel sturdy, so packing them up shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. The bathing cup makes it easy to drain and remove my retainers after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend these.</li>
            <li> I like this product alot, worth the price anyday.&lt;br /&gt;-Seems durable&lt;br /&gt;-Nifty tray too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It deserves 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It was not easy to fine in the store but Amazon had it my husband is happy with this product and has 20 year using it</li>
            <li> Perfect for my both of my sons&#x27; retainers.  Works also for my husband&#x27;s sleep mouthguard.  Note:  When they say random color, they mean it!  One order had a blue and white one, another order had a green teal and purple one.  I also called the manufacturer to ask if it dishwasher (top rack) safe and they said that they would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Color received is white though,  not as pictured, the blue.</li>
            <li> The denture baths seem to be well made &amp; are large enough for my husband to soak his dentures overnight without worry they aren&#x27;t getting covered.</li>
            <li> Good product. Larger than the one my dentist gave me.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this for a soaking a night guard. It is taller &amp; larger then I really need but it was a better price then the smaller cleaning tray. (When I travel I can pack everything in the tray so night guard, cleaner &amp; such are kept neatly together.)  I add water, cleaning solution, click the lid closed and give a little side to side shake to mix/activate cleaner with out any spills.  The lift out tray is handy (no hands in the cleaning solution) &amp; it is easy to keep everything clean.  It does not have venting wholes but it does leak if knocked over on its side. Not being water tight would be my only complaint but I am not sure air/water tight would be good for all cleaning products.  Over all great buy, has lasted a over a month thus far with out breaking have not need to opened the 2nd one yet.</li>
            <li> The ones I received were white, but they are easy to handle, and as pretty as a denture holder can be.  The removable basket is a terrific idea, so you can drain the denture without having to reach into the disinfectant.  As I have only a lower denture, I use the other bath to clean my portable nebulizer parts, and again the removable basket is perfect for more sanitary handling.  I much prefer this kind to the vibrating ones, which dentures don&#x27;t need in the first place.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Nice liner.</li>
            <li> My kids love it!  My daughter uses it for her retainer and my son uses the other for his football mouthpiece.!!</li>
            <li> I bought if for a retainer cleaner.  It is very large for what I wanted. My biggest complaint is that it leaks if you move it around.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love the tray with handle; makes &amp;#34;in and out&amp;#34; much easier.</li>
            <li> Large enough for two mouthpieces. Great size.</li>
            <li> This is just what the doctor (or dentist!) ordered.  I use this to clean/store the mouth guard I wear at night because of clenching and grinding my teeth.  I fill it up with warm water, add a denture cleaning tablet and viola...clean mouth guard.  My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that it comes with two.  I have idea what to do with the other one.  It would be nice to have the price taken down and just be for one bath.  My baths were blue and purple.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I am glad it came in a pack of 2. I leave one at home an take one in my travel bag. I have a night guard and an Invisalign brace that I use nightly. The bath has room for both; it does not break if dropped into the sink; and the lid fits tightly so nothing spills if it does fall into the sink.</li>
            <li> Coupled with a cleaning agent, this has been working out for me by making it easier to soak my mouth guard. It does, however, spill easily.</li>
            <li> What can I say? These denture baths are a Great value! With a 2-pack, I can keep one in the car for traveling (never know when you might need a denture case :-) ) Sturdy and well-made, each bath has a basket so you can easily lift your dentures out of the water or cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice and good quality.</li>
            <li> Great product for letting retainers soak in cleaning solution. Love this</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband....He found it hard to find in stores....He loves it ...</li>
            <li> Sturdy! Plenty of room and love the removable tray!</li>
            <li> Using it for a night guard case. Received it today: two trays one blue one purple. I am currently using the blue one for at home use but keeping the extra one for when I travel so If I forget the 2nd one somewhere I will still have a spare.</li>
            <li> This is a good bath for dentures.  I especially like the basket.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for my needs.  I was using one that the lid would stay closed.  Plus this one allows me to raise the tub up for drying.</li>
            <li> great product, love that the inter screen has a handle</li>
            <li> Good idea, could be smaller size.</li>
            <li> I ordered blue but recieved aqua. Otherwise, useful product.</li>
            <li> Super cheap, latch broke pretty much upon arrival.</li>
            <li> My husband love them,fast shipping</li>
            <li> Good product for home or travel.  My father uses one for is teeth and one for his hearing aids.  Lids snap tight so if box is knocked off, nothing falls out.  Arrived on time and in excellent condition, good job seller!</li>
            <li> This denture bath works great for keeping my retainers sparkling clean.  I just drop them into it in the morning with some denture cleaner and by the time I go to bed they are thoroughly cleansed and deodorized.</li>
            <li> Great, and many item to have around; it makes using Retainer Brite so much easier.</li>
