            <li>However, after a week of use, I noticed I have a lot more break outs.</li>

            <li>If you want to moisturize your lips, shea butter is the best possible balm I&#x27;ve found (mix it with powdered stevia extract and peppermint or sweet orange oil for flavor and sweetness.)</li>
            <li>I love the way they packaged this bottle, securely and in a box.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>I really had no clue at all the things that Rosehip Oil is good for.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li>I very light, clean iteration of this oil.</li>
            <li>Other than that, perfect and would buy it again from this seller!</li>
            <li>I use the oil as a carrier for other oils and it works great!</li>
            <li>The original is a lot more orange then what this company has produced.</li>
            <li>they kept me aware of shipping as well as checking if I enjoyed product !</li>
            <li>I added a little of my favorite smell and now it&#x27;s perfect...</li>
            <li>Mixes easily with my coconut and almond oils.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well, but absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is also great mixed with coconut oil and shea butter (with a dash of mint, my favorite scent) as a lotion.</li>
            <li>It melts into the skin so easily and does not leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>and it breaks easily.</li>
            <li>It arrived appearing to be packaged well; however, the top was loosened and some oil got out and required clean up.</li>
            <li>I really love the packaging which is a solid, brown glass with a great weight to it.</li>
            <li>bottle is HUGE and was filled to the top.</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong aroma</li>
            <li>This oil in particular is really good for skin, hair and nails.</li>
            <li>I now use rosehip oil from majestic pure and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>The glass packaging insures that the oil is kept cool and fresh and toxin free and the dropper works great to measure the right amount of oil needed.</li>
            <li>Very nice, penetrates the skin quickly leaving it very soft, and doesnt feel greasy!</li>
            <li>they are great for skin problems and just general moisture.</li>
            <li>is my first time trying rose hip oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip seed oil is moisturizing and used for a variety of skin conditions including dermatitis, acne, and eczema; for sunburned skin; for hydrating aging skin; and for smoothing fine lines and fine wrinkles in aging skin and helping to even skin tone; and for treating brittle nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fine wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fine wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This rosehip oil can also be used for scars, fine lines, wrinkles, and even brittle nails.</li>
            <li>No scent, which is fine.</li>
            <li>I am using it for fine lines on my face at night.  </li>
            <li>Is it light amber in color, has the consistence of an olive oil, but soaks easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works fine regardless of the color, but just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It helped improve fine lines, as well as the tone and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>, it is too soon to say if it is doing something on my fine lines, but I do like the way I look when I wake up.  </li>
            <li>It glides smoothly onto the skin soaking in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Love this oil for my face, absorbs quickly and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li>The oil is quickly absorbed on dry and parched areas of the skin, leaving an exquisite silky feel.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and super manageable and looks really really great with this treatment.</li>
            <li>This Majestic&#x60;s Pure Rose Hip, does not have a fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am loving the oils from Majestic Pure.</li>

            <li>I wondered if it would make me break out at all, and it hasn&#x27;t, they are both really light.</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly onto the skin and absorbs well without leaving a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light amber.</li>

            <li>So happy that I did, because there now my go to for any essential oil.</li>
            <li>Also makes a great carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li>It is great to use on your skin or as a carrier oil for essential oil, etc.</li>
            <li>Love it, well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Important to know it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, which I knew.</li>
            <li>She was very suprised that it helps and she also liked the scent.</li>
            <li>I never realized how amazing they really are.</li>
            <li>This bottle is a nice value size (which is very convenient).  </li>
            <li>I disagree that is is light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>I did not receive it FREE for an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I enjoy this oil a lot and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>have received free products to help facilitate my review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my hands, especially my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t yet speak to the efficacy of the oil, customer service is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li>If the oil works as well as customer service, it&#x27;s going to be fantastic.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and get the Leven Rose brand (available on Amazon) or order from Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li>It is lightly amber in color with no viscosity at all.</li>
            <li>I use this also at Night with night moisturizer and my skin so moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>The order and delivery process was smooth and efficient.  </li>
            <li>It was a light amber color.</li>
            <li>It also do not have any offensive smell, it feels nice on the skin and seem to penetrate very well on my face, have used it twice now</li>
            <li>This helps out to keep them looking fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly, very well packed, and this is a generous bottle of rose hip oil.</li>
            <li>This oil is light and has no scent.</li>
            <li>I do mix it with essential oils and it works great on my face.</li>
            <li>Great product that I use daily as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I really liked it as a face moisturizer because it was lightweight, didn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy or filmy, and there wasn&#x27;t much of a smell.</li>
            <li>So far, so good ...</li>
            <li>so far loving  results :)</li>
            <li>so I would feel good giving this as a gift has a natural but upscale look.</li>
            <li>I will be honest and say that so far it hasn&#x27;t helped it but it does make my skin feel better</li>
            <li>Awesome on the dry skin but a little oily when first put on and the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li>I have had some Rosehip leave a greasy feeling after rubbing it into my skin, but this one soaks right into my skin and gives me a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>My cuticles looked better right away.</li>
            <li>Also great for cuticle before and after a pedicure :) there are many uses for this oil, and I will update if I find that it works any specific wonders as I use it for new things.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Majestic Pure&#x27;s line!</li>
            <li>This is a smooth clean oil with no order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thank you for a quality product, easy ordering and quickly delivering.</li>
            <li>not this particular rose hip oil.  </li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is such a great ingredient to ad to your beauty routine because it offers so many benefits!</li>
            <li>It made my face smooth and it absorbed very quickly</li>
            <li>Such an amazing versatile product!</li>
            <li>But this product is a big four ounces and comes with its own dropper!</li>
            <li>I am already seeing a softening of them and more suppleness to my stomach; I have been using it for about three weeks but even the first time I put it on my stomach</li>
            <li>(  if i dont use rich oily products my skin fels thight and uncomfortobale.</li>
            <li>It soothed his face and the redness was significantly reduced by morning.</li>
            <li>Their prices are unbelievable and the quality is truly impressive.</li>
            <li>There are so many glowing reviews on this, but I just wanted to add what I felt was significant after trying this oil for a month: Really does minimize stretch marks!  </li>
            <li>I repurchase the original oil and something is off here.</li>
            <li>but once this bottle is up I will repurchase through them since its significantly cheaper then what I had been using.</li>
            <li>majestic pure has such a wonderful rosehip essential oil as well as many others!</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not that easy to be  absorbed.</li>
            <li>It comes with an easy to use dropper which is really useful.</li>
            <li>It feels light and nongreasy on the skin, seeming to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>and it got absorbed easily and within mins</li>
            <li>I put 3 drops on my clean hands and pat it on my face twice a day</li>
            <li>Makes a great moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far!</li>
            <li>It goes smooth on the skin, and absorbs quickly, leaving skin soft and smooth, however, it tends to break out on my face, but it works fine with my cuticles, so I decided to use it for my cuticles for the most part.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to try it on many other things its good for.</li>
            <li>The other 2 brands were a nice warm amber color.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s 100% pure and organic.</li>
            <li>There are so many uses for the Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil</li>
            <li>Specially on your face.</li>
            <li>I run out and also try out more products from magestic pure.</li>
            <li>I would just google it and see if it&#x27;s right for you!</li>
            <li>The serum is fantastic, but the dropper leaks way too much!!</li>
            <li>Super Fresh Taste !</li>
            <li>Seems to be pretty good stuff so far.</li>
            <li>I love how the rose oil absorbs into my skin without feeling oily and my skin feels hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li>Rosehip seed oil is my absolute favorite moisturizer for my face, hair and body.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a natural nice scent.</li>
            <li>It makes a bit of time to be absorbed but leaves your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Full of vitamins etc.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for a bit longer use to reap full benefits.</li>
            <li>My skin glows creamy with a gentle rosey-ness, and a dewey youthful rounding out of my more angular features is taking place.</li>
            <li>, compare effects against the outcomes of different products, arrive at conclusions that are fair and balanced.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I use it every day.</li>
            <li>Love this Rosehip Oil and it&#x27;s very generous for the price</li>
            <li>and I am loving it thus far.</li>
            <li>.. Makes you feel really cool</li>
            <li>and I love that it absorbs so fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely going to buy more whennever</li>
            <li>The bottle is a full 4 ounces, or 118 ml.</li>
            <li>And such a good price</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure offers very high quality, pure and organic oils with some of the best packaging I have owned!</li>
            <li>Overall, very impressed with this product, its many uses, and its overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by Majestic Pure for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li>This oil is non-greasy, light weight and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>I was super excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li>two weeks -- because this thing OXIDIZED QUICKLY because of the bottling.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin so quickly.</li>

            <li>I love this Rosehip Oil because it&#x27;s all natural ( like their others) and leaves my hair looking fantastic.</li>
            <li>and my skin is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will return later on and give a more thorough review after using this product some more.</li>
            <li>My skin loves the oil and quickly absorbs it, leaving no greasy feelings.</li>
            <li>Due to my acne outbreaks on my face, I always have this scar from old acne that leaves marks in my face that is not suppose to be there if you want a beautiful healthy skin.</li>
            <li>So many uses - highly</li>
            <li>I continue to use the oil nightly right out of the shower and it keeps it nice and soft as well as the skin around it.</li>
            <li>I own several Majestic Pure products and they have always provided me with top customer service.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Noticed a difference in my appearance the very first night I put it on before bed and woke in the morning.</li>
            <li>Apparently it is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes predominately grown in Chile.</li>
            <li>I am using it to mix with my essential oil recipes and and very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>:/&lt;br /&gt;I have enclosed a photo of the original rose hip oil I have been using since my surgery, the product in question and then regular vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>My nail beds are so healthy and they look &#x27;normal&#x27; again.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this oil and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li>Feels good after long sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>Every scent of Majectic Pure essential oil that I have tried has been amazing!</li>
            <li>We used the oil mostly on our hands and they feel like new again.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was very happy to see that the label on the bottle not only gave clear and easy directions about how to use the oil, but also has a list of many other uses for the oil too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and absorbs into the skin easily.</li>
            <li>bottle is also a pretty good size so for me personally it&#x27;ll last for quite awhile</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mild success with the non-scented vanocream lotion on</li>
            <li>It goes easy and  and absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li>For The First Time Ever !</li>
            <li>Since it comes specifically from only one kind of rose it makes it just a little more special.  </li>
            <li>It leave my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and super healthy looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also have been using on some dry skin areas on my forehead and it has left no residue, absorbs perfectly.</li>
            <li>It leave my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and super healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Majestic</li>
            <li>you have a large collection of special products for your special issues.</li>
            <li>I am wondering if Majestic Pure replaces it for free.</li>
            <li>Pure with a light aroma.  </li>
            <li>Huge upside to this product is that it is a very generous size (4 ounces) for the price, so I can apply it liberally and use it as an all-over serum rather than a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I use it for my face in the morning light and very absorbent</li>
            <li>Overall, this is an amazing oil that will help moisturize your face, body and hair.</li>
            <li>How can it smooth skin thats crepey or wrinklyish so fast?</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.  </li>
            <li>For moisture I use this Rosehip oil in combination with Argan oil and lavender, rose, frankincense and turmeric essential oils.</li>
            <li>Rosehip Seed Oil has powerful properties to help regenerate and brighten skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just got into using these oils but this is by far my favorite brand I have tried.</li>
            <li>was using jojoba oil as my night time moisturizer, but have since learned about rose hip&#x27;s benefits from my beauty vlogger friends, and i will never look back!</li>
            <li>We like that this oil is natural and organic, safe to use.  </li>
            <li>Nice to use on skin, especially for massage.</li>
            <li>this product is more of an light yellow!</li>
            <li>I feel it is worth the try.</li>
            <li>, never have I ever come across a product that I&#x27;ve put on my face that has had such astounding results.</li>
            <li>She loves how soft it is making her skin, she has a lot o sun damage and used to smoke so anything that works for her she is in love with.</li>
            <li>I have purchased two different brands of rose hip oil.</li>
            <li>product is not cold pressed as advertised  </li>
            <li>It has improved the look of several of my scars and reduced their visibility quite nicely.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and moisturised.</li>
            <li>Rather, the oil is quickly absorbed and the skin is moisturized within minutes.</li>
            <li>By far the most valuable of all the essential oils I own.</li>
            <li>I must say that the price is really worth it.</li>
            <li>What a nice big size!</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels after I use the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was a dropper top provided in the box.</li>
            <li>It can be used for naturally toning skin, moisturizing, sunburn, wrinkles and much more.</li>
            <li>Currently, I mix it with my jojoba oil (5 drops, rose hip oil 2-3 drops) in the evening.</li>
            <li>So for me at the moment I have to say is worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it for my hair and now my hair is so soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it 💟</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for the very dry skin around my eyes, and it really doesn&#x27;t have a smell, soaks in nicely, gives a nice (not greasy) dewy glow, and does the moisturizing job as it should.</li>
            <li>, I need extra rich creamy oily stuff since my skin is dry-ish even more so in winter &amp;#62;&#x3D;</li>
            <li>i used this along side some other essential oils and the results were wonderful!</li>
            <li>The rosehip is the fruit of the rose plant and is formed after successful pollination of flowers in spring or early summer, and ripens in late summer through autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gotten other oils from this company before and absolutely loved them.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because the dropper is not well made it just comes right out</li>
            <li>Works well on the face for moisture and on hands right after washing them.</li>
            <li>because I just purchased it, however I can say as of right now the oil is not greasy if I use right amount on my face.</li>
            <li>I took that sticker off and placed it right on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And this comes in a huge 4 oz bottle that will last for a very long time, so it is a great value as well.</li>
            <li>Not sure if rose hip oil can prevent stretch marks since some say it&#x27;s mostly genetics</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip Seed Oil is particularly high in Vitamin C and is one of the richest plant sources of Vitamin C available.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin, and leaves my skin feeling so soft, and smooth after applying.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it comes out too fast and you can easily use to much.</li>
            <li>Good size bottle, mild scent, fast absorbing, long shelf life.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried another brand which seemed to be higher quality.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!!  </li>
            <li>and we know that is a benefit for so many issues from sun damage to preventing further problems so to be able to undo some damage as well as protect future damage</li>
            <li>Will probably need to transfer to smaller bottles with better delivery system.</li>
            <li>I had purchased the first one to use in my laundry soap I make at home as well as to put in the body wash and soaps I make from home as well.</li>

            <li>This is my first time trying this brand</li>

            <li>Thank you..;)</li>
            <li>I love that this product comes with a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>Aside from the quality of the oil being above it&#x27;s competitors, I also really love this company because of the way they package their oils.</li>
            <li>For face/neck I put on the aloe first, then follow with a drop on finger smoothed on - drop on forehead, 1 on each side of face and 2 on neck.</li>
            <li>/felt in first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This bottle came sealed with a flat top cap and the dropper was wrapped separately,this is a nice option for those who prefer one over the other.</li>
            <li>I would never give anything other than my 100% honest opinion, and jeapordize my long-term beauty blog subscribers, or anyone else reading my reviews.</li>
            <li>this smells so good, and really works well, used a little on my scars and it has helped of lightening the redness.</li>
            <li>) Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10,</li>

            <li>I really didn&#x27;t get to use it that much yet..</li>
            <li>With art naturals I used up the whole bottle in a year</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to rub it anywhere - it&#x27;s light enough in texture that it spreads really well.</li>

            <li>this is a miracle oil coz it made my scars lightened ani made my skin much brighter.</li>
            <li>This company was very conscientious about selling their products and service.  </li>
            <li>really just depends on how much you use and how you use it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It will really condition and heal the skin.</li>
            <li>I wish it was available in a larger size because I like to use it on my arms, legs, etc.</li>

            <li>I have been using this on a surgery scar, and the area is so much softer already.</li>

            <li>Thanks guys</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much about how it worked on my problem areas as of yet</li>
            <li>To me the seller was very considerate in including a dropper in the box with the oil.</li>
            <li>Really, it feels like a liquid, and absorbs like a water based, not oil based.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 24), and it didn&#x27;t help out much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really can see results to skin tone/texture within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just apply a couple of drops of the oil onto your fingertips using the dropper provided and gently rub into the area you want to use it on.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>This is really.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to to the job.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all, unless you really put your nose to the bottle.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and she says they&#x27;ve really helped her complexion and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my moisturizer and love how fresh my face looks in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I see my stretch marks fading away slowly on my stomach and it has gotten smooth but it works better than cocoa butter ( from my experience)</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of twice daily application my skin is so soft and more glowing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product is ok, but the shipping package was poor.  </li>
            <li>Also use it for stretchmarks over thighs and not sure if it is effective yet, too soon to see, but very hopeful!</li>
            <li>I love to gently massage the oil into my face, as I can feel how soft it instantly makes my skin.</li>
            <li>made my own DYI facial serum with this along with some essential oils.</li>
            <li>I store my rose hip oil in the fridge and take it out every morning and evening to get a few drops.</li>
            <li>Awesome oil, exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to look like (light honey color) not much of a smell though like some other rosehip oils I have order in the past</li>
            <li>This oil is very useful for a lot of skin problem especially your face.</li>
            <li>A wonderful hydrator full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, restore skin elasticity, and boost collagen production, all while reducing scars and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am glad I receive a sample of rosehip oil because my skin was feeling rough and quite dry due to my cleansing products, but this oil is amazing!</li>
            <li>The differences i&#x27;ve noticed since using this in such a short period of time are nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying using it by itself and by adding drops to other creams and lotions I use.</li>
            <li>I love this Rosehip Oil, I had other brand before</li>
            <li>Unlike some other reviews, there&#x27;s also no awful smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for the the dry skin, works much better than other products I tried for that.</li>
            <li>I use the oil cleansing method and alternate that with honey to clean my face.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better everyday, and I don&#x27;t even have to wear as much foundation/concealer as I did before, and I JUST started this regimen!</li>
            <li>so I can not comment on the long term effects but the short term benefits are amazing.</li>
            <li>It was grease less , so I was able to wear a white light weight sweater over it with ease.</li>
            <li>My dry skin soaks it right up leaving me with silky smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li>I thought the Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil was thick, absorbed well into my skin, and I like the Holistic Value of Rosehip Oil on my Skin the most.</li>
            <li>Rose hip seed oil is a dry oil, when you put it on there should be no grease left.</li>
            <li>I have used in on my dry ends of my hair, on my face around my eyes to decrease fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love essential oils and the proper glass eye droppedlr that was included is Mich appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I also love how it as helped lighten up my dark spots.</li>
            <li>It is an incredibly versatile product that can be used as an acne treatment, facial toner, daily moisturizer, scar/blemish treatment, and makeup remover, to name a few.</li>
            <li>Just with the first application I could feel how soft my skin can be.</li>

            <li>I use this around my cuticles because they are so super dry and the winter has done a number on them.</li>
            <li>It also has a very soft scent.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend using natural oils.</li>
            <li>If not, you can just make sure there&#x27;s very little in there</li>
            <li>Because it is so gentle, Rosehip Seed Oil can be used as a serum to the face after cleansing, as a general body oil to soften and rejuvenate skin, and to nourish hair.</li>
            <li>I took off 1 star only because of the dropper which I made seller aware of and they are looking into it.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to using it in cold-process soap to make a facial bar to suit my exact needs.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty big 7 inch scar and this is what I use on it.</li>
            <li>keep your skin young with this!  </li>

            <li>I have recently seen some facial recipes that call for rosehip oil so am excited to try those out.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this rosehip oil as well as the majestic pure line of essential oils!</li>
            <li>It gets very messy, and the oil just slides out of the dropper without having to squeeze the top.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily for the past week and its made a noticeable difference in breakage and has given me a really nice shine.</li>
            <li>Mix this with some Lavender oil on my dry cracked hands and they instantly felt smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It smells a bit pungent for some, but I find, because I am using it topically and in smaller areas, the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin right now on my hands</li>
            <li>The product is in a very generous container, a little goes a long way, it seems as the skin absorbs it pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Omega 3, 6, and 9 fatty acids in the rosehip seed oil help to plump out fine lines and</li>

            <li>/&gt;The large bottle of therapeutic grade Rosehip Seed Oil contains 4 fluid ounces.</li>
            <li>Also I have purchased several products from Majestic Pure and can attest to their quality.  </li>
            <li>Get yourself this big 4oz bottle from Majestic Pure and google rosehip...</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure is definitely one of my FAVS!</li>
            <li>I have replaced all my commercial lotions with this 100% pure natural oil.</li>
            <li>I love that this may reverse some of that and make my skin a little younger looking.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times I have over used the oil by using the standard little bottles.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s pregnant and she uses this oil because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the cocoa butter and all the other oils for stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so disappointed, because I loved what Majestic Pure&#x27;s rosehip oil had done for my skin the first time around.</li>
            <li>This is a great sized bottle at 4 oz, it&#x27;s cold pressed and organic too, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t clear out my acne marks -- which what I was aiming for.</li>
            <li>My product is almost clear and has no discernible smell.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s early, but I was so amazed by result</li>
            <li>It is all natural.</li>
            <li>Completely healed my sunburn in as little&lt;</li>
            <li>the oil makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so soft, and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have old stretch marks on my stomach and while they may never go away</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin sooo soft.</li>
            <li>When ever I happen to get a pimple this really helps my skin to heal quicker and remove the redness left on my face from the pimple.</li>
            <li>and we were pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Organic completely.</li>
            <li>So far keep the skin moisturized and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: It really reduces the size of open pores!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for some months now on my body and in my baths and my skin is soft and no ash appearance.  </li>
            <li>My nails have a natural shine to them now.</li>
            <li>I even applied my foundation directly after and it didn&#x27;t make my foundation oily.</li>
            <li>This oil feels so soft on my skin</li>
            <li>breakouts so far, but</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel amazingly soft and silky without making me overly oily.  </li>
            <li>but it has no adverse effects as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>Since it is an oil I thought it would be greasy but far from it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the oil on my face to get rid of wrinkles and some adult acne</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>well enough but without a real organic certification</li>
            <li>This rosehip oil is soft, silky and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>and I needed a product that was natural that will help me with my surgical scars.  </li>
            <li>She has been using it for a couple of days and also has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but so far I think it will work out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was sold this item at a considerable discount to review it</li>
            <li>This oil makes my skin feel really really soft and not greasy</li>
            <li>(even though I have naturally oily skin and acne).</li>
            <li>but so far that hasn&#x27;t happened.  </li>
            <li>Seeing noticeable lightening of old scars in about 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a very generous size and will last me quite some time.  </li>
            <li>all ingredients into roller ball to use to help heal &amp; lighten old scars.</li>
            <li>Has no improvement so far over 2 weeks..</li>
            <li>The quantity and quality far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have scars from adult acne</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY ORGANIC.</li>
            <li>I used this in a face mask that I made and afterwards my skin felt both soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I use it at night on my face, and when I wake up, it feels really soft.  </li>
            <li>, she was surprised.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My plan is to go all natural.</li>
            <li>See how it works for everything else over time, but so far I am Amazed.</li>
            <li>’s brimming with natural nutrients and vitamins and can be used on hair skin and nails,and is also used in aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that the company comes up with a pump for the top rather than the dropper because the dropper is messy and gets oil all over my table.</li>
            <li>So far, the oil seems light and unscented - it says that it takes a few months to see results, so we&#x27;ll see.  </li>
            <li>Everything came nicely packed and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li>The oil I received looked, smelled, tasted, and absorbed into the skin EXACTLY like plain canola oil!  </li>
            <li>It has a light nutty smell, no strong odor letting me use this on my face during the night.</li>
            <li>I spent hours looking at various brands and hundreds of reviews and this has turned out to be so worth the time!  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend trying this to see if it works for you in place of your typical nighttime moisturizer - unlike commercial moisturizers, this is organic and pure and free of chemicals/preservatives.</li>
            <li>I got this for her because I wanted to make her a special hand cream to heal the cracks in her hands from them constantly being wet.</li>
            <li>By the way I am over 50 yrs old and it seems to be very healing for dry skin, wrinkles, and increases suppleness.</li>
            <li>Rosehip seed oil is a light amber color, with a light, subtle, slightly earthy &amp; nutty scent.</li>
            <li>I was curious if it would smell like roses, but it actually doesn&#x27;t really have much scent.</li>
            <li>The Rosehip seed oil is a light amber color, with a light, subtle, slightly earthy &amp; nutty scent.</li>
            <li>I think in four weeks I will be back to normal.</li>
            <li>I actually rubbed this oil right into my scalp as well as putting it on the dry ends after showering.  </li>
            <li>With my mom hitting 60 she was looking for something that would work for her that wasn’t heavy and even would possibly help diminish fine lines around her eyes.</li>
            <li>Pure 4 Oz - Certified Organic Cold Pressed Highest Quality Rose Hip Seed Oil</li>
            <li>it is huge compared to the standard little ones.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and actually moisturizes a little bit.</li>
            <li>I tried from high end like La Praire, SKII to all natural {Weleda) With no clear winner.</li>
            <li>However, there is absolutely no tell-tale rosehip oil scent and upon application it lacks the unique &#x27;dry&#x27; oil feel of rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>This is my new discovery for my daily skin care now.</li>
            <li>They are my new go-to place for essential oil.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t accomplish what I needed it for so can&#x27;t really say whether good or bad.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and for some reason one leg will end up with &amp;#34;razor bumps&amp;#34; and be extremely itchy while the other leg will be completely fine.</li>
            <li>For a one-ounce bottle of organic essential oils, you could take out a second mortgage on your house at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>It is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines.</li>

            <li>The oil has no scent and has a clear, slightly yellow color.</li>
            <li>I had several patches of discoloration and old acne scars and within a week of using this product I started to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>no regrets quicklyrics refunded (:</li>
            <li>It barely has any smell.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER this may be because I no longer use detergent to wash my face, and I&#x27;m letting my natural oil layer come back to life to protect my skin.</li>
            <li>However, I still adore this oil and how soft it left my face and hands.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to restore the natural color of my lips, after suffering an allergic reaction to Colgate Total toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I googled natural methods and Rosehip oil came up in several searches.</li>
            <li>I have heard a lot of back and forth about the scent but for me I can barely smell it and it&#x27;s similar to olive oil smell only much weaker.</li>
            <li>I fully expect to be seeing results within a few more weeks because this brand hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li>My summer is high in humidity, thus my skin doesn&#x27;t get really dry.</li>
            <li>you’ve suffered from skin conditions like Psoriasis, Dermatitis or the more common Eczema, it moisturizes and heals those dry, flaky spots and helps aid your skin in healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oil is surprisingly not greasy and absorbs into the skin easily.</li>
            <li>I have a combination type of skin and some parts of, my skin were oily yet dehydrated, and other parts flaky and now my skin is much smoother, softer, and plumper.</li>
            <li>Thick and rich.</li>
            <li>I was initially wary of it since I have combination, acne-prone skin that gets oily throughout the day, and knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive</li>
            <li>Pure&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil is the highest quality there is - cold pressed, 100% pure , organic, certified no additive, or fillers and fresh.</li>
            <li>At first I did purge a little</li>
            <li>Works great and makes my skin soft and helps keep them nasty tiny wrinkles at bay and its a pure natural product which is a BIG plus.</li>
            <li>Then I would cleanse my face with raw honey right after.</li>
            <li>It is very lax and does not simply sit on your skin when applied, like other oils.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my damp hair, scrunch it well to distribute thtoughout the strands and wrap it with a hot towel.</li>
            <li>The bottle is glass and very thick and strong, and it comes with an eye dropper which can replace the cap.</li>
            <li>The texture of this oil is slightly viscous without being thick or greasy on your skin, and it has a pretty golden color.</li>
            <li>but I believe I suffer from very minor dermatitis and this completely rids me of that.</li>
            <li>My family has been using rosehip oil for a while now as a natural way to cure dry scalp.</li>
            <li>She has dry sensitive skin and when I apply Rosehip Oil to her skin it immediately hydrates her.</li>
            <li>It completely reversed my dry skin problem.</li>
            <li>I have been consistently applying this product to an acne scar on the side of my face, and although it has only been a few days, the scar is noticeably beginning to fade away.</li>
            <li>I am not new to oils, and have used (and DO use) other oils from Majestic Pure, however Rosehip Seed Oil was one that I had never tried.</li>
            <li>I can grow my nails, but they are very weak and always break, and of course always at the most inopportune moments when I don&#x27;t have nail clippers or a nail file to correct the issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 yearold female who has been struggled with very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a good smell but it turned out not so bad.</li>

            <li> I love the combo of rose hip oil and jojoba oil because jojoba oil on its own is too greasy for my skin, rose hip oil penetrates much deeper into the skin but</li>

            <li> have been using the rose hip oil primarily on my nail beds to reduce cracking from the dryness of winter.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product when I am finished.</li>

            <li> I like to be able to smell like my perfume or body spray and was able to do so without the two fighting for attention in my nostrils.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference, except that it gave me more some pimples.</li>

            <li> It has faded most of them.</li>
            <li> I love using it on my cuticles and any place where dryness is an issue.</li>
            <li> update my review after I&#x27;ve had more time to test it.</li>
            <li> made such a great addition!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to use the Rosehip oil for, but based on what the bottle said, I figured I&#x27;d try it out as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However, after a week of use, I noticed I have a lot more break outs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it says it would be good for brittle nails, I thought it might be useful to use on my hair.</li>
            <li> and I love they way</li>
            <li> I love that this oil is organic and comes with a dropper.</li>
            <li> , it has so many uses and works</li>
            <li> After a week of using this rose hip oil directly on my face after showering my skin has never looked better!!  </li>
            <li> It is very rich in vitamins and antioxidants.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this, so a good bit came out the first time.  </li>
            <li> Used in my face serum and left face nicely moisturized without being greasy and no breakouts!!</li>
            <li> Was really excited to try this product discounted because of my skin issues!</li>
            <li> I love the dropper because it makes for more precise application.</li>
            <li> I like to add rose absolute to it for a rose scent.</li>

            <li> I wanted to love this oil because it&#x27;s a fantastic value</li>
            <li> If you want to moisturize your lips, shea butter is the best possible balm I&#x27;ve found (mix it with powdered stevia extract and peppermint or sweet orange oil for flavor and sweetness.)</li>
            <li> I love the way they packaged this bottle, securely and in a box.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is great stuff.  </li>
            <li> I really had no clue at all the things that Rosehip Oil is good for.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li> I very light, clean iteration of this oil.</li>
            <li> Other than that, perfect and would buy it again from this seller!</li>
            <li> I use the oil as a carrier for other oils and it works great!</li>
            <li> The original is a lot more orange then what this company has produced.</li>
            <li> they kept me aware of shipping as well as checking if I enjoyed product !</li>
            <li> I added a little of my favorite smell and now it&#x27;s perfect...</li>
            <li> Mixes easily with my coconut and almond oils.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well, but absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is also great mixed with coconut oil and shea butter (with a dash of mint, my favorite scent) as a lotion.</li>
            <li> It melts into the skin so easily and does not leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> and it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> It arrived appearing to be packaged well; however, the top was loosened and some oil got out and required clean up.</li>
            <li> I really love the packaging which is a solid, brown glass with a great weight to it.</li>
            <li> bottle is HUGE and was filled to the top.</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong aroma</li>
            <li> This oil in particular is really good for skin, hair and nails.</li>
            <li> I now use rosehip oil from majestic pure and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> The glass packaging insures that the oil is kept cool and fresh and toxin free and the dropper works great to measure the right amount of oil needed.</li>

            <li> they are great for skin problems and just general moisture.</li>
            <li> is my first time trying rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip seed oil is moisturizing and used for a variety of skin conditions including dermatitis, acne, and eczema; for sunburned skin; for hydrating aging skin; and for smoothing fine lines and fine wrinkles in aging skin and helping to even skin tone; and for treating brittle nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fine wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fine wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil can also be used for scars, fine lines, wrinkles, and even brittle nails.</li>
            <li> No scent, which is fine.</li>
            <li> I am using it for fine lines on my face at night.  </li>
            <li> Is it light amber in color, has the consistence of an olive oil, but soaks easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works fine regardless of the color, but just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It helped improve fine lines, as well as the tone and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> , it is too soon to say if it is doing something on my fine lines, but I do like the way I look when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> It glides smoothly onto the skin soaking in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Love this oil for my face, absorbs quickly and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> The oil is quickly absorbed on dry and parched areas of the skin, leaving an exquisite silky feel.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and super manageable and looks really really great with this treatment.</li>
            <li> This Majestic&#x60;s Pure Rose Hip, does not have a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am loving the oils from Majestic Pure.</li>

            <li> While I can&#x27;t yet speak to the efficacy of the oil, customer service is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li> If the oil works as well as customer service, it&#x27;s going to be fantastic.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get the Leven Rose brand (available on Amazon) or order from Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>

            <li> Initially, I really liked it as a face moisturizer because it was lightweight, didn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy or filmy, and there wasn&#x27;t much of a smell.</li>
            <li> So far, so good ...</li>
            <li> so far loving  results :)</li>
            <li> so I would feel good giving this as a gift has a natural but upscale look.</li>
            <li> I will be honest and say that so far it hasn&#x27;t helped it but it does make my skin feel better</li>
            <li> Awesome on the dry skin but a little oily when first put on and the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li> I have had some Rosehip leave a greasy feeling after rubbing it into my skin, but this one soaks right into my skin and gives me a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> My cuticles looked better right away.</li>
            <li> Also great for cuticle before and after a pedicure :) there are many uses for this oil, and I will update if I find that it works any specific wonders as I use it for new things.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Majestic Pure&#x27;s line!</li>
            <li> This is a smooth clean oil with no order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thank you for a quality product, easy ordering and quickly delivering.</li>
            <li> not this particular rose hip oil.  </li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is such a great ingredient to ad to your beauty routine because it offers so many benefits!</li>
            <li> It made my face smooth and it absorbed very quickly</li>
            <li> Such an amazing versatile product!</li>
            <li> But this product is a big four ounces and comes with its own dropper!</li>
            <li> I am already seeing a softening of them and more suppleness to my stomach; I have been using it for about three weeks but even the first time I put it on my stomach</li>
            <li> (  if i dont use rich oily products my skin fels thight and uncomfortobale.</li>
            <li> It soothed his face and the redness was significantly reduced by morning.</li>
            <li> Their prices are unbelievable and the quality is truly impressive.</li>
            <li> There are so many glowing reviews on this, but I just wanted to add what I felt was significant after trying this oil for a month: Really does minimize stretch marks!  </li>
            <li> I repurchase the original oil and something is off here.</li>
            <li> but once this bottle is up I will repurchase through them since its significantly cheaper then what I had been using.</li>
            <li> majestic pure has such a wonderful rosehip essential oil as well as many others!</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not that easy to be  absorbed.</li>
            <li> It comes with an easy to use dropper which is really useful.</li>
            <li> It feels light and nongreasy on the skin, seeming to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> and it got absorbed easily and within mins</li>
            <li> I put 3 drops on my clean hands and pat it on my face twice a day</li>
            <li> Makes a great moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far!</li>
            <li> It goes smooth on the skin, and absorbs quickly, leaving skin soft and smooth, however, it tends to break out on my face, but it works fine with my cuticles, so I decided to use it for my cuticles for the most part.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to try it on many other things its good for.</li>
            <li> The other 2 brands were a nice warm amber color.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s 100% pure and organic.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for the Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil</li>
            <li> Specially on your face.</li>
            <li> I run out and also try out more products from magestic pure.</li>
            <li> I would just google it and see if it&#x27;s right for you!</li>
            <li> The serum is fantastic, but the dropper leaks way too much!!</li>
            <li> Super Fresh Taste !</li>
            <li> Seems to be pretty good stuff so far.</li>
            <li> I love how the rose oil absorbs into my skin without feeling oily and my skin feels hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is my absolute favorite moisturizer for my face, hair and body.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a natural nice scent.</li>
            <li> It makes a bit of time to be absorbed but leaves your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Full of vitamins etc.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for a bit longer use to reap full benefits.</li>
            <li> My skin glows creamy with a gentle rosey-ness, and a dewey youthful rounding out of my more angular features is taking place.</li>
            <li> , compare effects against the outcomes of different products, arrive at conclusions that are fair and balanced.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Love this Rosehip Oil and it&#x27;s very generous for the price</li>

            <li> .. Makes you feel really cool</li>
            <li> and I love that it absorbs so fast</li>

            <li> Overall, very impressed with this product, its many uses, and its overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by Majestic Pure for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> This oil is non-greasy, light weight and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> I was super excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li> two weeks -- because this thing OXIDIZED QUICKLY because of the bottling.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin so quickly.</li>

            <li> Will return later on and give a more thorough review after using this product some more.</li>
            <li> My skin loves the oil and quickly absorbs it, leaving no greasy feelings.</li>
            <li> Due to my acne outbreaks on my face, I always have this scar from old acne that leaves marks in my face that is not suppose to be there if you want a beautiful healthy skin.</li>
            <li> So many uses - highly</li>
            <li> I continue to use the oil nightly right out of the shower and it keeps it nice and soft as well as the skin around it.</li>
            <li> I own several Majestic Pure products and they have always provided me with top customer service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noticed a difference in my appearance the very first night I put it on before bed and woke in the morning.</li>
            <li> Apparently it is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes predominately grown in Chile.</li>
            <li> I am using it to mix with my essential oil recipes and and very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> :/&lt;br /&gt;I have enclosed a photo of the original rose hip oil I have been using since my surgery, the product in question and then regular vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> My nail beds are so healthy and they look &#x27;normal&#x27; again.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this oil and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> Feels good after long sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> Every scent of Majectic Pure essential oil that I have tried has been amazing!</li>
            <li> We used the oil mostly on our hands and they feel like new again.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was very happy to see that the label on the bottle not only gave clear and easy directions about how to use the oil, but also has a list of many other uses for the oil too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and absorbs into the skin easily.</li>
            <li> bottle is also a pretty good size so for me personally it&#x27;ll last for quite awhile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild success with the non-scented vanocream lotion on</li>
            <li> It goes easy and  and absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li> For The First Time Ever !</li>
            <li> Since it comes specifically from only one kind of rose it makes it just a little more special.  </li>
            <li> It leave my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and super healthy looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also have been using on some dry skin areas on my forehead and it has left no residue, absorbs perfectly.</li>
            <li> It leave my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and super healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Majestic</li>
            <li> you have a large collection of special products for your special issues.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if Majestic Pure replaces it for free.</li>
            <li> Pure with a light aroma.  </li>
            <li> Huge upside to this product is that it is a very generous size (4 ounces) for the price, so I can apply it liberally and use it as an all-over serum rather than a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face in the morning light and very absorbent</li>
            <li> Overall, this is an amazing oil that will help moisturize your face, body and hair.</li>
            <li> How can it smooth skin thats crepey or wrinklyish so fast?</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.  </li>
            <li> For moisture I use this Rosehip oil in combination with Argan oil and lavender, rose, frankincense and turmeric essential oils.</li>
            <li> Rosehip Seed Oil has powerful properties to help regenerate and brighten skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just got into using these oils but this is by far my favorite brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> was using jojoba oil as my night time moisturizer, but have since learned about rose hip&#x27;s benefits from my beauty vlogger friends, and i will never look back!</li>
            <li> We like that this oil is natural and organic, safe to use.  </li>
            <li> Nice to use on skin, especially for massage.</li>
            <li> this product is more of an light yellow!</li>
            <li> I feel it is worth the try.</li>
            <li> , never have I ever come across a product that I&#x27;ve put on my face that has had such astounding results.</li>
            <li> She loves how soft it is making her skin, she has a lot o sun damage and used to smoke so anything that works for her she is in love with.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two different brands of rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> product is not cold pressed as advertised  </li>
            <li> It has improved the look of several of my scars and reduced their visibility quite nicely.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and moisturised.</li>
            <li> Rather, the oil is quickly absorbed and the skin is moisturized within minutes.</li>
            <li> By far the most valuable of all the essential oils I own.</li>
            <li> I must say that the price is really worth it.</li>
            <li> What a nice big size!</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels after I use the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was a dropper top provided in the box.</li>
            <li> It can be used for naturally toning skin, moisturizing, sunburn, wrinkles and much more.</li>
            <li> Currently, I mix it with my jojoba oil (5 drops, rose hip oil 2-3 drops) in the evening.</li>
            <li> So for me at the moment I have to say is worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it for my hair and now my hair is so soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it 💟</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for the very dry skin around my eyes, and it really doesn&#x27;t have a smell, soaks in nicely, gives a nice (not greasy) dewy glow, and does the moisturizing job as it should.</li>
            <li> , I need extra rich creamy oily stuff since my skin is dry-ish even more so in winter &amp;#62;&#x3D;</li>
            <li> i used this along side some other essential oils and the results were wonderful!</li>
            <li> The rosehip is the fruit of the rose plant and is formed after successful pollination of flowers in spring or early summer, and ripens in late summer through autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gotten other oils from this company before and absolutely loved them.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because the dropper is not well made it just comes right out</li>
            <li> Works well on the face for moisture and on hands right after washing them.</li>
            <li> because I just purchased it, however I can say as of right now the oil is not greasy if I use right amount on my face.</li>
            <li> I took that sticker off and placed it right on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this comes in a huge 4 oz bottle that will last for a very long time, so it is a great value as well.</li>
            <li> Not sure if rose hip oil can prevent stretch marks since some say it&#x27;s mostly genetics</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip Seed Oil is particularly high in Vitamin C and is one of the richest plant sources of Vitamin C available.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin, and leaves my skin feeling so soft, and smooth after applying.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it comes out too fast and you can easily use to much.</li>
            <li> Good size bottle, mild scent, fast absorbing, long shelf life.</li>
            <li> The scent is intense, sweet and floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In general the yellower it is the better it is.  </li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a product discount however my reviews remain honest</li>
            <li> Rose Hip Seed Oil is Known to Heal and lighten minor to severe stretch marks and scars, firms the skin, and keeps the skin hydrated and supple.</li>
            <li> This oil is Amazing for curing cracked skin on your heels because of dryness, it also works wonders with dry and itchy scalp.</li>

            <li> Just a few drops are the perfect facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about this all natural product.</li>
            <li> The product and the customer service far exceeds my expectations, what I really like most is the helpful leaflet describing the uses for the oils.</li>
            <li> A nice light oil with no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> I found this price to be very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Very fast service.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil is quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing to gain by leaving a positive review, this is simply the my honest thoughts with it.</li>
            <li> So since Rosehip Oil is suppose to be good on skin I decided to use a little bit on my leg and man</li>
            <li> I did use an exfoliate first and then apply the rosehip oil</li>
            <li> It comes safety sealed with the regular top in place and</li>
            <li> Many are home remedies and such that are beneficial to your health.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really helps with my eczema!</li>
            <li> The rosehip seed oil has lightened up some facial discolorations and seems to be making my skin tone more</li>
            <li> The rosehip seed oil has lightened up some facial discolorations and seems to be making my skin tone more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really designed to make your house smell nice.</li>
            <li> I apply several drops to my face after my serum of choice (i.e. collagen, hyaluronic, retinol, vitamin C, etc.), and it absorbs beautifully, leaving absolutely no feeling of greasiness.  </li>
            <li> I am outdoors playing golf in hot weather</li>
            <li> This oil made them magically disappear after using them for several days.</li>
            <li> Very informative!</li>
            <li> and I love that they are availible in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s my first time using organic oil</li>
            <li> The oil was much softer to touch and absorbed well into the skin.</li>
            <li> but this is my first experience with  Rosehip oil &amp; I</li>

            <li> this is my first review...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another brand which seemed to be higher quality.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!!  </li>
            <li> and we know that is a benefit for so many issues from sun damage to preventing further problems so to be able to undo some damage as well as protect future damage</li>
            <li> Will probably need to transfer to smaller bottles with better delivery system.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the first one to use in my laundry soap I make at home as well as to put in the body wash and soaps I make from home as well.</li>

            <li> Thank you..;)</li>
            <li> I love that this product comes with a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Aside from the quality of the oil being above it&#x27;s competitors, I also really love this company because of the way they package their oils.</li>
            <li> For face/neck I put on the aloe first, then follow with a drop on finger smoothed on - drop on forehead, 1 on each side of face and 2 on neck.</li>
            <li> /felt in first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This particular brand is very light in color and free of odor unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have found that oils like this one can really soften the wrinkles and fine lines on your face.</li>
            <li> This bottle came sealed with a flat top cap and the dropper was wrapped separately,this is a nice option for those who prefer one over the other.</li>
            <li> I would never give anything other than my 100% honest opinion, and jeapordize my long-term beauty blog subscribers, or anyone else reading my reviews.</li>
            <li> this smells so good, and really works well, used a little on my scars and it has helped of lightening the redness.</li>

            <li> Cheaper than other rosehip oils I&#x27;ve bought in the past but not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>

            <li> I used the Rosehip oil on my fianc&amp;eacute; for his surgical scars and watched them turn from bright pink to white before my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested a few different types of rosehip oils and this is a great quality oil.</li>

            <li> I really didn&#x27;t get to use it that much yet..</li>
            <li> With art naturals I used up the whole bottle in a year</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to rub it anywhere - it&#x27;s light enough in texture that it spreads really well.</li>
            <li> I use this oil when my skin needs real moisture.  </li>
            <li> The rosehip oil got to me fast without any problems...</li>
            <li> this is a miracle oil coz it made my scars lightened ani made my skin much brighter.</li>
            <li> This company was very conscientious about selling their products and service.  </li>
            <li> really just depends on how much you use and how you use it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It will really condition and heal the skin.</li>

            <li> Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash (Morning and Night</li>
            <li> I have been using this on a surgery scar, and the area is so much softer already.</li>
            <li> I put too much on one day and by the evening my hair was a bit greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It shipped very promptly.</li>
            <li> It has just helped so much.</li>
            <li> I use it in my whole Body and really like how it feels.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the quality of the oil.</li>
            <li> I used it last night as a night serum and this morning as a moisturizer and my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used essential oils that are light and absorb well...but</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS MIRACLES.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about how it worked on my problem areas as of yet</li>
            <li> To me the seller was very considerate in including a dropper in the box with the oil.</li>
            <li> Really, it feels like a liquid, and absorbs like a water based, not oil based.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 24), and it didn&#x27;t help out much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really can see results to skin tone/texture within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just apply a couple of drops of the oil onto your fingertips using the dropper provided and gently rub into the area you want to use it on.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> This is really.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to to the job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all, unless you really put your nose to the bottle.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and she says they&#x27;ve really helped her complexion and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my moisturizer and love how fresh my face looks in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I see my stretch marks fading away slowly on my stomach and it has gotten smooth but it works better than cocoa butter ( from my experience)</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of twice daily application my skin is so soft and more glowing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is ok, but the shipping package was poor.  </li>
            <li> Also use it for stretchmarks over thighs and not sure if it is effective yet, too soon to see, but very hopeful!</li>
            <li> I love to gently massage the oil into my face, as I can feel how soft it instantly makes my skin.</li>
            <li> made my own DYI facial serum with this along with some essential oils.</li>
            <li> I store my rose hip oil in the fridge and take it out every morning and evening to get a few drops.</li>
            <li> Awesome oil, exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to look like (light honey color) not much of a smell though like some other rosehip oils I have order in the past</li>
            <li> This oil is very useful for a lot of skin problem especially your face.</li>
            <li> A wonderful hydrator full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, restore skin elasticity, and boost collagen production, all while reducing scars and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am glad I receive a sample of rosehip oil because my skin was feeling rough and quite dry due to my cleansing products, but this oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> The differences i&#x27;ve noticed since using this in such a short period of time are nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying using it by itself and by adding drops to other creams and lotions I use.</li>
            <li> I love this Rosehip Oil, I had other brand before</li>
            <li> Unlike some other reviews, there&#x27;s also no awful smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it for the the dry skin, works much better than other products I tried for that.</li>
            <li> I use the oil cleansing method and alternate that with honey to clean my face.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better everyday, and I don&#x27;t even have to wear as much foundation/concealer as I did before, and I JUST started this regimen!</li>
            <li> so I can not comment on the long term effects but the short term benefits are amazing.</li>
            <li> It was grease less , so I was able to wear a white light weight sweater over it with ease.</li>
            <li> My dry skin soaks it right up leaving me with silky smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li> I thought the Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil was thick, absorbed well into my skin, and I like the Holistic Value of Rosehip Oil on my Skin the most.</li>
            <li> Rose hip seed oil is a dry oil, when you put it on there should be no grease left.</li>
            <li> I have used in on my dry ends of my hair, on my face around my eyes to decrease fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love essential oils and the proper glass eye droppedlr that was included is Mich appreciated.  </li>
            <li> I also love how it as helped lighten up my dark spots.</li>
            <li> It is an incredibly versatile product that can be used as an acne treatment, facial toner, daily moisturizer, scar/blemish treatment, and makeup remover, to name a few.</li>
            <li> Just with the first application I could feel how soft my skin can be.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil as a sample for review and evaluation and so far I really like it!</li>
            <li> I really like knowing it is 100% Pure and Natural.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to the idea of using so many different oils for skin hair and nails, so I&#x27;m still trying to navigate and experiment with all different uses for all kinds of oils.</li>
            <li> but so far I am enjoying the oil and prefer using this over other oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Majestic Pure also offers a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.</li>
            <li> It is also 100% pure and natural.  </li>

            <li> Face much improved in only first week.</li>
            <li> I am not young and my skin is vastly smoother and somehow better.</li>
            <li> These are issues the girls are facing as their bodies blossom into young womanhood, and it would be nice to have natural treatments on hand instead of harsh chemical cleansers and compounds.</li>
            <li> The oil is a nice thick consistency not runny or drippy.</li>
            <li> The 4 ounce bottle is enough for all of my needs right now and the dropper makes measuring a breeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so possessed right now with using essential oils.</li>
            <li> Okay, it is supposed to be 100% pure Rosehip Oil, but there is no rose scent at all.  </li>
            <li> Like the other products within this company, these bottles are huge.</li>
            <li> bottle of Rosehip Seed Oil is very potent, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any new results in the lightening of my scars yet</li>
            <li> And now we all live with a fear of the damage that is to come.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always acquiring new scars.</li>
            <li> Not to any HUGE degree, like facial fillers would, but my skin around my mouth just looks smoother and the lines not as deep.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry fairly quick which I like because I don&#x27;t want it all over my clothes.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago to help out my super dry skin</li>
            <li> I use this around my cuticles because they are so super dry and the winter has done a number on them.</li>
            <li> It also has a very soft scent.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend using natural oils.</li>
            <li> If not, you can just make sure there&#x27;s very little in there</li>
            <li> Because it is so gentle, Rosehip Seed Oil can be used as a serum to the face after cleansing, as a general body oil to soften and rejuvenate skin, and to nourish hair.</li>
            <li> I took off 1 star only because of the dropper which I made seller aware of and they are looking into it.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using it in cold-process soap to make a facial bar to suit my exact needs.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty big 7 inch scar and this is what I use on it.</li>
            <li> keep your skin young with this!  </li>

            <li> I have recently seen some facial recipes that call for rosehip oil so am excited to try those out.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this rosehip oil as well as the majestic pure line of essential oils!</li>
            <li> It gets very messy, and the oil just slides out of the dropper without having to squeeze the top.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for the past week and its made a noticeable difference in breakage and has given me a really nice shine.</li>
            <li> Mix this with some Lavender oil on my dry cracked hands and they instantly felt smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It smells a bit pungent for some, but I find, because I am using it topically and in smaller areas, the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin right now on my hands</li>
            <li> The product is in a very generous container, a little goes a long way, it seems as the skin absorbs it pretty quick.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The large bottle of therapeutic grade Rosehip Seed Oil contains 4 fluid ounces.</li>
            <li> Also I have purchased several products from Majestic Pure and can attest to their quality.  </li>
            <li> Get yourself this big 4oz bottle from Majestic Pure and google rosehip...</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure is definitely one of my FAVS!</li>
            <li> I have replaced all my commercial lotions with this 100% pure natural oil.</li>
            <li> I love that this may reverse some of that and make my skin a little younger looking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times I have over used the oil by using the standard little bottles.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s pregnant and she uses this oil because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the cocoa butter and all the other oils for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, because I loved what Majestic Pure&#x27;s rosehip oil had done for my skin the first time around.</li>
            <li> This is a great sized bottle at 4 oz, it&#x27;s cold pressed and organic too, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t clear out my acne marks -- which what I was aiming for.</li>
            <li> My product is almost clear and has no discernible smell.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s early, but I was so amazed by result</li>
            <li> It is all natural.</li>
            <li> Completely healed my sunburn in as little&lt;</li>
            <li> the oil makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin so soft, and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have old stretch marks on my stomach and while they may never go away</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin sooo soft.</li>
            <li> When ever I happen to get a pimple this really helps my skin to heal quicker and remove the redness left on my face from the pimple.</li>
            <li> and we were pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Organic completely.</li>
            <li> So far keep the skin moisturized and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: It really reduces the size of open pores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for some months now on my body and in my baths and my skin is soft and no ash appearance.  </li>
            <li> My nails have a natural shine to them now.</li>
            <li> I even applied my foundation directly after and it didn&#x27;t make my foundation oily.</li>
            <li> This oil feels so soft on my skin</li>
            <li> breakouts so far, but</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazingly soft and silky without making me overly oily.  </li>
            <li> but it has no adverse effects as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Since it is an oil I thought it would be greasy but far from it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil on my face to get rid of wrinkles and some adult acne</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> well enough but without a real organic certification</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is soft, silky and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> and I needed a product that was natural that will help me with my surgical scars.  </li>
            <li> She has been using it for a couple of days and also has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but so far I think it will work out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was sold this item at a considerable discount to review it</li>
            <li> This oil makes my skin feel really really soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> (even though I have naturally oily skin and acne).</li>
            <li> but so far that hasn&#x27;t happened.  </li>
            <li> Seeing noticeable lightening of old scars in about 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a very generous size and will last me quite some time.  </li>
            <li> all ingredients into roller ball to use to help heal &amp; lighten old scars.</li>
            <li> Has no improvement so far over 2 weeks..</li>
            <li> The quantity and quality far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have scars from adult acne</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> I used this in a face mask that I made and afterwards my skin felt both soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I use it at night on my face, and when I wake up, it feels really soft.  </li>
            <li> , she was surprised.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My plan is to go all natural.</li>
            <li> See how it works for everything else over time, but so far I am Amazed.</li>
            <li> ’s brimming with natural nutrients and vitamins and can be used on hair skin and nails,and is also used in aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is that the company comes up with a pump for the top rather than the dropper because the dropper is messy and gets oil all over my table.</li>

            <li> I use it in the humidifier, laundry detergents, and add a few drop in my bath.</li>
            <li> I will use the rest of the bottle in the name of beauty and  waste not want not</li>

            <li> and/or use a few drops on damp skin after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like to use the dropper to target small dark spots around my face and avoid my oily t-zone.</li>
            <li> Of course, I was skeptical about using it on my face because I have sensitive skin, but this product has not caused an adverse reaction to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even put a few drops in the bath just to soak.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy.  </li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of Rosehip Oil and Jojoba Oil and rub on after cleaning and toning my face.</li>

            <li> A few drops in shampoo does</li>
            <li> This Rosehip is 4oz&#x27;s, and I like using a few drops in my Tub with some Epson Salt while I soak.  </li>
            <li> At a few drops at a time, I imagine this is practically a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> She loves this and finds that its not to heavy and doesn’t clog her pores which is something that she was concerned with.</li>
            <li> I also mix a few drops in with Moroccan oil I use on hair.</li>
            <li> I also used a few drops on my hands; it seemed no matter what cream or lotion</li>
            <li> Been using it a few months now</li>
            <li> Not too heavy for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I also like to put a few droplets on my fingertips and run them through my hair.</li>
            <li> Just pull up a few drops of oil.  </li>
            <li> Crows feet that I&#x27;ve had for years, which I&#x27;ve applied both every all-natural hippie formulation or synthetic serum on, are now almost gone within less than a week of using this product twice a day (now I&#x27;m bumping it up to 3 times a day!)</li>
            <li> I am so excited to watch my scar disappear because I hate wearing make up during the Summer months.</li>
            <li> rosehip oil was surprisingly not greasy as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The smell is not fantastic, but I can look (smell?) past that.</li>
            <li> This is a very messy oil...or maybe it is the dropper that makes it messy.  </li>
            <li> I have to use very little lotion whereas before I would have to lotion up twice before even putting on clothes.  </li>
            <li> There is very little smell-</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying hard to reduce the number of products that I use everyday.</li>
            <li> Indian Healing Clay ( I should probably use this twice a week, but I&#x27;m lazy, so I use this around the time I&#x27;m getting my period.</li>
            <li> The description says that it helps fade stretch marks, small or severe..</li>
            <li> These are two things I was not able to take care of in the past, instead of scraping off the cracked skin on my heels</li>
            <li> I usually mix with jojoba oil (you can use by itself) after a layer of moisturizer gel/ cream after shower.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad as other reviews stated, actually, I barely can smell anything after applying to my hands.</li>
            <li> but alas, it is not like any other rosehip oil I have used.  </li>
            <li> But this one, the majestic pure brand disappointed me.</li>
            <li> so i usually have to add baby oil (which dont always work either) or Vaseline (which leave thick caked on feeling to skin)</li>
            <li> My cuticles are hardly even visible now.</li>
            <li> Sadly I have very very dry skin around my eyes, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had since I was 18</li>
            <li> This thing is delicate.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> It came bubble wrapped in a thick cardboard box, so there was no chance of spillage or leakage upon delivery.</li>
            <li> I mean, you name it</li>
            <li> That annoying facial hair growth is slowed by the turmeric oil dramatically and I have much less redness.</li>
            <li> Hope I find something that will last and not go bad.</li>
            <li> Like you have to open it, to use the squeezing thing which exposes it in the air WHICH IS BAD.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s from a cut, scrape or some other crazy accident</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know if it is helping or not, as I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but trusting from the reviews of others, that it will make a difference!</li>
            <li> say it has a nasty smell honestly it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very confusing.</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and sometimes split, when I rub the oil on the nails they feel hydrated.  </li>
            <li> However, my glass dropper came broken in the package...</li>
            <li> It is not a great quality dropper.  </li>
            <li> The seller responded to my concerns and stands behind the product, but as a consumer I would not recommend.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality, feels watery.</li>
            <li> The bottle is not a great, it is messy.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Wanted to stop using unhealthy chemical products since our skin absorbs everything.</li>
            <li> , I was disappointed because the long glass dropper that came with it was broken upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT expect this to smell of roses, in fact, this smell is not as bad as other&#x27;s I have sampled.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s base helps to enhance&lt;br /&gt;the penetration and absorption of other oils.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure why the bad reviews say its not.  </li>
            <li> This is Therapeutic Grade - just like expensive spas buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to control the amount of oil that comes out of it, but you can always switch it out with another dropper if you have one.</li>
            <li> In my research, I saw some reviews complaining of a weird smell with rosehip oil - this one has zero smell.  </li>
            <li> But Dropper is useless: it just drips.</li>
            <li> very thin</li>
            <li> Also, my dropper was very poor quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that my dropper came broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After removing my makeup and cleaning my face before bedtime, I splash cold water on my face and leave moist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After removing my makeup and cleaning my face before bedtime, I splash cold water on my face and leave moist.</li>
            <li> I will re-order again before cold</li>
            <li> I was afraid the oil would make my face break out</li>
            <li> and it never went bad.</li>
            <li> it smells so bad (fish)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why does a lot of reviews talking how bad the smell is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in need of a way to reduce the ugly scars that come out of it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smell horrible , like stale .</li>
            <li> Who needs a million expensive beauty products and cleansers when all you need is coconut oil and rosehip oil!!</li>
            <li> Well I had a baby 2 years ago, and like an idiot, I never rubbed lotion or Shea butter on my baby bump to prevent my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> We never used Rosehip oil before but after this brutal northeast winter our skin needed some TLC.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst smell</li>
            <li> Nothing bad in it at all!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The serum is fantastic, but the dropper leaks way too much!!</li>
            <li> Good price for this product.</li>
            <li> My mom is a nurse so she is always washing her hands. I got this for her because I wanted to make her a special hand cream to heal the cracks in her hands from them constantly being wet. I simply mixed this with some Shea butter, coconut oil, lavender oil, and jojoba oil. She now swears by my concoction and in a matter of 2 weeks her hands are the softest they&#x27;ve been in years, she says. I chose to add rosehip oil because it is known to soften and heal dry cracked skin. I find the rosehip oil has more of an earthy scent not like a bouquet of roses like I&#x27;d imagined. The 4 ounce bottle is enough for all of my needs right now and the dropper makes measuring a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Love organic rose hip oil for my face, body and hair!!!</li>
            <li> Good size bottle, mild scent, fast absorbing, long shelf life. Great for kitchen cosmetics.  Discounted sample received for review.  Note: Rosehip Oil isn&#x27;t supposed to smell like roses.  It has sort of a nutty aroma.</li>
            <li> Excellent, i used many oil to get soft skin, but this Rosehip oil is the best one.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil is a great carrier for my essential oils.  It is virtuously scentless and has a silky texture to it.  It is easily absorbed into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.  I have noticed that since I have been putting it in my hair on the dry ends that my nails are also appearing to be stronger.  I have used in on my dry ends of my hair, on my face around my eyes to decrease fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest improvement that I have seen is on my chest and neck, I had terribly dry skin skin and the wrinkles were starting.  I did use an exfoliate first and then apply the rosehip oil and my skin sucked it in.  I can tell that the dryness has receded and the wrinkles are starting to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a large 4 ounce bottle and you only need a small amount for each application, this bottle will last forever.  It comes safety sealed with the regular top in place and the dropper portion is separately bubble wrapped, it also comes in a sturdy box.</li>
            <li> Probably the only &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used that my skin actually absorbs in the twenty years I&#x27;ve started caring about taking care of my face. Takes about 20 minutes after applying, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sit on top&amp;#34; of my skin like everything else I&#x27;ve ever tried as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticed a difference in my appearance the very first night I put it on before bed and woke in the morning. Although, I did mix it with a tiny bit of Vitamin C powder. Finally, I&#x27;ve found a natural moisturizer that works for me on my tough skin.</li>
            <li> From using on the ends of my hair, skin, finger nails to helping aid in a little sunburn (FL gal here) this Rosehip Oil is perfect.  Nice bottle and dropper also makes it easy to put in my hands.  I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin, finger nails or hair.</li>
            <li> I use Rosehip oil for my face and arms, and this brand is such a great product! I have had some Rosehip leave a greasy feeling after rubbing it into my skin, but this one soaks right into my skin and gives me a refreshing feeling. It also has a very soft scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rosehip seed oil for a year now and have done a fair amount of research as to how it should look and what the consistency should be. I ordered this brand recently because I thought I&#x27;d try another brand. I sent it back. The color was extremely light and the consistency was thin. It looked nothing like what I&#x27;ve used before, and oddly enough, it looked nothing like what the woman reviews in the video.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is amazing! Rosehip seed oil is my absolute favorite moisturizer for my face, hair and body. It brightens my complexion and is great for anti aging! It is so lightweight and absorbs very quickly! This oil is very high quality and smells great! I love that it&#x27;s 100% pure and organic. It is a huge bottle so it will last me forever but I will definitely be repurchasing when I finally run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 yearold female who has been struggled with very dry sensitive skin. I tried from high end like La Praire, SKII to all natural {Weleda) With no clear winner. Specially that time the month, my face becomes all red, flaky,  dry, thick, itchy and breakout along the chin line. I deceide to try rosehip oil for even tone (because sun spot too) and chamomile oil for clamming effect. I used one dropperful of rosehip oil and 3-4  tiny dropps of chamomile essential oil mixed together in morning and evening for 2 days. I know it&#x27;s early, but I was so amazed by result I wanted share.  My skin looks and feels much clam and brighter And smells of oils are very soothing also.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday with lavender oil in my skin-care regimen and I&#x27;ve not had a blemish for about 8 years now. This is a good blend that I will probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I am so possessed right now with using essential oils. I have learned to save tons of money by making my own cleaning and household products, laundry detergent, soap, body sprays, body scrubs, hand sanitizers, air fresheners, fabric softener... I mean, you name it and you can probably find a recipe to make it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really great that there are so many out there and that each has some specific uses that they can be used for. Many are home remedies and such that are beneficial to your health.&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to receive the Rosehip Oil because it smells good and has many helpful uses. It is also 100% PURE and Certified ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> I bought it for My dandruff issue I had..it&#x27;s an excellent remedy for it..just apply it for half hour and wash...this is very light and it&#x27;s also being used for glowing skin..haven&#x27;t applied for long but it feels smooth ...I am loving it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Really helps with my eczema!</li>
            <li> This product smells awesome. I love that is smooth and silky when I apply it to my body. I have heard about the benefits of essential oils before, but never had the chance to try them. That&#x27;s why when I was given the chance to try and review this product, I jumped. It is all natural. It only takes a few drops to moisturize your skin, It also works for your hair. It makes it softer and smells great!</li>
            <li> Much lighter than I anticipated.  Mixes easily with my coconut and almond oils. LOVE the way it makes my hair and skin feel - without heaviness.</li>
            <li> Great healing oil with excellent moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;properties.  Completely healed my sunburn in as little&lt;br /&gt;as three days.  Soothed my chapped lips and eased&lt;br /&gt;my baby&#x27;s diaper rash.  Smells neutral and serves&lt;br /&gt;as a great carrier oil.  So it&#x27;s base helps to enhance&lt;br /&gt;the penetration and absorption of other oils.  It&lt;br /&gt;is known for it&#x27;s high vitamin C content which has&lt;br /&gt;aided in diminishing my stretch marks and acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this oil has been a life saver for me as it&lt;br /&gt;works for so many purposes from skin to hair and&lt;br /&gt;nutritional purposes.</li>
            <li> This Rosehip Oil smell so good.It&#x27;s so relaxing. I use it in the humidifier, laundry detergents, and add a few drop in my bath. Love it. Will recommend to friend and family.</li>
            <li> Great buy, great company, fast shipping. I was sent this product to test and give me experience, I LOVE IT!! it works amazing, no strong smell and bottled perfectly. Will by from this company for many years. Their products are great.</li>
            <li> If your make up area is like most of us.. you have a large collection of special products for your special issues. And I would bet that you don’t use half of them but won’t throw them away because they were expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying hard to reduce the number of products that I use everyday. Today you would see one bottle on the counter top, my rosehip oil. I am growing more fond of it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 4 ounce bottle is made from Cold-Pressed, Fresh and High Quality, No Additives or Fillers. Each bottle is free of parabens, artificial ingredients and fragrance oils. This oil is often used for aromatherapy, especially for aromatherapy skin care and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Hip Seed Oil is Known to Heal and lighten minor to severe stretch marks and scars, firms the skin, and keeps the skin hydrated and supple. Rose hip seed oil is known to work for a variety of skin conditions, including dermatitis, acne and eczema. Dry Skin will be replenished and revitalized. The appearance of Fine Lines are visibly diminished and skin looks brighter and more radiant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve suffered from skin conditions like Psoriasis, Dermatitis or the more common Eczema, it moisturizes and heals those dry, flaky spots and helps aid your skin in healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Pure also offers a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. I would suggest giving this product a run. I noticed that my flaky spots along my hairline were showing improvement within a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil with so many uses. It is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines. I add this to my skin routine. Great addition. Feels great to use on you face.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. My skin has never looked better. I use the oil cleansing method and alternate that with honey to clean my face. For moisture I use this Rosehip oil in combination with Argan oil and lavender, rose, frankincense and turmeric essential oils. Pimples disappear overnight. That annoying facial hair growth is slowed by the turmeric oil dramatically and I have much less redness. I used the Rosehip oil on my fianc&amp;eacute; for his surgical scars and watched them turn from bright pink to white before my eyes. This oil does all that it claims to do. It is now a staple in my home.</li>
            <li> I love it!  The Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil aromatherapy is exhilarating. I really like knowing it is 100% Pure and Natural. The eyedropper will spoil you for any other type of dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;The Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil is quickly absorbed into the skin. Besides the joyful scent experience, my initial use was for my hands and nails. My cuticles looked better right away. I then  put it on my legs and felt quite decadent. This is Therapeutic Grade - just like expensive spas buy.  There are so many uses for the Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil I know I have just scratched the surface on the benefits of my purchase. I hope you enjoy it too.</li>
            <li> Great Quality at a low price, I can always count on this company!</li>
            <li> Liking it...very thin but I do use it all over- face, neck, chest, hands arms &amp; legs for sun spots.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I got the Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil and it is really a great oil. For the price and the effect of this product on the skin, I really got a great value. I strongly recommend it for the the dry skin, works much better than other products I tried for that. You can feel the richness of this oil as soon as you apply it on the skin, and it really firms the skin as soon as you apply it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was given an opportunity to write a review for Rosehip Seed Oil purchased at a deep discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large bottle of therapeutic grade Rosehip Seed Oil contains 4 fluid ounces. Therapeutic oils are certified as pure oils and do not contain any chemicals or fillers that cheaper oils may contain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle of Rosehip Seed Oil is very potent, so a little goes a long way. The scent is intense, sweet and floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ingredient in Rosehip Seed Oil is simply 100% organic cold-pressed Rosehip oil harvested from roses.  The rosehip is the fruit of the rose plant and is formed after successful pollination of flowers in spring or early summer, and ripens in late summer through autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Seed Oil is renowned for the ability to heal and lighten minor to severe stretch marks and scars.  It is often used on individuals with degenerative tissues and keloid scarring. Rosehip Seed Oil has powerful properties to help regenerate and brighten skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Seed Oil is considered one of the best massage oils for someone trying to prevent or reduce stretch marks.  To use, apply 2-3 drops onto fingertips and rub the oil into the affected area two or three times each day.  Noticeable changes may take a few months of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip seed oil is moisturizing and used for a variety of skin conditions including dermatitis, acne, and eczema; for sunburned skin; for hydrating aging skin; and for smoothing fine lines and fine wrinkles in aging skin and helping to even skin tone; and for treating brittle nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip seed oil is a superior mental stimulant used to promote mental well-being. Treatment of stress, anxiety, and eczema are other beneficial uses of rosehip seed oil.  It is calming, reduces swelling, aids in the healing of a sore or wound, and is effective for respiratory problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Seed Oil is particularly high in Vitamin C and is one of the richest plant sources of Vitamin C available. Rose hips also contain beta-carotene, lutein, zeaaxanthin, and lycopene which are potent antioxidants that protect against damage from free radicals and skin aging.  It contains natural vitamin A (also known as Retinol) and is very effective to help avoid premature ageing as a result of excessive sun exposure.  Omega 3, 6, and 9 fatty acids in the rosehip seed oil help to plump out fine lines and fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using the Rosehip Seed Oil to make delicious rosehip herbal tea and to flavor cookies and frostings for cakes.  . I use a few drops of the rosehip seed oil, water and a choice of sweetener such as honey or sugar to make the rosehip herbal tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy using the Rosehip Seed Oil for home fragrance purposes. The sweet and floral aroma is wonderful and calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I really love is what the Rosehip Seed Oil is doing for my face.  My skin looks more radiant.  The rosehip seed oil has lightened up some facial discolorations and seems to be making my skin tone more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing my makeup and cleaning my face before bedtime, I splash cold water on my face and leave moist. Then I put 2 drops of the Rosehip Seed Oil in my palm and gently rub it on my face until it is all absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I mix 1 drop of the Rosehip Seed Oil into my moisturizer and apply to my face. Let it dry and then I apply my makeup for the day.available. Rose hips also contain beta-carotene, lutein, zeaaxanthin, and lycopene which are potent antioxidants that protect against damage from free radicals and skin aging.  It contains natural vitamin A (also known as Retinol) and is very effective to help avoid premature ageing as a result of excessive sun exposure.  Omega 3, 6, and 9 fatty acids in the rosehip seed oil help to plump out fine lines and fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using the Rosehip Seed Oil to make delicious rosehip herbal tea and to flavor cookies and frostings for cakes.  . I use a few drops of the rosehip seed oil, water and a choice of sweetener such as honey or sugar to make the rosehip herbal tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy using the Rosehip Seed Oil for home fragrance purposes. The sweet and floral aroma is wonderful and calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I really love is what the Rosehip Seed Oil is doing for my face.  My skin looks more radiant.  The rosehip seed oil has lightened up some facial discolorations and seems to be making my skin tone more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing my makeup and cleaning my face before bedtime, I splash cold water on my face and leave moist.

            <li> I really didn&#x27;t get to use it that much yet..but seems works well and I do like it because it absorb s good on my skin.....thank you</li>
            <li> Rosehip is one great oil!! This bottle came sealed with a flat top cap and the dropper was wrapped separately,this is a nice option for those who prefer one over the other. I use it daily on my hands to help keep my cuticles from drying out so much with the cold weather and continuous hand washing! I also use it on a relatively recent burn, which is still not quite back to normal in color (dontcha love new skin?!) There are so many wonderful benefits to rosehip oil from skin healing properties to helping to treat itchy scalp! This is a great sized bottle at 4 oz, it&#x27;s cold pressed and organic too, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I purchased this product with a promotional code. This in no way affects my opinions or experiences*</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and face. It absorbs well and helps my skin feel hydrated. I like it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I noticed that it started smelling like fish. I used to use art naturals rosehip oil and did not get this smell. With art naturals I used up the whole bottle in a year and it never went bad. But this one, the majestic pure brand disappointed me. I had to go back and update my review. I tried to order another bottle of art naturals rosehip but they no longer have it in stock : ( going to try yet another brand. Hope I find something that will last and not go bad.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipment. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love my rosehip oil. I use it on my face each night.</li>
            <li> My order came very quickly and the quality of the Rosehip oil is excellent. I will definitely be ordering again. Thank you for a quality product, easy ordering and quickly delivering. Victoria Charbonneau</li>
            <li> Very high quality rose hip oil. The price is better than the retail stores.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: This stuff does NOT go into your oil diffuser. It&#x27;s not really designed to make your house smell nice. It doesn&#x27;t stink or anything, but it&#x27;s really more for therapeutic purposes. That being said, rosehip oil is fantastic for your skin! The texture of this oil is slightly viscous without being thick or greasy on your skin, and it has a pretty golden color. You don&#x27;t need much to rub it anywhere - it&#x27;s light enough in texture that it spreads really well. Also, the price is phenomenal. For a one-ounce bottle of organic essential oils, you could take out a second mortgage on your house at Whole Foods. But this product is a big four ounces and comes with its own dropper! What a great deal! I love Majestic Pure&#x27;s products and I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity to review them.</li>
            <li> Use regularly on my face, makes my skin look 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> I received my order expeditiously. I am very pleased with the quality of the product. Thank​ you</li>
            <li> So far, so good ... the oil makes my skin feel soft. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give a final review.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried rosehip oil until recently, and it is a MIRACLE moisturizer.  I apply several drops to my face after my serum of choice (i.e. collagen, hyaluronic, retinol, vitamin C, etc.), and it absorbs beautifully, leaving absolutely no feeling of greasiness.  I will be adding this oil to my beauty regimen going forward.  Also I have purchased several products from Majestic Pure and can attest to their quality.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about rosehip oil, take the plunge!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is great. I have alot of scars and stretch marks and they have been fading away little by little every day sense I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I use this oil when my skin needs real moisture.  Feels good after long sun exposure.  I am outdoors playing golf in hot weather and though I use sunscreen my skin still get very dry.  The Rosehip Oil helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks know. At first I did purge a little but as I continue to use it my skin skin is looking better and better! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month and I will update. I gave 4 stars because the dropper is not well made it just comes right out</li>
            <li> amazing stuff!! My skin is usually not too bad, but at the time when I ordered this oil, I was experiencing an unusual breakout on my cheek and my chest, which seemed to get worse after I&#x27;d wash my face with a cleanser. I decided to ditch the cleanser &amp; wash my face/remove my makeup with coconut oil instead, and use rosehip oil as a daily/nightly moisturizer--I love it!! It moisturizes well, but absorbs very quickly. My skin looks better everyday, and I don&#x27;t even have to wear as much foundation/concealer as I did before, and I JUST started this regimen! I&#x27;m looking forward to what results I&#x27;ll see int he next couple of months. Who needs a million expensive beauty products and cleansers when all you need is coconut oil and rosehip oil!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and neck every day and I&#x27;m soft as a baby&#x27;s behind. So great for your skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the rosehip oil along with argan oil to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face. It has made my skin so soft, and hydrated. I wondered if it would make me break out at all, and it hasn&#x27;t, they are both really light. I read that rosehip is good for aging skin, and that is me. Google all the benefits, and try it for yourself. Look up what essential oils will work best with your skin type, mix them in and wa la! Such a better option then all those chemicals used in traditional skin care. The rosehip oil got to me fast without any problems...</li>
            <li> I love this rosehip oil and wish I had known about the benefits of rosehip oil a long time ago.I have old stretch marks on my stomach and while they may never go away I am already seeing a softening of them and more suppleness to my stomach; I have been using it for about three weeks but even the first time I put it on my stomach it took away the dryness &amp; smoothed the wrinkled areas.  The oil is quickly absorbed on dry and parched areas of the skin, leaving an exquisite silky feel. It does takes a little longer to absorb on my face, due to the natural oils I have there, so  now I only use a drop for the face. By the way I am over 50 yrs old and it seems to be very healing for dry skin, wrinkles, and increases suppleness. I love the way if feels, the subtle smell (pleasant &amp; barely noticed), it&#x27;s effect on my skin, and the size! It is a larger bottle compared to some of the others on the market for the same price. I hope the size and the current formula is never changed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face and hands for several weeks now.  My ageing spots have appeared to be fading and I love the way it feels in conjunction with my moisturizer.  The seller also sent a web link for 10 different uses.  I am very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Great value and loved the follow up information from the seller!</li>
            <li> Bought this oil for my wife, she is still utilizing with other essential oils. We plan on leaving reviews as used.</li>
            <li> it smells so bad (fish) it has a color, so i cannot use on my face. my face skin will have a stain.</li>
            <li> Sorry the smell is more than I had anticipated. I will use the rest of the bottle in the name of beauty and  waste not want not but  I will look for another option of rose oil to use .</li>
            <li> I really love this oil and I use it exclusively as a moisturizer in the morning and evening. I had several patches of discoloration and old acne scars and within a week of using this product I started to notice a difference. My skin looks more even toned and the scars are fading. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Because it is so gentle, Rosehip Seed Oil can be used as a serum to the face after cleansing, as a general body oil to soften and rejuvenate skin, and to nourish hair. I add a few drops to my moisturizer and love how fresh my face looks in the morning.  I also like to put a few droplets on my fingertips and run them through my hair. It leave my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and super healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Seed Oil is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, restore skin elasticity, and boost collagen production, all while reducing scars and fine lines. It can also be used as an addition to lotions and creams, as it’s anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant, which helps to decrease environmental damage and soothe the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Rosehip seed oil is a light amber color, with a light, subtle, slightly earthy &amp; nutty scent. It glides smoothly onto the skin and absorbs well without leaving a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discount received on purchase price for evaluation purposes.e the fact that this is Organic cold pressed Rosehip oil from Chile - 100% Pure USDA certified, and the company stands behind their product with a 100% money back customer satisfaction guarantee.

            <li> I like it so far. Use it for my face.</li>
            <li> Not Instanatural..but no regrets I Will be sticking with the best.. amazon is amazing.. no regrets quicklyrics refunded (:</li>
            <li> WOW. I really love this huge bottle of oil a lot. It is very rich in vitamins and antioxidants. It is also 100% pure and natural.  I use this oil to reduce my stretch mark and it seems to be working. I have been using it for a week.  I see my stretch marks fading away slowly on my stomach and it has gotten smooth but it works better than cocoa butter ( from my experience) It smell so good, like cherry/rose blossom! This rosehip oil can also be used for scars, fine lines, wrinkles, and even brittle nails. I also used this for my face because I had a several acne scars on my forehead for about 2 years. This oil made them magically disappear after using them for several days. I am very happy with the results. This oil is very useful for a lot of skin problem especially your face. I am glad I took the risk to try. I would recommend people who has several issues with their face or nails or even the scalps to give this a try</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product that long, but I definitely notice an added softness and suppleness to my skin. I add a few drops of it into my normal body moisturizer and/or use a few drops on damp skin after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried adding it to my face regime, but I noticed it broke me out a bit, so I&#x27;m sticking to body only.</li>
            <li> This brand has a low odor (does not smell like roses) It&#x27;s made from the seeds you see in the photo on the front not roses.&lt;br /&gt;Rose hip oil is yet another product that has many advantages uses.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it for genel moisturizer for hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;It helps to reduce scarring on stretch marks or hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;And I use it to help often my cuticles and provide shine to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large 4 0z bottle that will last a long time, a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a product discount however my reviews remain honest</li>
            <li> I have only used for a couple of weeks. Nothing noticeable yet.</li>
            <li> I got this oil on a very good diacounted price...this is a miracle oil coz it made my scars lightened ani made my skin much brighter. Its super hydrating which helped my skin feels much hydrated.</li>
            <li> Product came as described along with an email listing all of the benefits of Rosehip oil and how to use. Very informative!</li>
            <li> Loving this oil!  No scent (that I can smell), spreads evenly and doesn&#x27;t take forever to absorb even with my oily skin. Item arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I took off 1 star only because of the dropper which I made seller aware of and they are looking into it. It&#x27;s difficult to control the amount of oil that comes out of it, but you can always switch it out with another dropper if you have one. If not, you can just make sure there&#x27;s very little in there and that will help. Other than that, perfect and would buy it again from this seller!</li>
            <li> quick service, great seller, smells great and smooth</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. Like the softness of skin it leaves.</li>
            <li> Love this and Jojoba oil I ordered together! I will re-order again before cold, I need extra rich creamy oily stuff since my skin is dry-ish even more so in winter &amp;#62;&#x3D;(  if i dont use rich oily products my skin fels thight and uncomfortobale. These awesome oils are life savers! In combination with skin creams does wonders and makes skin look nourished and younger &#x3D;) I have been told many a times I have very nice skin tone and texture &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;I take care of my finicky skin with these fancy oils and feel great improvements and get compliments &#x3D;) Will order soon again!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The list of things this oil can be used for is limitless!!! I use it in my hair, on dry spots on my face, my hands...etc.  This oil also does wonders for stretch marks!!! This is a must have in any beauty collection!!</li>
            <li> Every scent of Majectic Pure essential oil that I have tried has been amazing! They are more powerful than other brands I have tried and I love that they are availible in larger sizes. I just got into using these oils but this is by far my favorite brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> works great in my projects.  so happy in both my products that i got from this company that they sent glass droppers and packaged wonderfully.  smells really good</li>
            <li> Great product....great price!!!</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me at a reduced price to review and critique. I would never give anything other than my 100% honest opinion, and jeapordize my long-term beauty blog subscribers, or anyone else reading my reviews. peace &amp; love&lt;br /&gt;http://www.youtube.com/c/JenniferTireyLove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using jojoba oil as my night time moisturizer, but have since learned about rose hip&#x27;s benefits from my beauty vlogger friends, and i will never look back! My skin is extremely dry by nature, so i use oil every night under my moisturizer. The differences i&#x27;ve noticed since using this in such a short period of time are nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> I finally can write the review for the Rosehip oil. I bought a couple months back. When I opened it. I didn&#x27;t expect a good smell but it turned out not so bad. It barely has any smell. I don&#x27;t know why does a lot of reviews talking how bad the smell is. Then I checked the color. It&#x27;s really light amber. Since it&#x27;s my first time using organic oil I can&#x27;t tell if the color should be like that or that. It doesn&#x27;t work that quick and great like a lot of viewers said. But it did work after applying a lot of times. I used a little over half bottle now. It got my eye lash soften, moisturized my ankles a little, repaired some of my pimple marks and it refined a little bit of my husband&#x27;s arms as you can see in the pictures. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product for the price. But is not the Magical like it&#x27;s mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Concentrate  Essential oil. Comparing this rose hip oil with it, I like Kiehl&#x27;s better just because this oil is  greasier than Kiehl&#x27;s. So it&#x27;s not that easy to be  absorbed. Takes a while of rubbing. Specially on your face. But you don&#x27;t want to rub your face a lot of time. It causes wrinkles...</li>
            <li> Customer service was pretty good, smell nice and does a good job</li>
            <li> Makes my skin sooo soft. I love it. also has cleared up my completion. I am 57 and it helps wrinkles and age spots. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This company was very conscientious about selling their products and service.  The Rosehip Oil is great.  I use it as a moisturizer.  Wonderful on aging skin.  It put a dewy glow to my face.</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil!!!  Used in my face serum and left face nicely moisturized without being greasy and no breakouts!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested a few different types of rosehip oils and this is a great quality oil. It&#x27;s very lightweight and absorbs into the skin easily. Rosehip oil has no smell to it which is great as I like the way my toner (orange blossom water) smells. I love the way this feels on my face and the bottle even comes with a nice glass dropper for easy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing versatile product! I have sensitive skin and for some reason one leg will end up with &amp;#34;razor bumps&amp;#34; and be extremely itchy while the other leg will be completely fine. So since Rosehip Oil is suppose to be good on skin I decided to use a little bit on my leg and man was I amazed! It absorbs really quick and made the itch go away almost instantly and after a couple times doing this I&#x27;ve seen some of the bumps starting to fade faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not great,for me personally. It&#x27;s not the worst smell but it&#x27;s definitely not something I would want to stick my nose up to for very long. However once it absorbs the smell went away! I also put a small amount in my hair and which made it very soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is also a pretty good size so for me personally it&#x27;ll last for quite awhile really just depends on how much you use and how you use it!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this Rosehip Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is such a great ingredient to ad to your beauty routine because it offers so many benefits! Rub Majestic Pure rosehip oil into acne scars, stretch marks and darkspots. I like to use the dropper to target small dark spots around my face and avoid my oily t-zone. Rosehip does not smell like roses, if you&#x27;re wondering. It comes from the seeds which is why it is high in the essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (or omega-6), as well as linolenic acid (or omega-3) and how it can provide so many anti-aging benefits. It smells a bit pungent for some, but I find, because I am using it topically and in smaller areas, the smell dissipates quickly. It has never bothered me. I like to massage  Rosehip oil into the brittle ends of my hair before I wash it to protect my colored hair and leave it shinny. If you are a dandruff sufferer, massage rosehip into your scalp 30 mins before washing your hair to battle flakes. Rosehip is great for anti-aging but also for skin recovery after a sunburn. I mean I really could go on and on. Get yourself this big 4oz bottle from Majestic Pure and google rosehip...the possibilities are practically endless! *Discount given for my unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product.  I was worried it would make my face seem shiny or oily but it does not.  After 2 weeks of twice daily application my skin is so soft and more glowing.  I have recommended to several friends and will purchase again once gone.</li>
            <li> I put this into my facial moisturizer to get that extra boost of umph out of my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love essential oils and the proper glass eye droppedlr that was included is Mich appreciated.  The bottle was well sealed and wrapped so no leakage.  I will have to research some nice uses for rosehip.</li>
            <li> Love the Rose Hip, and am using it for face boo boo&#x27;s as well as other dry places.</li>
            <li> The Organic Rosehip oil was delivered protectively packaged, sealed, and as described on product page.  We purchased the oil in a promotion to test and review.  We like that this oil is natural and organic, safe to use.  Also love that the supplement is made in the USA facility, and is certified.  Nice to use on skin, especially for massage.</li>
            <li> I just received this oil and I had to immediately try it. It has a nice neutral scent to it. When I put it on my skin, it isn&#x27;t greasy at all. It feels smooth and actually moisturizes a little bit. Rosehip oil is meant to help reduce scars and help with eczema. I have really dry skin right now on my hands and I put a little of this on it. It actually helps quite a bit. The bottle also recommend that you can use it on brittle nails, which I definitely have, especially during the winter. This product is also great mixed with coconut oil and shea butter (with a dash of mint, my favorite scent) as a lotion. It will really condition and heal the skin. Was really excited to try this product discounted because of my skin issues!</li>
            <li> Awesome oil, exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to look like (light honey color) not much of a smell though like some other rosehip oils I have order in the past but I will definitely order this product again. Worth the money, great price for size of bottle (4 oz).</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Beautiful scent. High quality. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have had great results my skin looks better than ever.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Its ok I will continue using Rosehip</li>
            <li> I have been using this organic rosehip oil for about 2 weeks, along with the a vitamin C serum. The oil absorbs almost immediately &amp; there is no oily residue. My skin is appearing healthier with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order rosehip oil from other companies and was happy, BUT Majestic Pure was truly different. The oil was much softer to touch and absorbed well into the skin. My nails are thin and sometimes split, when I rub the oil on the nails they feel hydrated.  The smell of the rosehip oil is a light pleasant smell. Awesome oil!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this is of high quality do to color.the color should be more of an orange color...this product is more of an light yellow!</li>
            <li> Lovely oil, great service</li>
            <li> Works great for my purposes!</li>
            <li> Have only used for a few days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t accomplish what I needed it for so can&#x27;t really say whether good or bad.</li>
            <li> I mix this in with my vanocream lotion and rub it on my hands... as an eczema sufferer, I&#x27;m constantly looking for some relief. I&#x27;ve had mild success with the non-scented vanocream lotion on it&#x27;s own, but I&#x27;ve noticed quite the improvement since I started mixing in some of this rosehip oil! I received this promotionally for review, and I definitely recommend it to people who need some relief from eczema.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. .people  say it has a nasty smell honestly it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all..i use this stuff everywhere..so far loving  results :)</li>
            <li> I am loving my rosehip oil.  I wish it was available in a larger size because I like to use it on my arms, legs, etc.</li>
            <li> Was rancid. But was issued a refund(hence the 2 stars)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is ok, but the shipping package was poor.  The oil leaked, and made quite a mess.</li>
            <li> I adore this oil!  I waited a few weeks to write this review because I wanted to see how I really felt about it.  I make my own face serum now and this oil, along with almond oil, is my base for it.  It is sold at a good price. It does not have a strong aroma so when mix it with my essential oils it smells wonderful! I will be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. I added this to my skin care regimen and my face looks better then it has ever looked. I am 26 and struggled with acne since I was a Freshmen in High School. My face appears smoother and my acne scars have slightly diminished. The best part about this oil is how  even my skin tone appears. When ever I happen to get a pimple this really helps my skin to heal quicker and remove the redness left on my face from the pimple. I notice improvements within one night. This has even made my nails look fantastic. I never intended on apply this to my nails. It just happened to get on my nails when apply this to my face. I am going to start to apply this to my stretch marks on my thighs to see how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;My new Skin Care Regimen That has really improved my face:&lt;br /&gt;1) Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash (Morning and Night/Wait 10 min before next step)&lt;br /&gt;2) Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10, Maximum Strength (Only on pimples after washing my face/thin layer/wait 15min before next step)&lt;br /&gt;3) Last I apply Rosehip Oil (Morning and Night during summer. My summer is high in humidity, thus my skin doesn&#x27;t get really dry. In the winter I will mix a couple drops of Rosehip Oil into Neutrogena Naturals Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Moisturizer when my skin needs extra moisture)&lt;br /&gt;4) Indian Healing Clay ( I should probably use this twice a week, but I&#x27;m lazy, so I use this around the time I&#x27;m getting my period. This is when I experience a crappy breakout.)</li>
            <li> lotions dont tend to work too well for me cause i have such extremely dry skin so i usually have to add baby oil (which dont always work either) or Vaseline (which leave thick caked on feeling to skin) but i have recently started adding a few drops of rosehip oil to my lotion and i must say my skin is begining to look better then ever before.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth clean oil with no order.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a moisturizer because I have very dry skin. As everyone knows all body &amp; skin is different &amp; reacts differently to anything applied.&lt;br /&gt;Mine is dry &amp; loves oil which I have used all my life but this is my first experience with  Rosehip oil &amp; I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil! I use it alongside my mother as a moisturizer at night. I love how it flawlessly soaks into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me oily at all. I also love how it as helped lighten up my dark spots. I keep mine refrigerated because I&#x27;ve read that helps with the longevity.</li>
            <li> Really good oil and we were pleasantly surprised. We never used Rosehip oil before but after this brutal northeast winter our skin needed some TLC. We used the oil mostly on our hands and they feel like new again. We&#x27;re read we could use the oil for aromatherapy and will give that a shot. We use oils daily and this one is a great addition to our daily regimen.</li>
            <li> This oil feels great on the skin. It&#x27;s good as a carrier oil too. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed at this oil’s healing abilities for my skin.  Of course, I was skeptical about using it on my face because I have sensitive skin, but this product has not caused an adverse reaction to my skin.  My blemish marks are getting lighter and I can see a change in face already.  I read a review that stated someone used it in their for razor burn on the thighs, so I tried it and it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worthwhile to try this product with this price.But the packing should be improved. I concern the hygiene problem, because the dropper is not packed properly and separated with the bottle. So I washed the dropper before use. And it is difficult to control the dropper precisely.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It smoothes my skin and my face feels softer. My husband even uses it for his bags under his eyes, also!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Seems like fine quality and works well in my face creams, lotions and tanning oils! Also love the dropper!</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and currently using this to prevent stretch marks.  Not sure if rose hip oil can prevent stretch marks since some say it&#x27;s mostly genetics but so far I am enjoying the oil and prefer using this over other oils.  It soaks well and quick into the skin, and I especially love that it has no scent.  My only suggestion is that the company comes up with a pump for the top rather than the dropper because the dropper is messy and gets oil all over my table.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and great packaging!</li>
            <li> Perfect thank you, will purchase agains</li>
            <li> Left Review A few days ago,maybe It didn&#x27;t post. And very pleased with the product, the scent, The bottle glass dropper that came with it which makes it easy to apply. Received a discount to try + give honest feedback. So happy that I did, because there now my go to for any essential oil. Company also emailed me and exter information on Ways to use the oil +more about the properties. Great company that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering this product again!!</li>
            <li> A ++ this stuff cleared up my dermatitis</li>
            <li> Great size oil in my favorite kind of bottle. No scent. Very high quality. You can tell this was pressed in a quality press. Organic completely. I have been using this on a surgery scar, and the area is so much softer already. Can&#x27;t wait to see lightening of the scar. Also have been using on some dry skin areas on my forehead and it has left no residue, absorbs perfectly. Also makes a great carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;m trying to fend off crows feet so this seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I was researching a good source for argan oil and decided to add this to my order.  So glad I did!  I have very light/fair/pale &amp; sensitive skin and most oils cause me to break out or get blackheads along my cheek line.  After a week of using this rose hip oil directly on my face after showering my skin has never looked better!!  I spent hours looking at various brands and hundreds of reviews and this has turned out to be so worth the time!  It is a very light oil, so it soaks into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel behind.  In my research, I saw some reviews complaining of a weird smell with rosehip oil - this one has zero smell.  I&#x27;ve also had great results using a tiny bit on my hair after showering too - does a great job of stopping frizzy hair.  Just be aware that a little goes a long way!  I put too much on one day and by the evening my hair was a bit greasy looking.  Overall an amazing product and a great price!  I&#x27;m totally hooked on it!! :-)</li>
            <li> Amazing rejuvenating oil. Great for the hair and skin. This oil is full of vitamins and antioxidants which is why it is so amazing and great for oour hair and skin!</li>
            <li> Lovely oil and I would order again! Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is great to use on your skin or as a carrier oil for essential oil, etc. I love the dropper because it makes for more precise application. I have used it on my face to add hydration because I have very dry skin. It melts into the skin so easily and does not leave a greasy residue. I would definitely suggest using rosehip oil on your skin because it is very gentle to even the most sensitive skin. I am looking forward to using it in cold-process soap to make a facial bar to suit my exact needs. This rosehip oil is a great price for a great product! I would definitely recommend this product to others in need of a facial moisturizer or to use as a carrier oil!</li>
            <li> Love it, well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, have started using it, will publish the results later. So far keep the skin moisturized and no breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It really reduces the size of open pores!</li>
            <li> Seems to be pretty good stuff so far. I mainly use it for the very dry skin around my eyes, and it really doesn&#x27;t have a smell, soaks in nicely, gives a nice (not greasy) dewy glow, and does the moisturizing job as it should. Can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles yet, as I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day for a week, but I like it. Also great for cuticle before and after a pedicure :) there are many uses for this oil, and I will update if I find that it works any specific wonders as I use it for new things. Hope this was helpful :)</li>
            <li> love this oil.  I&#x27;ve been using this oil for some months now on my body and in my baths and my skin is soft and no ash appearance.  I have to use very little lotion whereas before I would have to lotion up twice before even putting on clothes.  I also have eczema and almost never have to use my cortizone creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to the idea of using so many different oils for skin hair and nails, so I&#x27;m still trying to navigate and experiment with all different uses for all kinds of oils. This rose hip oil works beautifully and leaves my skin feeling soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Awesome oil. I love it. The seller was prompt and I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich. Seems to dry fairly quick which I like because I don&#x27;t want it all over my clothes. Important to know it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, which I knew. I like to add rose absolute to it for a rose scent.</li>
            <li> A nice light oil with no strong fragrance. It feels great on my face and hands at night after washing. Will it rid my wrinkles? I guess I will see in time I just started using it. I feel it is worth the try.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of rosehip oil until my sister introduced me to it when she purchased a bottle for herself after claiming that Miranda Kerr swears by it. Not one to ever turn down potentially looking like Miranda Kerr, I began looking into rosehip oil as well in hopes that it would improve my acne-prone skin. I was initially wary of it since I have combination, acne-prone skin that gets oily throughout the day, and knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rosehip oil was surprisingly not greasy as I expected it to be. It reminds me of tea tree oil, if you have ever used that. The product is far from greasy and is easily absorbent upon application. I have been consistently applying this product to an acne scar on the side of my face, and although it has only been a few days, the scar is noticeably beginning to fade away. Huge upside to this product is that it is a very generous size (4 ounces) for the price, so I can apply it liberally and use it as an all-over serum rather than a spot treatment. It is an incredibly versatile product that can be used as an acne treatment, facial toner, daily moisturizer, scar/blemish treatment, and makeup remover, to name a few. As I mentioned, the generous size of this product allows me to use it liberally and experiment with the countless ways to apply it. Overall, very impressed with this product, its many uses, and its overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by Majestic Pure for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> Took 2 days longer to get here but it got here. Beautiful smell</li>
            <li> This is god for so may things looked it up n line and wil be using for all sorts of home remedy&amp;#34;s.&lt;br /&gt;Received this for a review.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that can be used for so many things. It also comes with a natural nice scent. I&#x27;ve used this for headaches many times on myself and my daughter. She was very suprised that it helps and she also liked the scent. I&#x27;ve even put a few drops in the bath just to soak. This is so good food so many things.</li>
            <li> I have tried , and love it,,,,on  face, arms,  thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;packages &amp; delivery was excellent.  due to our weather snow &amp; ice in NlW Tennessee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have just recently gotten introduced to essential oils. I never realized how amazing they really are. You can&#x27;t get anything better than all-natural. I am slowly building my collection of essential oils so when the opportunity came for me to test out Rosehip Oil and give my honest and unbiased opinion I was super excited.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped very promptly. It was wrapped and packaged nicely in lots of bubble-wrap, which I was very pleased with. I really had no clue at all the things that Rosehip Oil is good for. It is actually quite mind-blowing. Its good for stretch-marks, acne, scars, dry brittle nails, fine lines &amp; wrinkles, and dry skin. That is truthfully just a handful of its many uses. I have been using it on my nails and I cannot believe the difference.  My cuticles were just terribly dry and often times would crack open. Since I have started using Rosehip Oil on them each night, my cuticles and my actual nails just look and feel so much better. My nails have a natural shine to them now. My cuticles are hardly even visible now. It has just helped so much. Well, that peaked my interest so I&#x27;ve just yesterday started using it on my C-Section scar. I cannot wait to try it on many other things its good for. I am very pleased with my purchase.This Rosehip Oil is just absolutely awesome.  I would definitely recommend this for whatever your Rosehip Oil need may be.</li>
            <li> Excellent. No scent, which is fine. A perfect consistency. Just a few drops are the perfect facial moisturizer. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Much better for you then using creams or lotions</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it in my whole Body and really like how it feels.</li>
            <li> This was like olive oil, not rosehip oil. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Amazing product with so many healing qualities.  This bottle is a nice value size (which is very convenient).  Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> My child was sun burned on his face.  I used an after sun product with aloe and lidocaine - it burned his face - he ran to the sink to wash it off.  I used the rosehip oil and it was great!  It soothed his face and the redness was significantly reduced by morning. Very nice nice product.  I am using it for fine lines on my face at night.  I have noticed the lines soften because it hydrates the skin well.  A little goes a long way and there is virtually no scent to it.</li>
            <li> Buy this oil if you want a great multiuse oil. I used this oil in my hair to seal in my moisturizer, I applied it to my face after my cleanser and I even applied it to my body after the shower. I will say the best use I found for this oil was fir my face after cleansing. It made my face smooth and it absorbed very quickly I even applied my foundation directly after and it didn&#x27;t make my foundation oily. It works great all around and is a great oil to travel with, I keep some in a travel size container just for that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER : I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. MY OPINIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE BASED ON MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Love this product. We are avid campers and I mix I part of the oil to two parts water in a spray bottle to keep ticks off our shoes/socks</li>
            <li> Love the big 4 oz size rosehip oil! It comes with an easy to use dropper which is really useful. I use the oil as a carrier for other oils and it works great!</li>
            <li> This oil feels so soft on my skin I use it after my moisturizer &amp; I can see a difference in the texture of my skin</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! Works better than vitamin E for scar removal</li>
            <li> fixin&#x27; my face right up!!! :)</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s great. You can really feel the quality of the oil. However, my glass dropper came broken in the package... I am wondering if Majestic Pure replaces it for free.</li>
            <li> Ok, you guys. I used this for oil cleansing (and I use a microfiber towel damped in warm water to rinse it off). Then I would cleanse my face with raw honey right after. And then I would use two drops of this as my moisturizer, wait for my face to dry, then apply Vitamin C serum. I stopped breaking out with cystic acne HOWEVER this may be because I no longer use detergent to wash my face, and I&#x27;m letting my natural oil layer come back to life to protect my skin. I used it over the course of two weeks. I saw improvement on decreasing redness of my face. But it didn&#x27;t clear out my acne marks -- which what I was aiming for. But this may be because I only used it through the course of two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why two weeks -- because this thing OXIDIZED QUICKLY because of the bottling. Like you have to open it, to use the squeezing thing which exposes it in the air WHICH IS BAD. I plan to buy another Rosehip Oil AND transfer it to a dark bottle with a pump on it so I won&#x27;t have to open it. This thing is delicate. Don&#x27;t even try to take out of the fridge. I may buy mine from Mountain Rose Herbs because of how everybody praises their stuff. But I have a feeling it&#x27;s the same. I kinda want to buy it here while I still have my Amazon Prime :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have comments/suggestions, let me know!</li>
            <li> wife loves the oil  she uses it every night before bed</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I feel that this is a quality product. I mix it with jojoba oil, and use for the body and face.&lt;br /&gt;No breakouts so far, but somehow my skin felt a bit dry.. So better to use it with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really love how this oil feels on my skin and nails. I will be purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I recently had a hip replacement and this oil has really helped to smooth out my scar. It absorbs into my skin so quickly. I also made a face serum with it. It leaves my skin moist, but not oily. It gives a nice glow, too. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Very nice, penetrates the skin quickly leaving it very soft, and doesnt feel greasy!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have only just begun to use it so I can not comment on the long term effects but the short term benefits are amazing. I used it last night as a night serum and this morning as a moisturizer and my skin is so smooth. It&#x27;s better than any moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rose hip oil - makes nails strong and pretty, and this is an excellent brand.  Great service and follow-up to ensure satisfaction.  Will definitely order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> this smells so good, and really works well, used a little on my scars and it has helped of lightening the redness. was given a chance to review this oil. also put this on my dry skin and it helps give moisture to it.</li>
            <li> The Freshest Cleanest Oil Ever ! The Bottle Says For External Use Only ! Tasted It Anyway ! Super Fresh Taste ! Great And Safe For The Skin ! Skin Loves It ! Thanks Amazon ! For The First Time Ever ! A Perfect Oil !</li>
            <li> this is my first review...I don&#x27;t know about the quality or results yet.  This is a very messy oil...or maybe it is the dropper that makes it messy.  It is not a great quality dropper.  I disagree that is is light and absorbs well.  It feels heavy.  I have used essential oils that are light and absorb well...but not this particular rose hip oil.  I feel the need to blot the excess film of oil...and I feel greasy.  I would not use it as part of my daily moisturizer if I wear makeup.  my suggestion is to use it with your nightly moisturizer before bed.  I&#x27;ll report back in a month of so as to the effect and result on my skin.  I paid for this product...I did not receive it FREE for an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Working perfectly for what I needed. Really fast delivery and excellent follow-up. I will buy from these great people again...</li>
            <li> I use this as night time moisturizer and I love it. I want to see my stretch marks go away but I know it will take time. In the meantime, I enjoy this oil a lot and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Rose hip oil comes from Chile. Is it light amber in color, has the consistence of an olive oil, but soaks easily into the skin. It is a great moisturizer. It particularly heals and lightens stretch marks and scars, and tone the skin. This Majestic&#x60;s Pure Rose Hip, does not have a fragrance. I was expecting a rose scent and I am disappointed, that it does not smell as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced price for evaluation.</li>
            <li> Love it I use it on myself and my kids too</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Rosehip Oil before trying it, but a friend mentioned that it was good for treating eczema and acne, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. These are issues the girls are facing as their bodies blossom into young womanhood, and it would be nice to have natural treatments on hand instead of harsh chemical cleansers and compounds. The oil came in a glass jar with a handy dropper fro application. It feels light and nongreasy on the skin, seeming to absorb quickly. The smell was pleasant but not floral or overwhelming. (I think I sort of expected it to smell like roses. Haha. It doesn&#x27;t!) I like that it has such a wide variety of uses, from improving both your hair and skin, to massage and aromatherapy.  It&#x27;s definitely something I will keep on hand in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Really great product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, and seems to absorb well and not feel too oily, no noticable fragrance, will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never messed with oils before so I am not even sure if my opinion should count! The description says that it helps fade stretch marks, small or severe.. Well I had a baby 2 years ago, and like an idiot, I never rubbed lotion or Shea butter on my baby bump to prevent my stretch marks. I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because like every other product I&#x27;ve tried so far for my stretch marks, it hasn&#x27;t worked yet. I&#x27;m not giving up hope just yet so I&#x27;ll update this review if anything changes. Also, my dropper was very poor quality. It gets very messy, and the oil just slides out of the dropper without having to squeeze the top.</li>
            <li> great multi-purpose oil for hair skin, and healing</li>
            <li> I love it bugs don&#x27;t it also seems to be healing to my skin and to the dogs in their shampoo</li>
            <li> works great and is a huge amount for the price.  only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the dropper, which seems to drip the product out a bit, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  I poured some in another bottle I had and use that dropper instead.  I use the oil on my face twice a day and love how it feels.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing ... a couple nights a week I mix a few drops of Rosehip Oil and Jojoba Oil and rub on after cleaning and toning my face. I&#x27;ve really noticed improvement in my complexion. Great addition to my skincare routine!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I use it for my face, morning and evening. It&#x27;s great for my hands, especially my cuticles.  My daughter uses it for her itchy scalp.  Roseship Oil doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily.  The oil is practically scentless.</li>
            <li> Good quality product...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have been using it as a carrier oil for my essential oils to make a face serum.  Haven&#x27;t even been using it for 2 weeks yet and already noticing my sunspots have faded around my eyes.  Makes my skin feel amazingly soft and silky without making me overly oily.  I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts and this stuff has been amazing even still.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> A large bottle of awesome oil. Has a very nice feel, a pleasant scent, and I do believe it has been helping my teen daughter with her skin concerns (pimpley face, shhhh)</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer and hair oil, both  look great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very confusing. The listing claims to be 100% certified organic but the bottle does not. It has ambiguous language. I&#x27;ve tried another brand which seemed to be higher quality. Rose hip seed oil is a dry oil, when you put it on there should be no grease left. This product has a some traces of oil. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Better than expected! Will order again!</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t yet speak to the efficacy of the oil, customer service is just fantastic.  So far, the oil seems light and unscented - it says that it takes a few months to see results, so we&#x27;ll see.  If the oil works as well as customer service, it&#x27;s going to be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love the Essential Oils and use them very regularly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that my dropper came broken. I don&#x27;t want to have to pour my product because you end up using more than needed.</li>
            <li> Great product...price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery excellent product. I use it for my face in the morning light and very absorbent</li>
            <li> I USE THIS ON MT DRY FEET, .SPARINGLY ON MY FACE, AND IN MY CONDITIONER.  IT HAS WORKED MIRACLES!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!!  IT REALLY WORKS MIRACLES.</li>
            <li> Loving the rosehip oil! Great product, great value, timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Product for Review: This product is great! And a great beauty product. I would highly recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this oil.  My skin is looking more even and youthful in just 2 weeks of faithfully use this oil. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Using this oil on a scar from a recent surgery as I read that it would help with the healing process.  It&#x27;s hard to know if it is helping or not, as I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but trusting from the reviews of others, that it will make a difference!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Great price! Thanks guys</li>
            <li> Works great and makes my skin soft and helps keep them nasty tiny wrinkles at bay and its a pure natural product which is a BIG plus.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was shipped in s timely matter.  It came within three days as it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;The product seems of good quality.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;however, I was disappointed because the long glass dropper that came with it was broken upon arrival.  It would&#x27;ve been nice to have that to get the product out.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for skin. I add it to my facial lotion to get deep hydration with less shininess. I put it on stretch marks too. I have not had enough time yet to see if the stretch marks decrease but my skin does feel wonderful. I just ordered more of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for like 3 weeks but it has no adverse effects as far as I can tell. I just use it on my hair. I put a few drops in my spray bottle ( I have curly hair so I spray my hair with water every morning to make it softer) so I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li> My family has been using rosehip oil for a while now as a natural way to cure dry scalp. A few drops in shampoo does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is finding a product that is not diluted. This product is not diluted and works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;It mixes well with the shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this oil because it&#x27;s a fantastic value but alas, it is not like any other rosehip oil I have used.  I can excuse the lack of color since plants can vary and also there can be seasonal variations.  However, there is absolutely no tell-tale rosehip oil scent and upon application it lacks the unique &#x27;dry&#x27; oil feel of rosehip oil.  In fact, it feels much like any other carrier oil in that it leaves a bit of a &#x27;slick&#x27; on the skin.  The seller responded to my concerns and stands behind the product, but as a consumer I would not recommend.  Spend the extra money and get the Leven Rose brand (available on Amazon) or order from Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li> I thought the Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil was thick, absorbed well into my skin, and I like the Holistic Value of Rosehip Oil on my Skin the most. What made me want to try Rosehip was that it&#x27;s enriched with Vitamin A.  I am all for homeopathic skin elastic properties.  This Rosehip is 4oz&#x27;s, and I like using a few drops in my Tub with some Epson Salt while I soak.  I am a firm believer that a little bit of oil goes a long way.  I received product at discount for my opinion.</li>
            <li> Will buy again. Love it.</li>
            <li> It is a luscious oil. It makes a bit of time to be absorbed but leaves your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I very light, clean iteration of this oil. It is lightly amber in color with no viscosity at all. At a few drops at a time, I imagine this is practically a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> Im Using the Rose Hip Oil for this made difference . Super great product for the price. Soak right for me no oily feeling ,my skin looks so much smoother. I do this after using toner, Im apply a small amount of this in my face and neck,let dry a few minutes, then apply daytime moisturizer with sunscreen in morning..I use this also at Night with night moisturizer and my skin so moist and smooth. I got this Item under promotional offer with my Honest review opinion</li>
            <li> Just love this product, and what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li> Awesome oil. Not greasy and absorbs well. I used it for a scalp massage which was great. Used it on face and body. Full of vitamins etc. Can&#x27;t wait for a bit longer use to reap full benefits. Received this product for review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews for products anymore. After 10 years of buying on this site, it just gets to be a chore. But in all the years that I&#x27;ve been trying new and expensive anti-aging this or sculpting and wrinkle removing that, never have I ever come across a product that I&#x27;ve put on my face that has had such astounding results. Crows feet that I&#x27;ve had for years, which I&#x27;ve applied both every all-natural hippie formulation or synthetic serum on, are now almost gone within less than a week of using this product twice a day (now I&#x27;m bumping it up to 3 times a day!) My skin glows creamy with a gentle rosey-ness, and a dewey youthful rounding out of my more angular features is taking place. A literal transformation before my eyes with how quickly it seems to be working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a dude with a scientific bent, I&#x27;m very objective in my evaluation of effectiveness. I test and retest, compare effects against the outcomes of different products, arrive at conclusions that are fair and balanced. This is a product where every star has earned itself rightfully. I will be buying again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, though: as a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil, it won&#x27;t dry out your facial skin, but it will dry out and irritate/chap mucosal skin - so keep it away from the line of your eyelids and your lips. If you want to moisturize your lips, shea butter is the best possible balm I&#x27;ve found (mix it with powdered stevia extract and peppermint or sweet orange oil for flavor and sweetness.)</li>
            <li> Great size bottle, comes with a nice dropper and ideas for using this.I have used rose hips oils before- they are great for skin problems and just general moisture. There is very little smell- so don&#x27;t be concerned about that. Would recommend this brand to friends!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine swears by this stuff so I did a little research before I actually got it. Apparently it is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes predominately grown in Chile. Rosehip seed oil is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines. You can use it pretty much anywhere on your body. I&#x27;ve been using on my face and hands to get rid of my dry winter skin. Since it is an oil I thought it would be greasy but far from it. My dry skin soaks it right up leaving me with silky smooth, soft skin. I love it so much I use it every day. If you are thinking about trying Rosehip oil I say Go For It! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this rosehip oil. It has a light nutty smell, no strong odor letting me use this on my face during the night. There are great benefits the rosehip oil have, I have been using the oils on my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s eczema skin and noticing their skins clearing and healing. The oil is surprisingly not greasy and absorbs into the skin easily. I have been using the oil on my face to get rid of wrinkles and some adult acne and I am noticing a difference in my complexion and love how my face is feeling. I would highly recommend all house hold to have a bottle of rosehip oil in their cabinet. The 4 oz will go a long way for us, just a little goes a long way. I love the way they packaged this bottle, securely and in a box.</li>
            <li> Great for acne scars and lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;I have rolling acne scars and this has helped a lot. If you have acne scars get this. It helps alot.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price . My face loves it!</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are slowly fading away. I recommend this to anyone who has stretch marks or any other scar they would like to correct.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of oils with my essential oils. I use Rosehip and mix it with lavender oil, Aragon oil and tea tree and use it after i wash my face. I also add Rosehip oil to my hair (spit ends) and nails. I&#x27;m sure there are a bunch of ways to use it though! I would just google it and see if it&#x27;s right for you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Majestic Pure&#x27;s line! I use many of their oils and creams and have had awesome results from them. Their prices are unbelievable and the quality is truly impressive. I love this Rosehip Oil because it&#x27;s all natural ( like their others) and leaves my hair looking fantastic. I have very dry hair and it breaks easily. Or, used to. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for the past week and its made a noticeable difference in breakage and has given me a really nice shine. I add a few drops to my damp hair, scrunch it well to distribute thtoughout the strands and wrap it with a hot towel. I let it sit about 30 minutes, unwrap and rinse well. My hair is soft and super manageable and looks really really great with this treatment. It&#x27;s also great on my face after toning. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores which is very important for me because I&#x27;m acne prone. I haven&#x27;t noticed any new results in the lightening of my scars yet but as I said it&#x27;s only been about a week. I fully expect to be seeing results within a few more weeks because this brand hasn&#x27;t let me down yet. I can say my skin is softer after using this as a mouisturizer and doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy. I LOVE it. I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after having tried this oil. Its great. I have absolutely nothing to gain by leaving a positive review, this is simply the my honest thoughts with it.</li>
            <li> The oil I received looked, smelled, tasted, and absorbed into the skin EXACTLY like plain canola oil!  I returned it.  No deep golden amber color as described.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for a demititis on my neck. I must say it has almost disappeared. I was using a antifungal cream and it was still there. So I highly recommend using natural oils. Thank you,</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil.  Pure with a light aroma.  Perfect natural facial moisturizer following deep cleansing.  Works to secure moisture for extremely dry skin.  We used this on sunburned skin, in diaper creams, on dry hands, and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> WOW...I REALLY LOVE THIS OIL!! Great packaging and glides on super smooth with no fragrance...Absorbs instantly with no greasy feel to it at all. Makes my dry skin feel like velvet and works well with my other body products. Majestic Pure is definitely one of my FAVS! Will always order from them...Great products &amp; service here! I asked to review this item at a promo price to try this oil and I&#x27;m SO HAPPY I DID...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Is a good oil.&lt;br /&gt;I received on time.</li>
            <li> This oil is Amazing for curing cracked skin on your heels because of dryness, it also works wonders with dry and itchy scalp. These are two things I was not able to take care of in the past, instead of scraping off the cracked skin on my heels I now use rosehip oil from majestic pure and I am very satisfied with the results. I use fractionated coconut oil as a carrier oil with rosehip oil on my hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this Rosehip Oil and it&#x27;s very generous for the price</li>
            <li> I am writing this review because I was traded for it. This is a great product, I love rose hip oil. Only complaint is the dropper it came with doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil - This is a beautiful oil with a lovely scent.  Rosehip oil is becoming one of the best oils as it is highly antioxidant and we know that is a benefit for so many issues from sun damage to preventing further problems so to be able to undo some damage as well as protect future damage is priceless.  Goes on very nicely and penetrates the skin almost immediately so it is great for evening skin care routines. Really nice label design so I would feel good giving this as a gift has a natural but upscale look.</li>
            <li> This oil has made a huge improvement in my skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy &amp; my face was so dry but now feels normal. Thanks for the great service &amp; product.</li>
            <li> This Rosehip oil is very good quality. I&#x27;m enjoying using it by itself and by adding drops to other creams and lotions I use. It arrived appearing to be packaged well; however, the top was loosened and some oil got out and required clean up.</li>
            <li> I like the oil well enough but without a real organic certification I personally will choose to believe it is not organic until I see the seal.</li>
            <li> I add a little of the rosehip oil to my favorite hand lotion and it protects and heals my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I work in a hospital where I am constantly washing my hands and my skin would dry out . My hands healed immediately with this product. I also use this on my face with great results. Thank you for keeping its quality excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any cream, I believe. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a very good Rosehip oil. It has very nice smell. Very good to use as addition to Shea butter moisturizer. It comes in a glass brown bottle. The only reason I gave 4 stars because it came with plastic dropper and not the glass one as on the pictures. As an oil itself highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is soft, silky and fragrance-free. It feels smooth and not greasy at all. The product comes with a large glass eye-dropper that can be used to distribute the product, and it really comes out one drop at a time. This is an excellent bargain for the amount of oil you get. No nasty chemicals, or byproducts. This oil works great on scars and blemishes. I can&#x27;t wait to use it every day!</li>
            <li> Product came promptly and was as described.</li>
            <li> No scent whatsoever. I guess I expected some sort of scent. Good carrier oil. But Dropper is useless: it just drips. No need to squeeze. Will probably need to transfer to smaller bottles with better delivery system.</li>
            <li> I recently had breast surgery and I needed a product that was natural that will help me with my surgical scars.  It has not been a month, but the healing process has begun.  I use the Rosehip each morning and evening. It helps with the dryness and cracked skin.  It keeps my skin well moisturized.  The delivery was before the estimated date which was a plus.  I will order another bottle of Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Came with loose seal , spilled  inside the box. Smell horrible , like stale .</li>
            <li> I am using it to mix with my essential oil recipes and and very pleased with it.  The order and delivery process was smooth and efficient.  I will order again!</li>
            <li> Works well on the face for moisture and on hands right after washing them. Also use this on my lips before putting on my lipstick so they won&#x27;t be so dry.</li>
            <li> My clogged pore prone skin loves rosehip oil.  Helps reduce my clogged pores and eases wrinkles around my eyes, and sinks into my skin without being greasy.  I add a few drops of carrot seed oil for sunscreen and more wrinkle protection during the day.</li>
            <li> This is my new discovery for my daily skin care now. It&#x27;s supposed to help with improving your complexion, healing scars and fading dark marks. I have been using it for a while now at night time before going bed and waking up with better glowing skin. I have normal-combination skin and it didn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin. Also use it for stretchmarks over thighs and not sure if it is effective yet, too soon to see, but very hopeful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 other brands in addition to this one.  This brand seems to lack the richness of the others, feels more oily and doesn&#x27;t soak in as well.  The color of this brand was also comparable to almond oil coloring.  The other 2 brands were a nice warm amber color.</li>
            <li> With my mom hitting 60 she was looking for something that would work for her that wasn’t heavy and even would possibly help diminish fine lines around her eyes. When I got the chance to receive this at a promotional price and give an honest opinion on it I thought that was great. She has been using it for a couple of days and also has extremely sensitive skin. She loves this and finds that its not to heavy and doesn’t clog her pores which is something that she was concerned with. She loves how soft it is making her skin, she has a lot o sun damage and used to smoke so anything that works for her she is in love with. She is going to use this bottle until it runs out and will be purchasing this for herself. I am glad that I found something for my mom that works for her.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how many uses there are for Rosehip Oil. I am just getting into essential oils, and so I am learning all of the wonderful benefits that these oils provide. Upon receiving this, I noticed that Rosehip is used to combat one of my biggest problems, brittle nails. I can grow my nails, but they are very weak and always break, and of course always at the most inopportune moments when I don&#x27;t have nail clippers or a nail file to correct the issue. So I started using the rosehip oil, and massaging it into my cuticles every night before bed. I cannot believe the difference that it has made in my nails. They are stronger and beautiful, now I can start doing nail art, which has always been something that interested me. And this comes in a huge 4 oz bottle that will last for a very long time, so it is a great value as well. I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two different brands of rose hip oil. I had purchased the first one to use in my laundry soap I make at home as well as to put in the body wash and soaps I make from home as well. I am big on if I can make it at home I don&#x27;t buy it.  I found this price to be very reasonable.  When I was able to find a discount code to purchase this at a lower price i of course jumped on the opportunity.  There are many benefits of Rosehip oil.  Since it comes specifically from only one kind of rose it makes it just a little more special.  It has great properties like Vitamin A and C and has been known to help with fine lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen production.  It can also help reduce the appearance of scarring.  I also did research on the product to see what other benefits it held.  I found that it also can reduce UV damage already done to your skin. So many of us grew up in a time where tan was sexy.  And now we all live with a fear of the damage that is to come.  I love that this may reverse some of that and make my skin a little younger looking.  Very impressed with the size and packaging of this product as well as the quality.</li>
            <li> product is not cold pressed as advertised  Does not state that on the lable and company refuse to return my 3 messages regarding this.  Color is clear, should be dark orange. Poor quality, feels watery.</li>
            <li> There are so many glowing reviews on this, but I just wanted to add what I felt was significant after trying this oil for a month: Really does minimize stretch marks!  I am not new to oils, and have used (and DO use) other oils from Majestic Pure, however Rosehip Seed Oil was one that I had never tried. It is a lightweight, virtually odorless oil that is nice and light for the summer. My great interest in it was the claim that it reduces stretch marks, and I have some like that, (lines, etc) around my mouth and chin that I wanted to minimize. After a month of using this this oil exclusively, I find that it REALLY HAS minimized my mouth lines!  Not to any HUGE degree, like facial fillers would, but my skin around my mouth just looks smoother and the lines not as deep. I am thrilled with this product! Thank you Majestic Pure, you guys are an awesome company as well!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: so I started using this and I was not seeing the same great results I have been with my other oil. I repurchase the original oil and something is off here. The original is a lot more orange then what this company has produced. :/&lt;br /&gt;I have enclosed a photo of the original rose hip oil I have been using since my surgery, the product in question and then regular vegetable oil. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s vegetable oil but My opinion is this is NOT rosehip oil. Hmmmm make your own conclusion but this is not going on my skin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using rosehip oil since my emergency surgery in 2013. I have a pretty big 7 inch scar and this is what I use on it. It has flattened it and made my scar heal nicely (as nice as it can be, the surgeon even commented on how good it looks) I continue to use the oil nightly right out of the shower and it keeps it nice and soft as well as the skin around it. If i stop using this i notice the scar begins to itch. This is my first time trying this brand and although i have only used it once it is comparable to the one i just finished which was WAY more expensive. This soaks in to the skin very nicely without getting greasy.  I also use this oil after a home skin peel, wake up and my skin is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will update as I use this product more but so far I think it will work out.&lt;br /&gt;I was sold this item at a considerable discount to review it but once this bottle is up I will repurchase through them since its significantly cheaper then what I had been using.</li>
            <li> I use on nails and hair</li>
            <li> Wonderful on skin and nail. This is my daily skin care routine for anti aging and treating scars/ stretchmark. I usually mix with jojoba oil (you can use by itself) after a layer of moisturizer gel/ cream after shower. The purpose is to lock in the moist and nourish your skin. Very good amount of product with reasonable price. I love it.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my house uses this Rosehip oil. I have stretch marks and wrinkles I rub down every night. My daughters have dry scaly skin at times due to this weather and use this oil for a moisturizer. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t lead to more acne. Comes with a handy pipette to measure the amount you need. This was a large bottle more than I expected and will last awhile. Smelled very pleasant. It was a light amber color. I keep this Rosehip oil at the front of my oils because it can be used for so many things. I was able to buy this product during a promotion and am happy to share my experience with it.</li>
            <li> This is my First time trying rosehip oil. Can&#x27;t say much about how it worked on my problem areas as of yet because I just purchased it, however I can say as of right now the oil is not greasy if I use right amount on my face. It also do not have any offensive smell, it feels nice on the skin and seem to penetrate very well on my face, have used it twice now and I am loving it thus far. To me the seller was very considerate in including a dropper in the box with the oil. Everything came nicely packed and nothing was broken. Will return later on and give a more thorough review after using this product some more. Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> This oil makes my skin feel really really soft and not greasy (even though I have naturally oily skin and acne). I love to gently massage the oil into my face, as I can feel how soft it instantly makes my skin. I apply this at night after washing my face in conjunction with a vitamin A serum. While the vitamin A serum has been helping to heal my acne, the rose hip oil has been toning and softening my skin. Sometimes at night I will also apply argan oil around my eyes in conjunction with the rose hip oil and vitamin A serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying rose hip oil. I was curious if it would smell like roses, but it actually doesn&#x27;t really have much scent. I would definitely recommend trying this to see if it works for you in place of your typical nighttime moisturizer - unlike commercial moisturizers, this is organic and pure and free of chemicals/preservatives.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I have used this for a while before I wrote the review.  I have been using it on my face daily before my regular moisturizer.  I initially bought it to see if it would help the red areas on face that I believe are rosacea.  I will be honest and say that so far it hasn&#x27;t helped it but it does make my skin feel better and I feel like some of my lines and crows feet seem less noticeable. I was afraid the oil would make my face break out but so far that hasn&#x27;t happened.  I also mix a few drops in with Moroccan oil I use on hair.</li>
            <li> Good product/Fast Delivery.  Seeing noticeable lightening of old scars in about 2-3 weeks.  Will deifinitely buy again for this and other benefits.</li>
            <li> I got this to add to some of my at home remedies and even added a little to my henna paste to darken the color a bit. I really love the packaging which is a solid, brown glass with a great weight to it. This comes with a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; cap as well as a cap with a glass dropper built into it. This is pure and works great!</li>
            <li> Try on my hand it is very good.</li>
            <li> Mix this with some Lavender oil on my dry cracked hands and they instantly felt smooth and hydrated.  I&#x27;ve read reviews where others use it on their hair, cuticles, and face.  I also add a few drops of the rosehip oil in my lotion for extra hydration. Love the smell and efficacy of this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad as other reviews stated, actually, I barely can smell anything after applying to my hands. It goes smooth on the skin, and absorbs quickly, leaving skin soft and smooth, however, it tends to break out on my face, but it works fine with my cuticles, so I decided to use it for my cuticles for the most part. I&#x27;m using it to see how it woks on my dark spots too, I&#x27;m not expecting wonders though.</li>
            <li> Love applying this to my skin after cleansing it. It absorbs quickly into the skin, and leaves my skin feeling so soft, and smooth after applying. I personally prefer using oils on my skin rather than a cream moisturizer. I find that Rose-hip Oil improved my skin from it&#x27;s dry and acne prone state.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always acquiring new scars. Whether it&#x27;s from a cut, scrape or some other crazy accident I&#x27;m always in need of a way to reduce the ugly scars that come out of it. This Rosehip oil seems to be doing the trick quite nicely. It has improved the look of several of my scars and reduced their visibility quite nicely. I think this is an excellent product and worth your consideration!!</li>
            <li> truly great product. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Great oil and absorbs well.  Used it on fingers and toes! You can also use it all over your body. I have sensitive skin and have had absolutely no adverse reaction.  The company also sent me a follow up email to advise on its multiple uses.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I own several Majestic Pure products and they have always provided me with top customer service. Majestic Pure offers very high quality, pure and organic oils with some of the best packaging I have owned! The rosehip oil came packed in a sturdy glass bottle and a glass dropper. The glass packaging insures that the oil is kept cool and fresh and toxin free and the dropper works great to measure the right amount of oil needed. I purchased this item using a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is one of my favorite oils of all time! I have replaced all my commercial lotions with this 100% pure natural oil. My skin loves the oil and quickly absorbs it, leaving no greasy feelings. The oil has no scent and has a clear, slightly yellow color. The bottle includes several uses and directions on the label which is great because I have a huge collection of oils. I also us this rosehip oil nightly to heal my husband&#x27;s skin eczema, he likes the oil because it alleviates the itching and has visibly helped the appearance of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is HUGE and was filled to the top. I am very satisfied with this purchase and will purchase another bottle once mine runs oil. The oil is great for skin, face and body. I would highly recommend any Majestic Pure product to friends and family! Price is great for the size and quality of the oil!</li>
            <li> I put it in my coffee... delicious vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I had never used rosehip oil before but someone recommended it to me after a medicine I was taking caused a lot of drying and damage to my hair.  I actually rubbed this oil right into my scalp as well as putting it on the dry ends after showering.  I didn&#x27;t need to rinse it out and my hair was not greasy.  It is doing wonders for my hair.  The bottle is a very generous size and will last me quite some time.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make a solution for healing scars. I combined (equal parts of the following):&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Juice&lt;br /&gt;Almond Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;added a couple drops each of:&lt;br /&gt;Rose Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;Lemon Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;Helichrysum Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placed all ingredients into roller ball to use to help heal &amp; lighten old scars.</li>
            <li> I am wondering what is the rose hip oil? Really, it feels like a liquid, and absorbs like a water based, not oil based. Has no improvement so far over 2 weeks.. I don&#x27;t think I will order this anymore</li>
            <li> Love this oil for my face, absorbs quickly and does not make me break out. Will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil I received was awesome. I have normal skin and it got absorbed easily and within mins I felt like there was nothing on my skin. My skin feels fresh and moisturised. Currently I&#x27;m suffering from a bout of acne and so used the oil only a couple of times. Waiting for this attack to subside and then use it regularly to combat  the scarring.</li>
            <li> This Rosehip oil is one of the best oil I have ever used. It is very lax and does not simply sit on your skin when applied, like other oils. Rather, the oil is quickly absorbed and the skin is moisturized within minutes. You do not need to apply a lot on the skin, a little bit goes quite a long way. This product has greatly helped me fade my acne scars and is very gentle on the face. It is a great moisturizer for the face and body. It is also great for the hair, just massage a bit of rosehip oil 20-30 minutes before you shower will result in soft, smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;However, be aware that this oil has a rather pungent, almost damp smell. Some people may find it revolting, I personally do not. So buy this product knowing that it has a rather interesting smell. Overall, this is an amazing oil that will help moisturize your face, body and hair. If you have acne scars or irritations, this rosehip oil does a great job of soothing your skin and fading the scars.</li>
            <li> This is a great poduct... it gives your skin radiance and glow throughout the day.</li>

            <li> My daughter has eczema and this oil has helped keep her skin nice and moisturized.She has dry sensitive skin and when I apply Rosehip Oil to her skin it immediately hydrates her.Less irritation of her skin.I love the size of this bottle it is huge compared to the standard little ones.I also love the dropper it comes with it makes keeping track of the drops you use easier than say using the bottle.I don&#x27;t know how many times I have over used the oil by using the standard little bottles.Sometimes it comes out too fast and you can easily use to much.This is an awesome skin moisturizer and it is pure and organic.Love it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this product for this long. I am so glad I was given the opportunity to try this product for a review - I will never be without it in my skin care regimen ever again.&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say that this bottle is a generous size. It came bubble wrapped in a thick cardboard box, so there was no chance of spillage or leakage upon delivery. There was a sticker on the outside of the box with the manufacturing date and shelf life ( 3 years!). I took that sticker off and placed it right on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the rose hip oil primarily on my nail beds to reduce cracking from the dryness of winter. My nail beds are so healthy and they look &#x27;normal&#x27; again.  I also used a few drops on my hands; it seemed no matter what cream or lotion I used my hands were always dry ( dishpan hands, winter, etc etc. ) . The Rose hip oil worked wonders for the dryness I  had been experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found that the Rose hip oil works on my hair and scalp! I have very thick, curly, coarse hair. I use a lot of product ( sprays, gels) to keep the frizz at a minimum and my curls defined. I have noticed lately that I have been scratching at my scalp more than usual; although I do not have dandruff. I read that Rose hip oil could be used on the hair , so I tried it. When my hair was still wet, I used the dropper provided and used about 6 drops around my temples, and a few directly centered on my scalp. . I combed it through;  my hair is not greasy, there is no residue; my hair is softer and my scalp is moisturized. I intend to use this everyday from now on to ensure a healthy head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this all natural product. So many uses - highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE 3/2015**** I will be buying more of this product when I am finished. By far the most valuable of all the essential oils I own. It is great for cuticles in the winter. It sits on my bedside table and I use it nightly for my cuticles and spots of eczema that pop up. Soothes &amp; gets rid of dry patches like no other product I have ever tried. ROSE HIP OIL WORKS!!!! *****othes &amp; gets rid of dry patches like no other product I have ever tried. ROSE HIP OIL WORKS!!!! *****</li>
            <li> I am glad I receive a sample of rosehip oil because my skin was feeling rough and quite dry due to my cleansing products, but this oil is amazing! This oil is non-greasy, light weight and absorbs right away. Since adding this oil, about 2 weeks ago, my skin has improved. I have a combination type of skin and some parts of, my skin were oily yet dehydrated, and other parts flaky and now my skin is much smoother, softer, and plumper. This oil also makes my skin glow. I mix one drop of rosehip oil with oil-free moisturizer and I use it all over my face, around my eyes and neck, mostly as a night treatment. It&#x27;s a great for wintertime. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used the Majestic Pure Rosehip Oil to lightened the stretch marks on my arm surrounding my tattoos . It lightened the area and didn&#x27;t do any discoloration like other stretch mark lighteners. It was grease less , so I was able to wear a white light weight sweater over it with ease. I also used it on my face for a minor scar- and the scar is now gone.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Packages wonderfully!  Just as described, am looking forward to using.</li>
            <li> I love this solution. I use these every morning as a part of my daily routine and these haven&#x27;t let me down yet. For about /2 the price of stores this is a great option. Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it from head to toe.  It goes easy and  and absorbs fast.  Not at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week or two now on my hands, elbows and chest mixed with regular lotion  I cannot say I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference but will still continue to use and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> Love how this brand of rosehip oil feels on my face.  Not too greasy and absorbs well into the skin.  Better than another brand I was using.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago to help out my super dry skin and I absolutely love it! I put 3 drops on my clean hands and pat it on my face twice a day and I&#x27;m starting to see a difference. I stopped using my moisturizers and use this instead. My skin looks like its glowing and I love that it absorbs so fast so I dont look greasy. Sadly I have very very dry skin around my eyes, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had since I was 18 (I&#x27;m 24), and it didn&#x27;t help out much. I probably need a dermatologist at this point since nothing seems to work. However, I still adore this oil and how soft it left my face and hands. I&#x27;m absolutely going to buy more whennever I run out and also try out more products from magestic pure.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Using it for a nighttime face moisturizer.  It seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I must say that the price is really worth it. The quantity and quality far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of homemade lotions, and I added this to evening primrose oil to make a lotion for my oily (but 40-something) skin. It seems like a high quality product, and the size is a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly, very well packed, and this is a generous bottle of rose hip oil. I use it every day from head to toe...a little bit goes a long way and sooo good for your skin! My face loves it!</li>
            <li> Great product . Clean, pure and meets my needs for natural beauty care and essential oils. Great customer service - they kept me aware of shipping as well as checking if I enjoyed product !</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil feel nice on my skin and my hair too.</li>
            <li> This comes in an amber glass bottle with a glass dropper.  The smell seems to be lighter than I am used to, but that is a good thing.  It is yellowish in color so I am not sure why the bad reviews say its not.  In general the yellower it is the better it is.  Rosehip oil contains retinol (vitamin A), vitamin C, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids. These combined nutrients make it a great skincare product. If you look at a lot of your skincare products, you will see this ingredient in there, so why not skip all the chemicals those other products have &amp; just use the natural source!</li>
            <li> Wow. What a nice big size! Comes with the dropper too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses this for moisture all summer. This particular brand is very light in color and free of odor unlike other brands. While I have to wonder if this indicates that a lot of the good stuff has been stripped out in the processing, it works so nicely that I don&#x27;t wonder for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can see results to skin tone/texture within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on her experience I would recommend this product as a value for the price! I did receive a slight discount for honest feedback.  If you are in the market this product could work well for you!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I question the authenticity of this product. My product is almost clear and has no discernible smell. From my research and other products I have tried, this oil should&#x27;ve been darker in color and have a nutty smell. I have emailed the company about this and am waiting for a reply. I do believe that this is not 100% rosehip oil, as other reviewers seem to agree with.</li>
            <li> Love it. Calmed the redness of my skin and made a good primer for my foundation.</li>
            <li> Not for my face.  I got little oily bumps on my face the 1st time I use it.  Now I use two drops on my face in the morning, I wait a little then wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;My face is OK, no bump.  I can&#x27;t not use this oily over night.  The bottle is not a great, it is messy.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Like the other products within this company, these bottles are huge. I always wanted to try Rosehip Oil but the it  was always a small bottle with a large price. This is a the perfect price and size. I love having the dropper because I control the amount used, which is not a lot. I have scars from adult acne and I two nights into using this product. I treated a spot that would have become an issue and the next morning it was gone. I am so excited to watch my scar disappear because I hate wearing make up during the Summer months. DO NOT expect this to smell of roses, in fact, this smell is not as bad as other&#x27;s I have sampled. Once you apply the oil the scent is no longer there. Your skin just looks soft and very hydrated.</li>
            <li> Due to my acne outbreaks on my face, I always have this scar from old acne that leaves marks in my face that is not suppose to be there if you want a beautiful healthy skin. This oil  not only comes in 4 oz and a great price for its size but also perfect for the imperfections on my face. Just apply 2-3x a day will heal and lighten my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I love this Rosehip Oil, I had other brand before and i would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> The color of the oil was not orange like the video shown in some other people&#x27;s review. It was a very pale yellow hint. Unlike some other reviews, there&#x27;s also no awful smell whatsoever. I was looking for orange tinted oil so I returned it. Maybe it works fine regardless of the color, but just not what I was looking for. So I returned it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this oil, I loved the results.  It helped improve fine lines, as well as the tone and texture of my skin.  The second time I bought it, however, it didn&#x27;t seem to be the same oil.  The color was no longer amber and the earthy scent was gone, but so were the great results.  I&#x27;m so disappointed, because I loved what Majestic Pure&#x27;s rosehip oil had done for my skin the first time around.</li>
            <li> Only using  a few days now. Bought another brand before. Price is great. Loving it so far! Feels wonderful on my face.</li>
            <li> I received this rosehip oil for a consumer review. I love it. It is very easy to use. Just apply a couple of drops of the oil onto your fingertips using the dropper provided and gently rub into the area you want to use it on. The consistency feels very similar to baby oil, although not as thick or as heavy once applied to your skin. Use this oil a couple of times a day and consistently so that you get the best results. You get a really large bottle of it so you can concentrate on many areas at once. The bottle is a full 4 ounces, or 118 ml. I used the oil on my face for acne and wrinkles and I also used it on my stomach where I have some stretch marks. The rosehip oil takes a little bit of time to show results, but use it every day so that you maximize the effects. I will also be using it on some really deep scars that I have in two places. Just with the first application I could feel how soft my skin can be. It does not feel greasy, but silky. It absorbed quickly and completely into my skin. There are many benefits of using the rosehip oil. It helps with many skin conditions including acne, eczema and dermatitis. It is also great for scars and stretch marks. It will help your skin with elasticity as well as radiant youthful look and reversal of aging when used over time. It is also great for hair, even permed or dyed hair! I am looking forward to the benefit of it aiding with brittle nails. My nails break often and without supplements or vitamins they take on a ridge potato chip quality. I am using the rosehip on my nails because it is good for them. I love how soft my skin feels after I use the rosehip oil. It would make a great massage oil or be really good for aromatherapy. I know many people want to know if it is organic, and it is. COMPLETELY ORGANIC. I dont notice an overbearing scent from the bottle which I am okay with. I like to be able to smell like my perfume or body spray and was able to do so without the two fighting for attention in my nostrils. I love that this product comes with a money back guarantee. They stand behind the quality of their product and if you are not satisfied you can get a full refund.e that this product comes with a money back guarantee. They stand behind the quality of their product and if you are not satisfied you can get a full refund.</li>
            <li> The product and the customer service far exceeds my expectations, what I really like most is the helpful leaflet describing the uses for the oils. Nice touch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a week now and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference, except that it gave me more some pimples. Haha</li>
            <li> A life changer! A Must have !!! From head to toe ! You will forever know This must Never go! :)</li>
            <li> This is really.My wife loves it.She&#x27;s pregnant and she uses this oil because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the cocoa butter and all the other oils for stretch marks. She&#x27;s only 15weeks and she&#x27;s satisfied with it. Price and quantity.</li>
            <li> keep your skin young with this!  And such a good price</li>
            <li> Amazing product! My whole family is now using it, and loving it!</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day on my face and also on my legs and arms. It completely reversed my dry skin problem. It doesn&#x27;t take much to to the job. I am definitely a big fan of rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I love all oils. This oil in particular is really good for skin, hair and nails. It can help repair multiple skin issues. The smell is not fantastic, but I can look (smell?) past that. I love it, and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> I used this in a face mask that I made and afterwards my skin felt both soft and supple. It was amazing! Im so glad that I got it a discount for review!</li>
            <li> I love how the rose oil absorbs into my skin without feeling oily and my skin feels hydrated all day long. I use a dab in the hair also and it feels so soft but not weighed down or greasy. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this, great quality, fast shipping. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I received a discount on the product in order to review it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was a dropper top provided in the box. I&#x27;m looking forward to using this great smelling oil on some acne scars and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This company is Amazing.  They are my new go-to place for essential oil.</li>
            <li> Works good. Cheaper than other rosehip oils I&#x27;ve bought in the past but not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to restore the natural color of my lips, after suffering an allergic reaction to Colgate Total toothpaste. My lips were swollen, cracked, and left dark. I googled natural methods and Rosehip oil came up in several searches. After two weeks, my lips are returning to their normal color. I&#x27;ve been taking pictures so I won&#x27;t get discouraged and I see the difference. I think in four weeks I will be back to normal. This oil is light and has no scent. I apply it three times per day.</li>
            <li> I have gotten other oils from this company before and absolutely loved them. I ordered this oil because I have heard that it can help with scars and stretchmarks. When it arrived I was very happy to see that the label on the bottle not only gave clear and easy directions about how to use the oil, but also has a list of many other uses for the oil too. It can be used for naturally toning skin, moisturizing, sunburn, wrinkles and much more. Aside from the quality of the oil being above it&#x27;s competitors, I also really love this company because of the way they package their oils. The bottle is glass and very thick and strong, and it comes with an eye dropper which can replace the cap. The eye dropped also makes it extra easy to get the exact amount of oil you need in the exact place you need- makes application of the oil so easy!&lt;br /&gt;product was purchased for the intent of review</li>
            <li> I use it at night on my face, and when I wake up, it feels really soft.  Not oily.  I have only been using it for two weeks, it is too soon to say if it is doing something on my fine lines, but I do like the way I look when I wake up.  Also, my daughter went to the beach last weekend, and she got a sunburn in her shoulders, she used it, and it calmed the redness, she was surprised.</li>
            <li> Just started using. Very subtle scent only just briefly, smells fine/nice. Absorbs into skin after some minutes when put on after bathing. Face, arms, butt, legs. How can it smooth skin thats crepey or wrinklyish so fast? My thighs are great. Arms. Face much improved in only first week. How I use: I combine in my hand then smooth on: squirt of Earth&#x27;s Daughter organic cold pressed pure aloe vera (best aloe vera I have found anywhere), then 1-3 drops of rose hip seed oil and then smooth on all over. For face/neck I put on the aloe first, then follow with a drop on finger smoothed on - drop on forehead, 1 on each side of face and 2 on neck. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Best moisturizer skin combo I have found among all mass market OTC moisturizers, organic pure products, etc. Tried &#x27;em all. Halelujah. My skin has never been happier. I am not young and my skin is vastly smoother and somehow better. My thighs have gotten younger. Geez Louise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sensitivity reaction on sensitive face, and less wrinkling. Better than the many over the counter toxic mass marketed moisturizers for sure. Nothing bad in it at all!! Been using it a few months now but improvements seen/felt in first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to try it because it is a &amp;#34;...hydrator full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, restore skin elasticity, and boost collagen production, all while reducing scars and fine lines&amp;#34;. Seems to be that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To store it I put the bottle in fridge and put just a week&#x27;s worth (small amount) into a new small blue glass dropper bottle for use in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought it to try it after reading the literature and reviews on my own; was not compensated to review. Wanted to stop using unhealthy chemical products since our skin absorbs everything.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and the rosehip oil is helping that.</li>
            <li> I like these long eye droppers.</li>
            <li> Nice nice oil. I use it anywhere I have dry skin. Doesn&#x27;t have any odor. I do mix it with essential oils and it works great on my face. Not too heavy for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  made my own DYI facial serum with this along with some essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great product that I use daily as a moisturizer.  Will be ordering again.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil to add to your beauty routine! Lots of uses for just your hair alone - great for dry/dull hair and dandruff. Makes a great moisturizer for dry skin. Put it on a sunburn to help ease the pain and speed up the healing process. Or use it for scars or stretch marks, helps heal them/make them less visible. Great purchase price for such a huge bottle of this amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this that it&#x27;s better than nothing. Rosehip plus is so far the best for me. I was looking for something better than rosehip plus.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days. My skin was dry so started using this and has made a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this oil. I use it as an oil moisturizer for my skin, to help treat my minor hyperpigmentation, as an anti-aging treatment for my skin, and as UV protection in the warmer months. Currently, I mix it with my jojoba oil (5 drops, rose hip oil 2-3 drops) in the evening. In the morning I mix two drops of jojoba oil and one drop of rose hip oil with my moisturizer. In the evening I like that it sits on my skin as protection (for some reason my skin dries out in the evening), and during the day I feel like adding it to my moisturizer helps it sink deeper into the skin. I also add a bit on any dry areas to keep any dry skin issues at bay (I have not been to a doctor but I believe I suffer from very minor dermatitis and this completely rids me of that. I apply on wet skin, let it sit for a few minutes then follow up with my usual moisturizer). I love the combo of rose hip oil and jojoba oil because jojoba oil on its own is too greasy for my skin, rose hip oil penetrates much deeper into the skin but its a dry oil so sometimes it can dry out the skin. Mixing both is the perfect solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also...I store my rose hip oil in the fridge and take it out every morning and evening to get a few drops. Because this is a 4oz container and it will take my a long time to go through I feel like this is the best way for me to keep it fresh. I am considering putting it in a smaller (1 oz) dropping container and freezing the rest because I anticipate this taking me quite a long time to go through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am extremely satisfied with this product. If you are looking for something to even out and refine your skin this is the perfect product. This in conjunction with daily exfoliation (I was with black soap) has evened out my skin tone in a matter of weeks, I cannot wait to see the quality of my skin by the end of the summer.</li>
            <li> Okay, it is supposed to be 100% pure Rosehip Oil, but there is no rose scent at all.  I&#x27;ve purchased others and they all had the scent of roses.</li>
            <li> For starters, for everyone who thinks that rosehip oil does not smell like roses. It actually has no smell at all and absorbs into your skin quickly.  I have been using it on my scars and I am seeing difference already. I think that after prolonged use my scars will be gone in no time.  I am thankful for the opportunity to receive the oil at a special price and provide my honest opinion.  This oil can also be used as a skin moisturizer. I will definitely make sure to keep this oil on my bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to swear by it, but I can say that I had three dark mark on my left cheek and they have faded quite a bit. The product is in a very generous container, a little goes a long way, it seems as the skin absorbs it pretty quick. So for me at the moment I have to say is worth it and I will continue using.</li>
            <li> Reduces the acne on my skin, helps diminish wrinkles, evens out skin tone, and is an all around good moisturizing oil for body, nails, and hair. Doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;fish oil&#x27; smell like another brand I purchased. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all, unless you really put your nose to the bottle. A little bit goes a long way. It comes with a dropper, is well sealed and protected when shipping, and has a manufacture/use by date on the box it came in. Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> Rosehip Seed Oil is an amazingly versatile product! A wonderful hydrator full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, restore skin elasticity, and boost collagen production, all while reducing scars and fine lines. It can also be used as an addition to lotions and creams, as it’s anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant, which helps to decrease environmental damage and soothe the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Because it is so gentle, Rosehip Seed Oil can be used as a serum to the face after cleansing, as a general body oil to soften and rejuvenate skin, and to nourish hair. I add a few drops to my moisturizer and love how fresh my face looks in the morning! I also like to put a few droplets on my fingertips and run them through my hair. It leave my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and super healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Pure&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil is the highest quality there is - cold pressed, 100% pure , organic, certified no additive, or fillers and fresh. It comes in an amber colored 4 Oz. glass bottle with a glass dropper. The Rosehip seed oil is a light amber color, with a light, subtle, slightly earthy &amp; nutty scent. It glides smoothly onto the skin soaking in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this rosehip oil on my arms, which have developed lots of age spots and excessive dryness. It has faded most of them. I was pleasantly surprised. Even my husband noticed the difference. I love using it on my cuticles and any place where dryness is an issue. Great product!</li>
            <li> This oil is truly a life changer for me. I will no longer use lotion or Vaseline. My plan is to go all natural. I&#x27;ve also used it for my hair and now my hair is so soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it 💟</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the great reviews.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long, so it&#x27;s too soon to say if I notice any changes in my skin.  I noticed several reviewers commenting on the smell of this rosehip oil; however, mine has no odor at all.  Makes me wonder if the oil I received has degraded in some way, whether from heat during shipping or age of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When taking the dropper out of the oil, one needs to be careful to scrape the sides of the dropper on the inside of the bottle; otherwise, the oil will just pour out and spill everywhere.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting this, so a good bit came out the first time.  It seems like the oil doesn&#x27;t stay in the dropper . . . it just drips out without squeezing the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update my review after I&#x27;ve had more time to test it.</li>
            <li> I have used the oil. It is very easy to apply without any mess...great product!</li>
            <li> Awesome on the dry skin but a little oily when first put on and the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest. I added a little of my favorite smell and now it&#x27;s perfect...</li>
            <li> i used this along side some other essential oils and the results were wonderful! made such a great addition! i highly recommend! majestic pure has such a wonderful rosehip essential oil as well as many others! i am so happy to have received the wonderful rosehip oil from majestic pure complementary to present you my thoughts and opinions. i highly recommend this rosehip oil as well as the majestic pure line of essential oils! they please every time!</li>
            <li> Just arrived after only 2 days! Very fast service. The oil is a nice thick consistency not runny or drippy. I used to purchase a 1 oz  bottle for $26 but now I can order Rosehip oil  in a larger bottle for so much less. I am very happy with my purchase.  Rosehip is wonderful for your face and I use it as a serum before I put on my moisturizer. I am 55 years old and have found that oils like this one can really soften the wrinkles and fine lines on your face.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to use the Rosehip oil for, but based on what the bottle said, I figured I&#x27;d try it out as a moisturizer. Initially, I really liked it as a face moisturizer because it was lightweight, didn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy or filmy, and there wasn&#x27;t much of a smell. However, after a week of use, I noticed I have a lot more break outs. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the oil, but that&#x27;s the only part of my skin regiment I&#x27;ve changed. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it on my face anymore, but will continue to use it all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it says it would be good for brittle nails, I thought it might be useful to use on my hair. I used it as an anti frizz serum, and thought it worked wonderfully. No greasy residue but helped my hair look less frizzy from the humidity.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is great stuff.  Long time ago I went and had facials and they face wash had some rose hips in it, loved that stuff. Have been looking every since and finally stumbled across this.  Read the reviews and decided to try it.  I have been using it for only about 3-4 days and saw instant  results.  My face is ALOT clearer and hopefully will stay that way.  See how it works for everything else over time, but so far I am Amazed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil as a sample for review and evaluation and so far I really like it! I have heard a lot of back and forth about the scent but for me I can barely smell it and it&#x27;s similar to olive oil smell only much weaker. I don&#x27;t smell anything at all after it&#x27;s applied to my skin and I love they way it feels once it has absorbs. I use this around my cuticles because they are so super dry and the winter has done a number on them. I have recently seen some facial recipes that call for rosehip oil so am excited to try those out. I love that this oil is organic and comes with a dropper. If I am applying it to my face I sometimes drop the oil onto a cotton ball then massage the skin. It gives me a deeper hydration and nice healthy glow. Overall I am very pleased with this oil and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> great quality that i will enjoy using</li>
            <li> Great oil. My mom uses it on her face before sleep and she says they&#x27;ve really helped her complexion and wrinkles. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I am loving the oils from Majestic Pure. The rosehip oil is one of my favorites so far.&lt;br /&gt;Like the other oils they offer, it has so many uses and works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;It’s brimming with natural nutrients and vitamins and can be used on hair skin and nails,and is also used in aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I use the product in my anti-aging routine, Applying it to dark spots and problem areas provides obvious results.&lt;br /&gt;More uses for the product are:&lt;br /&gt;Dermatitis&lt;br /&gt;Age spots&lt;br /&gt;Brittle nails&lt;br /&gt;Psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;Eczema&lt;br /&gt;Hyper-pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;Burns, radiation and sun&lt;br /&gt;Dry and damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product at a reduced cost for my hones evaluation. All observations are my own and 100% unbiased</li>
            <li> I like it.  Don&#x27;t fill the dropper all the way.  Just pull up a few drops of oil.  It has a tendency to leak from the dropper.  So, go slowly and have your hand (or whatever your using to apply) ready.</li>
