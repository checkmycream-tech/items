    <ol>
            <li>so this was a perfect choice for eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Product title describes it perfectly.</li>
            <li>This was a great product and my friend was really happy to get it!</li>
            <li>Great color.</li>
            <li>It goes on great with out smearing it.</li>
            <li>Easy application and awesome results.  </li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner and is at a very good price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it had a good rating on EWG&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>Great price, good product, easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>My favorite eye liner!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, she was happy with it and we will order it again.</li>
            <li>It goes on real smooth.</li>
            <li>The color is nice and it stays put all day.</li>
            <li>I think I will keep buying the unstoppable instead because it stays put in warm weather.</li>
            <li>It is not waterproof, nor suitable for those who can&#x27;t help rubbing their eyes, but it provides a pop to my eyelids without looking like a raccoon.  </li>
            <li>Nice accurate tip for a nice neat line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not overly pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Jean</li>
            <li>a bit softer than anticipated but still works OK</li>
            <li>my favorite go-to eyeliner</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best price available!</li>
            <li>I think its great for day time as some of the liquid ones are a bit much for day</li>
            <li>Better to have nothing than this.</li>
            <li>The gel eye liner is much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more a fan of kohl or liquid liners because of the precision&amp;look</li>
            <li>I wish the onscreen depiction of the color showed more accurately the color.</li>
            <li>Also love the smudging end for smooth blending.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily</li>
            <li>It just wears off extremely easily.</li>
            <li>The blender is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love simple affordable items that give consistently great results.  </li>
            <li>affordable, easy to use, non-irritating.</li>
            <li>Overall it is easy to use and get a nice tidy result.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on smoothly and I will.</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>Ow be able to conveniently reorder knowing that I will get the right color and product,</li>
            <li>If you prefer the soft ready glide then this is great.</li>
            <li>It came right on time!</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my teenage daughter based on the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Love the soft tip to apply,  easy to correct mistakes with</li>
            <li>Smudges easily when you want it to, stays a crisp line when you want it to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a more natural eyeliner that works on waterlines</li>
            <li>These eyeliners go on smooth, there&#x27;s no sharpening other than coloring on a piece of paper to get a nice edge.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast too!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, stays nearly all day, always stays sharpened, and the blending tip is just the right softness and texture to be really useful.</li>
            <li>Good eyeliner but very dark.</li>
            <li>I think personally I like the dryness of a pencil better.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it intends.</li>
            <li>This Eyeliner is exactly that.</li>
            <li>Sure enough--it came out red with a hint of brown.</li>
            <li>It is dark brown, not black, which is softer for fair skinned brunettes, and looks much more natural on me.  </li>
            <li>Liner was ok but doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and eyes and my stores nearby</li>
            <li>Perfect Point Plus are dry and won&#x27;t smudge easily, and the blending tip is all but useless.</li>
            <li>So I purchased Maybelline&#x27;s Unstoppable waterproof in expresso, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly but instantly smudges.</li>
            <li>Very embarassing.</li>
            <li>If you do smear it you have an eraser on the other end to use, i like it a lot more than some of the others i have had used.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding eyeliner that is the dark brown color I prefer and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this eyeliner multiple times in multiple colors and have been continuously pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know; however, anyone with darker hair or high contrast coloring (Winters) would not want to use Chestnut Brown.  </li>
            <li>I normally buy maybeline unstoppable but on a whim bought this stuff.</li>
            <li>Okay formular but smudges after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I do live in the desert</li>
            <li>and I particularly like that I don&#x27;t need to use a pencil sharpener, which doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this twist up one.  </li>
            <li>The liner is very soft, so every time I wanted to sharpen it, the pencil broke, wasting a lot of products.</li>
            <li>Easy application and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Product performs exactly the same as before.  </li>
            <li>No little wood fragments close to my eyes!</li>
            <li>I have to take my earlier rating down a star, thought it is mostly my fault.  </li>
            <li>I like this eyeliner because it applies very well to my lower and upper waterlines.</li>
            <li>but so far, I haven&#x27;t found one.</li>
            <li>I like this pencil because it is soft, has  built in sharpener, and even a smudge tip on one end.  </li>
            <li>I really like Maybelline New York define-A-Liner Eyeliner, Brownish black, it is a  just the right shade, because just black is to dark but making it brownish black is a lot better.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m now 53), I haven&#x27;t really been able to use the hard pencil eyeliners because they skip, and I don&#x27;t like stretching my eyelids tight to eliminate the gaps.</li>
            <li>I guess brownish black is more on the black side than the brown side.</li>
            <li>Its title of \\&quot;Define-A-Line\\&quot; is an accurate selling point because, unlike other liners, it&#x27;s able to achieve a line as thin or thick as you please.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but this creamy liner goes on very smoothly and without fear of stabbing out an eye.</li>
            <li> Other than the shade, I like this product:  </li>
            <li> Other &amp;#34;always sharp&amp;#34; eyeliners like the Cover Girl</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little softer then I hoped.</li>
            <li> Applying it made me look as if I&#x27;d been crying or was coming down with &amp;#34;pink eye&amp;#34;!.  </li>
            <li> It rubs off within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some really expensive eyeliners, and always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Brown-Black in the past, but decided to try Chestnut Brown.</li>
            <li> The tip is too thick and it is hard to define the brow without it looking overdone.</li>
            <li> Some days goes on so thick</li>
            <li> At my age, I want to avoid a hard line and go for a smoky look instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boom!</li>
            <li> I hate going to the store and rummaging through the options to only get home and find that I have the wrong color.</li>
            <li> So for that I gave it a mediocre rating.</li>
            <li> It looks awful, like I&#x27;m wearing last nights makeup.</li>
            <li> However after I opened it and tryed it on, I read the ingredients and was shocked to see propylparaben listed.</li>
            <li> The sharpener is useless!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst eyeliner I have ever purchase.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this eyeliner because it applies very well to my lower and upper waterlines. Charcoal pencils don&#x27;t work well for me and neither do liquid liners. The texture of this is in-between, like a cream stick or moist charcoal pencil. The color is spot on and it lasts throughout the day for me. I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a more natural eyeliner that works on waterlines but so far, I haven&#x27;t found one. Until I do, this Maybelline eyeliner will remain the last non-natural piece of makeup in my collection.</li>
            <li> Love this! Arrived super fast too!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and I like the color, but it runs and smudges during wear. So for that I gave it a mediocre rating.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it had a good rating on EWG&#x27;s website.  However after I opened it and tryed it on, I read the ingredients and was shocked to see propylparaben listed. EWG obviously made a mistake as they discuss the dangers of this ingredient on their website, and it was not listed as one of the ingredients of this product.  So I purchased Maybelline&#x27;s Unstoppable waterproof in expresso, which I really like.  The color is nice and it stays put all day.</li>
            <li> I normally buy maybeline unstoppable but on a whim bought this stuff. I think I will keep buying the unstoppable instead because it stays put in warm weather. this one smears after a few hours, the unstoppable takes much longer to smear so I will not buy this define a liner again.</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes and brown hair so this was a perfect choice for eyeliner. The eyeliner does fade as the day goes on but I like that it turns into an eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly pleased with this. It rubs off within a few hours. Not worth the hassle. Go with a covergirl product.</li>
            <li> I hate going to the store and rummaging through the options to only get home and find that I have the wrong color. This eyeliner goes on smoothly and I will. Ow be able to conveniently reorder knowing that I will get the right color and product,</li>
            <li> My favorite eye liner! Applies smoothly. Great color. Never runs.</li>
            <li> After about the age of 45 (I&#x27;m now 53), I haven&#x27;t really been able to use the hard pencil eyeliners because they skip, and I don&#x27;t like stretching my eyelids tight to eliminate the gaps. I feel like that&#x27;s only going to add wrinkles. These eyeliners go on smooth, there&#x27;s no sharpening other than coloring on a piece of paper to get a nice edge. No little wood fragments close to my eyes! Also love the smudging end for smooth blending. At my age, I want to avoid a hard line and go for a smoky look instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boom! I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my teenage daughter based on the good reviews.  She had not tried this eye liner before.  Fortunately, she was happy with it and we will order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some really expensive eyeliners, and always come back to this one.  It works well and I particularly like that I don&#x27;t need to use a pencil sharpener, which doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this twist up one.  Not for people who rub their eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like Maybelline New York define-A-Liner Eyeliner, Brownish black, it is a  just the right shade, because just black is to dark but making it brownish black is a lot better. It goes on great with out smearing it. If you do smear it you have an eraser on the other end to use, i like it a lot more than some of the others i have had used. It goes on real smooth. Thank you for the product.Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Jean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little softer then I hoped. Some days goes on so thick it almost feels like it just melts onto the lid. If you prefer the soft ready glide then this is great. Also feel like I&#x27;m wasting a lot because I constantly have to sharpen it. I think personally I like the dryness of a pencil better. I do live in the desert and it&#x27;s summer ... could be part of the problem.</li>
            <li> The tip is too thick and it is hard to define the brow without it looking overdone.</li>
            <li> a bit softer than anticipated but still works OK</li>
            <li> my favorite go-to eyeliner</li>
            <li> Good eyeliner but very dark. I guess brownish black is more on the black side than the brown side. Still, it&#x27;s cute so isn&#x27;t that all that matters?</li>
            <li> Easy application and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Different packaging than the traditional one pictured.  Product performs exactly the same as before.  Easy application and awesome results.  Smudger also flips over to become a sharpener if needed.  This is definitely the best price available!</li>
            <li> ive used mine for a month, and i dont have oily face, and this product is oily i used it for my smoky eyes.</li>
            <li> This was a great product and my friend was really happy to get it! It came right on time! Yay!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it intends. It just wears off extremely easily. I would recommend getting the water resistant one instead.</li>
            <li> I like this and use every day.  Nice accurate tip for a nice neat line.  The blender is easy to use.  Overall it is easy to use and get a nice tidy result.  I think its great for day time as some of the liquid ones are a bit much for day</li>
            <li> This is the worst eyeliner I have ever purchase. It goes on smoothly but instantly smudges. Shortly after putting it on I have raccoon eyes- it all smudged to my lower lashes/under eye area.  It looks awful, like I&#x27;m wearing last nights makeup. Avoid.  Better to have nothing than this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  My favorite eyeliner and is at a very good price.  I have a hard time finding eyeliner that is the dark brown color I prefer and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love simple affordable items that give consistently great results.  This Eyeliner is exactly that. I have to take my earlier rating down a star, thought it is mostly my fault.  I&#x27;ve used Brown-Black in the past, but decided to try Chestnut Brown. Big Mistake!  Color is almost red.  Applying it made me look as if I&#x27;d been crying or was coming down with &amp;#34;pink eye&amp;#34;!.  I tried the product on the back of my hand to check the color. Sure enough--it came out red with a hint of brown. (I think I could use this as a lip liner.) This shade may work well for redheads...I don&#x27;t know; however, anyone with darker hair or high contrast coloring (Winters) would not want to use Chestnut Brown.  Other than the shade, I like this product:  affordable, easy to use, non-irritating. I wish the onscreen depiction of the color showed more accurately the color.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and eyes and my stores nearby don&#x27;t carry this in brown anymore. It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smear or run unintentionally like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, stays nearly all day, always stays sharpened, and the blending tip is just the right softness and texture to be really useful. Smudges easily when you want it to, stays a crisp line when you want it to. Other &amp;#34;always sharp&amp;#34; eyeliners like the Cover Girl Perfect Point Plus are dry and won&#x27;t smudge easily, and the blending tip is all but useless. This is the one to get.</li>
            <li> Okay formular but smudges after a few hours. Very embarassing. Don&#x27;t buy this. The gel eye liner is much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this eyeliner multiple times in multiple colors and have been continuously pleased with the results. Its title of \\&quot;Define-A-Line\\&quot; is an accurate selling point because, unlike other liners, it&#x27;s able to achieve a line as thin or thick as you please. I&#x27;m more a fan of kohl or liquid liners because of the precision&amp;look but this creamy liner goes on very smoothly and without fear of stabbing out an eye. It isn&#x27;t waterproof so if I want it to extend beyond the day, I set the liner w/ a similar colored shadow to avoid smearing; it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The sharpener is useless!!! The liner is very soft, so every time I wanted to sharpen it, the pencil broke, wasting a lot of products. I stopped sharpening it of course, but it is not a &amp;#34;define&amp;#34; line anymore!</li>
            <li> I like this pencil because it is soft, has  built in sharpener, and even a smudge tip on one end.  It is dark brown, not black, which is softer for fair skinned brunettes, and looks much more natural on me.  It is not waterproof, nor suitable for those who can&#x27;t help rubbing their eyes, but it provides a pop to my eyelids without looking like a raccoon.  Great price, good product, easy to apply and remove.  Product title describes it perfectly.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner! Love this color!</li>
            <li> Liner was ok but doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> Love the soft tip to apply,  easy to correct mistakes with</li>
