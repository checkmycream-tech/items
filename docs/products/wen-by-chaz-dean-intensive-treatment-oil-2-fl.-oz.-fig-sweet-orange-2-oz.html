            <li> I love the scent of the Fig and Sweet Orange. I&#x27;ve tried the other oils but this is my favorite. It&#x27;s great as a bath oil in the bath or after or a drop or 2 in the hair before and after shampoo.</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE all of the WEN products!! I will use the oil in my hair at night, then use the cleansing conditioner the following morning, the result is always fabulous!!!l After adding my pump of leave in conditioner, and several pumps of the (WEN SixThirteen Ultra Nourishing Treatment Mousse) then the (Styling Creme), I like to add a drop or two of the oil, to the (Finishing Treatment Creme) using it last. Everything together, makes my hair amazing!! I will NEVER be without my WEN!!!!</li>
            <li> Applied this oil on dry hair as demonstrated on the Wen presentation I viewed earlier on the QVC shopping channel; and, It did a great job moisturizing my hair.

            <li> I like the product. For the life of me I can find use instructions. Yes, they are written on the bottle, I&#x27;d need a microscope to read it. I think when direct from chaz dean it comes with a pamphlet. Though it looks like chaz dean no longer carries this. It feels good and smells good on the skin, I have no idea how to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb.  It is very moisturizing, but not greasy.  It gives your hair body and bounce.  I just wished it was sold in 4oz size and wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
