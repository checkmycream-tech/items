            <li>Very effective for me.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delivered in microsponges (you don&#x27;t feel them, but they work to ensure good delivery of the retinol where you apply it).</li>
            <li>But the result is just as good if not</li>
            <li>A good value.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>

            <li>Again - love this product!</li>
            <li>This is a really good product, I am glad that I tried it and will keep using and reordering it.</li>
            <li>and BAM- I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li>It has some highly recommended ingredients, but best for night use since has retinol.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve been practicing good skin care for a while, you&#x27;ll be fine tolerating this.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found another product that is as close natural that works, and the best thing, it&#x27;s affordable.  </li>
            <li>I had the lovely situation of aging skin which is still oily and breaking out (am I lucky or what?  lol).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This, along with their resurfacing disks (STRONG!  </li>
            <li>Every once in awhile I fall for another product which sounds too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a glycolic acid product, and it makes my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and very fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>because it looks so much better, one friend thought I might have had surgery.</li>
            <li>She was satisfied with the product and would recommend these for anybody.</li>
            <li>I love both of the Alpha Hydroxy creams, I purchased...</li>
            <li>And yes, Neoteric (the manufacturer of this cream) is a highly reputable company selling many millions of dollars in skin care products annually.</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;d like this cream to erase 20 years from my face.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone wanting  better looking skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try to use ResQ during my summer break, when I don&#x27;t have to go to work :)</li>
            <li>As recommended and tried ...am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Mostly though I didn&#x27;t like the texture: it is simultaneously runny and sticky.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks I feel I have a more refreshed appearance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are people that this product worked well for, but it didn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>I love this Retinol.</li>
            <li>I feel with continued use I will be even more pleased.</li>
            <li>the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my skin has been brighter and smoother with a more supple feel since I started two weeks ago.</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture and light feel, so I&#x27;ve used it up as a day cream</li>
            <li>I also feel it helps my vitamin C moisturizer absorb better.</li>
            <li>love this one and will get it again</li>
            <li>Not to mention being able to help stave off wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all the Alpha Hydrox products.  </li>
            <li>Would give more stars if I could.  </li>
            <li>one of my favorite products</li>
            <li>I feel I look more radiant and have even made my husband use it for his wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I spent hours studying the science and types of retinol/retinals) and came up with this as the best match for me, in price, quantity, and quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>14% so be careful) and then their AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong for me</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and love, love, love the Alpha Hydrox series.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for years due to originally going by the excellent reviews on Drug Store.com.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night, along with a more mild retinol eye cream (by Roc).</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ll settle for a great performer that works as well as a $107 cream at only $15.</li>
            <li>On my neck, I have experienced definite firming.  </li>
            <li>my skin feels irritated, but it does seem to be exfoliating and giving a smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>used this a week and souflee in day time and after first 2 dys I could see Difference AFTER a week EVERYONE can see the smoothness , even tone, helps acne scars fade too !!  </li>
            <li>Usually Amazon reviews are an excellent gauge by which to measure the quality of a product.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty light and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, although I have not noticed any significant reduction of wrinkles and fine lines within a month that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>All the beauty reviewers love this product - that&#x27;s how I first found this line of skin care products.  </li>
            <li>Just get it , I love 12 % or higher as this is 12% .</li>
            <li>On my face, I won&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m looking younger, but I would say I have probably slowed the process that creates sagging &amp; wrinkles - which is better than nothing for sure!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use a sunscreen during the day because it makes your skin much more sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li>I felt the difference right away!  </li>
            <li>This tube has a full .15% pure-active Retinol (Vitamin A).</li>
            <li>I used to buy this at a local drug store and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have used Retinol A products from the doctor before, they cost a little more than what you would have to pay for as compared to Alpha Hydrox Optimum Series, Retinol Night ResQ, Anti wrinkle firming cream.</li>
            <li>I always go back to Alpha Hydrox where the products are wonderful and actually perform as stated.  </li>
            <li>I love most of Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s products but this left me lukewarm.</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular product for over a year, and at age 50, my face has become much more even in skin tone, and the wrinkles around my mouth and my brow have all vanished.</li>
            <li>Love it, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>this is the one product that really delivers for smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It could be an ineffective delivery to the cells, or the compound prevents it from being absorbed, etc.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, is easily absorbed, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>After just a couple of nights of use my skin was softer and more clear.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my skin feel without greasiness.  </li>
            <li>Because after your initial breakouts go away, this stuff keeps your skin sooo nice.</li>
            <li>Think in terms of eggs: raw, scrambled, poached...... which would be most effective if you had to put one on your skin?  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly right</li>
            <li>I figured 1% retinol should be just right-</li>
            <li>I have added the Retinol Night ResQ cream to my routine for the past four months and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is as good (in my experience) and way less $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels like souffle on the skin and within the first week of using ResQ</li>
            <li>Actually, my skin looks and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>At first I felt stinging when I applied the Retinol</li>
            <li>This cream works better than estee lauder&#x27;s perfectionist,clinique&#x27;s deep wrinkle serum.</li>
            <li>But I really love what these products have done for my skin -- especially at this price point.</li>
            <li>and I love that because I always leave re ordering to the last minute.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products but I found this one  works for me.</li>
            <li>My first tube of retinol was purchased on Amazon and it was made by another company.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve only been using soap &amp; water, toner, basics like that, then this product will be potent and may aggravate your skin (</li>
            <li>It feels great - a little tingly but soft.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell if it is effective with anti-aging or cell regeneration, but boy is it extremely drying.</li>
            <li>After reading about the benefits of Retinol and considering the low price and good reviews on this product I bought a tube of Retinol ResQ in my local Ulta store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Many people say I look 10 years younger than I really am.</li>
            <li>Will continue this and see if long-term results are positive.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product as I have noticed a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>But my super sensitive skin kept me from trying the hard-core approaches like Retin-A.</li>
            <li>but after a week or two you&#x27;ll certainly notice the difference.  </li>
            <li>Definitely notice a difference with this - fine lines look fainter and even my skin looks firmer when I put this on.</li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do, --- reduces deep wrinkles and fine wrinkles diminish.</li>
            <li>Okay, but not a miracle (haven&#x27;t found one yet :).  Did moisturize without being oily and wrinkles certainly aren&#x27;t any worse than before I used the tube.  </li>
            <li>absolutely nothing. .</li>
            <li>That&#x27;d be a real improvement.</li>
            <li>THANKS ALPHA HYDROX.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft,retinol content must be low,Haven&#x60;t noticed too much difference in skin.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well after application.</li>
            <li>As a chemistry teacher, I have researched skin care products with an understanding of what really works and does not work.</li>
            <li>I am really disappointed,i want what i paid for now</li>
            <li>I am a real fan of the Alpha Hydrox products.  </li>
            <li>I did not give it five stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment on its true effectiveness, but I do love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well, but doesn&#x27;t provide much moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I do not have any real signs of aging as of yet</li>
            <li>I really beat the bushes looking for this product when they no longer carried it.  </li>
            <li>and yes, it really does work.  </li>
            <li>(although when you first start using retinols you may have a purge period, that&#x27;s normal, just power through it).</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m Usually a very crunchy granola type of girl and like to use things that are as natural as possible.</li>
            <li>Or maybe I just don&#x27;t have enough of them to see anything significant.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think there is a significant enough concentration of retinol in this cream to make any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li>is so much better than what I was previously using.</li>
            <li>The Roc product performed a tad better, but this one works well for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand (Alpha Hydrox) for 4+ years after seeing an episode of Oprah where the line was highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I did a little research (ok, a lot-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 with very oily, acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Although, my skin looks clearer, some of my old freckles seem to be fading, and I just really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>To purchase the exact same weight (1.05 oz tube) and strength, my dermatologist wants $107.</li>
            <li>I have long used and loved Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion, which in tandem with Cerave lotion got me through the harsh winter months without any skin problems.</li>
            <li>It is the only line of face creams that actually do reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I cannot live</li>
            <li>There are a lot of creams out there claiming to do miracles and most cost a small fortune</li>
            <li>I decided due to financial reasons to change my skin care routine to something more affordable and I chose the Alpha Hydrox line.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a solid atlernative to much higher priced face creams.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t notices the results I was looking for so far!</li>
            <li>First, it delivers enough retinol to keep my skin looking young, and second, the price is so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I love this formula, it&#x27;s not too hard on your skin</li>
            <li>It firms and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>But only one would be really beneficial in this hypothetical situation.  </li>
            <li>A case of a seemingly \\&quot;same\\&quot; ingredient that is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>I felt a difference (soft to the touch) in the mornings.</li>
            <li>By far the highest amount of retinol you&#x27;ll find in the over the counter lines.  </li>
            <li>I AM 73 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>ive used it 3 night in a row now and will take a break tonight, but so far ive had NO issues with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any real change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox really helps my skin look much younger than my years.  </li>
            <li>so far.. I had read that retinol can help keep acne at bay, and I can attest to that.</li>
            <li>I have been using for over a year now and have seen smaller pores, less wrinkles and an overall healthy appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li>first used it on my chin, then on my forehead and above the upper lip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll notice my skin getting dry and flaky, especially around my smile lines and frown lines because I apply a thicker layer around those areas.</li>
            <li>I use the Alpha Hydrox oil free glycolic acid every morning, which simply helps peel off those dead skin cells that make us look old.</li>
            <li>first time ive ever used a retinol product, and I was a tad intimidated by all the reviews that say to be careful.</li>
            <li>but today I noticed my skin was not dull, but actually looked Dewey.  </li>
            <li>My bff who is 8 years younger than I am in age, and chose not to use an alpha hydroxy, actually looks much older than me!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this high .15% strength available through any other company at less than 4 times the Neoteric price.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was one of the less expensive retinol products available, but it&#x27;s turned out to be my favorite</li>
            <li>Maybe I was looking for it to be as amazing as Help Me, for a fraction of the price, and that was unrealistic.  </li>
            <li>yet I do feel its improving my general complexion.</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old and before starting Alpha Hydrox</li>
            <li>As I have sensitive skin, I only apply once every 4-6 days.  </li>
            <li>I can use on my neck area, but facial skin must be too sensitive.</li>
            <li>These Alpha Hydrox products are terrific for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>I will say that occasionally my skin is very &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; and I worried that either one of these products were causing it to dry out</li>
            <li>In the last few weeks I have started using their other AHA enhanced creams in the day, and I am seeing even more improvements.</li>
            <li>And the results are pretty fast—within just a few days I can tell that the skin on my forehead is a lot</li>
            <li>/&gt;The skin feels very radiant especially when you apply make up on your face, a little make up goes a long way with the new radiant on the skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li>When you first use a retinol product there might be a short period where you have a few break outs..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to target, and I&#x27;m hoping it stays that way a little longer with this stuff.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s delivered in microsponges (you don&#x27;t feel them, but they work to ensure good delivery of the retinol where you apply it).</li>
            <li> But the result is just as good if not</li>
            <li> A good value.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin would look this good (in my 50&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I will order this product again, for sure!  </li>
            <li> Again - love this product!</li>
            <li> This is a really good product, I am glad that I tried it and will keep using and reordering it.</li>
            <li> and BAM- I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li> It has some highly recommended ingredients, but best for night use since has retinol.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been practicing good skin care for a while, you&#x27;ll be fine tolerating this.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found another product that is as close natural that works, and the best thing, it&#x27;s affordable.  </li>
            <li> I had the lovely situation of aging skin which is still oily and breaking out (am I lucky or what?  lol).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This, along with their resurfacing disks (STRONG!  </li>
            <li> Every once in awhile I fall for another product which sounds too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a glycolic acid product, and it makes my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and very fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> because it looks so much better, one friend thought I might have had surgery.</li>
            <li> She was satisfied with the product and would recommend these for anybody.</li>
            <li> I love both of the Alpha Hydroxy creams, I purchased...</li>
            <li> And yes, Neoteric (the manufacturer of this cream) is a highly reputable company selling many millions of dollars in skin care products annually.</li>
            <li> Sure, I&#x27;d like this cream to erase 20 years from my face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone wanting  better looking skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to use ResQ during my summer break, when I don&#x27;t have to go to work :)</li>
            <li> As recommended and tried ...am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Mostly though I didn&#x27;t like the texture: it is simultaneously runny and sticky.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks I feel I have a more refreshed appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are people that this product worked well for, but it didn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> I love this Retinol.</li>
            <li> I feel with continued use I will be even more pleased.</li>
            <li> the better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my skin has been brighter and smoother with a more supple feel since I started two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture and light feel, so I&#x27;ve used it up as a day cream</li>
            <li> I also feel it helps my vitamin C moisturizer absorb better.</li>
            <li> love this one and will get it again</li>
            <li> Not to mention being able to help stave off wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all the Alpha Hydrox products.  </li>
            <li> Would give more stars if I could.  </li>
            <li> one of my favorite products</li>
            <li> I feel I look more radiant and have even made my husband use it for his wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I spent hours studying the science and types of retinol/retinals) and came up with this as the best match for me, in price, quantity, and quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> 14% so be careful) and then their AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong for me</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love, love, love the Alpha Hydrox series.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for years due to originally going by the excellent reviews on Drug Store.com.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night, along with a more mild retinol eye cream (by Roc).</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ll settle for a great performer that works as well as a $107 cream at only $15.</li>
            <li> On my neck, I have experienced definite firming.  </li>
            <li> my skin feels irritated, but it does seem to be exfoliating and giving a smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> used this a week and souflee in day time and after first 2 dys I could see Difference AFTER a week EVERYONE can see the smoothness , even tone, helps acne scars fade too !!  </li>
            <li> Usually Amazon reviews are an excellent gauge by which to measure the quality of a product.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty light and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, although I have not noticed any significant reduction of wrinkles and fine lines within a month that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> All the beauty reviewers love this product - that&#x27;s how I first found this line of skin care products.  </li>
            <li> Just get it , I love 12 % or higher as this is 12% .</li>
            <li> On my face, I won&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m looking younger, but I would say I have probably slowed the process that creates sagging &amp; wrinkles - which is better than nothing for sure!  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use a sunscreen during the day because it makes your skin much more sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li> I felt the difference right away!  </li>
            <li> This tube has a full .15% pure-active Retinol (Vitamin A).</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at a local drug store and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have used Retinol A products from the doctor before, they cost a little more than what you would have to pay for as compared to Alpha Hydrox Optimum Series, Retinol Night ResQ, Anti wrinkle firming cream.</li>
            <li> I always go back to Alpha Hydrox where the products are wonderful and actually perform as stated.  </li>
            <li> I love most of Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s products but this left me lukewarm.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular product for over a year, and at age 50, my face has become much more even in skin tone, and the wrinkles around my mouth and my brow have all vanished.</li>
            <li> Love it, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is the one product that really delivers for smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It could be an ineffective delivery to the cells, or the compound prevents it from being absorbed, etc.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, is easily absorbed, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> After just a couple of nights of use my skin was softer and more clear.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my skin feel without greasiness.  </li>
            <li> Because after your initial breakouts go away, this stuff keeps your skin sooo nice.</li>
            <li> Think in terms of eggs: raw, scrambled, poached...... which would be most effective if you had to put one on your skin?  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s exactly right</li>
            <li> I figured 1% retinol should be just right-</li>
            <li> I have added the Retinol Night ResQ cream to my routine for the past four months and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is as good (in my experience) and way less $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels like souffle on the skin and within the first week of using ResQ</li>
            <li> Actually, my skin looks and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> At first I felt stinging when I applied the Retinol</li>
            <li> This cream works better than estee lauder&#x27;s perfectionist,clinique&#x27;s deep wrinkle serum.</li>
            <li> But I really love what these products have done for my skin -- especially at this price point.</li>
            <li> and I love that because I always leave re ordering to the last minute.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products but I found this one  works for me.</li>
            <li> My first tube of retinol was purchased on Amazon and it was made by another company.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve only been using soap &amp; water, toner, basics like that, then this product will be potent and may aggravate your skin (</li>
            <li> It feels great - a little tingly but soft.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it is effective with anti-aging or cell regeneration, but boy is it extremely drying.</li>
            <li> After reading about the benefits of Retinol and considering the low price and good reviews on this product I bought a tube of Retinol ResQ in my local Ulta store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Many people say I look 10 years younger than I really am.</li>
            <li> Will continue this and see if long-term results are positive.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product as I have noticed a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> But my super sensitive skin kept me from trying the hard-core approaches like Retin-A.</li>
            <li> but after a week or two you&#x27;ll certainly notice the difference.  </li>
            <li> Definitely notice a difference with this - fine lines look fainter and even my skin looks firmer when I put this on.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, --- reduces deep wrinkles and fine wrinkles diminish.</li>
            <li> Okay, but not a miracle (haven&#x27;t found one yet :).  Did moisturize without being oily and wrinkles certainly aren&#x27;t any worse than before I used the tube.  </li>
            <li> absolutely nothing. .</li>
            <li> That&#x27;d be a real improvement.</li>
            <li> THANKS ALPHA HYDROX.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft,retinol content must be low,Haven&#x60;t noticed too much difference in skin.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well after application.</li>
            <li> As a chemistry teacher, I have researched skin care products with an understanding of what really works and does not work.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed,i want what i paid for now</li>
            <li> I am a real fan of the Alpha Hydrox products.  </li>
            <li> I did not give it five stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment on its true effectiveness, but I do love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but doesn&#x27;t provide much moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I do not have any real signs of aging as of yet</li>
            <li> I really beat the bushes looking for this product when they no longer carried it.  </li>
            <li> and yes, it really does work.  </li>
            <li> (although when you first start using retinols you may have a purge period, that&#x27;s normal, just power through it).</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m Usually a very crunchy granola type of girl and like to use things that are as natural as possible.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I just don&#x27;t have enough of them to see anything significant.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think there is a significant enough concentration of retinol in this cream to make any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> is so much better than what I was previously using.</li>
            <li> The Roc product performed a tad better, but this one works well for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand (Alpha Hydrox) for 4+ years after seeing an episode of Oprah where the line was highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I did a little research (ok, a lot-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 with very oily, acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Although, my skin looks clearer, some of my old freckles seem to be fading, and I just really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> To purchase the exact same weight (1.05 oz tube) and strength, my dermatologist wants $107.</li>
            <li> I have long used and loved Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion, which in tandem with Cerave lotion got me through the harsh winter months without any skin problems.</li>
            <li> It is the only line of face creams that actually do reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I cannot live</li>
            <li> There are a lot of creams out there claiming to do miracles and most cost a small fortune</li>
            <li> I decided due to financial reasons to change my skin care routine to something more affordable and I chose the Alpha Hydrox line.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been a solid atlernative to much higher priced face creams.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t notices the results I was looking for so far!</li>
            <li> First, it delivers enough retinol to keep my skin looking young, and second, the price is so reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I love this formula, it&#x27;s not too hard on your skin</li>
            <li> It firms and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> But only one would be really beneficial in this hypothetical situation.  </li>
            <li> A case of a seemingly \\&quot;same\\&quot; ingredient that is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> I felt a difference (soft to the touch) in the mornings.</li>
            <li> By far the highest amount of retinol you&#x27;ll find in the over the counter lines.  </li>
            <li> I AM 73 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li> ive used it 3 night in a row now and will take a break tonight, but so far ive had NO issues with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any real change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox really helps my skin look much younger than my years.  </li>
            <li> so far.. I had read that retinol can help keep acne at bay, and I can attest to that.</li>
            <li> I have been using for over a year now and have seen smaller pores, less wrinkles and an overall healthy appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li> first used it on my chin, then on my forehead and above the upper lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll notice my skin getting dry and flaky, especially around my smile lines and frown lines because I apply a thicker layer around those areas.</li>
            <li> I use the Alpha Hydrox oil free glycolic acid every morning, which simply helps peel off those dead skin cells that make us look old.</li>
            <li> first time ive ever used a retinol product, and I was a tad intimidated by all the reviews that say to be careful.</li>
            <li> but today I noticed my skin was not dull, but actually looked Dewey.  </li>
            <li> My bff who is 8 years younger than I am in age, and chose not to use an alpha hydroxy, actually looks much older than me!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this high .15% strength available through any other company at less than 4 times the Neoteric price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was one of the less expensive retinol products available, but it&#x27;s turned out to be my favorite</li>
            <li> Maybe I was looking for it to be as amazing as Help Me, for a fraction of the price, and that was unrealistic.  </li>
            <li> yet I do feel its improving my general complexion.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and before starting Alpha Hydrox</li>
            <li> As I have sensitive skin, I only apply once every 4-6 days.  </li>
            <li> I can use on my neck area, but facial skin must be too sensitive.</li>
            <li> These Alpha Hydrox products are terrific for mature skin.  </li>
            <li> I will say that occasionally my skin is very &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; and I worried that either one of these products were causing it to dry out</li>
            <li> In the last few weeks I have started using their other AHA enhanced creams in the day, and I am seeing even more improvements.</li>
            <li> And the results are pretty fast—within just a few days I can tell that the skin on my forehead is a lot</li>
            <li> /&gt;The skin feels very radiant especially when you apply make up on your face, a little make up goes a long way with the new radiant on the skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li> When you first use a retinol product there might be a short period where you have a few break outs..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to target, and I&#x27;m hoping it stays that way a little longer with this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IF you are using this for acne, you need to know that you will get what a lot of people refer to as the &amp;#34;acne purge.&amp;#34; Retinol has the properties of increasing cell turnover, which is good in the long run, but it will usually cause your breakouts to be worse in the beginning.</li>
            <li> have clear, dry, not very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After using this for a few months I think the Neutrogena retinol and Serious Skincare brands work better.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, with stuff this inexpensive while still so effective, I say you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> : It didn&#x27;t seem like anything changed (but maybe my skin isn&#x27;t at the point where change would be noticeable?), possibly had minor breakouts related to this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use a heavy moisturizer with high spf over this.</li>
            <li> I have not tried long enough to make a comment.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of other, much higher priced creams, with much less results!</li>
            <li> - the next day i saw some red blotches on my face, which later became rough and dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Different brand but same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of wrinkle-reducing creams including Olay, Garnier, Dove and Nutragena with disappointing results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other retinol products, including green cream and products by philosophy and other higher range brands...</li>
            <li> I started off using it at night every other day, building up to daily.</li>
            <li> Every time I have tried other products I always come back to it.  </li>
            <li> The next morning my face was covered with a small red rush.</li>
            <li> It made my skin very, very dry.</li>
            <li> My skin was initially red and it stung a little-</li>
            <li> It is just a little bit harsh, so I recommend keeping it far away from your eyelid area.</li>
            <li> Skin is much firmer and radiant looking, although a slight breakout of small dots, one or two as expected, doctor did mentioned that to me previously about Retinol A side effect.</li>
            <li> an item is not readily available locally-</li>
            <li> Maybe I am impatient but I didn&#x27;t see noticeable enough results.</li>
            <li> I started using it only a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was not really experienced with using retinol but that product didn&#x27;t really impress me.</li>
            <li> I am going to try some of their other products now.</li>
            <li> I used to use Retin-A and Retin-A micro, but I feel this stuff works just as well, plus it has other ingredients that help improve your skin.</li>
            <li> I imagine it is due to the product containing glycerin.</li>
            <li> I try other products as well</li>
            <li> The rush turned hard the following days and it took over a week for it to go</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know that this did anything for me other than just act like any other moisturizer and clog my pores a little.</li>
            <li> Fades my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Slowly I have started to see my wrinkles disappear and my skin tone become even, the deeper pitting is even starting to fade.</li>
            <li> If you do some research you&#x27;ll see that this company is careful about the PH-balancing (they have quite a few products to choose from).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Alpha Hydrox Retinol doesn&#x27;t seem to have lightened any dark spots or had any noticeable change in skin wrinkles or taughtness that the Neutrogena and Serious Skincare had after the same period of time.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t dried me out or made me break out or get bumpy face as some other (cough, neutrogena) retinol creams have.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years, one of the few things that has helped with my bouts of cystic acne without the drying and peeling I&#x27;ve gotten with lots of other stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was getting that little sag just under my chin</li>
            <li> my friend who is a physician.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is one of the few ingredients that has been scientifically proven to improve wrinkles, as I learned on  Mayo clinic&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I may not be giving this product a chance because I have not used it everyday.</li>
            <li> Plus it is affordable and natural not like those expensive supposedly miracle in a jar products that are advertised by celebrities who probably don&#x27;t even use the products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do this everyday</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer of this all over my face, and literally the next day (usually in the afternoon)</li>
            <li> deliver within two days usually</li>
            <li> Usually with these products breaking out is a problem, not with this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn a little, which I take to mean that it is working.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to review skin care products as I find that they don&#x27;t work overnight.</li>
            <li> (late 50&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> I think this is common.  </li>
            <li> My skin is slowly getting for youthful looking</li>
            <li> cream itself is fairly thick, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So keep in mind, just because a product contains the \\&quot;same\\&quot; amount of an ingredient, doesn&#x27;t mean it works just as well.  </li>

            <li> I once worked for a company that sold products with Alpha Hydroxy in them and they were expensive!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it didn&#x27;t smell bad, it was inexpensive to try&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product based solely upon the reviews I read here. Usually Amazon reviews are an excellent gauge by which to measure the quality of a product. But in this case, I have to wonder if these glowing reviews were written by the people who sell this stuff. I have been using this for a while now and have noticed........absolutely nothing. . I may as well be putting baby lotion on my face.  I have used the prescription retinol at the same strength and noticed a big difference when using that.  So keep in mind, just because a product contains the \\&quot;same\\&quot; amount of an ingredient, doesn&#x27;t mean it works just as well.  It could be an ineffective delivery to the cells, or the compound prevents it from being absorbed, etc.  Think in terms of eggs: raw, scrambled, poached...... which would be most effective if you had to put one on your skin?  They all are the SAME ingredient, yes?  But only one would be really beneficial in this hypothetical situation.  I think that is what we are looking at here.  A case of a seemingly \\&quot;same\\&quot; ingredient that is completely ineffective. Anyway, save your pennies on this product and keep shopping for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/5/11:  I am now using Neutrogena \\&quot;Ageless Intensives\\&quot; Deep Wrinkle Anti-wrinkle Serum.  Started seeing a difference in one week.  It is extremely similar to the prescription RetinA I&#x27;d been using.  And it&#x27;s not the most expensive on the shelf, either.  Love it, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Feels like souffle on the skin and within the first week of using ResQ I felt a difference (soft to the touch) in the mornings. Be prepared for breakouts initially, however, it does even out! Actually, my skin looks and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> This tube will last me a lifetime considering that you need just a dab for the eye area. It feels pretty light and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, although I have not noticed any significant reduction of wrinkles and fine lines within a month that I&#x27;ve been using it. Or maybe I just don&#x27;t have enough of them to see anything significant. Going through the ingredient list, I was impressed to see a lot of good anti aging ingredients, but Parabens have to go.</li>
            <li> I have always had problematic skin: Acne, Rosacea, scaring and pitting; and now I am also showing signs of aging. I starting looking online for something that would help. There are a lot of creams out there claiming to do miracles and most cost a small fortune but this product worked as close to a miracle as possible on my skin. After researching and finding out about Retinol and Alpha-Hydroxy acids I thought I would give Alpah Hydrox products a try. At first I felt stinging when I applied the Retinol but I also apply Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Cream over it and that took care of the sting. Slowly I have started to see my wrinkles disappear and my skin tone become even, the deeper pitting is even starting to fade. I have even been asked by friends what I am doing to my skin because it looks so much better, one friend thought I might have had surgery. I have been using the Retinol Rescue with the night cream for over a month now and that alone was doing wonders for my skin. In the last few weeks I have started using their other AHA enhanced creams in the day, and I am seeing even more improvements.</li>
            <li> Got these for the wife and they work quite well. She was satisfied with the product and would recommend these for anybody.</li>
            <li> I love both of the Alpha Hydroxy creams, I purchased... One for day and night. I used a lot of other, much higher priced creams, with much less results!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years, one of the few things that has helped with my bouts of cystic acne without the drying and peeling I&#x27;ve gotten with lots of other stuff.  I always try other things but come back to this after a week or two when I notice how dull and blah my skin looks (usually accompanied by a nasty break out).</li>
            <li> Okay, but not a miracle (haven&#x27;t found one yet :).  Did moisturize without being oily and wrinkles certainly aren&#x27;t any worse than before I used the tube.  I used it all, am still looking for something to help with these ugly creases above my lip.  It has some highly recommended ingredients, but best for night use since has retinol.</li>
            <li> By far the highest amount of retinol you&#x27;ll find in the over the counter lines.  I love this formula, it&#x27;s not too hard on your skin but after a week or two you&#x27;ll certainly notice the difference.  Be sure to use a sunscreen during the day because it makes your skin much more sensitive to the sun.  All the beauty reviewers love this product - that&#x27;s how I first found this line of skin care products.  Check out the enhanced AHA creme too - great for summer!</li>
            <li> This cream works better than estee lauder&#x27;s perfectionist,clinique&#x27;s deep wrinkle serum. Check out beauty pedia.com rated#1 retinol product !.. get it !... get it !...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand (Alpha Hydrox) for 4+ years after seeing an episode of Oprah where the line was highly recommended. I researched everywhere I could, including a lengthy talk w/my friend who is a physician.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is one of the few ingredients that has been scientifically proven to improve wrinkles, as I learned on  Mayo clinic&#x27;s website. This tube has a full .15% pure-active Retinol (Vitamin A). It&#x27;s delivered in microsponges (you don&#x27;t feel them, but they work to ensure good delivery of the retinol where you apply it). It goes on smoothly, is easily absorbed, and is not greasy. No scent that I notice. To purchase the exact same weight (1.05 oz tube) and strength, my dermatologist wants $107. Yes, $107. Different brand but same active ingredient. I couldn&#x27;t find this high .15% strength available through any other company at less than 4 times the Neoteric price. And yes, Neoteric (the manufacturer of this cream) is a highly reputable company selling many millions of dollars in skin care products annually. Are there improvements to be made? Sure, I&#x27;d like this cream to erase 20 years from my face. That&#x27;d be a real improvement. But, I&#x27;ll settle for a great performer that works as well as a $107 cream at only $15.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months.  I have noticed a great improvement in my skin.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting  better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I felt the difference right away!  I will order this product again, for sure!  My skin is slowly getting for youthful looking</li>
            <li> GREAT ! I use with a derm roller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Alpha Hydrox products for years.  Every once in awhile I fall for another product which sounds too good to be true.  And that&#x27;s exactly right, it&#x27;s too good to be true.  I always go back to Alpha Hydrox where the products are wonderful and actually perform as stated.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> although I am over 65 I don&#x27;t and didn&#x27;t have wrinkles.  I think it is helping my face but I have roceasea and it doesn&#x27;t help that.  I also use the cleanser at night.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING ALPHA HYDROX PRODUCTS FOR YEARS.  THE PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL.  I AM 73 YEARS OLD AND PEOPLE TELL ME I HAVE BEAUTIFUL SKIN ALL THE TIME.  THANKS ALPHA HYDROX.</li>
            <li> best value for the money and it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 and my skin started showing some signs of aging. After reading about the benefits of Retinol and considering the low price and good reviews on this product I bought a tube of Retinol ResQ in my local Ulta store.&lt;br /&gt;I first used it on my chin, then on my forehead and above the upper lip. I didn&#x27;t feel any burning or irritation. Encouraged by this one night I applied a thin layer on my cheeks. The next morning my face was covered with a small red rush. It could have been clogged pores, caused by emulsifying wax in this cream. Or that was my reaction to the retinol in this cream. The rush turned hard the following days and it took over a week for it to go away.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it and switched to Neutrogena, which doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but also doesn&#x27;t seem to work either.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to use ResQ during my summer break, when I don&#x27;t have to go to work :)</li>
            <li> As recommended and tried ...am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;When an item is not readily available locally- I stop in to Amazon to see if they have it&lt;br /&gt;and they do and I order and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for your face.  People can notice the changes immediately on your youthful looks.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it is effective with anti-aging or cell regeneration, but boy is it extremely drying. I apply a thin layer of this all over my face, and literally the next day (usually in the afternoon) I&#x27;ll notice my skin getting dry and flaky, especially around my smile lines and frown lines because I apply a thicker layer around those areas. It&#x27;s too strong for me so I cut it back to once a week, and the results are the same. Will continue this and see if long-term results are positive.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m Usually a very crunchy granola type of girl and like to use things that are as natural as possible. While this is not, it has helped my face a lot. At 57 years of age I guess I&#x27;m a bit of a sellout. Whatever</li>
            <li> Pros: It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it didn&#x27;t smell bad, it was inexpensive to try&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It didn&#x27;t seem like anything changed (but maybe my skin isn&#x27;t at the point where change would be noticeable?), possibly had minor breakouts related to this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that this did anything for me other than just act like any other moisturizer and clog my pores a little. I&#x27;ll keep it in mind to try again in a couple of years when maybe my skin has matured enough that this might affect it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product, I am glad that I tried it and will keep using and reordering it.</li>
            <li> As I approach my thirties, I decided it was time to up my preventative beauty routing. But my super sensitive skin kept me from trying the hard-core approaches like Retin-A. I have long used and loved Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion, which in tandem with Cerave lotion got me through the harsh winter months without any skin problems. I have added the Retinol Night ResQ cream to my routine for the past four months and am quite happy with it. I tend to use the Enhanced lotion and Retinol cream on alternating nights, and ALWAYS wear/reapply sunscreen during the day. But I really love what these products have done for my skin -- especially at this price point. I recommend the Alpha Hydrox series to all!</li>
            <li> I have not tried long enough to make a comment.</li>
            <li> I love most of Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s products but this left me lukewarm. Maybe I am impatient but I didn&#x27;t see noticeable enough results. Mostly though I didn&#x27;t like the texture: it is simultaneously runny and sticky. Definitely only apply this at night after you&#x27;ve applied everything else underneath.</li>
            <li> I have been using for over a year now and have seen smaller pores, less wrinkles and an overall healthy appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li> AHHH HEAVENS Oh my!&lt;br /&gt;This along with the day aha Souflee is a tag team duo fo POWER I cannot live without!&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSKY, my skin color and tone and pores are now invisible, everyone tells me my skin is flawless with NO makeup on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this a week and souflee in day time and after first 2 dys I could see Difference AFTER a week EVERYONE can see the smoothness , even tone, helps acne scars fade too !!  I had one on my chin that is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also took away one ketaris pilaris I think its spelled. Just get it , I love 12 % or higher as this is 12% .</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft,retinol content must be low,Haven&#x60;t noticed too much difference in skin.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well after application.Will continue to monitor results.</li>
            <li> I bought this and Roc&#x27;s retinol cream, and have been using them on the backs of my hands (which suddenly got all crepey this year).  The Roc product performed a tad better, but this one works well for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle for day.  Between the two, I am definitely seeing an improvement in my skin.  I am 45 years old and before starting Alpha Hydrox I had the lovely situation of aging skin which is still oily and breaking out (am I lucky or what?  lol).  My skin is still oily (I don&#x27;t think anything is going to change that) but I no longer break out.  On my face, I won&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m looking younger, but I would say I have probably slowed the process that creates sagging &amp; wrinkles - which is better than nothing for sure!  On my neck, I have experienced definite firming.  I was getting that little sag just under my chin and that is definitely firmed up since I&#x27;ve started using these products.  Who knows, maybe my face will catch up?  At any rate, with stuff this inexpensive while still so effective, I say you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Love this product. After just a couple of nights of use my skin was softer and more clear. After a couple of weeks I feel I have a more refreshed appearance. Again - love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are people that this product worked well for, but it didn&#x27;t for me.  It made my skin very, very dry.</li>
            <li> As a chemistry teacher, I have researched skin care products with an understanding of what really works and does not work. My dermatologist and I both agree that retinol products and glycolic acid products are the way to go. I have been using this particular product for over a year, and at age 50, my face has become much more even in skin tone, and the wrinkles around my mouth and my brow have all vanished. I use it every night, along with a more mild retinol eye cream (by Roc). This product will burn the area above the checkbone and below the eyebrow,, so care must be taken. I started off using it at night every other day, building up to daily. Used during the day could cause sunburns (which cause wrinkles and defeat the purpose of using this product). I use the Alpha Hydrox oil free glycolic acid every morning, which simply helps peel off those dead skin cells that make us look old.</li>
            <li> Definitely notice a difference with this - fine lines look fainter and even my skin looks firmer when I put this on.</li>
            <li> I am yet to recieve this product and i order it over 2 months ago. I am really disappointed,i want what i paid for now</li>
            <li> I am a real fan of the Alpha Hydrox products.  It is the only line of face creams that actually do reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles. I have tried many brands of wrinkle-reducing creams including Olay, Garnier, Dove and Nutragena with disappointing results. I have been using one of the daytime formulas for close to a year, and my skin definitely looks younger and healthier. I only recently added this nighttime formula to my regimen.  I love how soft it makes my skin feel without greasiness.  I did not give it five stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment on its true effectiveness, but I do love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alpha Hydrox Retinol Night ResQ for years.  As I have sensitive skin, I only apply once every 4-6 days.  It must be working as I&#x27;m always mistaken for being much younger than I am (late 50&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products. My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> Prestige skin care for drug store price.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but doesn&#x27;t provide much moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I once worked for a company that sold products with Alpha Hydroxy in them and they were expensive! I was happy to find this product and have been very pleased with it. Many people say I look 10 years younger than I really am. My bff who is 8 years younger than I am in age, and chose not to use an alpha hydroxy, actually looks much older than me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it came on the market @ 10 yrs ago now, I think. I haven&#x27;t found another product that is as close natural that works, and the best thing, it&#x27;s affordable.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amazon deliver within two days usually and I love that because I always leave re ordering to the last minute.</li>
            <li> I love this Retinol. It&#x27;s about the best one you can buy without a prescription.</li>
            <li> I may not be giving this product a chance because I have not used it everyday. So I will do another review on this in a month are so.</li>
            <li> Once again came before schedule. Could not wait to put on,have had these before,and they are GREAT</li>
            <li> I adore this treatment cream.  First, it delivers enough retinol to keep my skin looking young, and second, the price is so reasonable.  You won&#x27;t regret buying this!</li>
            <li> I have used Retinol A products from the doctor before, they cost a little more than what you would have to pay for as compared to Alpha Hydrox Optimum Series, Retinol Night ResQ, Anti wrinkle firming cream. But the result is just as good if not BETTER!&lt;br /&gt;I see almost instant result within 3days !! Skin is much firmer and radiant looking, although a slight breakout of small dots, one or two as expected, doctor did mentioned that to me previously about Retinol A side effect. But it goes away in a day or two, nothing serious. I would definitedly recommend this cream as a MUST HAVE at night before you go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;The skin feels very radiant especially when you apply make up on your face, a little make up goes a long way with the new radiant on the skin. Thumbs up !!</li>
            <li> I got this to try as a substitute for Philosophy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Help Me&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t seem to do what I wanted.  Maybe I was looking for it to be as amazing as Help Me, for a fraction of the price, and that was unrealistic.  So I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> first time ive ever used a retinol product, and I was a tad intimidated by all the reviews that say to be careful. so I have been! (O: anyway I think this stuff is VERY nice! ive used it 3 night in a row now and will take a break tonight, but so far ive had NO issues with it yet I do feel its improving my general complexion. it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn or cause redness on my skin at all. I feel with continued use I will be even more pleased.</li>
            <li> The best thing is it does not make me break out .  Usually with these products breaking out is a problem, not with this. I am going to try some of their other products now.</li>
            <li> I did a little research (ok, a lot- I spent hours studying the science and types of retinol/retinals) and came up with this as the best match for me, in price, quantity, and quality.&lt;br /&gt;I have clear, dry, not very sensitive skin and I&#x27;m 25. I talked with some people in the biz (plastic surgeon/ dermatology offices) and they all say, the sooner you get on the retinols, the better. I figured 1% retinol should be just right- its not the strongest form of it but not the weakest. It hasn&#x27;t dried me out or made me break out or get bumpy face as some other (cough, neutrogena) retinol creams have. I still use a heavy moisturizer with high spf over this. I&#x27;d say my skin has been brighter and smoother with a more supple feel since I started two weeks ago. I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to target, and I&#x27;m hoping it stays that way a little longer with this stuff. I will def stick with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think there is a significant enough concentration of retinol in this cream to make any difference whatsoever. It has a nice texture and light feel, so I&#x27;ve used it up as a day cream but that&#x27;s about it. No results to report. If you are seeking results, go with Babyface 2% retinol Night Renewal cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any real change in my skin. I&#x27;m 28 with very oily, acne prone, sensitive skin. This was recommended to me as a replacement for another AHA product I was using to ease congested pores (chemical exfoliators work wonders for me)  but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for my skin. I do not have any real signs of aging as of yet so I can&#x27;t comment on how this works as an anti-wrinkle product.</li>
            <li> Very effective for me. Thank ~+~</li>
            <li> I started using it only a few weeks ago. I have combination skin. I recommend using a moisturizer with it because I noticed my skin started peeling. Although, my skin looks clearer, some of my old freckles seem to be fading, and I just really notice a difference in my skin. I also feel it helps my vitamin C moisturizer absorb better. I used to use Retin-A and Retin-A micro, but I feel this stuff works just as well, plus it has other ingredients that help improve your skin.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, but I&#x27;ve always had favorable experiences with&lt;br /&gt;Alpha Hydrox products, so I&#x27;ve optimistic.</li>
            <li> It is hard to review skin care products as I find that they don&#x27;t work overnight. But I do like this. Plus it is affordable and natural not like those expensive supposedly miracle in a jar products that are advertised by celebrities who probably don&#x27;t even use the products. A good value.</li>
            <li> Reduces blemishes. Fades my dark spots. Give it time it&#x27;l work. I&#x27;m on my second tube.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at a local drug store and loved it.  I really beat the bushes looking for this product when they no longer carried it.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.  Alpha Hydrox really helps my skin look much younger than my years.  When you first use a retinol product there might be a short period where you have a few break outs.. I think this is common.  I am so happy to find this source for this great.. yet affordable product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very pleased. Thank you</li>
            <li> After using this for a few months I think the Neutrogena retinol and Serious Skincare brands work better.  The Alpha Hydrox Retinol doesn&#x27;t seem to have lightened any dark spots or had any noticeable change in skin wrinkles or taughtness that the Neutrogena and Serious Skincare had after the same period of time.</li>
            <li> I believe I have seen some improvement. Have only been using it for a few weeks. I use this at night and the enhanced lotion 10 during the day. I will say that occasionally my skin is very &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; and I worried that either one of these products were causing it to dry out but that has not happened.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products but I found this one  works for me. love this one and will get it again</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it&#x27;s been very good to my skin.  I have oily skin and this helps to keep it from breaking out with pimples.</li>
            <li> Made my skin irritated and break out. I can use on my neck area, but facial skin must be too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was one of the less expensive retinol products available, but it&#x27;s turned out to be my favorite so far.. I had read that retinol can help keep acne at bay, and I can attest to that. In addition to helping to keep the breakouts away, I definitely notice a smoother texture to my skin. And the results are pretty fast—within just a few days I can tell that the skin on my forehead is a lot smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you are using this for acne, you need to know that you will get what a lot of people refer to as the &amp;#34;acne purge.&amp;#34; Retinol has the properties of increasing cell turnover, which is good in the long run, but it will usually cause your breakouts to be worse in the beginning. But tough it out! Because after your initial breakouts go away, this stuff keeps your skin sooo nice. Not to mention being able to help stave off wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is fairly thick, and moisturizing. I imagine it is due to the product containing glycerin. It is just a little bit harsh, so I recommend keeping it far away from your eyelid area.</li>
            <li> Great Retinol cream.  Highly recommend it and Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s other products.  Have been using for years due to originally going by the excellent reviews on Drug Store.com.  Do purchase on Amazon now.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It doesn&#x27;t burn a little, which I take to mean that it is working.  I use it with a glycolic acid product, and it makes my skin very smooth.  I can&#x27;t do this everyday bc my skin feels irritated, but it does seem to be exfoliating and giving a smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> This works great for me.  I have seen an improvement since I have started using this product.  I love all the Alpha Hydrox products.  It firms and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I have used Alpha Hydrox Nite ResQ for over 15 years and yes, it really does work.  Every time I have tried other products I always come back to it.  It makes a visible difference and I get lots of compliments on my skin. (I am over 65!) Along with keeping out out of the sun this is the one product that really delivers for smooth skin.</li>
            <li> My first tube of retinol was purchased on Amazon and it was made by another company. I was not really experienced with using retinol but that product didn&#x27;t really impress me. I decided due to financial reasons to change my skin care routine to something more affordable and I chose the Alpha Hydrox line. I&#x27;m happy with their line of products and the ResQ is so much better than what I was previously using. I do recommend this product as I have noticed a positive difference in my skin. Its smoother and softer now and I will continue to purchase and use the ResQ creme.</li>
            <li> One night of use- and BAM- I am loving this product.  Used it last night after the Alpha Hydrox Cream cleanser.  My skin was initially red and it stung a little- but today I noticed my skin was not dull, but actually looked Dewey.  I am 50 years old and very fair skinned.  I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it&#x27;s been a solid atlernative to much higher priced face creams.  The jury is still out on whether or not it works.  I do not have any issues with this product.  No burning, there is no smell and no irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> These Alpha Hydrox products are terrific for mature skin.  If you do some research you&#x27;ll see that this company is careful about the PH-balancing (they have quite a few products to choose from).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been practicing good skin care for a while, you&#x27;ll be fine tolerating this.  If you&#x27;ve only been using soap &amp; water, toner, basics like that, then this product will be potent and may aggravate your skin (uncomfortable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, along with their resurfacing disks (STRONG!  14% so be careful) and then their AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA are wonderful.  I don&#x27;t think my skin would look this good (in my 50&#x27;s) if I hadn&#x27;t used these products for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the MD Forte line for several years before I discovered this.  I love MD Forte, but it&#x27;s expensive.  This is as good (in my experience) and way less $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Souffle during day, and Night ResQ at night.  I try other products as well but this brand is my staple.  Would give more stars if I could.  (and no, I don&#x27;t rep for this company).  Excellent value and results.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love, love, love the Alpha Hydrox series.  Using for 5 years and I am 58.  They work well and I couldn&#x27;t imagine not using them now.</li>
            <li> It feels great - a little tingly but soft. Unfortunately it seems like i&#x27;m allergic to it - the next day i saw some red blotches on my face, which later became rough and dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t notices the results I was looking for so far! Will continue to use the product for awhile to give the benefit of the doubt!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite products</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, --- reduces deep wrinkles and fine wrinkles diminish. I feel I look more radiant and have even made my husband use it for his wrinkles. He also likes this product. Price is very good and also u do not need a prescription.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST out there. I&#x27;ve tried other retinol products, including green cream and products by philosophy and other higher range brands... this is the one I keep coming back to. It&#x27;s affordable and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of extra ingredients that I&#x27;m not looking for. It doesn&#x27;t break my skin out either (although when you first start using retinols you may have a purge period, that&#x27;s normal, just power through it).</li>
