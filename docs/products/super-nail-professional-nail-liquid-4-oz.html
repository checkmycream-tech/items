            <li> I was disappointed because on the description it says that it&#x27;s an 8oz bottle but what I got was a 4oz bottle...</li>
            <li> I would love to give a proper review of this item but I have been waiting a long time for the product to arrive. It has been about 2 weeks and the product has not even shipped yet. I will change my review if I ever get the thing. The company really needs to get their act together. It&#x27;s not good business to take someones money and not send them what they ordered. I will not ever give this company a second thought. They will never get my business again.</li>
            <li> Came on time works just fine for the price its worth it.</li>
            <li> This items work great . I recommend this product to any one that needs it. Very in expense product to purchase.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff, and cheap too you need a really good primer with it though, will probably order the. Offer one next time</li>

            <li> It works well and it&#x27;s just a great product. I&#x27;m not sure what else I can say about a nail liquid other than it was nice liquid...I&#x27;d get it again! Bigger than I thought, will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is Pretty good. Arrived early and is a good sized bottle. Perfect for my needs and works very well with the super nail acrylic.</li>
            <li> Great product. No sticky residue. Quick hardening time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this primer along with the polymer and monomer and they are a wonderful alternative to the tiny expensive products in Sally&#x27;s and online. No yellowing, no lifting and great strength! Buy them all!!</li>
            <li> Good product at a decent price.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> i brought this becuase was cheaper.it work good. i just dont like the smell but it work good, but dont dry fast.</li>
            <li> One of the items that will help me with the other nail care items.</li>
            <li> This stuff is kind of sticky more than others, it&#x27;s ok.  My nails lifted with this stuff but not with the liquid primer i got from Rite Aid</li>
            <li> great and doest smell like most liquids iv used. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Works good. Wish it soaked the powder up better for easy application. I probably just need more practice. I gave it 3 stars because it smells aweful! I have a big house and it smelt up the entire house and I barely used any.</li>
            <li> I wish this came in a bigger bottle, but it works for the job I bought it for. I just feel like I will be buying them more often the more I do others nails.</li>
            <li> Every item I purchased from Amazon work well for me, except, the SANOXY OTG Adapter Dongle Cable. It did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product, its a great price for a high quality professional product.  I do my own acrylic nails at home and this is the only brand I use of the liquid</li>
            <li> I have been using Super Nail products for over 30 years both professionaly and personally.  Can&#x27;t get a better review than that.</li>
            <li> First time I have tried this brand and I was pleased with my results.  I had some difficulties, but I am 99% sure it was my brush.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Packaged nice , they even tape the top so to prevent it from coming open during shipping. Correct size,trust me this will last a very long time as when used you never need much. Use this along with your fav nail polish color to make for doing your acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once and it seems to be working very well. Great for the price</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, totally worth every penny. I am a beginner teaching myself how to do acrylics on my own nails, I scavenged Amazon for the best stuff for the cheapest price and this was my find... I would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> its a good product and i will be ordering more. It came earlier than expected just after two days of ordering.</li>
            <li> Not the best monomer. I could not stand the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It is super strong. My nails would not even last four days.</li>
