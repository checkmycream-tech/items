            <li>Wonderfully light oil.</li>
            <li>Too many products on our shelves have had all the medicinal and healing properties processed right of them.</li>

            <li>My skin was either really dry, or the absorption is so quick  there is practically no residue after application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with psoriasis and dermatologists and salves since I was 13yrs old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really into natural and unprocessed, as much as possible.</li>
            <li>barely  there.</li>
            <li>I am using it as a carrier oil for essential oils, but have also found it to be very moisturizing for my dry skin, used alone.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference other than oily hair and hands.</li>

            <li> good product as an essential oil carrier</li>
            <li> Great product was exactly what I needed. The quality was much better than others that I have purchased in my local area.</li>
            <li> It came on time and great product</li>
            <li> This product is a new additive to my oil mixture I have read great things about grapeseed oil and wanted to try this product. I like how lite this product is not heavy or has a crazy smell. Mixes well and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin issues . . . forever! I&#x27;ve been dealing with psoriasis and dermatologists and salves since I was 13yrs old. Its not fun! I have found some products that really have an impact and this Grapeseed Oil is definitely one of those. I&#x27;m really into natural and unprocessed, as much as possible. Too many products on our shelves have had all the medicinal and healing properties processed right of them. Most of what we buy is, above all else, made for a long shelf life. This body oil, after a nice long soak, just melts into my skin. They use a &#x27;cold press&#x27; process and that allows the healing properties to remain in the oil. They don&#x27;t &#x27;process and preserve&#x27; the life out of it. I love this oil! It will always be on my shelf. Thanks Amazon ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference other than oily hair and hands. Hope it works for others.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Mixes well with my other essential oils and butters. I will order again.  Great for hair and skin as carrier oil.</li>
            <li> This is part of my daily beauty regimen! Been using this stuff since I was a teenager. Absolutely love it, great for hair and moisterizing the skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the best thing for dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. Great for the sauna</li>
            <li> Worked wonderfully with my homemade lotion.  I am going to cook with it too.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am quite impressed with the quality of this oil. And the quantity is quite generous for the price. I am using it as a carrier oil for essential oils, but have also found it to be very moisturizing for my dry skin, used alone.</li>
            <li> The oil is a good quality and shipping was on time but funny get oil on the label because it will make the ink bleed all over whatever it touches. I had to cover it with duck tape to prevent the ink from being all over everything.</li>
            <li> Seems good, mix with other oils. Small bottle of 4oz. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price.  Using it now and am satisfied completely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my eyelashes for about a month and I can see a difference in the growth!</li>
            <li> pure, potent I like it will buy again. Sarah</li>
            <li> It really did nothing for my face that I was hoping to expect. Dissapointed</li>
            <li> The price was great and the oil was delivered much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great carrier oil, really very light...I add my essential oils to it in a spray bottle and spray on as needed. I also add it to soap I make as a skin softener.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick, great at moisturizing, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. I&#x27;ve also noticed how it&#x27;s been healing my acne and fading the scars. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This oil was recommended to me by a friend who is a massage therapist.  We needed something to replace the massage oil we had been using that they discontinued making. This does the job.</li>
            <li> I like it. Will order again. Just wish it was a bigger size. But lasted a good amount.</li>
            <li> The description of grape seed oil is what I received based on other outside sources. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light oil. This was a decent product.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the oil leaving marks on my clothes. My skin was either really dry, or the absorption is so quick  there is practically no residue after application.  My skin is moisturizer. This is my favorite carrier oil.</li>
            <li> The perfect carrier oil! I either blend it with essential oils or just use it by itself. It&#x27;s so perfect for my skin. I also use it for the oil cleansing method.</li>
            <li> Great for hair &amp; skin</li>
            <li> Grapeseed Oil Organic Carrier Cold Pressed 100%... is light in color and fragrance- barely  there. It is used in combination with other oils for skin moisture sealant.</li>
