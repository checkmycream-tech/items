    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Had Merkur blades when I bought my safety razor (merkur as well) and found them to be wonderful.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly with my Merkur Safety Razor that I bought at Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li>Oh, and get a Merkur razor (handle) for a perfect combination.</li>
            <li>It is excellent.</li>
            <li>Gave me the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>But - for me - Merkur is the best.)</li>
            <li>And for some shavers, it is an excellent blade, so if this is your go-to blade don&#x27;t be put off by my comments.</li>

            <li>and that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Astra and Feather are the best, even Shark performs better.</li>
            <li>You get a good shave, and the blade lasts a while.</li>
            <li>They are a good baseline blade.</li>
            <li>These are good</li>
            <li>It is a good blade.</li>
            <li>They are extremely good for my taste.</li>
            <li>I thought they were good, however, that was before I tried Feather blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shaving experience, my face feels great</li>
            <li>But for your money, these are a good value.</li>
            <li>GOOD QUALITY BLADES AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li>SHIPPED ON TIME IN GOOD CONDITION.</li>
            <li>Good product...</li>
            <li>Good, quality blade with middle-of-the-road sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Than I may get 3 good shaves after its all said and shaved off.</li>
            <li>works exceptionally well for my face.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the performance after a week for these blades.  </li>
            <li>Nice close shave, good bye disposable razor.</li>
            <li>Love these blades!</li>
            <li>Although everyone recommends the sharper Feather blades I am more than content!</li>
            <li>(even though I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;greenie&amp;#34;), and if you buy a quality razor...just a real joy to use.</li>
            <li>I thought that I was going to get a nice, close shave with a quality product.  </li>
            <li>He is that kind of dude.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with 6 or 7 brands of razors and the Merkur is clearly the best razor for my beard.</li>
            <li>Although  many reviewers have criticized these blades I still adamantly maintain that these are the best blades for shaving; granted these blades are not for everyone</li>
            <li>Thank You for having something that is good for more than one shave available.</li>
            <li>No blade is better than another.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a better shave,</li>
            <li>I probably change blades more often than I need to --</li>
            <li>I found these blades to be much better than the Feather blades for my beard/skin.</li>
            <li>Now I use Shark, which is a lot better.</li>
            <li>Much better than the cartridge razors now days.</li>
            <li>This is better.</li>
            <li>I give this blade 3 stars because it does an OK job, and is certainly better than some blades out there.</li>
            <li>Way better than the triple blade razors</li>
            <li>Nice close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Well be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I use these in my safety razor and get a better shave with this than with a 5 blade Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li>I get more shaves from it as well.  </li>
            <li>Way better than a Gillette blade.</li>
            <li>I know every face and beard is different, but this seems perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I love their safety razors themselves, but I would recommend looking elsewhere for the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Love these blade.</li>
            <li>and I would gladly purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>would suggest buying a sample pack of blades made by several companies to determine what is best for your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This blade was much better than the one that came with the razor.....</li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband, nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>How do I say more?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than the 5-blade shaver&#x27;s I used to use.</li>
            <li>For the price, there are better blades.</li>
            <li>I feel that there are much better options for the price;</li>
            <li>More tugging and effort required leaving more irritaion.  </li>
            <li>These blades work ok.</li>
            <li>Just make sure</li>
            <li>in my opinion the best double edge razor blade!</li>
            <li>Fairly Cheap and highly effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to learn that razor burn is based on too many factors to judge blades on whether or not they cause it.</li>
            <li>Love these blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the Fuhrer himself swore by them .</li>
            <li>Good blades for the right beard and face.</li>
            <li>I believe the Astras to be inferior (but still very respectable), and the Feathers to be slightly superior (when in a Progress; too agressive for my sensitive skin when in a 1960&#x27;s Gillette DE).</li>
            <li>These blades are amazing, I have yet to find anything that cuts and smooth and easy as these do.</li>
            <li>Very clean cut.  </li>
            <li>They seem pretty good.</li>
            <li>Use nice cream and a brush for full effect.</li>
            <li>the feathers were too sharp/finicky and I haven&#x27;t used more than 3 of the 10 I purchased because they tend to take off skin too easily.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>Excellent blades that retain a sharp edge for many shaves.  </li>
            <li>More important, each shave is as close as the one before it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re way more comfortable before, during and after use then</li>
            <li>The best part of these is that I can shave a large swath of my face without taking the razor away to unclog it like I frequently had to do with my *name brand that starts with a G* razor.  </li>
            <li>These would be perfect for the first-time user, but try other blades once you go through a box of these.</li>
            <li>Feather blades from Japan, on the other hand, are THE best.</li>
            <li>I was immediately back to the Merkur &amp; my good shaving experience returned!  </li>
            <li>feathers might be to sharp for some people, so these are perfect.</li>
            <li>Easy to control.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hyped up a lot, but rationally though it&#x27;s nice to have this kind of quality even if it&#x27;s old school.</li>
            <li>for a smooth clean shave!</li>
            <li>Really nice razors that works pretty well with my skin.</li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to clean, more environmentally friendly...</li>
            <li>These blades are fine.</li>
            <li>If your technique didn&#x27;t cause nicks before, chances are the Feather will be fine.  </li>
            <li>Though I love the Merkur super blades and rate them 5 start the non-super</li>
            <li>Merkur Doubel Edge in my opinion are a great blade, gives me a fantastic shave, the double is a 5 STAR./</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Personally I think they do a great job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more fun for me.</li>
            <li>I got a free blade in a Merkur razor so tried without buying.</li>
            <li>a cheap one that came with it, some Gillette blades, and the Merkur.</li>
            <li>These Merkur blades seem to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>and I have not cut myself at all, but still shaves smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I actually enjoy shaving now, after hating it for year.</li>
            <li>great start for intro to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li>They provide a nice shave, and haven&#x27;t nicked me too much.</li>
            <li>I as amazed at how smooth this blade was.  </li>
            <li>loves it and his face is so smooth.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These ones tended to not last very many shaves and weren&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>Cuts consistently over many shaves.  </li>
            <li>Just got my first ever safety razor for xmas 4 months ago, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>One of these Merkur blades came as a free sample with my razor, and these work as good as the same free sample.  </li>
            <li>I used the original Merkur blade for a week and then switched to the Feather blades and used them until I finished that box.  </li>
            <li>By far and away I&#x27;m pleased more with the Merkur blade than the Feather.  </li>
            <li>It came with one of these blades, so after being impressed with my first several shaves, I bought this whole pack.  </li>
            <li>overall pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I suggest you to try out as many blades as possible until you find out the suitable one</li>
            <li>I like using better than using modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>nicks/cuts with the Merkur blade that lasted every bit of full week.  </li>
            <li>Never had one of these rust either, which is good because that would likely leave a stain on my razor, which is a Merkur Futur.</li>
            <li>A good blade especially if you prep your face.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>The item arrived very quickly and exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>These things are sharp and are great for a safety razor.</li>
            <li>The Feather&#x27;s are great but are too sharp for my taste.</li>
            <li>Not too sharp and works great.</li>
            <li>Super sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Great&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>They lose the edge quickly but will try them again.</li>
            <li>I had to make multiple passes in order to get my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Help tremendously wilts</li>
            <li>The Merkur blades are fine - heavier than some other bargain brands, and with a good edge.</li>
            <li>I normally use Shark blades and they are much better than this.</li>
            <li>I only post this info because I own several Merkurs and have never found the Merkur blade to yield a good shave.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good blades, but personally I prefer the Feather blades.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp, but not the sharpest or most aggressive blade available, falling right in that range where most people like them a lot.</li>
            <li>Love these blades, stay sharp and very durable, great shave and easy to replace when it is necessary.</li>
            <li>These blades give a really close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>After some practice, great shave, lasts for quite a few shaves, and i do my face and head</li>
            <li>but the one that came with the razor is smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li>I have since purchased one of the sample packs that include several brands of blades and have found some that work better (for a more reasonable price).</li>
            <li>For any shaver that shaves with a safety razor these are a kind of a blade that are in the middle!!!</li>
            <li>It is worth the money</li>
            <li>I rarely nick myself with the Merkur.</li>
            <li>long as you use shave soaps and creams, not canned shave foam, with this product, you will be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The longest and rare time span is a week.</li>
            <li>These blades shave close and do a good job with out being aggressively sharp.</li>
            <li>Good sharp blades.</li>
            <li>These blades are good &amp;sharp takes my beard off with 3 passes however since Is have my head</li>
            <li>Keep trying until you find one that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>I thought a blade is just a blade right?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving with the old school safety razor, but I have found these blades to be excellent.  </li>
            <li>These blades are pretty straight forwrd and definitely cheap compared to newer style razor blades.    </li>
            <li>now he gets a very close shave and his face is as smooth as when he was a yojung man in the service shaving witb a straight razor.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>I bought these when I first purchased my saftey razor.</li>
            <li>I became aware of these blades after watching a cable TV program called, \\&quot;How</li>
            <li>These are the first double edged razors I&#x27;ve ever used to shave with, but they seem to work better than any cartridge I&#x27;ve used.    </li>
            <li>I just used these blades for the first time after switching from cartridges to a de safety razor.</li>
            <li>Blades such as Personnas, Derbys (also sold on Amazon), Gillettes, and Feathers will generally do a better job in a Merkur.</li>
            <li>It feels kind of rough on my face</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for suicide though because they are pretty flimsy when not in a holding apparatus.</li>
            <li>I tried these when first bought my Merkur \\&quot;Fat Boy\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a safety razor</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s retro factor is pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is even a slot in the back of the box to safely dispose of your used razors.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>These Merkur blades come in a nice spring loaded dispenser, which makes them harder to lose.</li>
            <li>you know what you&#x27;re doing first.</li>
            <li>These were okay but after purchasing this initially I tried a larger sampler pack of many different manufacturers and types and ended up falling in love with the Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my top 3 blades.</li>
            <li>(they wouldn&#x27;t let me have blades in basic), and Merkur are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>I love double edge razors.</li>
            <li>I dont know why it faded out in the first place.</li>
            <li>You do not need a very expensive handle but a good blade like this one to have a good shave.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp blades, can&#x27;t complain about their performance.</li>
            <li>Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
            <li>These blades are very nice, last a long time, and produce a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I would be happy with these for the rest of my shaving career, but I am tempted to try the Japanese ones that everyone says are so sharp.</li>
            <li>Great blades that are sharp and stay that way through numerous shaves.</li>
            <li>But if I tak my time the first 3 Feather shaves are very close.</li>
            <li>My first experence with a real blade after years of electric</li>
            <li>Very sharp and nicely wrapped in the package.</li>
            <li>But sharper blades also mean more irritation, so you&#x27;ll have to find the right fit for you.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent blades.</li>
            <li>Hey guys, I bounce between a Dovo straight razor and an ancient Gilette safety razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Merkur 180 Safety Razor and without giving it much thought I also ordered the Merkur DE Razor Blades.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from the Merkur DE blades!</li>
            <li>- My beard is not dense, straight whiskers.  </li>
            <li>My face thanks me every day</li>
            <li>Where Merkur leaves my skin smooth and nick-free, even with the lightest of touches, Feather left my face bleeding from razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I was very please with the razor</li>
            <li>Also they do not hold an edge very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>If I shaved regularly like a civilized gentleman, I&#x27;d probably look for cheaper blades.  </li>
            <li>I recommend really works</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t cut myself much at all with them.</li>
            <li>You really need to know what your doing with a safety razor to use these.</li>
            <li>These razors gets at least 4 to 5 good shaves from these razors I will buy again.</li>
            <li>However, these may not be right for others, who will need to do more extensive trials and errors with various blades; ouch!</li>
            <li>Small enough that it arrived super quickly and is exactly what I&#x27;ve come to expect from the Merker blades, a comfortable and reliably consistent shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of the other major brands but this one gives me the best shave and lasts a little longer than the others.</li>
            <li>Considering how much cheaper these are over the counter high quality razor blade I see no reason to ever use anything else.</li>
            <li>The Feather is very sharp indeed, but sharp doesn&#x27;t necessarily equate to &amp;#34;the best...</li>
            <li>I get a nice close shave without the irritation that has caused me to have in grown hairs in the past.  </li>
            <li>I am returning to the world of &#x27;old fashion,&#x27; shaving after having spent many years using more conventional cartridge style razors.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a whole new level of shaving amazingness.</li>
            <li>Recommend anyone new to wet shaving, to try a few different blades and see what works best for your face.</li>
            <li>I believe you can use these for a while, if you keep them dry and free of debris after shaving.</li>
            <li>- Merkur Classic Safety razor.  </li>
            <li>If you shave regularly with a with a double shaver you will be well pleased with the Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>These are decent blades.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that switching blades could make that much of a difference but after shaving with the Astra Superior Platinum Blade this morning I can tell you from first hand experience that blades make a ton of difference.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this blade.</li>
            <li>highly recommend both.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Merkurs do the job just fine, last several shaves and are much easier on the skin.</li>
            <li>I think its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>He has not complained and he would tell me if a gift I gave him was a POS.</li>
            <li>They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn.</li>
            <li>No problems with longer facial hair as these cut it right off.</li>
            <li>Got these blades to go in my new Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>once I spent the money on a good safety razor, I have to buy box of these every few months.</li>
            <li>Which is exactly why I went to DE wet shave razors in the first place.</li>
            <li>The few additional nicks that occur are far more acceptable than the day-long irritation that I received after using cartridge systems like the Mach series from Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I understand that when it comes to wet shaving, one needs to find the right blade to suit one&#x27;s face, as blades range in the angle of sharpness; with these blades I believe I have found my brand of blades for life!</li>
            <li>Blades are a very personal choice and many other factors play in to the result one gets from them, so here are my conditions:  - Wetshaving for 2 months at time of writing.  </li>
            <li>we can get the same thing at the local Wal-Mart for a third of the price, and they are not any better of quality.</li>
            <li>First time using double edge razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very careful at first and in my first week have not cut myself once.</li>
            <li>To bad they get dull ;-) excellent product long life still able to get close to month depending on use</li>
            <li>These blades fit well into the long handled razor of the same name.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I switched over to these rather than those gimickey multi blade super expensive Mach Fusion things.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was my technique as I was new to safety razor shaving, but even with practice, different shave creams, pre-shave oil, and a variety of stubble preps, I can say these things are barely usable with my skin</li>
            <li>For me &amp;#34;last quite a long time&amp;#34; means I can leave it in the safety razor for a long time unused and pick it up and shave myself and it still feels fine.  </li>
            <li>I can press a bit harder at a slightly greater angle have little chance of nicking myself and thus shave twice as fast if I am in a hurry.</li>
            <li>It surprised me, so let me tell you this --</li>
            <li>Feathers are much sharper and last longer.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave far outshines multi-blade systems and cuts out ingrown hairs with ease.</li>
            <li>using the old style razor.</li>
            <li>I have found the merkur blades to be far inferior to the quality of their razors.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>they have some gall to charge that much for 10 basic razor blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far a durability is concerned I have just started using them and will have to wait to evaluate that aspect.</li>
            <li>i used this when i first bought the merkur long handle.</li>
            <li>old school shaving kit...</li>
            <li>I know many men with thick beards who swear by it.</li>
            <li>My first time using a traditional double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li>Merkur may make decent razors, but these blades are not sharp enough for me.</li>
            <li>These blades can be bought with confidence that your gonna have a quality blade that are a step up from a normal double edge blade.. would defiantly buy again</li>
            <li>These blades are a little too mild for my taste.</li>
            <li>compare the Merkur razor blade against the Feather Razor Blade, NEW Hi-Stainless Double Edge.  </li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] blades and a box of Merkur blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several times to get multiple shaves out of them, but it just rips my face up too much to continue trying with these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is higher than some of the other blades</li>
            <li>But the truth is, there are a few other blades out there that will work better in your Merkur razor than the stock Merkur blade.</li>
            <li>These blades are generally considered above-average quality.</li>
            <li>If you have a coarse beard and/or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Couple that with the old school feel of the double safety razor and these are a must have.</li>
            <li>They work better than 8 blade disposable crap from the grocery store, but there are better DE blades out there for the same price.</li>
            <li>They seem to be a bit on the expensive side, but, I&#x27;ll need more then one blade to find out  how long they last, consistently.  </li>
            <li>After trying 3 of these blades, enough is enough, too much razor burn and not close enough... next.</li>
            <li>Tolerances on the blades seem very tight when fitting it into the razor, and the blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a Merkur Long handeled razor, and the single blade that was enclosed, was of course the first blade used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched over to Feather blades, giving them a shot, but I don&#x27;t have any major complaints about the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li>The sharpness is very consistent from one blade to the next, and I change blades every week usually.</li>
            <li>For me I have to shave everyday and have thick stuble and this product will not work in that kind of situation simply because it is just not sharp enough to do the trick and will leave you with razor burn or cuts especially on the neck portion.</li>
            <li>very good blades, to bad ARTIE LANGE was not aware of these german made razor blades.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that if you have never done that, exercise extreme caution.</li>
            <li>It was nearly as sharp on the 7th  as the 7 AM blades I bought are new.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but really - the only problem with these blades is that they&#x27;re not made by Feather.</li>

            <li> and that&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> You get a good shave, and the blade lasts a while.</li>
            <li> They are a good baseline blade.</li>
            <li> These are good</li>
            <li> It is a good blade.</li>
            <li> They are extremely good for my taste.</li>
            <li> I thought they were good, however, that was before I tried Feather blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shaving experience, my face feels great</li>
            <li> But for your money, these are a good value.</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY BLADES AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li> SHIPPED ON TIME IN GOOD CONDITION.</li>
            <li> Good product...</li>
            <li> Good, quality blade with middle-of-the-road sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Than I may get 3 good shaves after its all said and shaved off.</li>
            <li> works exceptionally well for my face.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the performance after a week for these blades.  </li>
            <li> Nice close shave, good bye disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Love these blades!</li>
            <li> Although everyone recommends the sharper Feather blades I am more than content!</li>
            <li> (even though I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;greenie&amp;#34;), and if you buy a quality razor...just a real joy to use.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was going to get a nice, close shave with a quality product.  </li>
            <li> He is that kind of dude.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with 6 or 7 brands of razors and the Merkur is clearly the best razor for my beard.</li>
            <li> Although  many reviewers have criticized these blades I still adamantly maintain that these are the best blades for shaving; granted these blades are not for everyone</li>
            <li> Thank You for having something that is good for more than one shave available.</li>
            <li> No blade is better than another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a better shave,</li>
            <li> I probably change blades more often than I need to --</li>
            <li> I found these blades to be much better than the Feather blades for my beard/skin.</li>
            <li> Now I use Shark, which is a lot better.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cartridge razors now days.</li>
            <li> This is better.</li>
            <li> I give this blade 3 stars because it does an OK job, and is certainly better than some blades out there.</li>
            <li> Way better than the triple blade razors</li>
            <li> Nice close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Well be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I use these in my safety razor and get a better shave with this than with a 5 blade Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li> I get more shaves from it as well.  </li>
            <li> Way better than a Gillette blade.</li>
            <li> I know every face and beard is different, but this seems perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> I love their safety razors themselves, but I would recommend looking elsewhere for the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Love these blade.</li>
            <li> and I would gladly purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> would suggest buying a sample pack of blades made by several companies to determine what is best for your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This blade was much better than the one that came with the razor.....</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband, nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> How do I say more?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than the 5-blade shaver&#x27;s I used to use.</li>
            <li> For the price, there are better blades.</li>
            <li> I feel that there are much better options for the price;</li>
            <li> More tugging and effort required leaving more irritaion.  </li>
            <li> These blades work ok.</li>
            <li> Just make sure</li>
            <li> in my opinion the best double edge razor blade!</li>
            <li> Fairly Cheap and highly effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to learn that razor burn is based on too many factors to judge blades on whether or not they cause it.</li>
            <li> Love these blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the Fuhrer himself swore by them .</li>
            <li> Good blades for the right beard and face.</li>
            <li> I believe the Astras to be inferior (but still very respectable), and the Feathers to be slightly superior (when in a Progress; too agressive for my sensitive skin when in a 1960&#x27;s Gillette DE).</li>
            <li> These blades are amazing, I have yet to find anything that cuts and smooth and easy as these do.</li>
            <li> Very clean cut.  </li>
            <li> They seem pretty good.</li>
            <li> Use nice cream and a brush for full effect.</li>
            <li> the feathers were too sharp/finicky and I haven&#x27;t used more than 3 of the 10 I purchased because they tend to take off skin too easily.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades that retain a sharp edge for many shaves.  </li>
            <li> More important, each shave is as close as the one before it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re way more comfortable before, during and after use then</li>
            <li> The best part of these is that I can shave a large swath of my face without taking the razor away to unclog it like I frequently had to do with my *name brand that starts with a G* razor.  </li>
            <li> These would be perfect for the first-time user, but try other blades once you go through a box of these.</li>
            <li> Feather blades from Japan, on the other hand, are THE best.</li>
            <li> I was immediately back to the Merkur &amp; my good shaving experience returned!  </li>
            <li> feathers might be to sharp for some people, so these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Easy to control.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hyped up a lot, but rationally though it&#x27;s nice to have this kind of quality even if it&#x27;s old school.</li>
            <li> for a smooth clean shave!</li>
            <li> Really nice razors that works pretty well with my skin.</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to clean, more environmentally friendly...</li>
            <li> These blades are fine.</li>
            <li> If your technique didn&#x27;t cause nicks before, chances are the Feather will be fine.  </li>
            <li> Though I love the Merkur super blades and rate them 5 start the non-super</li>
            <li> Merkur Doubel Edge in my opinion are a great blade, gives me a fantastic shave, the double is a 5 STAR./</li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Personally I think they do a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more fun for me.</li>
            <li> I got a free blade in a Merkur razor so tried without buying.</li>
            <li> a cheap one that came with it, some Gillette blades, and the Merkur.</li>
            <li> These Merkur blades seem to fit the bill.</li>
            <li> and I have not cut myself at all, but still shaves smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I actually enjoy shaving now, after hating it for year.</li>
            <li> great start for intro to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> They provide a nice shave, and haven&#x27;t nicked me too much.</li>
            <li> I as amazed at how smooth this blade was.  </li>
            <li> loves it and his face is so smooth.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These ones tended to not last very many shaves and weren&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> Cuts consistently over many shaves.  </li>
            <li> Just got my first ever safety razor for xmas 4 months ago, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> One of these Merkur blades came as a free sample with my razor, and these work as good as the same free sample.  </li>
            <li> I used the original Merkur blade for a week and then switched to the Feather blades and used them until I finished that box.  </li>
            <li> By far and away I&#x27;m pleased more with the Merkur blade than the Feather.  </li>
            <li> It came with one of these blades, so after being impressed with my first several shaves, I bought this whole pack.  </li>
            <li> overall pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I suggest you to try out as many blades as possible until you find out the suitable one</li>
            <li> I like using better than using modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> nicks/cuts with the Merkur blade that lasted every bit of full week.  </li>
            <li> Never had one of these rust either, which is good because that would likely leave a stain on my razor, which is a Merkur Futur.</li>
            <li> A good blade especially if you prep your face.  </li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> The item arrived very quickly and exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> These things are sharp and are great for a safety razor.</li>
            <li> The Feather&#x27;s are great but are too sharp for my taste.</li>
            <li> Not too sharp and works great.</li>
            <li> Super sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Great&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> They lose the edge quickly but will try them again.</li>
            <li> I had to make multiple passes in order to get my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Help tremendously wilts</li>
            <li> The Merkur blades are fine - heavier than some other bargain brands, and with a good edge.</li>
            <li> I normally use Shark blades and they are much better than this.</li>
            <li> I only post this info because I own several Merkurs and have never found the Merkur blade to yield a good shave.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good blades, but personally I prefer the Feather blades.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp, but not the sharpest or most aggressive blade available, falling right in that range where most people like them a lot.</li>
            <li> Love these blades, stay sharp and very durable, great shave and easy to replace when it is necessary.</li>
            <li> These blades give a really close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> After some practice, great shave, lasts for quite a few shaves, and i do my face and head</li>
            <li> but the one that came with the razor is smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> I have since purchased one of the sample packs that include several brands of blades and have found some that work better (for a more reasonable price).</li>
            <li> For any shaver that shaves with a safety razor these are a kind of a blade that are in the middle!!!</li>
            <li> It is worth the money</li>
            <li> I rarely nick myself with the Merkur.</li>
            <li> long as you use shave soaps and creams, not canned shave foam, with this product, you will be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The longest and rare time span is a week.</li>
            <li> These blades shave close and do a good job with out being aggressively sharp.</li>
            <li> Good sharp blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are good &amp;sharp takes my beard off with 3 passes however since Is have my head</li>
            <li> Keep trying until you find one that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> I thought a blade is just a blade right?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving with the old school safety razor, but I have found these blades to be excellent.  </li>
            <li> These blades are pretty straight forwrd and definitely cheap compared to newer style razor blades.    </li>
            <li> now he gets a very close shave and his face is as smooth as when he was a yojung man in the service shaving witb a straight razor.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> I bought these when I first purchased my saftey razor.</li>
            <li> I became aware of these blades after watching a cable TV program called, \\&quot;How</li>
            <li> These are the first double edged razors I&#x27;ve ever used to shave with, but they seem to work better than any cartridge I&#x27;ve used.    </li>
            <li> I just used these blades for the first time after switching from cartridges to a de safety razor.</li>
            <li> Blades such as Personnas, Derbys (also sold on Amazon), Gillettes, and Feathers will generally do a better job in a Merkur.</li>
            <li> It feels kind of rough on my face</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for suicide though because they are pretty flimsy when not in a holding apparatus.</li>
            <li> I tried these when first bought my Merkur \\&quot;Fat Boy\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a safety razor</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s retro factor is pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is even a slot in the back of the box to safely dispose of your used razors.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> These Merkur blades come in a nice spring loaded dispenser, which makes them harder to lose.</li>
            <li> you know what you&#x27;re doing first.</li>
            <li> These were okay but after purchasing this initially I tried a larger sampler pack of many different manufacturers and types and ended up falling in love with the Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my top 3 blades.</li>
            <li> (they wouldn&#x27;t let me have blades in basic), and Merkur are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> I love double edge razors.</li>
            <li> I dont know why it faded out in the first place.</li>
            <li> You do not need a very expensive handle but a good blade like this one to have a good shave.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades, can&#x27;t complain about their performance.</li>
            <li> Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
            <li> These blades are very nice, last a long time, and produce a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I would be happy with these for the rest of my shaving career, but I am tempted to try the Japanese ones that everyone says are so sharp.</li>
            <li> Great blades that are sharp and stay that way through numerous shaves.</li>
            <li> But if I tak my time the first 3 Feather shaves are very close.</li>
            <li> My first experence with a real blade after years of electric</li>
            <li> Very sharp and nicely wrapped in the package.</li>
            <li> But sharper blades also mean more irritation, so you&#x27;ll have to find the right fit for you.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent blades.</li>
            <li> Hey guys, I bounce between a Dovo straight razor and an ancient Gilette safety razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Merkur 180 Safety Razor and without giving it much thought I also ordered the Merkur DE Razor Blades.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from the Merkur DE blades!</li>
            <li> - My beard is not dense, straight whiskers.  </li>
            <li> My face thanks me every day</li>
            <li> Where Merkur leaves my skin smooth and nick-free, even with the lightest of touches, Feather left my face bleeding from razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I was very please with the razor</li>
            <li> Also they do not hold an edge very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> works really well</li>
            <li> If I shaved regularly like a civilized gentleman, I&#x27;d probably look for cheaper blades.  </li>
            <li> I recommend really works</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t cut myself much at all with them.</li>
            <li> You really need to know what your doing with a safety razor to use these.</li>
            <li> These razors gets at least 4 to 5 good shaves from these razors I will buy again.</li>
            <li> However, these may not be right for others, who will need to do more extensive trials and errors with various blades; ouch!</li>
            <li> Small enough that it arrived super quickly and is exactly what I&#x27;ve come to expect from the Merker blades, a comfortable and reliably consistent shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of the other major brands but this one gives me the best shave and lasts a little longer than the others.</li>
            <li> Considering how much cheaper these are over the counter high quality razor blade I see no reason to ever use anything else.</li>
            <li> The Feather is very sharp indeed, but sharp doesn&#x27;t necessarily equate to &amp;#34;the best...</li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave without the irritation that has caused me to have in grown hairs in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am returning to the world of &#x27;old fashion,&#x27; shaving after having spent many years using more conventional cartridge style razors.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a whole new level of shaving amazingness.</li>
            <li> Recommend anyone new to wet shaving, to try a few different blades and see what works best for your face.</li>
            <li> I believe you can use these for a while, if you keep them dry and free of debris after shaving.</li>
            <li> - Merkur Classic Safety razor.  </li>
            <li> If you shave regularly with a with a double shaver you will be well pleased with the Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> These are decent blades.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that switching blades could make that much of a difference but after shaving with the Astra Superior Platinum Blade this morning I can tell you from first hand experience that blades make a ton of difference.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this blade.</li>
            <li> highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Merkurs do the job just fine, last several shaves and are much easier on the skin.</li>
            <li> I think its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> He has not complained and he would tell me if a gift I gave him was a POS.</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn.</li>
            <li> No problems with longer facial hair as these cut it right off.</li>
            <li> Got these blades to go in my new Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> once I spent the money on a good safety razor, I have to buy box of these every few months.</li>
            <li> Which is exactly why I went to DE wet shave razors in the first place.</li>
            <li> The few additional nicks that occur are far more acceptable than the day-long irritation that I received after using cartridge systems like the Mach series from Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand that when it comes to wet shaving, one needs to find the right blade to suit one&#x27;s face, as blades range in the angle of sharpness; with these blades I believe I have found my brand of blades for life!</li>
            <li> Blades are a very personal choice and many other factors play in to the result one gets from them, so here are my conditions:  - Wetshaving for 2 months at time of writing.  </li>
            <li> we can get the same thing at the local Wal-Mart for a third of the price, and they are not any better of quality.</li>
            <li> First time using double edge razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very careful at first and in my first week have not cut myself once.</li>
            <li> To bad they get dull ;-) excellent product long life still able to get close to month depending on use</li>
            <li> These blades fit well into the long handled razor of the same name.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I switched over to these rather than those gimickey multi blade super expensive Mach Fusion things.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was my technique as I was new to safety razor shaving, but even with practice, different shave creams, pre-shave oil, and a variety of stubble preps, I can say these things are barely usable with my skin</li>
            <li> For me &amp;#34;last quite a long time&amp;#34; means I can leave it in the safety razor for a long time unused and pick it up and shave myself and it still feels fine.  </li>
            <li> I can press a bit harder at a slightly greater angle have little chance of nicking myself and thus shave twice as fast if I am in a hurry.</li>
            <li> It surprised me, so let me tell you this --</li>
            <li> Feathers are much sharper and last longer.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave far outshines multi-blade systems and cuts out ingrown hairs with ease.</li>
            <li> using the old style razor.</li>
            <li> I have found the merkur blades to be far inferior to the quality of their razors.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> they have some gall to charge that much for 10 basic razor blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far a durability is concerned I have just started using them and will have to wait to evaluate that aspect.</li>
            <li> i used this when i first bought the merkur long handle.</li>
            <li> old school shaving kit...</li>
            <li> I know many men with thick beards who swear by it.</li>
            <li> My first time using a traditional double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> Merkur may make decent razors, but these blades are not sharp enough for me.</li>
            <li> These blades can be bought with confidence that your gonna have a quality blade that are a step up from a normal double edge blade.. would defiantly buy again</li>
            <li> These blades are a little too mild for my taste.</li>
            <li> compare the Merkur razor blade against the Feather Razor Blade, NEW Hi-Stainless Double Edge.  </li>
            <li> NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] blades and a box of Merkur blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several times to get multiple shaves out of them, but it just rips my face up too much to continue trying with these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is higher than some of the other blades</li>
            <li> But the truth is, there are a few other blades out there that will work better in your Merkur razor than the stock Merkur blade.</li>
            <li> These blades are generally considered above-average quality.</li>
            <li> If you have a coarse beard and/or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Couple that with the old school feel of the double safety razor and these are a must have.</li>
            <li> They work better than 8 blade disposable crap from the grocery store, but there are better DE blades out there for the same price.</li>
            <li> They seem to be a bit on the expensive side, but, I&#x27;ll need more then one blade to find out  how long they last, consistently.  </li>
            <li> After trying 3 of these blades, enough is enough, too much razor burn and not close enough... next.</li>
            <li> Tolerances on the blades seem very tight when fitting it into the razor, and the blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Merkur Long handeled razor, and the single blade that was enclosed, was of course the first blade used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched over to Feather blades, giving them a shot, but I don&#x27;t have any major complaints about the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> The sharpness is very consistent from one blade to the next, and I change blades every week usually.</li>
            <li> For me I have to shave everyday and have thick stuble and this product will not work in that kind of situation simply because it is just not sharp enough to do the trick and will leave you with razor burn or cuts especially on the neck portion.</li>
            <li> very good blades, to bad ARTIE LANGE was not aware of these german made razor blades.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that if you have never done that, exercise extreme caution.</li>
            <li> It was nearly as sharp on the 7th  as the 7 AM blades I bought are new.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but really - the only problem with these blades is that they&#x27;re not made by Feather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going to get a sample pack here in the near future to see what other blades feel like.  </li>
            <li> blades are extremely thin making them flimsy... be careful when placing them on razors and such because they bend easily</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edge razor it may take a little time to hone your technique, but stick with it.  </li>
            <li> These \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; Merkur single blades achieve a much better shave than over-hyped, expensive triple-blade systems - and with fewer ingrown hairs and skin \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; too.</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard and sensitive skin and these blades have given me the most painful and unsightly razor burn ever.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> They appear to last quite a long time, but again I don&#x27;t shave often.  </li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor, I only had the Merkur blade it came with, a box of [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades</li>
            <li> I have a very rough and frisky beard, one sweep with these blades (without the guard) removed all the hair straight down to the skin.</li>
            <li> Open the razor a bit and let the blade dry.</li>
            <li> Every single person has a different skin type, hair thickness, and shaving period.</li>
            <li> but it stayed sharp enough for an entire month.  </li>
            <li> was filled with users complaining about uncomfortable shaves and razor burn coming from the Merkur blades.  </li>
            <li> I use these blades and make sure that I rinse of with cold water and put on some aftershave lotion</li>
            <li> I have hearty beard hairs and soft skin, so I need sharp blades, but not TOO sharp.</li>
            <li> I purchased these along with a Merkur 180 long handled DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how careful I would be I would still end up with tiny nicks.</li>
            <li> I have tried other blades and have not received the same close shave.</li>
            <li> They last a little over a week of regular shaving.</li>
            <li> blade will spoil you for any other double edged blade.</li>
            <li> , they are Sharp and pliable durable German Steel.</li>
            <li> Then I went back to start using my box of Merkur blades and a new blade serious</li>
            <li> Shake them dry.</li>
            <li> is only average.</li>
            <li> They felt dull, even though I put new blade in my razor.</li>
            <li> It seems difficult to believe that such a fine product could come in such a cheesy package, but I&#x27;m sold and I will continue to buy only this brand until such time as it becomes unavailable.</li>
            <li> These are made with typical German engineering.</li>
            <li> And last but not least after shaving I would experience an uncomfortable burning sensation that would last almost all day.  </li>
            <li> Stays sharp a long time, just rinse as there is no need to touch the blade itself.</li>
            <li> But one of the closest finest shaves I have ever had, including single edged razor blades in a shop!  </li>
            <li> my husband has been buying disposable razors and spending so much for shaving as his beard is so tough.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t have very thick beard growth.</li>
            <li> Due to all the patches I started resorting to shaving while holding the safety razor at odd angles which wrecked further havoc on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is rough on the skin and will tear it up every time you shave.</li>
            <li> Not much too them.</li>
            <li> I was this close to quitting shaving with a safety razor until I started looking through wet shaving forums and just about every post</li>
            <li> but my expected razor stubble returning within 8-10 hours, as it did when I used cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li> That does not mean that there are not slightly better blades, but it does mean that it established the standard by which others are judged.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with a tough beard, the Feather blades left my face pretty scraped and bloody, but with Merkur, I got a very close shave, with no nicks/bleeding.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other brands (Derby, Shark, Personna) and then went back to try another Merkur.</li>
            <li> This is a DECENT blade for those who do not shave everyday or have thick stuble.</li>
            <li> Merkur blades are dull and not sharp from the get go, in comparison.</li>
            <li> These blades start sharp and stay sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other blades</li>
            <li> I regret that I did not order my other blades from this type.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and work</li>
            <li> My shaving regimen consists of applying pre-shave oil and shaving cream via a silvertip badger brush yet the Merkur blades consistently pulled uncomfortably on my beard.  </li>
            <li> After six months with Merkur razors I tried Feather brand razors, but found them too sharp.  </li>
            <li> our whatever other amount of blades they have out now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who these things are made for, but my experience makes me think they are intended for leather faced persons with no facial hair.</li>
            <li> I find them sharp without being overly aggressive.</li>
            <li> This blade was sharp, came with the razor, and lasted 6 shaves.</li>
            <li> Literally, \\&quot;razor\\&quot; sharp, they cut through a three day growth with ease.  </li>
            <li> One benefit is that these blades seem to stay sharp for about 5-7 shaves.</li>
            <li> They might not be as sharp as the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brand, but they do their job correctly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> These blades seem quite sharp.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using the other 9 Feathers-</li>
            <li> However, I was a bit disappointed when I compare their razors to Shark and Astra brands, which are often a better price and value.</li>
            <li> all know the importance of a sharp blade for shaving comfort, and these will not disappoint you.</li>
            <li> I have no need to every buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> I used these first, and then switched to a less expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I have read that these blades are not considered the sharpest in the spectrum of DE blades, so if you have a dense or thick beard, these might not be sharp enough for a shave without tugging.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, but not too sharp.  </li>
            <li> These do not irritate your face as much as other blades but are still very sharp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how common the used blade slot on the back is</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time nor your money on this poorly designed and produced product.  </li>
            <li> felt WORSE than a week old Feather blade.  </li>
            <li> Do not push down, let the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> Those three little blade, while sharp, got clogged up all the time.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try a different blade, as usual the Germans have delivers engineering at it finest!  </li>
            <li> I get typically six to seven shaves from a blade, versus two or three from the others.</li>
            <li> You will find 100 for less than $20.</li>
            <li> This costs almost half and gives me 10 razors.  </li>
            <li> These leave me with a nicer shave, less razors bumps, and for a heck of a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> I have these for my safety razor and I am replacing these way less than the disposables plus they are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have a rough beard and soft skin and Merkur blades just seem to drag and pull while cutting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as sharp as the Feather blades but sharper is not necessarily better.</li>
            <li> I was blown away by how little I felt shaving with these.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that they are a bad blade, but I recently tried Feather blades and wow what a difference!</li>
            <li> I shave at least 6 times per week, these last at least a week and a half for me, maybe two.</li>
            <li> My beard is tough &amp; I can go through a cartridge razor in several days, not a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut myself a few times.  </li>
            <li> Watch a few Youtube videos and read a few shaving articles before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I started shaving with a safety razor a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I get about 4-5 shaves with one blade if I shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Use anything less and you&#x27;ll swear you shaved with a rusty steak knife!</li>
            <li> The Merkur blades are sharp, and hold their sharpness, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> , I usually flip them over after a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to slow down when shaving.</li>
            <li> Closest shaves I&#x27;ve had in years of using those silly multi-blade monstrosities from the \\&quot;big</li>
            <li> The 10 razor leads took up no more room then</li>
            <li> Felt too dull.</li>
            <li> A common misconception is that there is a \\&quot;best\\&quot; type of razor blade.</li>
            <li> Merkurs offer the smoothest, least abrasive shave, and they are unmatched for edge-</li>
            <li> Each one lasts at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> Maybe my 10 were from a bad batch, but these blades are basically single use.</li>
            <li> Not uncommonly I can get razor burn on my neck, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t cut your face off, so don&#x27;t worry about that, but you can&#x27;t get away with the sloppy form you can with plastic cartridge doo dads.</li>
            <li> No more expensive 3,4,5 blade razors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with these blades 5 times and they have been by far the WORST shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  </li>
            <li> Merkur gives German quality a very bad name.</li>
            <li> Unless something becomes obviously wrong I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I tried one of these that came with my Merkur &#x27;1904&#x27; and I was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Wrong...  </li>
            <li> The result of these multiple passes was horrible road rash and a quite a bit of blood.</li>
            <li> They are very thin, and I would purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> It pulled hair before cutting.</li>
            <li> you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> While I have to change blades every three days I have yet to find a bad one in any of the packages.  </li>
            <li> This does not make any sense and is bad for the environment.</li>
            <li> My merkur 180 came with 10 of these blades, and frankly, they have been actually painful to use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used these first, and then switched to a less expensive brand. It surprised me, so let me tell you this -- it DOES make a difference. These blades start sharp and stay sharp. I will be switching back to this brand.</li>
            <li> These blades are great. They last a long time. I&#x27;ve been using them for years.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was going to get a nice, close shave with a quality product.  Do not waste your time nor your money on this poorly designed and produced product.  Merkur gives German quality a very bad name.</li>
            <li> For blades, it&#x27;s all about personal preference. No blade is better than another. Recommend anyone new to wet shaving, to try a few different blades and see what works best for your face. For me, I&#x27;ve only tried merkur and feather brands and the merkur works exceptionally well for my face.</li>
            <li> Had Merkur blades when I bought my safety razor (merkur as well) and found them to be wonderful. I&#x27;ve tried other blades and I either use Merkur or Feather.</li>
            <li> Hey guys, I bounce between a Dovo straight razor and an ancient Gilette safety razor. The Gilette is fed nothing but these Merkur blades and it gives me a great shave. Use anything less and you&#x27;ll swear you shaved with a rusty steak knife!</li>
            <li> I bought these when I first purchased my saftey razor. I have since purchased one of the sample packs that include several brands of blades and have found some that work better (for a more reasonable price). I would recommend going that route instead of spending your money on one brand.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works perfectly with my Merkur Safety Razor that I bought at Art of Shaving. I&#x27;ve never had a better shave, once I spent the money on a good safety razor, I have to buy box of these every few months. No more expensive 3,4,5 blade razors!</li>
            <li> Got these blades to go in my new Merkur razor. It&#x27;s not that they are a bad blade, but I recently tried Feather blades and wow what a difference! Feathers are much sharper and last longer. I have a rough beard and soft skin and Merkur blades just seem to drag and pull while cutting. The Feather blades just glide and cut.</li>
            <li> I became aware of these blades after watching a cable TV program called, \\&quot;How it&#x27;s made\\&quot;, so I specifically sought this brand.  Not only are these the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve ever tried, but they hold their edge longer than any blade in any type of razor.  It seems difficult to believe that such a fine product could come in such a cheesy package, but I&#x27;m sold and I will continue to buy only this brand until such time as it becomes unavailable.</li>
            <li> Superlative product. Closest shaves I&#x27;ve had in years of using those silly multi-blade monstrosities from the \\&quot;big names\\&quot; in men&#x27;s grooming. Effortless in use. I get typically six to seven shaves from a blade, versus two or three from the others. More important, each shave is as close as the one before it. I probably change blades more often than I need to -- that&#x27;s the level of quality of this product from Merkur. Highly recommended! Oh, and get a Merkur razor (handle) for a perfect combination.</li>
            <li> I found these blades to be much better than the Feather blades for my beard/skin. I have sensitive skin with a tough beard, the Feather blades left my face pretty scraped and bloody, but with Merkur, I got a very close shave, with no nicks/bleeding.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. It is rough on the skin and will tear it up every time you shave. It came with the Merkur shaver I bought years ago and made me consider switching back to standard triple blades. Now I use Shark, which is a lot better.</li>
            <li> Do a search for Derby blades on amazon.com. You will find 100 for less than $20. The blades are of equal quality. I fell for these by purchasing a bundle. You will save money by getting the Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Great Blade.  Very sharp, but not too sharp.  Easy to control.  Smooth. Almost never nicks.  Cuts consistently over many shaves.  I think its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> These are the first double edged razors I&#x27;ve ever used to shave with, but they seem to work better than any cartridge I&#x27;ve used.    Each one lasts about 3 shaves before it needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> These are made with typical German engineering. Definitely sharper than the drugstore blades I had. They won&#x27;t cut your face off, so don&#x27;t worry about that, but you can&#x27;t get away with the sloppy form you can with plastic cartridge doo dads. I would be happy with these for the rest of my shaving career, but I am tempted to try the Japanese ones that everyone says are so sharp. That is just curiousity. These blades are fine.</li>
            <li> This pack of razors could easily last a year. You get a good shave, and the blade lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I got them as an extra to my purchase. I regret that I did not order my other blades from this type. It is excellent. You do not need a very expensive handle but a good blade like this one to have a good shave.</li>
            <li> Not much too them. They are sharp and work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to using it. I&#x27;ve cut myself a few times.  I know many men with thick beards who swear by it.</li>
            <li> I just reverted back to this type of shaving. I enjoy it. They give a close shave with no burn.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Merkur 180 Safety Razor and without giving it much thought I also ordered the Merkur DE Razor Blades.  I&#x27;ve shaved with these blades 5 times and they have been by far the WORST shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  I have a very coarse beard and sensitive skin and these blades have given me the most painful and unsightly razor burn ever.  My shaving regimen consists of applying pre-shave oil and shaving cream via a silvertip badger brush yet the Merkur blades consistently pulled uncomfortably on my beard.  After 2-3 shaving passes I still found myself with patches of beard all over my face.  Due to all the patches I started resorting to shaving while holding the safety razor at odd angles which wrecked further havoc on my face.  And last but not least after shaving I would experience an uncomfortable burning sensation that would last almost all day.  I was this close to quitting shaving with a safety razor until I started looking through wet shaving forums and just about every post I ran into on blades was filled with users complaining about uncomfortable shaves and razor burn coming from the Merkur blades.  I was skeptical that switching blades could make that much of a difference but after shaving with the Astra Superior Platinum Blade this morning I can tell you from first hand experience that blades make a ton of difference.  With the Astra SP I had no pulling and after only 1 pass I was 90% done.  If you have a coarse beard and/or sensitive skin I highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from the Merkur DE blades!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this blade. Stays sharp a long time, just rinse as there is no need to touch the blade itself.</li>
            <li> I just used these blades for the first time after switching from cartridges to a de safety razor. They are a good baseline blade. Personally I think they do a great job. Much better than the cartridge razors now days. Gave me the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li> For any shaver that shaves with a safety razor these are a kind of a blade that are in the middle!!! Not the super-sharp ones but not the dullest ones. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I am trying different blades.  These are good but I think I will be going with Shark blades.  I need to try Feather blades yet.  Everybody is different.  It is a good blade.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades that retain a sharp edge for many shaves.  Although not recommended, I have gotten 50+shaves out of 1 blade.  The closeness of the shave far outshines multi-blade systems and cuts out ingrown hairs with ease.</li>
            <li> I like these blades for wetshaving a lot, hence 5 stars. Blades are a very personal choice and many other factors play in to the result one gets from them, so here are my conditions:  - Wetshaving for 2 months at time of writing.  - Merkur Classic Safety razor.  - My beard is not dense, straight whiskers.  - Shave daily.    The blades give me close shaves and I have yet to cut or nick myself (knock on wood). The sharpness is very consistent from one blade to the next, and I change blades every week usually. I have read that these blades are not considered the sharpest in the spectrum of DE blades, so if you have a dense or thick beard, these might not be sharp enough for a shave without tugging. But sharper blades also mean more irritation, so you&#x27;ll have to find the right fit for you.</li>
            <li> Very clean cut.  A lot smoother than triple blade razors and lasts a lot longer also. My face thanks me every day</li>
            <li> These \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; Merkur single blades achieve a much better shave than over-hyped, expensive triple-blade systems - and with fewer ingrown hairs and skin \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; too.</li>
            <li> Purchasing a 5-pack of razors for my Gill...name brand razor costs over 10$.  This costs almost half and gives me 10 razors.  The best part of these is that I can shave a large swath of my face without taking the razor away to unclog it like I frequently had to do with my *name brand that starts with a G* razor.  Those three little blade, while sharp, got clogged up all the time.  This is better.</li>
            <li> Mekur makes a really great blade.  While I have to change blades every three days I have yet to find a bad one in any of the packages.  The price is higher than some of the other blades but you are paying for quality.</li>
            <li> Super sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Great&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> These are pretty good blades, but personally I prefer the Feather blades.  These would be perfect for the first-time user, but try other blades once you go through a box of these.</li>
            <li> These blades give a really close, smooth shave.  If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edge razor it may take a little time to hone your technique, but stick with it.  Shaving will become something that feels like an indulgence, not a chore.  After six months with Merkur razors I tried Feather brand razors, but found them too sharp.  Where Merkur leaves my skin smooth and nick-free, even with the lightest of touches, Feather left my face bleeding from razor burn.  Maybe that&#x27;s just me.  I know Feather razors have lots of fans.  But - for me - Merkur is the best.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy i went to shaving with this \\&quot;method\\&quot; using the old style razor. It&#x27;s more fun for me. It&#x27;s hyped up a lot, but rationally though it&#x27;s nice to have this kind of quality even if it&#x27;s old school. These blades are pretty straight forwrd and definitely cheap compared to newer style razor blades.    I believe you can use these for a while, if you keep them dry and free of debris after shaving.</li>
            <li> I give this blade 3 stars because it does an OK job, and is certainly better than some blades out there. And for some shavers, it is an excellent blade, so if this is your go-to blade don&#x27;t be put off by my comments. But the truth is, there are a few other blades out there that will work better in your Merkur razor than the stock Merkur blade. Blades such as Personnas, Derbys (also sold on Amazon), Gillettes, and Feathers will generally do a better job in a Merkur. I only post this info because I own several Merkurs and have never found the Merkur blade to yield a good shave. YMMV, of course.</li>
            <li> I was very please with the razor I am now saving a lot of money thank you very much</li>
            <li> Way better than the triple blade razors our whatever other amount of blades they have out now. No problems with longer facial hair as these cut it right off. Nice close smooth shave. Well be buying more.</li>
            <li> Merkur blades are great!  7 shaves a week before changing. Great value for the money</li>
            <li> Though I love the Merkur super blades and rate them 5 start the non-super is only average. It feels kind of rough on my face and like it is hacking a bit. I normally use Shark blades and they are much better than this. I got a free blade in a Merkur razor so tried without buying. I&#x27;m glad I did. I was so impressed with Merkur supers that I might have bought these.</li>
            <li> who needs 4or5 blade razor when these double edge blades work just as well</li>
            <li> I use these in my safety razor and get a better shave with this than with a 5 blade Gillette razor.  I get more shaves from it as well.  I will never go back.</li>
            <li> I have found the merkur blades to be far inferior to the quality of their razors. My merkur 180 came with 10 of these blades, and frankly, they have been actually painful to use. At first I thought it was my technique as I was new to safety razor shaving, but even with practice, different shave creams, pre-shave oil, and a variety of stubble preps, I can say these things are barely usable with my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pre-shave oil did actually help and make a difference, but not enough to make me even consider staying with these blades. Also they do not hold an edge very well. Maybe my 10 were from a bad batch, but these blades are basically single use. I&#x27;ve tried several times to get multiple shaves out of them, but it just rips my face up too much to continue trying with these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they work with your skin type, great. I have fairly sensitive skin and I really don&#x27;t have very thick beard growth. I&#x27;m not sure who these things are made for, but my experience makes me think they are intended for leather faced persons with no facial hair.</li>
            <li> A common misconception is that there is a \\&quot;best\\&quot; type of razor blade. In fact, blade preference is highly personal. The \\&quot;best\\&quot; blade is the one that gives you the best shave, regardless of what anyone else says. I like these blades. I find them sharp without being overly aggressive. They also hold an edge well without dulling quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone searching for the perfect blade. These blades are generally considered above-average quality. They are sharp, but not the sharpest or most aggressive blade available, falling right in that range where most people like them a lot. I can&#x27;t promise they&#x27;ll be the best blade for you, but I do suggest you give them a shot and see how they work for you.</li>
            <li> Small enough that it arrived super quickly and is exactly what I&#x27;ve come to expect from the Merker blades, a comfortable and reliably consistent shave.</li>
            <li> ridiculously overpriced. we can get the same thing at the local Wal-Mart for a third of the price, and they are not any better of quality. they have some gall to charge that much for 10 basic razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;also, it didn&#x27;t make sense that they shipped separately and arrived 4 days later...</li>
            <li> This blade was sharp, came with the razor, and lasted 6 shaves. It was nearly as sharp on the 7th  as the 7 AM blades I bought are new.  The Merkur blades are sharp, and hold their sharpness, at least for me.  They seem to be a bit on the expensive side, but, I&#x27;ll need more then one blade to find out  how long they last, consistently.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ve got another 3 months of 7 AM&#x27;s to shave through, then I&#x27;ll give these another look</li>
            <li> very good blades, to bad ARTIE LANGE was not aware of these german made razor blades. Nice close shave, good bye disposable razor.</li>
            <li> This is a DECENT blade for those who do not shave everyday or have thick stuble. For me I have to shave everyday and have thick stuble and this product will not work in that kind of situation simply because it is just not sharp enough to do the trick and will leave you with razor burn or cuts especially on the neck portion. My recommended blade is the feather for those of you who are in the same situation as me and wish to use a safety razor.</li>
            <li> These things are sharp and are great for a safety razor. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for suicide though because they are pretty flimsy when not in a holding apparatus.</li>
            <li> They are extremely good for my taste.</li>
            <li> Felt too dull. It pulled hair before cutting. Left my face irritated. I&#x27;m going to try some sharper blades like bic, to see the difference.</li>
            <li> Love these blades! Although everyone recommends the sharper Feather blades I am more than content! After a decade of ingrown hairs, skin irritation, and razor bumps with cartridge razors I will never turn back! I have tried double, triple, four, and even five bladed razors (disposable razors and cartridge razors) I can now say that my face is happy!</li>
            <li> Way better than a Gillette blade. I&#x27;ve used three different types of blades on my safety razor.  a cheap one that came with it, some Gillette blades, and the Merkur. Each time with a noticeable step up. Considering how much cheaper these are over the counter high quality razor blade I see no reason to ever use anything else. It is worth the money</li>
            <li> Really nice razors that works pretty well with my skin. They&#x27;re way more comfortable before, during and after use then the Gillette Max Turbo 5000 or what they&#x27;re up to nowadays. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I tried these when first bought my Merkur \\&quot;Fat Boy\\&quot; razor.  I thought they were good, however, that was before I tried Feather blades. Merkur blades are dull and not sharp from the get go, in comparison. They pull your beard and always nick you up. Feather blades from Japan, on the other hand, are THE best. Literally, \\&quot;razor\\&quot; sharp, they cut through a three day growth with ease.  I will not buy the Merkur blades anymore, and will go back to the Japanese brand, which makes it a pleasure to shave. Which is exactly why I went to DE wet shave razors in the first place.</li>
            <li> Although  many reviewers have criticized these blades I still adamantly maintain that these are the best blades for shaving; granted these blades are not for everyone but they are the perfect blade for some people; namely me! I understand that when it comes to wet shaving, one needs to find the right blade to suit one&#x27;s face, as blades range in the angle of sharpness; with these blades I believe I have found my brand of blades for life! However, these may not be right for others, who will need to do more extensive trials and errors with various blades; ouch!</li>
            <li> thought these would have been sharper, but they do the job.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a safety razor so I am still getting used to these blades. They seem pretty good.</li>
            <li> the short handeled  Merkur razor and Merkur  blades are great. I would purchase them again and again!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend both. you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> blades are extremely thin making them flimsy... be careful when placing them on razors and such because they bend easily</li>
            <li> Great blades that are sharp and stay that way through numerous shaves. Great product</li>
            <li> I have experimented with 6 or 7 brands of razors and the Merkur is clearly the best razor for my beard. I use a Parker razor body and  get a great, close shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these and the feather blades - the feathers were too sharp/finicky and I haven&#x27;t used more than 3 of the 10 I purchased because they tend to take off skin too easily. I have hearty beard hairs and soft skin, so I need sharp blades, but not TOO sharp. These Merkur blades seem to fit the bill.</li>
            <li> was a gift for some one else</li>
            <li> works really well, I usually flip them over after a few shaves.  I find they last longer that way. overall pretty happy.</li>
            <li> These blades shave close and do a good job with out being aggressively sharp. One benefit is that these blades seem to stay sharp for about 5-7 shaves. This really saves money and think of all the waste not being thrown away.</li>
            <li> These blades can be bought with confidence that your gonna have a quality blade that are a step up from a normal double edge blade.. would defiantly buy again</li>
            <li> I will never go back to disposable razors again.  These leave me with a nicer shave, less razors bumps, and for a heck of a lot less money.  Also, it&#x27;s retro factor is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the pack has a handle slot to put the used blades in, so you don&#x27;t have to have blades just floating around in your garbage.</li>
            <li> These blades are amazing, I have yet to find anything that cuts and smooth and easy as these do. Believe me I have tried, but for a double edged razor, you just cant beat Merkur</li>
            <li> I have only used one but it stayed sharp enough for an entire month.  Unless something becomes obviously wrong I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER go back to the multi-blade razor. I don&#x27;t know why people ever stopped using this style of razor...easy to use, easy to clean, more environmentally friendly...(even though I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;greenie&amp;#34;), and if you buy a quality razor...just a real joy to use.</li>
            <li> My first time using a traditional double edge safety razor. Good sharp blades. I like using better than using modern multi-blade razors. Just remember to slow down when shaving. Watch a few Youtube videos and read a few shaving articles before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful at first and in my first week have not cut myself once. Do not push down, let the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> I have a Merkur handle. I rinse them well. Shake them dry. Open the razor a bit and let the blade dry. I rarely nick myself with the Merkur. The Feather brand is thinner and easier to draw blood with. But if I tak my time the first 3 Feather shaves are very close. However I believe I will keep buying 80% Merkur and 20% Feather. After about 4 shaves with th Merkur I can press a bit harder at a slightly greater angle have little chance of nicking myself and thus shave twice as fast if I am in a hurry.</li>
            <li> These blades fit well into the long handled razor of the same name.  Tolerances on the blades seem very tight when fitting it into the razor, and the blades are very sharp.  They might not be as sharp as the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brand, but they do their job correctly and efficiently.  Well made, just like their razors.</li>
            <li> Good blades for the right beard and face. Try these in your search for blades. These do not irritate your face as much as other blades but are still very sharp.</li>
            <li> These blades didn&#x27;t reduce my facial hair well. They felt dull, even though I put new blade in my razor. I shaved twice then through the blade away</li>
            <li> Merkur Doubel Edge in my opinion are a great blade, gives me a fantastic shave, the double is a 5 STAR./</li>
            <li> Merkur may make decent razors, but these blades are not sharp enough for me. After trying 3 of these blades, enough is enough, too much razor burn and not close enough... next.</li>
            <li> These blades seem quite sharp.  As far a durability is concerned I have just started using them and will have to wait to evaluate that aspect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving with the old school safety razor, but I have found these blades to be excellent.  I get a nice close shave without the irritation that has caused me to have in grown hairs in the past.  I use these blades with the Merkur 180 safety razor for the best shave ever!</li>
            <li> I know every face and beard is different, but this seems perfect for me.  My first experence with a real blade after years of electric and I have not cut myself at all, but still shaves smooth.  I&#x27;m loving the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shaving experience, my face feels great and I actually enjoy shaving now, after hating it for year.</li>
            <li> Great quality razors.  I use them with my Gillette slim adjustable.  There is even a slot in the back of the box to safely dispose of your used razors. perfect for &amp;#34;go bag&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The Merkur blades are fine - heavier than some other bargain brands, and with a good edge. A little pricey, but really - the only problem with these blades is that they&#x27;re not made by Feather. Feathers are still the best!</li>
            <li> my husband has been buying disposable razors and spending so much for shaving as his beard is so tough.  now he gets a very close shave and his face is as smooth as when he was a yojung man in the service shaving witb a straight razor. he&#x27;s very happy  with his smootb shave and so am I?</li>
            <li> I am returning to the world of &#x27;old fashion,&#x27; shaving after having spent many years using more conventional cartridge style razors.  My beard is tough &amp; I can go through a cartridge razor in several days, not a week.  Not uncommonly I can get razor burn on my neck, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compare the Merkur razor blade against the Feather Razor Blade, NEW Hi-Stainless Double Edge.  I used Col Conk&#x27;s glycerine shaving soap.  By far and away I&#x27;m pleased more with the Merkur blade than the Feather.  I had no skin nicks/cuts with the Merkur blade that lasted every bit of full week.  On the 1st day with the Feather I immediately sensed a difference.  The shave caused me to have burns and a few cuts that I hadn&#x27;t had before but my expected razor stubble returning within 8-10 hours, as it did when I used cartridge razors.  After 3 shaves with the Feather I was immediately back to the Merkur &amp; my good shaving experience returned!  I won&#x27;t be using the other 9 Feathers- I&#x27;m sticking with Merkur!!!</li>
            <li> great start for intro to double edge shaving. i used this when i first bought the merkur long handle. but after a while, if you want something sharper, try the feather razor blades. feathers might be to sharp for some people, so these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I tried one of these that came with my Merkur &#x27;1904&#x27; and I was not impressed at all. I am a fan of Feather and once you try a Feather, you will never go back.</li>
            <li> Every single person has a different skin type, hair thickness, and shaving period. Choose the brand that fulfills your shaving condition. I suggest you to try out as many blades as possible until you find out the suitable one</li>
            <li> I truly thought that this brand would outshine all the rest considering that they make the greatest safety razors in my opinion. However, I was a bit disappointed when I compare their razors to Shark and Astra brands, which are often a better price and value. I love their safety razors themselves, but I would recommend looking elsewhere for the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Husband loves these razors.</li>
            <li> Love these blade. Sharpest that I&#x27;ve used yet. I have a very rough and frisky beard, one sweep with these blades (without the guard) removed all the hair straight down to the skin. Gillette is no the closest shave that a man can get. Again, I used these blades without the guard. I highly recommend that if you have never done that, exercise extreme caution. If you are buying these blades, then I&#x27;m assuming that you already know the risk and danger of using them.</li>
            <li> To bad they get dull ;-) excellent product long life still able to get close to month depending on use</li>
            <li> The 10 razor leads took up no more room then a matchbox yet it was shipped in a box the size of the shoe box. This does not make any sense and is bad for the environment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave often and I&#x27;m not a razor connoisseur, but these seem like goo blades to me.  They appear to last quite a long time, but again I don&#x27;t shave often.  For me &amp;#34;last quite a long time&amp;#34; means I can leave it in the safety razor for a long time unused and pick it up and shave myself and it still feels fine.  If I shaved regularly like a civilized gentleman, I&#x27;d probably look for cheaper blades.  If I shaved regularly, I&#x27;d probably do a lot of things differently.</li>
            <li> I purchased these along with a Merkur 180 long handled DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur blades set the standard for the industry and I would gladly purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t the thinnest or sharpest blades, but they cut my coarse beard with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, blade manufacturers abound. Every one has a slightly different feel during a shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest buying a sample pack of blades made by several companies to determine what is best for your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have used a DE razor and blades, I have not had razor burn or ingrown hairs. The few additional nicks that occur are far more acceptable than the day-long irritation that I received after using cartridge systems like the Mach series from Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you use shave soaps and creams, not canned shave foam, with this product, you will be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Love these blades, stay sharp and very durable, great shave and easy to replace when it is necessary. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades, can&#x27;t complain about their performance. I shave at least 6 times per week, these last at least a week and a half for me, maybe two. Never had one of these rust either, which is good because that would likely leave a stain on my razor, which is a Merkur Futur.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Merkur Long handeled razor, and the single blade that was enclosed, was of course the first blade used. For whatever reason, that blade in reality, did not impress me. I tried a few other brands (Derby, Shark, Personna) and then went back to try another Merkur. This blade was much better than the one that came with the razor.....it will usually last me 5 shaves, no nicks or cuts......this is the blade I will stay with.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband, nice smooth shave. He claims 4-6 shaves before replacement. They lose the edge quickly but will try them again.</li>
            <li> I recommend really works</li>
            <li> Shaves great.  How do I say more?  I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper blade once...once and done.</li>
            <li> These blades are good &amp;sharp takes my beard off with 3 passes however since Is have my head I use the fusion pro glide on my noggin don&#x27;t have the nerve to use ad.e.razor.</li>
            <li> Every man deserves the merkur razor....old school shaving kit...for a smooth clean shave! My husband loves it and so do I!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very sharp and nicely wrapped in the package. The item arrived very quickly and exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent blades. I don&#x27;t know how common the used blade slot on the back is but it&#x27;s helpful so I like it. 5/5 because it&#x27;s as advertised.</li>
            <li> My son made the purchase,but he raved about it to me.</li>
            <li> If you shave regularly with a with a double shaver you will be well pleased with the Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;We all know the importance of a sharp blade for shaving comfort, and these will not disappoint you.</li>
            <li> Just got my first ever safety razor for xmas 4 months ago, and I love it.  It came with one of these blades, so after being impressed with my first several shaves, I bought this whole pack.  These blades are very nice, last a long time, and produce a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should. Thanks!</li>
            <li> These blades last about 5 days - five shaves- and then I change them. They do the job and I don&#x27;t cut myself much at all with them. I would recommend them but definately check out the Feather blades - that&#x27;s a whole new level of shaving amazingness.</li>
            <li> I am never dissatisfied with these blades. Great shave every time and great price. I have tried other blades and have not received the same close shave. It&#x27;s even better than the 5-blade shaver&#x27;s I used to use. Now I only use safety razors with these blades.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a safety razor a few months ago. These Merkur blades come in a nice spring loaded dispenser, which makes them harder to lose. They provide a nice shave, and haven&#x27;t nicked me too much. They are very thin, and I would purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> These razors gets at least 4 to 5 good shaves from these razors I will buy again. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> After some practice, great shave, lasts for quite a few shaves, and i do my face and head</li>
            <li> These are decent blades. I get about 15 uses out of each one . . . I&#x27;ve recently switched over to Feather blades, giving them a shot, but I don&#x27;t have any major complaints about the Merkur blades. They&#x27;re the ones I have used for ages.</li>
            <li> One of these Merkur blades came as a free sample with my razor, and these work as good as the same free sample.  I&#x27;m still going to get a sample pack here in the near future to see what other blades feel like.  But for your money, these are a good value.</li>
            <li> For the price, there are better blades. They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn. However, they do offer a close shave. I feel that there are much better options for the price; Persona (imported and domestic varieties), Derby, Feather, etc. I can use all of these interchangeably. Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
            <li> These were part of a gift for my brother. He has not complained and he would tell me if a gift I gave him was a POS. He is that kind of dude. So go ahead and buy them.</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY BLADES AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. SHIPPED ON TIME IN GOOD CONDITION.</li>
            <li> When I purchased my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor, I only had the Merkur blade it came with, a box of [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] blades and a box of Merkur blades.  I used the original Merkur blade for a week and then switched to the Feather blades and used them until I finished that box.  I was very pleased with the performance after a week for these blades.  Then I went back to start using my box of Merkur blades and a new blade serious felt WORSE than a week old Feather blade.  More tugging and effort required leaving more irritaion.  I just cannot recommend these in comparison to the Feather brand.  If I get different brands to compare to, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> These blades work ok. You really need to know what your doing with a safety razor to use these. They work better than 8 blade disposable crap from the grocery store, but there are better DE blades out there for the same price. Astra and Feather are the best, even Shark performs better. It&#x27;s all about face type though. Keep trying until you find one that&#x27;s right for you. Just make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing first.</li>
            <li> Great razor blades to a great razor!</li>
            <li> My person preference is I&#x27;d rather use the Feather blades. These were okay but after purchasing this initially I tried a larger sampler pack of many different manufacturers and types and ended up falling in love with the Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ones tended to not last very many shaves and weren&#x27;t my favorite. Not bad.</li>
            <li> Merkurs are the benchmark blade. That does not mean that there are not slightly better blades, but it does mean that it established the standard by which others are judged. As in knives, Solingen steel is nothing to sniff at. Merkurs offer the smoothest, least abrasive shave, and they are unmatched for edge-holding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Merkurs for four years, and I interchange them with Astras and Feathers in a Merkur Progress double-edge.I believe the Astras to be inferior (but still very respectable), and the Feathers to be slightly superior (when in a Progress; too agressive for my sensitive skin when in a 1960&#x27;s Gillette DE).</li>
            <li> Great feeling! great product, since i bought it i haven&#x27;t had any discomfit in using this product . . .</li>
            <li> Best blades for good shave</li>
            <li> My husband loves these razors. He used to get breakouts and rashes everytime he shaved even with the most expensive blades. Each one lasts at least 5 days. Best shave ever.</li>
            <li> in my opinion the best double edge razor blade!</li>
            <li> My go-to blade for my Art of Shaving razor. They last a little over a week of regular shaving. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of the other major brands but this one gives me the best shave and lasts a little longer than the others. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A good blade especially if you prep your face.  I do not get razor burn or irritation.  It&#x27;s not as sharp as the Feather blades but sharper is not necessarily better. This is definitely one of my top 3 blades.</li>
            <li> I always get the closest shave possible with these razors and my merkur safety razor. Use nice cream and a brush for full effect.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after trying out Feather DE razor blades. The Feather&#x27;s are great but are too sharp for my taste. No matter how careful I would be I would still end up with tiny nicks. Merkurs do the job just fine, last several shaves and are much easier on the skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a different blade, as usual the Germans have delivers engineering at it finest!  I thought a blade is just a blade right?  Wrong...  I as amazed at how smooth this blade was.  I was blown away by how little I felt shaving with these.  No tugging at the hairs, it glides like there was no blade at all. But one of the closest finest shaves I have ever had, including single edged razor blades in a shop!  I have no need to every buy any other brand. I&#x27;m going to stock up on these so that I never have to look again.&lt;br /&gt;This blade will spoil you for any other double edged blade.</li>
            <li> Nicest shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I switched over to these rather than those gimickey multi blade super expensive Mach Fusion things.</li>
            <li> These blades are a little too mild for my taste. My facial hair is on the thicker side so when I made a pass with the Merkur blade I could feel it tugging away. I had to make multiple passes in order to get my face nice and smooth. The result of these multiple passes was horrible road rash and a quite a bit of blood. Stepped over to Feather blades and they work like butter.</li>
            <li> My local pharmacy stopped carrying any but the cheapest blades, because the sales volume is so low. Thank You for having something that is good for more than one shave available. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double-edge safety razor that my father bought when he went into the Army in 1961 since I left basic training myself (they wouldn&#x27;t let me have blades in basic), and Merkur are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> For me, Merkur blades beat Feather. No muss, no fuss, my visage simply likes the Merkur and that is that. If you&#x27;re reading this, you may be a Feather guy or gal and that&#x27;s great. I just don&#x27;t quite understand the &amp;#34;if you don&#x27;t shave with Feather you&#x27;re a dolt...&amp;#34; mentality that exists in reviews I&#x27;ve read. The Feather is very sharp indeed, but sharp doesn&#x27;t necessarily equate to &amp;#34;the best...period&amp;#34;. There is no Jedi training required with any blade...just put the damn thing in the razor and see if it works for you. If your technique didn&#x27;t cause nicks before, chances are the Feather will be fine.  I like Merkur.</li>
            <li> First time using double edge razor and I will never go back to disposable razors!  Help tremendously wilts razor burn I used to get with Gillette.  Double edge shaver for life.</li>
            <li> Good product...as advertised</li>
            <li> Got this as part of the shaving set for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it and his face is so smooth.</li>
            <li> Good, quality blade with middle-of-the-road sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer sharper blades, but that reflects my personal needs, not the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check it out to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> Fairly Cheap and highly effective. I&#x27;ve come to learn that razor burn is based on too many factors to judge blades on whether or not they cause it. I use these blades and make sure that I rinse of with cold water and put on some aftershave lotion and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with bumps or burn in some time.</li>
            <li> These are my husband&#x27;s preferred brand of razor blades.  We have tried multiple others (made in the USA and in Japan) and he keeps going back to these.</li>
            <li> Husband ordered and likes them.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the blades in this pack yet but the one that came with the razor is smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> Love these blades. I get about 4-5 shaves with one blade if I shave everyday. However, there comes a time when I refrain and let my facial grow for a day or two. The longest and rare time span is a week. Than I may get 3 good shaves after its all said and shaved off. All in all, pound for pound, they are Sharp and pliable durable German Steel. I&#x27;m sure the Fuhrer himself swore by them .</li>
            <li> my partner loved it - perfect gift for him to go with all the accessories  . . . .  .</li>
            <li> Not too sharp and works great. I love double edge razors. I dont know why it faded out in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have these for my safety razor and I am replacing these way less than the disposables plus they are cheaper. Couple that with the old school feel of the double safety razor and these are a must have. Ya German steel</li>
