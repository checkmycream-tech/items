            <li>it smells AMAZING</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, this lotion isn&#x27;t anything amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product was an amazing FIVE-stars.</li>
            <li>Having worked in customer service all my life I know how important it is to keep your customers happy.</li>
            <li>This stuff works amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing...</li>
            <li>This lotion did that and gave my skin a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells nice.</li>
            <li>Lotion gives a nice color.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and has a nice smell too.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and does NOT look blotchy</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice and tan.</li>
            <li>nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>With this product she darkened up nicely and did not even need to use a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>To be honest, through the bottles I used I had NO idea</li>
            <li>You get a nice brown color from this, and don&#x27;t get the yucky after tanning scent.</li>
            <li>It was effective for tanning..</li>
            <li>I would give it zero stars because of that, but the lotion was kind to my skin, also, I did not care for the scent.</li>
            <li>nice smeeeth to to the air</li>
            <li>However it does not have any smell to it, I like when tanning lotions have a nice scent to them.</li>
            <li>This is a nice starter bronzer.  </li>
            <li>It does give you a nice glow without that burnt skin smell.</li>
            <li>After I achieved a nice tan, I went up to another product by this company that was 30x -</li>
            <li>Said that this was the popular choice.</li>
            <li>I had excellent and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Use for tanning indoor and out, nice smell will purchase this item again does not leave your skin feeling greesy</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order for my own use, my niece asked me to order it for her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bronzer has helped me get a great tan - and the longer I&#x27;ve gone, the tan just gets better &amp; better.</li>
            <li>I like it alot as it is nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have always liked AG products</li>
            <li>I did get a nice tan from using this lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice as well.</li>
            <li>I received the package two days after I ordered it which was nice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the smell, but I did get good color with this lotion</li>
            <li>but I feel like this helps me keep a nice hint of color.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product fast shipping</li>
            <li>Its ok not as good as I wanted it to be</li>
            <li>It always gave me great results, and I was never disappointed.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure my legs will have an awesome tan like my arms after it fades!</li>
            <li>Its almost like my color developed perfectly and got better each day!</li>
            <li>Normal tanning lotion you get at the tanning salon never works for my skin tone but this one works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>It has a light smell that I found pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and burn easily.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is easy to apply smells good ect.</li>
            <li>i tan very easily</li>
            <li>Smells fine and works fairly well for the price...</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant - light and kind of flowery, but not at all overwhelming or too girly-scented.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can over look this due to the great price and wonderful tan.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a fine product and the smell lasts and is quite good.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself works really well, and the price is very fair.</li>
            <li>By far the best Tanning lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>So I got on Amazon and started reading recommendations for a good, but cheap lotion.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin soft and came sealed in plastic, which I was very happy about.  </li>
            <li>So when I saw this lotion for so cheap, I was weary about how well it would work, regardless of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>Looks natural and is a superb moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Perfect product professional</li>
            <li>The Gold holds it&#x27;s own fur sure.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for a while and tried others, but by far this is the best tan in a bottle</li>
            <li>Lotion smells really good, isn&#x27;t oily, and works very well!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, it smells very good, and apply nicely and leaves a soft touch after tanning.</li>
            <li>Works like magic perfect for that golden tan quick and</li>
            <li>I could see a great color within the first week (after 5 days of tanning).  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice lotion that rubs in easy.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very smooth, looking healthy and no greasy feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I love smell  </li>
            <li>Have used this before and love this product.</li>
            <li>OC Ten was the best lotion I have ever used...</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably finish the bottle, and then get something with more bronzers in it.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>and I went with this company because it offered more OZ...definately not the case.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more of this.  </li>
            <li>So everyone buy this product :]</li>
            <li>but it works as well as some lotions that I have used that cost $50.00 or more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>But this bronzer was a safe bet for me.</li>
            <li>I love to combine products and experiment - and</li>
            <li>am satisfied, and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>With this lotion I have been able to go the the tanning bed about every three days without it wearing off.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>I have not gone more than a couple times</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some by Millennium, and mostly Designer Skin.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m really glad I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>It smells ok...</li>
            <li>and she bought more of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tan well, but most tanning bed products eventually turn me orange; like most tanning excellerators do.</li>
            <li>I looove my tan :-)</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, will buy again</li>
            <li>However, I decided to give it a try and after a couple days, I was satisfied with the tan that I got.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion for tanning.</li>
            <li>Love the color I love it</li>

            <li>Australian gold is my favorite brand of tanning lotion, I think it works best.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>

            <li>(But I will not be using any more of it.)</li>

            <li>I love this lotion,</li>
            <li>I always look at reviews before I buy a product and the ones I read about this one seemed okay</li>
            <li>awsome love it and the smell too</li>
            <li>I do still berry much love</li>
            <li>The darker the tan the better.</li>

            <li>It goes on smooth, smells nice and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Australian Gold used to be one of the best out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Not terrible</li>
            <li>Their lotions keep getting better and better as time goes on.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the color I have.  </li>
            <li>and I had such a great tan!</li>
            <li>, it has the smell of most lotions AFTER you get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>All of my friends now use it :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I gave this 3 stars because I know there&#x27;s better tanning lotions out there, but what can you expect for $13?</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>It gives that tan look you will just love</li>
            <li>It will do what it says and give you an even tan better than any lotion I have ever used</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS.............</li>
            <li>Love this indoor tanning lotion and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>It worked OK</li>
            <li>but I have used better.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had a better bronzing agent</li>
            <li>All the product diversion stories come mostly from tanning lotion companies.</li>
            <li>but this lotion makes magic on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, cheaper here than at the salon.</li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>and I figure the darker the better in Michigan summers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Not like most tanning lotions, defintiely recommend.</li>
            <li>I love all products from this company.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great, smells great &amp; its alot cheaper than others.</li>
            <li>This product goes on really quick and easy, and give a good color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this product!!!</li>
            <li>It delivers a nice golden brown!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and goes on pretty smooth</li>
            <li>Great service got my package very quickly, but for me it didn&#x27;t do much for my tan didn&#x27;t get any darker.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product about a week ago and when it arrived, the seal had already been cut (very cleanly I might add).</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li>It was pretty good...</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>This lotion is pretty good.</li>
            <li>but it really does help you get a nice tan!</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good once you 1st put it on</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good bronzer if you&#x27;re a beginner tanner and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a lotion.</li>
            <li>smells good, not expensive.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for new tanners, experienced tanners, and even men.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it goes on easy and has no shimmer or tingle.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING LOTION IS GREAT GOES ON SMOOTHLY.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, Ive used tons of different lotions and this one is deffiantly the best especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and rubs in smoothly.</li>
            <li>It gives you great natural color.</li>
            <li>I feel this is a great lotion for those looking for a natural tan.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It gave me a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li>It smells good, it only took a week of tanning for me to get nice color, and its cheap!</li>
            <li>Its ok, but deviously black is the best</li>
            <li>First of all, I was excited to find a good deal on this product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I use it every time I go (about every other day) and it does an excellent job at keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome, like Fruity &amp; Bright by victoria&#x27;s secret, just like it.</li>
            <li>And thanks to Amazon, my beautiful tan was so much cheaper than buying this in the tanning salon!</li>
            <li>It smells clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>lol .. love Australian gold products !</li>
            <li>I tan easy. .</li>
            <li>Got it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>I tan easily anyway</li>
            <li>Smells good and gives a nice overall color.</li>
            <li>And it doesnt leave you smelling to strong of tanning lotion</li>
            <li>Product gives good overall tan and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I got a beautiful brown color after just one session in just a regular tanning bed, no upgrade.  </li>
            <li>it smells good, its not a thick lotion like some i have used, and it did give me the tan i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I got a beautiful color from this lotion, but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how kind of greasy it felt at first.</li>
            <li>I love Australian Gold tanning lotions, this one is ok, but does give as good of tan as some of the others</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for a man, but probably better suited for the ladies</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly be buying more of this product!</li>
            <li>the shelf&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to work fine however.</li>
            <li>This lotion is just fine.</li>
            <li>and it works fine for the price you</li>
            <li>I opened it and it looked fine.</li>
            <li>I love Austrialian Gold and how it darkens and bronzes so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love how quickly I tan</li>
            <li>goes away quickly!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement with my tan.</li>
            <li>dont by lotion at the salon cuz its a huge rip off.</li>
            <li>Also the scent is so light, so I dont stink when I am finished tanning</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve yet to find one I truly like and enjoy using.</li>
            <li>There are lower priced options available on Amazon</li>
            <li>and they go on smooth.</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m happy to say that no of those were present.</li>
            <li>Is a light brown/tan color.  </li>
            <li>It does have a light bronzer in it that lasts about a day.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product and price.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and after you get done tanning</li>
            <li>leaves your skin sinfully smooth too.</li>
            <li>was it cheap on here...</li>
            <li>It is also watery and seems cheap.  </li>
            <li>Great if your staring out completely white like myself.</li>
            <li>I love a lot of Australian gold products but this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>but I was being cheap and decided to go with this one--</li>
            <li>I felt like maybe the lotion wasn&#x27;t genuine - but who knows.</li>
            <li>I have a great tan that happeneded almost instantly and stayed.</li>
            <li>and I really like it nice color results</li>
            <li>I have been doing a more powerful bed</li>
            <li>Nothing fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The amount of lotion you recieve for the price is incomparable.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion along with the Australian Gold Cheeky Brown as you could purchase both for a great price, they both can be used in the tanning aslon and outside, the smell is great,</li>
            <li>not that burnt skin smell, goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Cannot stand the smell, cheap quality, zero tanning results.</li>
            <li>If you are light skinned like me, dont expect this lotion to work miracles.</li>
            <li>Australian gold makes great products for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap (even in salons), and it does the job.</li>
            <li>and it works great with a australian gold SPF 4 over it</li>
            <li>This gives a nice brown color, and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a great product that gives me the fullest tan possible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned naturally and I am faithful to this lotion, and this price is a steal.</li>
            <li>overall this is one of my favorite tanning lotions/bronzers and it is a good price too.</li>
            <li>So use it because it smells good and makes your skin soft, don&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re trying to get darker.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super smooth and it smells nice - no fake tanning smells</li>
            <li>Just tried for the first time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results !!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best for fair-skinned individuals that want to look dark like everyone else, but not fake!</li>
            <li>This lotion smells nice &amp; has decent bronzers.</li>
            <li>It has a mild smell, not too strong and helps cover that \\&quot;just tanned smell\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>gave this lotion a 3 star rating because usually Australian Golds products have a super fruity, tropical smell, but Sinfully Blacks smell wasnt that great.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is more bearable than most and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I usually go with banana boat because it works awesome.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money!</li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many MUCH higher priced bronzers that don&#x27;t come close to the efficiency of this one.  </li>
            <li>The only kind for me!</li>
            <li>AN AMAZING TAN ALONG WITH THE ACTUAL TANNING BED.... :)</li>
            <li>They were nice enough to put some scotch tape over the top of it instead.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, very similar to AG products I have used before and the bronzing works.  </li>
            <li>though i am part indian and naturally tan, this helped me get my tan alot faster, love the smell too!</li>
            <li>, it gives you a really dark brown tan.. even naturally fair skinned people like me!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll have to admit this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>No orange-y hue and not pale, just a nice bronze.  </li>
            <li>Also it smells amazing and completely eliminates that post tanning bed smell.</li>
            <li>Tan fast and tan dark with this lotion that also has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>I had so many people comment on my great tan this year and usually don&#x27;t get any comments.</li>
            <li>At the end of my trip I came home with a great tan and for the first time my friends and family actually admitted that I looked tan.</li>
            <li>I average once or twice a week in a 20 minute bed and have a beautiful color.  </li>
            <li>So, I bought an full bottle this time and will keep this schedule.  </li>
            <li>I was using the australian gold in the orange bottle before and it worked good</li>
            <li>This stuff is priced well and leaves me feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned red head</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t tan as fast as most people</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and tan outside.</li>
            <li>Ga-Ga is really good too, so I might try that next.</li>
            <li>It was OK didn&#x27;t really do what it said.</li>
            <li>Its not thin as in watery, it just smooths out easier than most lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>DONT THINK I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN, BUT DO APPRECIATE THE LOW COST AND GOOD START ON MY TAN.</li>
            <li>for me was good enough.</li>
            <li>To orangey for my taste Australian Gold is a good product.</li>
            <li>Started seeing results fast and it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>dollars for them, so this would be a good investment for anyone just needing a regular tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I normally feel really oily and smell funny after the tanning beds but this lotion smelled great and didnt get that grimy feeling after.</li>
            <li>This is a really good tanning lotion and I&#x27;ll likely buy again since they&#x27;re no longer making the Crystal X.</li>
            <li>, I opened and loved it, tanned last night</li>
            <li>The bronzer definitely accelerates the tanning process; and the good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stain my hands.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t burn and just develop a nice natural brown colour , realy moisturises the skin aswell</li>
            <li>sinfully black is good stuff :)</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month, I am not dark, but have a nice tan and overall good tone.</li>
            <li>Being an avid tanner I strongly favor lotions that have bronzers in them.</li>
            <li>Other than that, everything was great, including the smell, and the color I got from one week alone.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for both tanning beds and outdoors - just remember no SPF so be careful!</li>
            <li>My tan has come in quick and my skin feels hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>so I was nervous till it got here which I may add quickly</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that the bottle is kind of cheap and crackles</li>
            <li>It also goes on super well, not runny like others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>I have perused the fine (very fine..) print on this product and nowhere does it say it is meant as simply  a pre/post tanning bed lotion.</li>
            <li>Beyond Famous, Crystal, HOT, and I really like this one for the value and the results.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin a very nice dark tan.  </li>
            <li>My favorite lotion so far!</li>
            <li>Item shipped fast!!</li>
            <li>and this just helps ten times more!</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion Ive ever used, and I have been no less than thrilled.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine, and it does not leave you with the feeling you need to shower as fast as you can after tanning.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t turn me orange after tanning every other day!!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t make me turn orange, but has given me a really solid, even tan.</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks she was a shade that she was happy with</li>
            <li>This one has instant bronzers and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>From the first use of this lotion, I LOVED the smell (although getting out of the bed it didn&#x27;t smell as pretty) but it definitely gave immediate results.    </li>
            <li>My GF used this at the tanning salon several times and it leaves a nice bronze color on her. 2</li>
            <li>and I now have my own tanning bed and Australian Gold is always number one!</li>
            <li>For the price it is worth it though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Australian Gold products for years and this one turned me a nice brown without ever making me look orange.  </li>
            <li>doesnt smell good and left me feeling very oily.</li>
            <li>I feel fun and fresh.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice enough you can run to the store afterwards and not feel like you have to run home and shower right away because you reek.  </li>
            <li>Works great better than some of the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li>Super Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>First off this stuff super moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>I read other reviews that stated this lotion makes you burn if you have fair skin</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll not walk out with the &#x27;burned skin&#x27; smell so you wont feel the need to run home and take a shower right away.</li>
            <li>this product is all right in my book</li>
            <li>I always put it on right before going into the bed.</li>
            <li>(I always have at least 3 different bottles) because there are some lotions that work great but start to look \\&quot;fake\\&quot; after too many uses!</li>
            <li>Great bronzer for an unbelievable price.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately doesn&#x27;t have that Australian Gold signature scent, but a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>Normally I can tan in the full sun for a couple of afternoons and get significant results that last more than a month.</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING and thanks to the fact that it has a bronzer in it already, you can see results in an extremely short amount of time.</li>
            <li>The Sinfully Black smells good, and applies well.</li>
            <li>) Leaves skin soft and glowing :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>delivery was really quick I recommend it highly !</li>
            <li>Maybe you will get lucky and receive the real deal.</li>
            <li>most of the Australian Gold lotions ive tried, they are very easy to spread on your body prior to tanning</li>
            <li>This product does not accelerate my tan very much</li>
            <li>Was surprised at how quickly I started to tan after using it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this lotion plus it has a nice smell that prevents me from having that strong gross tanning bed smell and since I go on my lunch break at work, that&#x27;s definitely a plus for me &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The first time I have used a lotion with a bronzer</li>
            <li>I saw results after first time i  used it, definetly going to get me to the shade I am looking for.</li>
            <li>The first 2 times I tanned with it</li>
            <li>think I was expecting a bit more instand color from this product overall.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite lotions yet</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back for more of what works.</li>
            <li>I work in a hot factory atmosphere,10 to 12 hour days, and did not want to &#x27;run&#x27;, sweat my tan off, or have wore spots.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased this product from the local tanning salon that I frequent and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for close to ten dollars more at the salon</li>
            <li>and I have to say I am pretty satisified with the results.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this again :)</li>
            <li>I really like this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>I love Australian Gold products and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li>I paid $22 for this at the salon - I would suggest anyone not to buy this lotion at this price because you could get a much better product (for the ones who want an instant difference).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>And even though I (for the most part) still feel that way, I actually felt like this lotion turned me bronze instead of orange.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this lotion, I absolutely love the results I get.  </li>
            <li>It came promptly and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I will be buying again very soon!</li>
            <li>It takes more effort than should be necessary to squeeze the lotion out as well.</li>
            <li>This is the same stuff you buy for much more.  </li>
            <li>It also smells really fruity!</li>
            <li>I am returning it and just gonna spend the extra money for something better.</li>
            <li>I love Australian Gold products</li>
            <li>first time using this product</li>
            <li>The only reason I stopped using it is because I wanted to branch out and try more lotions.</li>
            <li>When using this lotion for the first time (after using a weaker lotion) I recommend reducing your time you spend in the bed</li>
            <li>Thank you Australian gold! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for YEARS and have mostly used Australian Gold.</li>
            <li>First of all, the bottle I received does not smell like berries.</li>
            <li>I love the products from Australian Gold, I have used them for years.</li>
            <li>It smells better than most tanning lotions I have used in the past</li>
            <li>and I love that it has the bronzer without all the extra shimmer and tingle.</li>
            <li>The next day I used it and it was okay then too.</li>
            <li>You really do get your moneys worth out of it</li>
            <li>I started darkening after the first.  </li>
            <li>If the next day I felt I could handle 5 more minutes</li>
            <li>ALWAYS LOVE THE X DEEP TANNING</li>
            <li>It came in a timely manner and was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I dont feel or smell funny</li>
            <li>Unfortuantely I ordered a different lotion this time to see if I like it better,</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and smells really good and also gives you that dark tan your looking for</li>
            <li>It is a good lotion, however if you have sensitive skin like me it made me break out after a long period of time.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, not amazing, but not bad.</li>
            <li>I got super dark very quickly!</li>
            <li>and I do burn easy if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, light fragrance, soaks right in to the skin, no funny smell after tanning.  </li>
            <li>But it certainly feels like one of the more low quality lotions.</li>
            <li>This just made me feel a little more comfortable &amp; cleaner, I would still shower afterward to fully cleanse.</li>
            <li>I first using Australian gold and love the product, it very affordable and you will like the product.</li>
            <li>The bottle is smaller than expected but it is still a great value</li>
            <li>This lotion is great and non-greasy, but for obtaining a serious tan, I layer it with an oil.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than many of the boutique tanning oils which contain the same ingredients!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made me dark, a dream come true :)</li>
            <li>It works fine, but I didn&#x27;t notice any huge differences between this and other lotions I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you want to get dark very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>So I used it pretty much all summer</li>
            <li>Package was nicely packed and sealed, I tan very well due to genetics</li>
            <li>and I find I go through this stuff pretty fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results--I haven&#x27;t used this lotion in a long time, but it used to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>and this gives me a nice dark color</li>
            <li>, i kindof wonder if its fake and has sunblock missed in it or something, the only good thing i can say about this product is that it smells good.</li>
            <li>husband - who is a light complected black man, has also taken to applying some before he goes outside, and has accomplished a nice golden brown colour.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I work at a very popular tanning salon and was informed by someone very high up in the company that this lotion is almost identical to the J WOW tanning lotion which is much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>this has helped my skin darken faster, I had a very decent tan after one week of 4 indoor tanning sessions.</li>
            <li>Skin is super soft after.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothering me at all.</li>
            <li>Sinfully black does give you a nice tan.</li>
            <li>Planet fitness sells this exact same stuff for twice the price and even that is semi cheap for tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Really does help me attain a better tan after a long plateau.  </li>
            <li>love  this - wish I knew about it a long time ago - I get so tan with this !!</li>
            <li>My arms, back and chest are fine and tan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive tanning lotions and Sinfully Black is the best that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Recommendation is very high on this product.  </li>
            <li>I used this lotion for about a month everyday, it really lasts a long time and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a inexpensive tanning lotion that will keep your skin moisturized and give you fast results!</li>
            <li>I looked up a few others they sell and the price difference was amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and works just as good as any expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>This took my tan to a much deeper level and left my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t really like how watery it was.</li>
            <li>I think it was just because they haven&#x27;t seen much sun until yesterday.</li>
            <li>Helps to darken you much quicker</li>
            <li>SO much cheaper the the tanning salon charges.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, light scent, does not stain skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave you red and splotchy either!!!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>really worked well for me.</li>
            <li>It is also very affordable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Also, I do love Australian Gold products and I&#x27;ve tried many of their more expensive ones-</li>
            <li>Makes skin brown and keeps skin very moist.  </li>
            <li>2 stars for the yummy smell and semi fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t orange and the bronzers work really well and give an even appearance.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is getting me much darker than when I used no lotion at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>What I do know is that it gives you fast, practically one session results.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference than not using anything at all.</li>
            <li>Many years ago, I was a lifeguard, and spent probably 50-60 hours a week in the sun...</li>
            <li>and I got so much darker because I used this product</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t use much though</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll also pay 3 or 4 times as much.  </li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like at all about the lotion was that it made me feel really greasy after &amp; caused me to break out alot.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>I gave it a 5 star because it a very product and will in fact do the job, and will not cost you a lot of money..</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying lotion at the salon.</li>
            <li>I heard so much about this product from girls</li>
            <li>I used this lotion from the very start of my tanning season and never burned.  </li>
            <li>It was runny and seemed to have a problem absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used this tanning lotion for two years and it was absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really greasy and makes my skin very oily.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like how watery this product is.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t care too much for the smell</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give you much color.  </li>
            <li>I went on a cruise and used this the whole time.</li>
            <li>This lotion really works well on me.</li>
            <li>and it bronzes very well.  </li>
            <li>My skin tans very well</li>
            <li>The bronzer isn&#x27;t really noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>Was very liquidity....</li>
            <li>Very liquidy, and has a very stong scent.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help my tan get darker either.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>No problems with the product they just need to be honest with the actual fluid ounces you are getting!    </li>
            <li>shoot people still by the walmart brand of of stuff and generic prescriptions just being honest about your product makes a big difference!</li>
            <li>It does smell good although not amazing like some have proclaimed.</li>
            <li>Used this twice and already getting dark, love the Australian Gold line of tanning products but this my be my new favorite.</li>
            <li>So if you want a slightly bronzing smooth lotion with less smell this is a good one for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to use it next summer!!</li>
            <li>I have used other products that give a better tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more liquidy and slippery than other lotions, which allows it to spread on easier.</li>
            <li>Much better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>After a few days applying it and staying in the pool for a couple of hours, my skin gets really dark bronze and looks wonderful, hidrated and soft.</li>
            <li>While that one admittedly smelled better and left my skin super soft, I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results.</li>
            <li>A few days after purchasing this product, I posted a review about it because I was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>Have had great results past and present!</li>
            <li>I do not have time to be out in the sun much, so tanning beds and lotions are a whole new experience for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think there was anything extra special about this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I do leave on until next day to shower to get full effect of bronzer.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is one of many I use to have that dark tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to a higher end lotion, but so far this seems to be working as well for a 1/4 of the price.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations but it&#x27;s more of a bronzer then dark.</li>
            <li>AG Sinfully Black 15X Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion is a great indoor tanning lotion!!</li>
            <li>but this lotion is on a whole new level.</li>
            <li>Previously used Hawaiian Tropics and Banana Boat products have worked much better.</li>
            <li>This is one of favorite ones and with buying through an Amazon seller it was half the price vs the place I tan at.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a lot of tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve never been this satisfied with any of the ones I bought before I decided to get Sinfully Black.</li>
            <li>A really good, basic, inexpensive, everyday lotion.</li>
            <li>This particular bottle smelled like hair dye.</li>
            <li>It does smell decent though.</li>
            <li>I looked brown, then super red for a couple of days, then tan.</li>
            <li>but it did arrive quick overall</li>
            <li>I will go with a different kind once this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>but let be realistic...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li>In short, I did get darker but not as quickly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I have used (and loved) Australian Gold products in the past, but his didn&#x27;t work at all, which makes me think that it may not be real.</li>
            <li>You do need a really good base tan before using this product, other wise you will burn!.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion for everyone who uses a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Risk is too high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>lotion leaves your skin super soft, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in color after I used it a few times.</li>
            <li>Although I did get a little burnt, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my fault for over tanning.</li>
            <li>It was hard for me to get a nice color</li>
            <li>I do have a natural Olive complexion as well and tan fast.</li>
            <li>But the point is I baught the australian gold sinfully dark tanning lotion because it looked amazing.</li>
            <li>AS MUCH about getting completely fried.</li>
            <li>The smell in general isn&#x27;t very appealing to me, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Produt provides great color to fair-skinned people like myself without looking fake.  </li>
            <li>As far as smell is concerned, I don&#x27;t really notice after I have applied and tanned.  </li>
            <li>Its not thick or greasy</li>
            <li>Produt provides great color to fair-skinned people like myself without looking fake.</li>
            <li>so I do not know if it can give you the ultimate golden glow.</li>
            <li>Australian Gold products are all worth the price for the ease of uniform application.</li>
            <li>JUST HAVE MORE TROUBLE GETTING TO THE POOL....</li>
            <li>am fair skinned, and took awhile to get over  the &#x27;red&#x27; and build a good base.</li>
            <li>and this got me dark pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t tan as easy as I do so for her to get as dark as she did.  </li>
            <li>It usually takes me a few times laying out to get a good tan but not with this product!</li>
            <li>It felt uncomfortable on my skin and didn&#x27;t blend very nicely.</li>
            <li>for weird packaging, just make sure you order it through a place that has it fully sealed and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always looking for new stuff to tan with.</li>
            <li>Mos def a new ATF</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>She has a hard time tanning, where I do not, I tan very easily and darkened up before midsummer.</li>
            <li>It absorbed and dried quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>orange - very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Why would they sell a fake version of their own product?!</li>
            <li>A couple months ago, my first bottle started getting low.</li>
            <li>and they are exactly the same...</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion in the past and have yet to find one that works better.</li>
            <li>I first tried it when I bought one of those sample packets at my tanning salon and later that day</li>
            <li>Many other reviews spoke about instant color and a bronze glow after one use of this product.</li>
            <li>I believe it was transplanted with something cheap and watered down.</li>
            <li>the second time, it came in a clear sealed bag, so i thought it wouldn&#x27;t be the solid paste that i got, and would instead be the regular lotion that i love.</li>
            <li>I have used many others in the past, got to say that for me, this is just as good if not better than the more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>I love the deep dark color I get with it no orange color either.</li>
            <li>Love the Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15x</li>
            <li>I also recomend sinfully black to someone like me who love Australian Gold products.  </li>
            <li>After starting to use this it didnt get me as dark as fast but definitely gave me a more natural look.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t get as red.  </li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t tan, but this makes it fun!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to those that enjoy a deep dark tan.</li>
            <li>Compared to my last bottle of Sinfully Black, it is significantly lighter in color, has a much fainter smell, and is a lot runnier applying to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Lotion does the right job AND quick, plain and simple.</li>
            <li>I can tell that I am a bit darker, but nowhere near where I was hoping to be.</li>
            <li>and I had to stop using it because every time I did I developed a severe headache.</li>
            <li>Thanks Australian Gold!!</li>
            <li>Have gone tanning three times with it in a ten minute bed, and u can really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>but it was unsealed and didn&#x27;t work wonders like my old designer skin lotion</li>
            <li>The attendant at my local salon recommended this to me.</li>
            <li>She can go the whole summer and only go a shade or so darker.</li>
            <li>I really like Australian Gold products and this one is inexpensive ($13 when I bought it) and works well.</li>
            <li>I think it brings out your natural tanning ability and doesn&#x27;t make you orange.  </li>
            <li>it brings out the natural tones of your body&#x27;s tan, and keeps it there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been to the tanning bed in nearly a week, and the color has faded</li>
            <li>It came early</li>
            <li>so the bronzers take complete effect.</li>
            <li>I took a shower after anyway, but rubbed my skin really soft that way it didn&#x27;t wash away all the bronzers.</li>
            <li>Also, their products have a fragarance that is soft.</li>
            <li>and it was definitely not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Who makes this stuff, i would like to complain directly.  </li>
            <li>While I like the smell of this one as well as how soft it makes my skin</li>
            <li>its a natural bronzer</li>
            <li>I used this all summer and found that it gave me an even natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion, 8.5... Actually love all their products, would recommend to anyone... does give you that dark golden tan...</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper to go through Amazon than buying at a local salon.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a natural tanning color and makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>it was old feeling sticky feeling after tanning</li>
            <li>and I developed a base tan before I started using this lotion, but the results I&#x27;ve gotten are the best I&#x27;ve gotten from a tanning lotion so far.</li>
            <li>It is a bit thin and runny, but I liked that in the warmer months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sampled a bunch at the salon, including Smoke Black Bronzer, Snooki black bronzer, and this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The true brown color the bronzer leaves is very pretty and natural and lasted 3-4 days (even though I shower at least once daily).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying other lotions since then &amp; Luminary by Designer Skin will most likely be my next choice.</li>
            <li>Secondary sticker over original sku#... Not the real deal.</li>
            <li>and I am still super dark and bronze</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting to get dark quickly this is not the lotion for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve laid twice &amp;&amp; I&#x27;m super dark.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T expect to be super dark after one, or even a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>I tan pretty easily as I am of Greek and Italian descent.  </li>
            <li>The first time using this, I was several shades darker in only 30 minutes, with no burning.</li>
            <li>but this is the FIRST lotion with a bronzer I have bought because I have always stayed away from them, not wanting a fake looking fake-bake.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>and she got really dark in just a few days, so we ordered our own.</li>
            <li>My complexion is kind of dark due to native american ancestry but this lotion has gotten me even darker.</li>
            <li>I ordered this along with Devoted Creations White 2 Black Supre Advanced Bronzer Tanning Lotion... and the AG saved the day, so to speak.</li>
            <li>Smell is decent and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping for more dramatic change in color</li>
            <li>Oh and this size bottle really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work any better than any other lotion...looking for dark...</li>
            <li>Should be classified as a lotion not a dark tanner.</li>
            <li>I bought Sinfully Black after a long review process of the many different kinds for sale on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This really find nothing but dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>As far as the tan, it gives you that natural color that will last longer.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tell any major results.</li>
            <li>; I purchased this through Tan 4 Less, and they charge something like 6 or 7 dollars for shipping, but if you add a lotion to your order from them, they only add a dollar per item, so they are like a true wholesaler.  </li>
            <li>IT is a good thick lotion with very little fragrance, which is what I like.</li>
            <li>Product was not real, it smelt very chemically</li>
            <li>So far, its not impressing me but hopefully itll build up within the next days</li>
            <li>It had a fruity scent applying, but after getting out of the bed I barely noticed the odor at all.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get me near as tan as the Australian Gold &amp;#34;Going GAGA&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Your tanner will tell you that you&#x27;re only guaranteed to get quality lotions if you buy directly from them because you know where you&#x27;re getting it from.  </li>
            <li>I barely tanned at all.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice bronze, not orange or fake looking...</li>
            <li>So after tanning with this lotion, it&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable not taking a shower.</li>
            <li>Nothing better or worse than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>had a noticeable difference right after, and it had a little tingle to it.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about it is that it doesn&#x27;t give my skin that fake orange tint, doesn&#x27;t stain my palms after applying &amp; I see great, long lasting results after one twenty minute session in a base bed.</li>
            <li>I used this product tanning only once a week and after the second use I was wow darker!</li>
            <li>However, my tan usually fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>It really is giving me nice color, and it doesn&#x27;t look fake or wash down the drain as soon as you shower.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to be caught without your favorite lotions but the price tag markup is crazy high!</li>
            <li>It rivals many of the expensive brands by far.</li>
            <li>The thing I&#x27;ve read most in reviews about Australian Gold tanning lotions is how thin they are; making them go on easier.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it gets you pretty dark (and natural-looking) after just one use!</li>
            <li>hahaa ) which I rub on first, and then apply the Australian Gold Sinfully Black.</li>
            <li>This is the EXACT same lotion as JWOWW&#x27;s Black Bronzer.</li>
            <li>lotion is a bit thick, but spreads evenly and easily, and soaks into the skin quickly - should apply it at least 10 min before tanning, but could be applied much earlier, or at the last minute, too.  </li>
            <li>I got so dark so fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years and generally take the winters off.  </li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t see a big difference at all than any other lotions I have used.</li>
            <li>After just 1 use I&#x27;m pretty brown, and I&#x27;ve maintained that color for over a a few weeks</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Applies nicely, thick lotion, no streaks</li>
            <li>This lotion is absolutely watered down or cut with another type of lotion.  </li>
            <li>And it seems really runny, like watered down or</li>
            <li>Sinfully Black really boosted my tan.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase it again, works as well as the higher priced lotions sold at the salon, for half the price!</li>
            <li>I personally would prefer a lotion that is slightly thicker in consistancy, but really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>The seal wasn&#x27;t broken, the bottle was full and smells like the real deal stuff also the tag was not jacked up like other said.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I&#x27;m used to feeling at least a little greasy using any lotion (including Designer Skin lotions,)</li>
            <li>i use only a little bit &amp; it works really well.</li>

            <li> I also recommend that you use a good lotion after your shower to maintain the health of your skin (and the glow of your tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it takes a good lotion to get me to the brown I like during summer.</li>
            <li> Good after tan moisturizer too.  </li>

            <li> It also makes your skin look amazing after you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li> and all I can say is it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> it smells AMAZING</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, this lotion isn&#x27;t anything amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product was an amazing FIVE-stars.</li>
            <li> Having worked in customer service all my life I know how important it is to keep your customers happy.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing...</li>
            <li> This lotion did that and gave my skin a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice.</li>
            <li> Lotion gives a nice color.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and has a nice smell too.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and does NOT look blotchy</li>
            <li> It also leaves your skin feeling softer which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I tan once a week and with this lotion I am maintaining a nice even tan.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s your own fault for assuming so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and tan.</li>
            <li> nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> With this product she darkened up nicely and did not even need to use a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> To be honest, through the bottles I used I had NO idea</li>
            <li> You get a nice brown color from this, and don&#x27;t get the yucky after tanning scent.</li>
            <li> It was effective for tanning..</li>
            <li> I would give it zero stars because of that, but the lotion was kind to my skin, also, I did not care for the scent.</li>
            <li> nice smeeeth to to the air</li>
            <li> However it does not have any smell to it, I like when tanning lotions have a nice scent to them.</li>
            <li> This is a nice starter bronzer.  </li>
            <li> It does give you a nice glow without that burnt skin smell.</li>
            <li> After I achieved a nice tan, I went up to another product by this company that was 30x -</li>
            <li> Said that this was the popular choice.</li>
            <li> I had excellent and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Use for tanning indoor and out, nice smell will purchase this item again does not leave your skin feeling greesy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order for my own use, my niece asked me to order it for her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bronzer has helped me get a great tan - and the longer I&#x27;ve gone, the tan just gets better &amp; better.</li>
            <li> I like it alot as it is nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have always liked AG products</li>
            <li> I did get a nice tan from using this lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice as well.</li>
            <li> I received the package two days after I ordered it which was nice.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the smell, but I did get good color with this lotion</li>
            <li> but I feel like this helps me keep a nice hint of color.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Its ok not as good as I wanted it to be</li>
            <li> It always gave me great results, and I was never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure my legs will have an awesome tan like my arms after it fades!</li>
            <li> Its almost like my color developed perfectly and got better each day!</li>
            <li> Normal tanning lotion you get at the tanning salon never works for my skin tone but this one works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> It has a light smell that I found pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and burn easily.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is easy to apply smells good ect.</li>
            <li> i tan very easily</li>
            <li> Smells fine and works fairly well for the price...</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant - light and kind of flowery, but not at all overwhelming or too girly-scented.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can over look this due to the great price and wonderful tan.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a fine product and the smell lasts and is quite good.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself works really well, and the price is very fair.</li>
            <li> By far the best Tanning lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> So I got on Amazon and started reading recommendations for a good, but cheap lotion.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin soft and came sealed in plastic, which I was very happy about.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw this lotion for so cheap, I was weary about how well it would work, regardless of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> Looks natural and is a superb moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Perfect product professional</li>
            <li> The Gold holds it&#x27;s own fur sure.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for a while and tried others, but by far this is the best tan in a bottle</li>
            <li> Lotion smells really good, isn&#x27;t oily, and works very well!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, it smells very good, and apply nicely and leaves a soft touch after tanning.</li>
            <li> Works like magic perfect for that golden tan quick and</li>
            <li> I could see a great color within the first week (after 5 days of tanning).  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice lotion that rubs in easy.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very smooth, looking healthy and no greasy feel to it.  </li>
            <li> I love smell  </li>
            <li> Have used this before and love this product.</li>
            <li> OC Ten was the best lotion I have ever used...</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably finish the bottle, and then get something with more bronzers in it.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> and I went with this company because it offered more OZ...definately not the case.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more of this.  </li>
            <li> So everyone buy this product :]</li>
            <li> but it works as well as some lotions that I have used that cost $50.00 or more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> But this bronzer was a safe bet for me.</li>
            <li> I love to combine products and experiment - and</li>
            <li> am satisfied, and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> With this lotion I have been able to go the the tanning bed about every three days without it wearing off.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love that.</li>
            <li> I have not gone more than a couple times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some by Millennium, and mostly Designer Skin.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really glad I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> It smells ok...</li>
            <li> and she bought more of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tan well, but most tanning bed products eventually turn me orange; like most tanning excellerators do.</li>
            <li> I looove my tan :-)</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, will buy again</li>
            <li> However, I decided to give it a try and after a couple days, I was satisfied with the tan that I got.</li>

            <li> (But I will not be using any more of it.)</li>

            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion,</li>
            <li> I always look at reviews before I buy a product and the ones I read about this one seemed okay</li>
            <li> awsome love it and the smell too</li>
            <li> I do still berry much love</li>

            <li> and I had such a great tan!</li>
            <li> , it has the smell of most lotions AFTER you get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> All of my friends now use it :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because I know there&#x27;s better tanning lotions out there, but what can you expect for $13?</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It gives that tan look you will just love</li>
            <li> It will do what it says and give you an even tan better than any lotion I have ever used</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS.............</li>
            <li> Love this indoor tanning lotion and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> It worked OK</li>
            <li> but I have used better.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had a better bronzing agent</li>
            <li> All the product diversion stories come mostly from tanning lotion companies.</li>
            <li> but this lotion makes magic on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, cheaper here than at the salon.</li>
            <li> its okay</li>
            <li> and I figure the darker the better in Michigan summers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Not like most tanning lotions, defintiely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love all products from this company.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works great, smells great &amp; its alot cheaper than others.</li>
            <li> This product goes on really quick and easy, and give a good color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this product!!!</li>
            <li> It delivers a nice golden brown!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and goes on pretty smooth</li>
            <li> Great service got my package very quickly, but for me it didn&#x27;t do much for my tan didn&#x27;t get any darker.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a week ago and when it arrived, the seal had already been cut (very cleanly I might add).</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li> It was pretty good...</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty good.</li>
            <li> but it really does help you get a nice tan!</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good once you 1st put it on</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good bronzer if you&#x27;re a beginner tanner and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a lotion.</li>
            <li> smells good, not expensive.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for new tanners, experienced tanners, and even men.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it goes on easy and has no shimmer or tingle.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING LOTION IS GREAT GOES ON SMOOTHLY.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, Ive used tons of different lotions and this one is deffiantly the best especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and rubs in smoothly.</li>
            <li> It gives you great natural color.</li>
            <li> I feel this is a great lotion for those looking for a natural tan.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It gave me a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li> It smells good, it only took a week of tanning for me to get nice color, and its cheap!</li>
            <li> Its ok, but deviously black is the best</li>
            <li> First of all, I was excited to find a good deal on this product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I use it every time I go (about every other day) and it does an excellent job at keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, like Fruity &amp; Bright by victoria&#x27;s secret, just like it.</li>
            <li> And thanks to Amazon, my beautiful tan was so much cheaper than buying this in the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> It smells clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> lol .. love Australian gold products !</li>
            <li> I tan easy. .</li>
            <li> Got it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I tan easily anyway</li>
            <li> Smells good and gives a nice overall color.</li>
            <li> And it doesnt leave you smelling to strong of tanning lotion</li>
            <li> Product gives good overall tan and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> I got a beautiful brown color after just one session in just a regular tanning bed, no upgrade.  </li>
            <li> it smells good, its not a thick lotion like some i have used, and it did give me the tan i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I got a beautiful color from this lotion, but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how kind of greasy it felt at first.</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold tanning lotions, this one is ok, but does give as good of tan as some of the others</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad for a man, but probably better suited for the ladies</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly be buying more of this product!</li>
            <li> the shelf&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to work fine however.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just fine.</li>
            <li> and it works fine for the price you</li>
            <li> I opened it and it looked fine.</li>
            <li> I love Austrialian Gold and how it darkens and bronzes so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love how quickly I tan</li>
            <li> goes away quickly!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement with my tan.</li>
            <li> dont by lotion at the salon cuz its a huge rip off.</li>
            <li> Also the scent is so light, so I dont stink when I am finished tanning</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve yet to find one I truly like and enjoy using.</li>
            <li> There are lower priced options available on Amazon</li>
            <li> and they go on smooth.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m happy to say that no of those were present.</li>
            <li> Is a light brown/tan color.  </li>
            <li> It does have a light bronzer in it that lasts about a day.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product and price.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and after you get done tanning</li>
            <li> leaves your skin sinfully smooth too.</li>
            <li> was it cheap on here...</li>
            <li> It is also watery and seems cheap.  </li>
            <li> Great if your staring out completely white like myself.</li>
            <li> I love a lot of Australian gold products but this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> but I was being cheap and decided to go with this one--</li>
            <li> I felt like maybe the lotion wasn&#x27;t genuine - but who knows.</li>
            <li> I have a great tan that happeneded almost instantly and stayed.</li>
            <li> and I really like it nice color results</li>
            <li> I have been doing a more powerful bed</li>
            <li> Nothing fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The amount of lotion you recieve for the price is incomparable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion along with the Australian Gold Cheeky Brown as you could purchase both for a great price, they both can be used in the tanning aslon and outside, the smell is great,</li>
            <li> not that burnt skin smell, goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Cannot stand the smell, cheap quality, zero tanning results.</li>
            <li> If you are light skinned like me, dont expect this lotion to work miracles.</li>
            <li> Australian gold makes great products for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap (even in salons), and it does the job.</li>
            <li> and it works great with a australian gold SPF 4 over it</li>
            <li> This gives a nice brown color, and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a great product that gives me the fullest tan possible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned naturally and I am faithful to this lotion, and this price is a steal.</li>
            <li> overall this is one of my favorite tanning lotions/bronzers and it is a good price too.</li>
            <li> So use it because it smells good and makes your skin soft, don&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re trying to get darker.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super smooth and it smells nice - no fake tanning smells</li>
            <li> Just tried for the first time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results !!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best for fair-skinned individuals that want to look dark like everyone else, but not fake!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells nice &amp; has decent bronzers.</li>
            <li> It has a mild smell, not too strong and helps cover that \\&quot;just tanned smell\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> gave this lotion a 3 star rating because usually Australian Golds products have a super fruity, tropical smell, but Sinfully Blacks smell wasnt that great.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is more bearable than most and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I usually go with banana boat because it works awesome.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money!</li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many MUCH higher priced bronzers that don&#x27;t come close to the efficiency of this one.  </li>
            <li> The only kind for me!</li>
            <li> AN AMAZING TAN ALONG WITH THE ACTUAL TANNING BED.... :)</li>
            <li> They were nice enough to put some scotch tape over the top of it instead.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, very similar to AG products I have used before and the bronzing works.  </li>
            <li> though i am part indian and naturally tan, this helped me get my tan alot faster, love the smell too!</li>
            <li> , it gives you a really dark brown tan.. even naturally fair skinned people like me!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll have to admit this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> No orange-y hue and not pale, just a nice bronze.  </li>
            <li> Also it smells amazing and completely eliminates that post tanning bed smell.</li>
            <li> Tan fast and tan dark with this lotion that also has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> I had so many people comment on my great tan this year and usually don&#x27;t get any comments.</li>
            <li> At the end of my trip I came home with a great tan and for the first time my friends and family actually admitted that I looked tan.</li>
            <li> I average once or twice a week in a 20 minute bed and have a beautiful color.  </li>
            <li> So, I bought an full bottle this time and will keep this schedule.  </li>
            <li> I was using the australian gold in the orange bottle before and it worked good</li>
            <li> This stuff is priced well and leaves me feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned red head</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t tan as fast as most people</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and tan outside.</li>
            <li> Ga-Ga is really good too, so I might try that next.</li>
            <li> It was OK didn&#x27;t really do what it said.</li>
            <li> Its not thin as in watery, it just smooths out easier than most lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> DONT THINK I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN, BUT DO APPRECIATE THE LOW COST AND GOOD START ON MY TAN.</li>
            <li> for me was good enough.</li>
            <li> To orangey for my taste Australian Gold is a good product.</li>
            <li> Started seeing results fast and it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> dollars for them, so this would be a good investment for anyone just needing a regular tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I normally feel really oily and smell funny after the tanning beds but this lotion smelled great and didnt get that grimy feeling after.</li>
            <li> This is a really good tanning lotion and I&#x27;ll likely buy again since they&#x27;re no longer making the Crystal X.</li>
            <li> , I opened and loved it, tanned last night</li>
            <li> The bronzer definitely accelerates the tanning process; and the good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stain my hands.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t burn and just develop a nice natural brown colour , realy moisturises the skin aswell</li>
            <li> sinfully black is good stuff :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month, I am not dark, but have a nice tan and overall good tone.</li>
            <li> Being an avid tanner I strongly favor lotions that have bronzers in them.</li>
            <li> Other than that, everything was great, including the smell, and the color I got from one week alone.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for both tanning beds and outdoors - just remember no SPF so be careful!</li>
            <li> My tan has come in quick and my skin feels hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> so I was nervous till it got here which I may add quickly</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that the bottle is kind of cheap and crackles</li>
            <li> It also goes on super well, not runny like others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I have perused the fine (very fine..) print on this product and nowhere does it say it is meant as simply  a pre/post tanning bed lotion.</li>
            <li> Beyond Famous, Crystal, HOT, and I really like this one for the value and the results.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin a very nice dark tan.  </li>
            <li> My favorite lotion so far!</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast!!</li>
            <li> and this just helps ten times more!</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion Ive ever used, and I have been no less than thrilled.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, and it does not leave you with the feeling you need to shower as fast as you can after tanning.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t turn me orange after tanning every other day!!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t make me turn orange, but has given me a really solid, even tan.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks she was a shade that she was happy with</li>
            <li> This one has instant bronzers and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> From the first use of this lotion, I LOVED the smell (although getting out of the bed it didn&#x27;t smell as pretty) but it definitely gave immediate results.    </li>
            <li> My GF used this at the tanning salon several times and it leaves a nice bronze color on her. 2</li>
            <li> and I now have my own tanning bed and Australian Gold is always number one!</li>
            <li> For the price it is worth it though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Australian Gold products for years and this one turned me a nice brown without ever making me look orange.  </li>
            <li> doesnt smell good and left me feeling very oily.</li>
            <li> I feel fun and fresh.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nice enough you can run to the store afterwards and not feel like you have to run home and shower right away because you reek.  </li>
            <li> Works great better than some of the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> First off this stuff super moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews that stated this lotion makes you burn if you have fair skin</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll not walk out with the &#x27;burned skin&#x27; smell so you wont feel the need to run home and take a shower right away.</li>
            <li> this product is all right in my book</li>
            <li> I always put it on right before going into the bed.</li>
            <li> (I always have at least 3 different bottles) because there are some lotions that work great but start to look \\&quot;fake\\&quot; after too many uses!</li>
            <li> Great bronzer for an unbelievable price.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately doesn&#x27;t have that Australian Gold signature scent, but a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Normally I can tan in the full sun for a couple of afternoons and get significant results that last more than a month.</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING and thanks to the fact that it has a bronzer in it already, you can see results in an extremely short amount of time.</li>
            <li> The Sinfully Black smells good, and applies well.</li>
            <li> ) Leaves skin soft and glowing :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> delivery was really quick I recommend it highly !</li>
            <li> Maybe you will get lucky and receive the real deal.</li>
            <li> most of the Australian Gold lotions ive tried, they are very easy to spread on your body prior to tanning</li>
            <li> This product does not accelerate my tan very much</li>
            <li> Was surprised at how quickly I started to tan after using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this lotion plus it has a nice smell that prevents me from having that strong gross tanning bed smell and since I go on my lunch break at work, that&#x27;s definitely a plus for me &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The first time I have used a lotion with a bronzer</li>
            <li> I saw results after first time i  used it, definetly going to get me to the shade I am looking for.</li>
            <li> The first 2 times I tanned with it</li>
            <li> think I was expecting a bit more instand color from this product overall.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite lotions yet</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back for more of what works.</li>
            <li> I work in a hot factory atmosphere,10 to 12 hour days, and did not want to &#x27;run&#x27;, sweat my tan off, or have wore spots.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased this product from the local tanning salon that I frequent and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for close to ten dollars more at the salon</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am pretty satisified with the results.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this again :)</li>
            <li> I really like this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold products and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> I paid $22 for this at the salon - I would suggest anyone not to buy this lotion at this price because you could get a much better product (for the ones who want an instant difference).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> And even though I (for the most part) still feel that way, I actually felt like this lotion turned me bronze instead of orange.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this lotion, I absolutely love the results I get.  </li>
            <li> It came promptly and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I will be buying again very soon!</li>
            <li> It takes more effort than should be necessary to squeeze the lotion out as well.</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff you buy for much more.  </li>
            <li> It also smells really fruity!</li>
            <li> I am returning it and just gonna spend the extra money for something better.</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold products</li>
            <li> first time using this product</li>
            <li> The only reason I stopped using it is because I wanted to branch out and try more lotions.</li>
            <li> When using this lotion for the first time (after using a weaker lotion) I recommend reducing your time you spend in the bed</li>
            <li> Thank you Australian gold! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for YEARS and have mostly used Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> First of all, the bottle I received does not smell like berries.</li>
            <li> I love the products from Australian Gold, I have used them for years.</li>
            <li> It smells better than most tanning lotions I have used in the past</li>
            <li> and I love that it has the bronzer without all the extra shimmer and tingle.</li>
            <li> The next day I used it and it was okay then too.</li>
            <li> You really do get your moneys worth out of it</li>
            <li> I started darkening after the first.  </li>
            <li> If the next day I felt I could handle 5 more minutes</li>
            <li> ALWAYS LOVE THE X DEEP TANNING</li>
            <li> It came in a timely manner and was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I dont feel or smell funny</li>
            <li> Unfortuantely I ordered a different lotion this time to see if I like it better,</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and smells really good and also gives you that dark tan your looking for</li>
            <li> It is a good lotion, however if you have sensitive skin like me it made me break out after a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good, not amazing, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I got super dark very quickly!</li>
            <li> and I do burn easy if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, light fragrance, soaks right in to the skin, no funny smell after tanning.  </li>
            <li> But it certainly feels like one of the more low quality lotions.</li>
            <li> This just made me feel a little more comfortable &amp; cleaner, I would still shower afterward to fully cleanse.</li>
            <li> I first using Australian gold and love the product, it very affordable and you will like the product.</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than expected but it is still a great value</li>
            <li> This lotion is great and non-greasy, but for obtaining a serious tan, I layer it with an oil.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than many of the boutique tanning oils which contain the same ingredients!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made me dark, a dream come true :)</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I didn&#x27;t notice any huge differences between this and other lotions I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you want to get dark very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> So I used it pretty much all summer</li>
            <li> Package was nicely packed and sealed, I tan very well due to genetics</li>
            <li> and I find I go through this stuff pretty fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results--I haven&#x27;t used this lotion in a long time, but it used to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> and this gives me a nice dark color</li>
            <li> , i kindof wonder if its fake and has sunblock missed in it or something, the only good thing i can say about this product is that it smells good.</li>
            <li> husband - who is a light complected black man, has also taken to applying some before he goes outside, and has accomplished a nice golden brown colour.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I work at a very popular tanning salon and was informed by someone very high up in the company that this lotion is almost identical to the J WOW tanning lotion which is much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> this has helped my skin darken faster, I had a very decent tan after one week of 4 indoor tanning sessions.</li>
            <li> Skin is super soft after.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothering me at all.</li>
            <li> Sinfully black does give you a nice tan.</li>
            <li> Planet fitness sells this exact same stuff for twice the price and even that is semi cheap for tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Really does help me attain a better tan after a long plateau.  </li>
            <li> love  this - wish I knew about it a long time ago - I get so tan with this !!</li>
            <li> My arms, back and chest are fine and tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive tanning lotions and Sinfully Black is the best that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Recommendation is very high on this product.  </li>
            <li> I used this lotion for about a month everyday, it really lasts a long time and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a inexpensive tanning lotion that will keep your skin moisturized and give you fast results!</li>
            <li> I looked up a few others they sell and the price difference was amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and works just as good as any expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> This took my tan to a much deeper level and left my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t really like how watery it was.</li>
            <li> I think it was just because they haven&#x27;t seen much sun until yesterday.</li>
            <li> Helps to darken you much quicker</li>
            <li> SO much cheaper the the tanning salon charges.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, light scent, does not stain skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave you red and splotchy either!!!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> It is also very affordable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Also, I do love Australian Gold products and I&#x27;ve tried many of their more expensive ones-</li>
            <li> Makes skin brown and keeps skin very moist.  </li>
            <li> 2 stars for the yummy smell and semi fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t orange and the bronzers work really well and give an even appearance.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is getting me much darker than when I used no lotion at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> What I do know is that it gives you fast, practically one session results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference than not using anything at all.</li>
            <li> Many years ago, I was a lifeguard, and spent probably 50-60 hours a week in the sun...</li>
            <li> and I got so much darker because I used this product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use much though</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll also pay 3 or 4 times as much.  </li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like at all about the lotion was that it made me feel really greasy after &amp; caused me to break out alot.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star because it a very product and will in fact do the job, and will not cost you a lot of money..</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying lotion at the salon.</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product from girls</li>
            <li> I used this lotion from the very start of my tanning season and never burned.  </li>
            <li> It was runny and seemed to have a problem absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this tanning lotion for two years and it was absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really greasy and makes my skin very oily.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like how watery this product is.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t care too much for the smell</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you much color.  </li>
            <li> I went on a cruise and used this the whole time.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works well on me.</li>
            <li> and it bronzes very well.  </li>
            <li> My skin tans very well</li>
            <li> The bronzer isn&#x27;t really noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> Was very liquidity....</li>
            <li> Very liquidy, and has a very stong scent.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my tan get darker either.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> No problems with the product they just need to be honest with the actual fluid ounces you are getting!    </li>
            <li> shoot people still by the walmart brand of of stuff and generic prescriptions just being honest about your product makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> It does smell good although not amazing like some have proclaimed.</li>
            <li> Used this twice and already getting dark, love the Australian Gold line of tanning products but this my be my new favorite.</li>
            <li> So if you want a slightly bronzing smooth lotion with less smell this is a good one for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to use it next summer!!</li>
            <li> I have used other products that give a better tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more liquidy and slippery than other lotions, which allows it to spread on easier.</li>
            <li> Much better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> After a few days applying it and staying in the pool for a couple of hours, my skin gets really dark bronze and looks wonderful, hidrated and soft.</li>
            <li> While that one admittedly smelled better and left my skin super soft, I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results.</li>
            <li> A few days after purchasing this product, I posted a review about it because I was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> Have had great results past and present!</li>
            <li> I do not have time to be out in the sun much, so tanning beds and lotions are a whole new experience for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was anything extra special about this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I do leave on until next day to shower to get full effect of bronzer.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is one of many I use to have that dark tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a higher end lotion, but so far this seems to be working as well for a 1/4 of the price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations but it&#x27;s more of a bronzer then dark.</li>
            <li> AG Sinfully Black 15X Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion is a great indoor tanning lotion!!</li>
            <li> but this lotion is on a whole new level.</li>
            <li> Previously used Hawaiian Tropics and Banana Boat products have worked much better.</li>
            <li> This is one of favorite ones and with buying through an Amazon seller it was half the price vs the place I tan at.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve never been this satisfied with any of the ones I bought before I decided to get Sinfully Black.</li>
            <li> A really good, basic, inexpensive, everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> This particular bottle smelled like hair dye.</li>
            <li> It does smell decent though.</li>
            <li> I looked brown, then super red for a couple of days, then tan.</li>
            <li> but it did arrive quick overall</li>
            <li> I will go with a different kind once this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> but let be realistic...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li> In short, I did get darker but not as quickly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have used (and loved) Australian Gold products in the past, but his didn&#x27;t work at all, which makes me think that it may not be real.</li>
            <li> You do need a really good base tan before using this product, other wise you will burn!.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion for everyone who uses a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Risk is too high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> lotion leaves your skin super soft, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in color after I used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Although I did get a little burnt, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my fault for over tanning.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to get a nice color</li>
            <li> I do have a natural Olive complexion as well and tan fast.</li>
            <li> But the point is I baught the australian gold sinfully dark tanning lotion because it looked amazing.</li>
            <li> AS MUCH about getting completely fried.</li>
            <li> The smell in general isn&#x27;t very appealing to me, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Produt provides great color to fair-skinned people like myself without looking fake.  </li>
            <li> As far as smell is concerned, I don&#x27;t really notice after I have applied and tanned.  </li>
            <li> Its not thick or greasy</li>
            <li> Produt provides great color to fair-skinned people like myself without looking fake.</li>
            <li> so I do not know if it can give you the ultimate golden glow.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold products are all worth the price for the ease of uniform application.</li>
            <li> JUST HAVE MORE TROUBLE GETTING TO THE POOL....</li>
            <li> am fair skinned, and took awhile to get over  the &#x27;red&#x27; and build a good base.</li>
            <li> and this got me dark pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t tan as easy as I do so for her to get as dark as she did.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me a few times laying out to get a good tan but not with this product!</li>
            <li> It felt uncomfortable on my skin and didn&#x27;t blend very nicely.</li>
            <li> for weird packaging, just make sure you order it through a place that has it fully sealed and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always looking for new stuff to tan with.</li>
            <li> Mos def a new ATF</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li> She has a hard time tanning, where I do not, I tan very easily and darkened up before midsummer.</li>
            <li> It absorbed and dried quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> orange - very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Why would they sell a fake version of their own product?!</li>
            <li> A couple months ago, my first bottle started getting low.</li>
            <li> and they are exactly the same...</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion in the past and have yet to find one that works better.</li>
            <li> I first tried it when I bought one of those sample packets at my tanning salon and later that day</li>
            <li> Many other reviews spoke about instant color and a bronze glow after one use of this product.</li>
            <li> I believe it was transplanted with something cheap and watered down.</li>
            <li> the second time, it came in a clear sealed bag, so i thought it wouldn&#x27;t be the solid paste that i got, and would instead be the regular lotion that i love.</li>
            <li> I have used many others in the past, got to say that for me, this is just as good if not better than the more expensive products.  </li>
            <li> I love the deep dark color I get with it no orange color either.</li>
            <li> Love the Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15x</li>
            <li> I also recomend sinfully black to someone like me who love Australian Gold products.  </li>
            <li> After starting to use this it didnt get me as dark as fast but definitely gave me a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t get as red.  </li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t tan, but this makes it fun!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to those that enjoy a deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> Compared to my last bottle of Sinfully Black, it is significantly lighter in color, has a much fainter smell, and is a lot runnier applying to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Lotion does the right job AND quick, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I can tell that I am a bit darker, but nowhere near where I was hoping to be.</li>
            <li> and I had to stop using it because every time I did I developed a severe headache.</li>
            <li> Thanks Australian Gold!!</li>
            <li> Have gone tanning three times with it in a ten minute bed, and u can really see a difference.  </li>
            <li> but it was unsealed and didn&#x27;t work wonders like my old designer skin lotion</li>
            <li> The attendant at my local salon recommended this to me.</li>
            <li> She can go the whole summer and only go a shade or so darker.</li>
            <li> I really like Australian Gold products and this one is inexpensive ($13 when I bought it) and works well.</li>
            <li> I think it brings out your natural tanning ability and doesn&#x27;t make you orange.  </li>
            <li> it brings out the natural tones of your body&#x27;s tan, and keeps it there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been to the tanning bed in nearly a week, and the color has faded</li>
            <li> It came early</li>
            <li> so the bronzers take complete effect.</li>
            <li> I took a shower after anyway, but rubbed my skin really soft that way it didn&#x27;t wash away all the bronzers.</li>
            <li> Also, their products have a fragarance that is soft.</li>
            <li> and it was definitely not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Who makes this stuff, i would like to complain directly.  </li>
            <li> While I like the smell of this one as well as how soft it makes my skin</li>
            <li> its a natural bronzer</li>
            <li> I used this all summer and found that it gave me an even natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion, 8.5... Actually love all their products, would recommend to anyone... does give you that dark golden tan...</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper to go through Amazon than buying at a local salon.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a natural tanning color and makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> it was old feeling sticky feeling after tanning</li>
            <li> and I developed a base tan before I started using this lotion, but the results I&#x27;ve gotten are the best I&#x27;ve gotten from a tanning lotion so far.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thin and runny, but I liked that in the warmer months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sampled a bunch at the salon, including Smoke Black Bronzer, Snooki black bronzer, and this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The true brown color the bronzer leaves is very pretty and natural and lasted 3-4 days (even though I shower at least once daily).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying other lotions since then &amp; Luminary by Designer Skin will most likely be my next choice.</li>
            <li> Secondary sticker over original sku#... Not the real deal.</li>
            <li> and I am still super dark and bronze</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting to get dark quickly this is not the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve laid twice &amp;&amp; I&#x27;m super dark.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T expect to be super dark after one, or even a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I tan pretty easily as I am of Greek and Italian descent.  </li>
            <li> The first time using this, I was several shades darker in only 30 minutes, with no burning.</li>
            <li> but this is the FIRST lotion with a bronzer I have bought because I have always stayed away from them, not wanting a fake looking fake-bake.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> and she got really dark in just a few days, so we ordered our own.</li>
            <li> My complexion is kind of dark due to native american ancestry but this lotion has gotten me even darker.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with Devoted Creations White 2 Black Supre Advanced Bronzer Tanning Lotion... and the AG saved the day, so to speak.</li>
            <li> Smell is decent and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping for more dramatic change in color</li>
            <li> Oh and this size bottle really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than any other lotion...looking for dark...</li>
            <li> Should be classified as a lotion not a dark tanner.</li>
            <li> I bought Sinfully Black after a long review process of the many different kinds for sale on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This really find nothing but dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> As far as the tan, it gives you that natural color that will last longer.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t tell any major results.</li>
            <li> ; I purchased this through Tan 4 Less, and they charge something like 6 or 7 dollars for shipping, but if you add a lotion to your order from them, they only add a dollar per item, so they are like a true wholesaler.  </li>
            <li> IT is a good thick lotion with very little fragrance, which is what I like.</li>
            <li> Product was not real, it smelt very chemically</li>
            <li> So far, its not impressing me but hopefully itll build up within the next days</li>
            <li> It had a fruity scent applying, but after getting out of the bed I barely noticed the odor at all.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get me near as tan as the Australian Gold &amp;#34;Going GAGA&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Your tanner will tell you that you&#x27;re only guaranteed to get quality lotions if you buy directly from them because you know where you&#x27;re getting it from.  </li>
            <li> I barely tanned at all.</li>
            <li> The color is a nice bronze, not orange or fake looking...</li>
            <li> So after tanning with this lotion, it&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable not taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Nothing better or worse than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> had a noticeable difference right after, and it had a little tingle to it.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about it is that it doesn&#x27;t give my skin that fake orange tint, doesn&#x27;t stain my palms after applying &amp; I see great, long lasting results after one twenty minute session in a base bed.</li>
            <li> I used this product tanning only once a week and after the second use I was wow darker!</li>
            <li> However, my tan usually fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> It really is giving me nice color, and it doesn&#x27;t look fake or wash down the drain as soon as you shower.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to be caught without your favorite lotions but the price tag markup is crazy high!</li>
            <li> It rivals many of the expensive brands by far.</li>
            <li> The thing I&#x27;ve read most in reviews about Australian Gold tanning lotions is how thin they are; making them go on easier.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it gets you pretty dark (and natural-looking) after just one use!</li>
            <li> hahaa ) which I rub on first, and then apply the Australian Gold Sinfully Black.</li>
            <li> This is the EXACT same lotion as JWOWW&#x27;s Black Bronzer.</li>
            <li> lotion is a bit thick, but spreads evenly and easily, and soaks into the skin quickly - should apply it at least 10 min before tanning, but could be applied much earlier, or at the last minute, too.  </li>
            <li> I got so dark so fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years and generally take the winters off.  </li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t see a big difference at all than any other lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> After just 1 use I&#x27;m pretty brown, and I&#x27;ve maintained that color for over a a few weeks</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Applies nicely, thick lotion, no streaks</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely watered down or cut with another type of lotion.  </li>
            <li> And it seems really runny, like watered down or</li>
            <li> Sinfully Black really boosted my tan.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase it again, works as well as the higher priced lotions sold at the salon, for half the price!</li>
            <li> I personally would prefer a lotion that is slightly thicker in consistancy, but really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> The seal wasn&#x27;t broken, the bottle was full and smells like the real deal stuff also the tag was not jacked up like other said.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I&#x27;m used to feeling at least a little greasy using any lotion (including Designer Skin lotions,)</li>
            <li> i use only a little bit &amp; it works really well.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this, but it is so thick that it will not come out!</li>
            <li> I am italian and tan very nicely (had a base tan when used), so it wasn&#x27;t funky because I was pale!&lt;br /&gt;Namaste</li>
            <li> Left me wondering if it was a little older &amp;#34;off</li>
            <li> if its the real stuff no wonder it was so cheap if its the fake stuff list that its the knock of version so the buyer knows what they are getting there selves into!</li>
            <li> but I have not really seen much of difference form my other lotion</li>
            <li> but this lotion is the exact same as [[ASIN:B004FEKA3E Australian Gold Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion, 13.5-Ounce]].</li>
            <li> I mean the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely tried lotions that smell worse, but I always end up showering shortly after tanning when I use this lotion just because the smell is a little overpowering Prior to tanning though, this lotion smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I swapped out my normal lotion for this one the last few days</li>
            <li> As usual, keep your skin moisturized with an after bath oil ( I use Pure Romance&#x27;s Body Dew)</li>
            <li> I notice I&#x27;m a little darker then normal,</li>
            <li> My daughter had a better base tan than I did and she used it and got really dark with only two full days in the cancun sun.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this because it is so reasonable on price and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> But at least it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like PINK by Victoria&#x27;s Secret very girly very fruity</li>
            <li> so it seems to take a lot , I am worried about how long it will last but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and thin too so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Never had a tan last so long in my life!</li>
            <li> Never had a tan last so long in my life!</li>
            <li> I have went tanning in a level 2 bed for less than 60 minutes spread over the past week - after not having tanned indoors for 8 months - and already have distinct, noticeable color.  </li>
            <li> Works just as good as the expensive brands sold in salons, but way cheaper!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard for me to tan or burn, but much easier to burn than tan.    </li>
            <li> I never really believed that tanning lotion actually worked, I felt like it was just a money making market.</li>
            <li> I stayed in the bed too long because this product desensitizes you the heat.</li>
            <li> I decided to use it anyway, not really knowing what it is supposed to actually smell like.</li>
            <li> About the smell being strange, breaking out, etc.</li>
            <li> so I started tanning without it to get a good base tan.</li>
            <li> My guess is if you do not have a good base tan don&#x27;t use this stuff because you will get hurt by the sun.  </li>
            <li> i am extra pale and my pigment its extra low</li>
            <li> i tested this paste four times and it seems to have absolutely no effect on my skin, completely unlike previous orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> def will pay the extra 5 bucks for my other lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I know bronzers tend to be thicker lotions, but this was a little more difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I then researched and have found other reviewers mentioning the same thing!</li>
            <li> Didnt take very long on the sun beds either</li>
            <li> My skin is dry to the touch</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan every day in an attempt to keep my skin from getting too dry so</li>
            <li> As well this lotion is just as great to use as a base lotion for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a few different tanning lotions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are a few people who have done it, but I have never received a fake product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge believer in lotions making a big enough difference to pay 50</li>
            <li> The smell is decent and it has a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion 4 or 5 times so far, and have seen very little results.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want an orangey look, but you want to look dark... definitely use this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion, 12.8 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> The tan itself is dark, it got me to the next level up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m almost as dark as I was back then.  </li>
            <li> Gives a deep, dark tan...</li>
            <li> It creates a deep dark tan and the lotion absorbs well</li>
            <li> gives you deep dark tan even from the sun</li>
            <li> Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15X Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002WJOOIQ Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15x</li>
            <li> One of the lotions I purchased was this one, Sinfully Black by Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> Not so with Australian Gold Sinfully Black.</li>
            <li> recommend Australian Gold Sinfully Black.  </li>
            <li> The product works but you have to tan several times, dont expect to come out black with tanning</li>
            <li> I think the only color was the little bit of bronzer that was in there.</li>
            <li> After using it several times, I was not noticing a difference at all, and i broke out a little on parts of my body.</li>
            <li> I only know it has bronzer because when I shave my legs a little color comes out when I run the razor under the faucet.</li>
            <li> I have a good base tan already, and didnt notice this lotion really providing me with a \\&quot;Sinfully, dramatic, dark tan.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Military members and others who get drug tested should stay away from this product.  </li>
            <li> I had to throw mine away unless I want my military career ruined.</li>
            <li> It only took a few times to use it before I noticed some color.</li>
            <li> I would have spent around $140 in my salon for the lotions I purchased.  </li>
            <li> , something changed in the last few orders i got.</li>
            <li> Especially since everyone said not to order from Green Web.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  tan like I expected.</li>
            <li> Used JWOWW brown bottle and pink bottle but didn&#x27;t get these results</li>
            <li> I usually start to get a noticeable tan after 2 or 3 sessions, but it&#x27;s been twice as long with this lotion and the only color I&#x27;ve gotten is a slight burn.</li>
            <li> started to woe as soon as i put it on ,not smell and a little goes a long way ,amust have</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> i usually really like all australian gold products and especially their trademark scent, but this lotion smells bad.</li>
            <li> then any other lotion I have used.</li>
            <li> No funny smell after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and it seems that my tan lasts longer using this over other lotions.</li>
            <li> Not putrid like some other tanners.</li>
            <li> She would oil herself up with the product and sit out in the sun for fifteen minutes on one side and fifteen minutes on the other.</li>
            <li> This product worked well, but be careful!</li>
            <li> Other users have mentioned that the supplier may be refilling the bottles?  </li>
            <li> I bought this lotion the other day because I purchased a tanning membership and didn&#x27;t want to buy any overpriced lotions that they sell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bronze isn&#x27;t as dark as I expected.</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars, because I personally am not too crazy about natural bronzers.</li>
            <li> , if not before, I finish the other product...</li>
            <li> Totally a terrific lotion for real and artificial sunlight.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this before and it was a bit thicker and harder to get out of the bottle than previous bottles I have bought.</li>
            <li> Bottle was half empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying a cheaper one because that usually means the quality is cheap.</li>
            <li> It does give you a dark, sinfully, envious tan.</li>
            <li> Disn&#x27;t get me as dark as I wanted.</li>
            <li> For all the reviews saying it is fake, this lotion is the real thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt; got dark tan  </li>
            <li> (take a shower) for at least 4 hours after tanning, as it continues to work for several hours after your session.  </li>
            <li> I would assume if you use it a lot you can get really dark .But</li>
            <li> Not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> I have used tanning lotions that make me fairly dark</li>
            <li> average.  </li>
            <li> Before this lotion i was using a bronzing lotion called paramour that got me extremely dark.</li>
            <li> arms/legs, I got dark.  </li>
            <li> and I still have a dark tint.</li>
            <li> I ordered it based on my requeat of dark bronzing lotion.....</li>
            <li> a change in my color at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a dark bronzing lotion...</li>
            <li> even my daughter said that it looked watered down</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use half a bottle of lotion</li>
            <li> I like the way sinfully black smells and moisturizes my skin</li>
            <li> Another tip for those who are serious about tanning and buy a lot of different lotions</li>
            <li> Props to Tan 4 Less.</li>
            <li> I bought Sinfully Black a couple of months ago from my salon for around $30.</li>
            <li> But, Sinfully Black might work for you.</li>
            <li> You can buy it at the salon for around $30, or from the internet for half of that.</li>
            <li> but I used it any way and by the time I had used half the bottle I was losing my tan</li>
            <li> It glides on very well - not too thick, not too thin.</li>
            <li> My daughter was purchasing the over priced products that are sold at the tanning salons which did not work half as well as this product.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love about this product is the after tan smell is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Previous orders have come from dedicated tanning lotion sellers, but this time I was in a bit of a rush, so I went with the \\&quot;Amazon-fulfilled\\&quot; GreenWeb seller.  </li>
            <li> &amp; i still havent used any of my jegens gradual tanning lotion which i typically follow up with after a session, with that being said..</li>
            <li> The bronze makes the lotion an odd color</li>
            <li> and YOU an odd color after using it.</li>
            <li> Buy 2 bottles though if you tan a lot, went through this in less than a month.</li>
            <li> The product I received smelled extremely odd.</li>
            <li> and I would not recommend sinfully black.</li>
            <li> USED MAYBE 3 TIMES, AND I AM BLACK.....</li>
            <li> Black Storm 60x,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as other lotions.</li>
            <li> It give your tan just a little boost and helps it stay longer.</li>
            <li> BUT A LITTLE</li>
            <li> I did feel I looked a little orange though.</li>
            <li> When your tanning it smells a little like burnt skin, I would NOT recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> and she got dark !  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going every day for 4 or 5 days and have noticed that I&#x27;ve been getting a little darker, but also I used Level 1-4 beds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but after you get out of the tanning booth or bed, you tend to smell a little bit burnt (no biggie for me though).  </li>
            <li> Just a little organic.  </li>
            <li> I did burn a little</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews AFTER purchasing this product, I got a little scared.</li>
            <li> Just a little watery.</li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s why it took a little longer to build color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dark already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that people give this a 1 and say it&#x27;s not a genuine product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it dries my skin completely out.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> should I not use it on all spots or spread it uneven.</li>
            <li> However, I now know that this product is not genuine.</li>
            <li> Therefore, this product is not genuine.</li>
            <li> Avoid buying from Green Web Inc.</li>
            <li> Also, I have been tanning a few times now with this lotion and haven&#x27;t noticed any results.</li>
            <li> I think this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did break out and got a few pimples on my chest</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this yet, but it was recommended by my sister, who had some when we went on vacation a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Absolutely but only if I have a base tan.</li>
            <li> and I got it for half the retail price!</li>
            <li> and I dont like being pale.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m turning pale using this stuff...</li>
            <li> NOT COOL!</li>
            <li> Ignore the silly reviews about Hemp oil making you test positive for drugs, etc -- as this is completely false.  </li>
            <li> First of all, you can not give this a bad rating because you THOUGHT it was a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> It also made my chest break out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Usually, I would have been faded to about nothing and had wasted that one session.  </li>
            <li> The lotion has a weird, bad smell to it and the bottle is very cheap to the point where it feels like it&#x27;s about to break.</li>
            <li> But, three of us rather pale girls have put spots of it all over with absolutely no results!!!!   </li>
            <li> Average hard to use because little thick</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t remember if the bottles regularly come with a seal, but the last two bad batches came without a seal.</li>
            <li> This product I would recomend to anyone who is looking to build up a quick base.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how dark I was from one 10 minute session with that lotion!!</li>
            <li> I usually tan fairly easily, especially once my base tan is developed.  </li>
            <li> Also as like other bronzers, you want to leave it on for at least a few hours to get the maximum effect, so it&#x27;s important that they don&#x27;t stink horribly.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling really moisturized and the after smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i don&#x27;t know if i got really unlucky and got two bad batches, or if this is now how they&#x27;re being made.</li>
            <li> Wear this lotion out in the sun for 30 minutes or so a few times a week and it keeps me tanner then a Brazilian model!</li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few!  </li>
            <li> My skin usually takes a while to tan</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel when I started to burn (like i usually do).</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to use in my usual high-pressure bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this tanning lotion from Amazon twice in the past couple of months.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of natural or artificial sunlight.</li>
            <li> something I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s about</li>
            <li> no more dryy legs .</li>
            <li> this product came in the mail today, i was expecting it to have a broken seal and a jacked up tag like other reviews say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I would usually like, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought it a week ago, and I had already had a base tan, but when I used this lotion, it deepened my tan so much!</li>
            <li> Tan lasts a very long time and is never orange or fake looking.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product for anyone who has a hard time tanning because it appears to work wonders.</li>
            <li> Hard to bronze</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone that is hard to tan.</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Have to keep banging it on a hard surface to get the lotion out.  </li>
            <li> I have to squeeze really hard</li>
            <li> Gets me SO dark!!!</li>
            <li> Gets a little difficult towards the end of the bottle to get out but nothing a few taps can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I received the bottle of this lotion and the label was misplaced.</li>
            <li> Why pay some crazy amount for something that does the same?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a negative thing to say about this product.</li>
            <li> but now i realize the damage i have , my arms and legs are like leather, and i have always used lotions all the time, i buy at least 3 bottles of skin lotion a month to keep me moisturized</li>
            <li> I guess need to spend at least $35 on a lotion for it to be a 4-5 star</li>
            <li> I have tanned for at least 8 years</li>
            <li> and I do feel that I&#x27;m building up a very gradual base tan</li>
            <li> instead of a liquid lotion, the product was a thick paste.</li>
            <li> instead of the lotion this became an unusable thick paste that DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> Got me very dark after I had a base going, took it to that next level</li>
            <li> The Smell Is Subtle</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all</li>
            <li> i was disappointed to find the same thick paste on my hands when i poured it from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And we all know how hard it is to get a compliment out of a man out of no where I might add!</li>
            <li> Or at least I hope so!</li>
            <li> Used to like Australian Gold products, but I was disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thick</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to use a bronzer, afraid I might streak , be orange-y, or splotchy.</li>
            <li> You have to be profoundly stupid to not see that the product is sold by Australian Gold!</li>
            <li> however, if you have got your base tan and want to get darker faster, this is definitely the product for you!</li>
            <li> It made me feel gross &amp; the process became annoying.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucked, it was way to thin, it took me about 2 wks to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this product then decided to look up reviews, noticed that green dot had bad complaints</li>
            <li> complaint is the burnt after smell, but it&#x27;s not a bug deal!!</li>
            <li> I always recommend switching lotions randomly</li>
            <li> so Im like obsessed with tanning in the summer</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at the performance of the product considering the price</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate people that takes a while to tan.</li>
            <li> I also was skeptical of the scent, as it states on Amazon that it&#x27;s berry scented.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> but I am not impressed with my tan.</li>
            <li> The Devoted Creations lotion is horrible, and the AG totally made up for that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is winter here in the NW</li>
            <li> I used this after 3 months of tanning at the salon, so I was already past a base tan.</li>
            <li> A stupid complaint, I know, but the lotion itself seems to be working.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t already have a little bit of a base tan - you will burn!  </li>
            <li> Horrible product and waste of money.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, I would definetly buy this again.</li>
            <li> Whenever you get out of the tanning bed it leaves a bad smell on your skin.</li>
            <li> It does have sn odor, not as bad as others though.</li>
            <li> The smell could be improved but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked since it worked so well.</li>
            <li> and i guess this is what iget for not listening.so is it real or fake?</li>
            <li> How stupid do you people think your customers are??</li>
            <li> I have a base tan.</li>
            <li> However, I always hated going because after I was done</li>
            <li> I hated how the lotions made my skin feel (ex.</li>
            <li> You  will not be disappointed if you purchase this lotion!</li>
            <li> No eords to say how i hate this product!</li>
            <li> I was nervous the berry smell would be awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love  this - wish I knew about it a long time ago - I get so tan with this !!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this. Smells not that great and didn&#x27;t seem to darken my skin while tanning. wouldn&#x27;t buy this again even for a penny.</li>
            <li> I love smell  and i like the fact there is no autobronzer  added (i assume there is not cuz after using it there wasnt that post smell what every autobronzers has, if i want a cream with autobronzer i would just buy it at store!&lt;br /&gt;But for a result i dont see any difference between tanning with lotion and without.&lt;br /&gt;Also i am extra pale and my pigment its extra low so i cant blame lotion for it.&lt;br /&gt;So maybe on some one who can tan easilly, but i believe there is no cream can make you darker unless is autobronzer in it.</li>
            <li> Have used this before and love this product. Don&#x27;t know what else to say&lt;br /&gt;except if you want a beautiful tan. Try it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than any other lotion...looking for dark...this didn&#x27;t help at all. OC Ten was the best lotion I have ever used...Wish they would stop discontinuing tanning lotions...I swear you find one you like then its discontinued</li>
            <li> Great lotion for indoor tanning. The first time I have used a lotion with a bronzer and I LOVE IT. I got results sooner and it does not stain clothes and it smells great! Will buy again when needed. Great price.</li>
            <li> it did not tan no different then any other lotion I have used. It does not smell very good. I will not buy this again</li>
            <li> This Tanning lotion has a great smell, pleasant texture, gives an all over bronze when tanning indoors or out side.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and smells really good and also gives you that dark tan your looking for</li>
            <li> Wear this lotion out in the sun for 30 minutes or so a few times a week and it keeps me tanner then a Brazilian model! lol</li>
            <li> I saw results after first time i  used it, definetly going to get me to the shade I am looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I would usually like, but it gets the job done. I just don&#x27;t really like how watery it was.</li>
            <li> i like that good item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that people give this a 1 and say it&#x27;s not a genuine product. You have to be profoundly stupid to not see that the product is sold by Australian Gold! Why would they sell a fake version of their own product?! Give me a break people...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells AMAZING and thanks to the fact that it has a bronzer in it already, you can see results in an extremely short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I tan pretty easily as I am of Greek and Italian descent.  However, my tan usually fades quickly.  I tried this lotion from a packet because I ran out of lotion and didnt want to spend a lot of money on a packet that was going to last just one or two times.  I loved it...I got a beautiful brown color after just one session in just a regular tanning bed, no upgrade.  Then I had to leave town for five days and not tan.  Usually, I would have been faded to about nothing and had wasted that one session.  This lotion kept me a beautiful brown color after all that time.  I get compliments every day about my color and everyone thinks I have been going daily to the tanning bed.  I average once or twice a week in a 20 minute bed and have a beautiful color.  So, I bought an full bottle this time and will keep this schedule.  I highly recommend the lotion.  As usual, keep your skin moisturized with an after bath oil ( I use Pure Romance&#x27;s Body Dew) and your skin will look amazing!</li>
            <li> By far the best Tanning lotion I have ever tried. The first 2 times I tanned with it I went 2 days back to back in a turbo bed. This was Feb. 10/11 2010. I havent had time to make it back and I am still super dark and bronze it is Feb 21!! I got so dark so fast. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! Never had a tan last so long in my life! Its almost like my color developed perfectly and got better each day!</li>
            <li> I was using the australian gold in the orange bottle before and it worked good but this lotion is on a whole new level.I tanned in two hours after I used it.This stuff is priced well and leaves me feeling super clean.I would take this lotion over anyother because of the price and quality.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned red head and I put this all over me when I went to the beach yesterday. My arms, back and chest are fine and tan but my legs are so burnt!! I think it was just because they haven&#x27;t seen much sun until yesterday. I am pretty sure my legs will have an awesome tan like my arms after it fades! Or at least I hope so! IT SMELLS SO GOOD TOO!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want an orangey look, but you want to look dark... definitely use this stuff.  it&#x27;s the best for fair-skinned individuals that want to look dark like everyone else, but not fake!</li>
            <li> Helps to darken you much quicker</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews and the price. I am a Designer Skin fan, but I wanted to try something different. This product goes on really quick and easy, and give a good color. Unfortunately it dries my skin completely out. I feel like I have to use half a bottle of lotion get get the moisture back in  my skin. I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion 4 or 5 times so far, and have seen very little results. I can tell that I am a bit darker, but nowhere near where I was hoping to be. If you&#x27;re expecting to get dark quickly this is not the lotion for you. However, it does smell great and I do feel that I&#x27;m building up a very gradual base tan so I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a waste of money. I&#x27;ll probably finish the bottle, and then get something with more bronzers in it.</li>
            <li> I work at a very popular tanning salon and was informed by someone very high up in the company that this lotion is almost identical to the J WOW tanning lotion which is much more expensive.  I compared ingredients and I have also used both and this is definitely the same.  You  will not be disappointed if you purchase this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have used this 3 times and notice N0 acceleration in tanning. Previously used Hawaiian Tropics and Banana Boat products have worked much better. I will not buy this product again and would not recommend it. I used for tanning bed.</li>
            <li> SO much cheaper the the tanning salon charges.</li>
            <li> Product was not real, it smelt very chemically and I had to stop using it because every time I did I developed a severe headache.</li>
            <li> i usually really like all australian gold products and especially their trademark scent, but this lotion smells bad. and my coworkers thought so after my tanning session also.</li>
            <li> Item was in a sealed package and was not damaged in any way.  I love this product and I got it for half the retail price!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it goes on easy and has no shimmer or tingle. Also the scent is so light, so I dont stink when I am finished tanning, whcih is great because sometimes I go on my lunch break from work. Gives me a great color too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a good 5 plus years and I&#x27;ve yet to find one I truly like and enjoy using. This is one of favorite ones and with buying through an Amazon seller it was half the price vs the place I tan at. It&#x27;s not sticky, it smells very good, and apply nicely and leaves a soft touch after tanning. It doesn&#x27;t leave you looking orange or having orange hands once you apply it on. Recommendation is very high on this product.  *Seller posted product and sold product as listed. Well packaged, even got a kick out of how over well it was with bubble wrap. Thanks.</li>
            <li> IVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 2 MONTHS AND ITS GIVEN ME AN AMAZING TAN ALONG WITH THE ACTUAL TANNING BED.... :)</li>
            <li> AG Sinfully Black 15X Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion is a great indoor tanning lotion!! Non-greasy, light scent, does not stain skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave you red and splotchy either!!! Very happy with the results!!!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest lotion EVER. I&#x27;ve laid twice &amp;&amp; I&#x27;m super dark. I will never use another brand.</li>
            <li> I have been an Amazon shopper for years and have never been mislead by a product described. The bottle that I received was 8.5 OZ NOT 12.8 OZ. There are lower priced options available on Amazon and I went with this company because it offered more OZ...definately not the case. Buyer beware! The product works well. No problems with the product they just need to be honest with the actual fluid ounces you are getting!    [[ASIN:B002WJOOIQ Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15x Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion, 12.8 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Works well. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have hit a tanning plateau so I will be moving on... however, if you have got your base tan and want to get darker faster, this is definitely the product for you! It delivers a nice golden brown! No orange here... YEAH!!!! I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone!! Thanks Australian Gold!! And thanks to Amazon, my beautiful tan was so much cheaper than buying this in the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I got this after trying a sample at my tanning salon.  I have used many others in the past, got to say that for me, this is just as good if not better than the more expensive products.  Goes on smooth, light fragrance, soaks right in to the skin, no funny smell after tanning.  I do leave on until next day to shower to get full effect of bronzer.  Leaves my skin very smooth, looking healthy and no greasy feel to it.  I will be getting more of this.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my order in the mail. One of the lotions I purchased was this one, Sinfully Black by Australian Gold. I did not purchase it through Amazon, though have purchased lotions through Amazon in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this lotion a 3 star rating because usually Australian Golds products have a super fruity, tropical smell, but Sinfully Blacks smell wasnt that great. Its supposed to be a Berry scent and although it does smell Berry-like, it wasnt a very nice Berry scent.&lt;br /&gt;Like most of the Australian Gold lotions ive tried, they are very easy to spread on your body prior to tanning and they go on smooth. This lotion did that and gave my skin a nice sheen. I have a good base tan already, and didnt notice this lotion really providing me with a \\&quot;Sinfully, dramatic, dark tan.\\&quot; So far, its not impressing me but hopefully itll build up within the next days I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I think I was expecting a bit more instand color from this product overall. I do have a natural Olive complexion as well and tan fast. Someone needs to make a product for people like us!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! It smells awesome and does its job.  Definitely one of my favorite lotions yet and I have tried quite a few!  I always recommend switching lotions randomly (I always have at least 3 different bottles) because there are some lotions that work great but start to look \\&quot;fake\\&quot; after too many uses! For any level tanner.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that sells at tanning places in the area for $22. IT is a good thick lotion with very little fragrance, which is what I like.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice. I use it when i tan in the beds. Good price for the money. Why pay some crazy amount for something that does the same?</li>
            <li> No eords to say how i hate this product! The carrot oil works better than that!</li>
            <li> so Im like obsessed with tanning in the summer and I&#x27;m always looking for new stuff to tan with. I usually go with banana boat because it works awesome. But this year I wanted like the best tan ever because it was my 21 birthday and I wanted to look like really good. So I baught this stuff Australian Gold and It like worked amazinggg! So I used it pretty much all summer and then I wanted like a darker tan because school was coming and I dont like being pale. But the point is I baught the australian gold sinfully dark tanning lotion because it looked amazing. I only got to use it like once though because september came :[ But it worked awesome when i used it! I&#x27;m really excited to use it next summer!! So everyone buy this product :]</li>
            <li> Great product! Was surprised at how quickly I started to tan after using it! It smells awesome also! Would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have fairer skin so I don&#x27;t tan as fast as most people and I do burn easy if I&#x27;m not careful. I read other reviews that stated this lotion makes you burn if you have fair skin so I started tanning without it to get a good base tan. Once I started using it I definately seen the results. I&#x27;ve never been this tan ever! Definately worth the money!</li>
            <li> started to woe as soon as i put it on ,not smell and a little goes a long way ,amust have</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion going on ant the smell is rather plesent. After however, the smell is not so great. Lotion gives a nice color. I loke everything about this lotion except the after smell. Over-all a great lotion at a steal. :)</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;m a noobie when it comes to tanning lotions. I started tanning indoors a few weeks ago to get ready for an upcoming trip to Arizona. I wanted to get a solid tan before I got there so I didn&#x27;t have to worry AS MUCH about getting completely fried. The girls at the tanning salon recommended an $60 bottle of tanning lotion, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do it. So I got on Amazon and started reading recommendations for a good, but cheap lotion. Decided on this one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I use it every time I go (about every other day) and it does an excellent job at keeping my skin moisturized. The smell is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t make me turn orange, but has given me a really solid, even tan. Love this stuff and can&#x27;t recommend it enough. Oh and this size bottle really lasts a long time. I LATHER it on each time I go, but still haven&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion about seven times now and I really like it. It give your tan just a little boost and helps it stay longer. Also it smells amazing and completely eliminates that post tanning bed smell. It also makes your skin look amazing after you get out of the bed. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Lotion works great. I was skeptical at the performance of the product considering the price but it works as well as some lotions that I have used that cost $50.00 or more.</li>
            <li> It smells great but I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement with my tan. I have used other products that give a better tan.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion. I actually get compliments on my tan. What&#x27;s great about it is that it doesn&#x27;t give my skin that fake orange tint, doesn&#x27;t stain my palms after applying &amp; I see great, long lasting results after one twenty minute session in a base bed. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  A couple months ago, my first bottle started getting low. I decided to try a different AG product, the one with the orange cap. While that one admittedly smelled better and left my skin super soft, I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results. Now I&#x27;m back for more of what works.</li>
            <li> this has helped my skin darken faster, I had a very decent tan after one week of 4 indoor tanning sessions.</li>
            <li> Loved this product but after I applied it I decided to read the ingredients and realized that one of the ingredients is hemp seed!!!  NOT COOL! Military members and others who get drug tested should stay away from this product.  I had to throw mine away unless I want my military career ruined.</li>
            <li> Lotion smells really good, isn&#x27;t oily, and works very well!!!  Have gone tanning three times with it in a ten minute bed, and u can really see a difference.  Will definately buy again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this tanning lotion. It does give you a dark, sinfully, envious tan. I have all the girls at the gym asking me where I purchased this lotion. I hope I have access to future purchases of this lotion at Amazon. Thank you for the speedy delivery as well and great service you always provide.</li>
            <li> Disn&#x27;t get me as dark as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this, but it is so thick that it will not come out! I had to take the top off and shake it to get to the lotion!</li>
            <li> really worked well for me. though i am part indian and naturally tan, this helped me get my tan alot faster, love the smell too!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful lotion with a great price. The perfect lotion for beginnig tanners. Also, the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I feel this a good lotion, at a good price, by a reputable company.&lt;br /&gt;I am fair skinned, and took awhile to get over  the &#x27;red&#x27; and build a good base. I have been using this for about a month, I am not dark, but have a nice tan and overall good tone. I was a little scared to use a bronzer, afraid I might streak , be orange-y, or splotchy. I work in a hot factory atmosphere,10 to 12 hour days, and did not want to &#x27;run&#x27;, sweat my tan off, or have wore spots.  But this bronzer was a safe bet for me. I do not have time to be out in the sun much, so tanning beds and lotions are a whole new experience for me. I must be the Queen of Combining - I love to combine products and experiment - and I use a tanning lotion with maximizer but no bronzer ( Hemp Freak, can I say the brand ? hahaa ) which I rub on first, and then apply the Australian Gold Sinfully Black. I am happy with my result. The Sinfully Black smells good, and applies well. No tingle. No funny smell after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;My husband - who is a light complected black man, has also taken to applying some before he goes outside, and has accomplished a nice golden brown colour.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied, and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> this product came in the mail today, i was expecting it to have a broken seal and a jacked up tag like other reviews say. But i&#x27;m happy to say that no of those were present. The seal wasn&#x27;t broken, the bottle was full and smells like the real deal stuff also the tag was not jacked up like other said. Haven&#x27;t gone tanning yet, hopefully it works well!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and tan outside. The first time using this, I was several shades darker in only 30 minutes, with no burning. Used it on my face too. Skin is super soft after. Tan lasts a very long time and is never orange or fake looking. This is the first lotion Ive ever used, and I have been no less than thrilled.</li>
            <li> So far so good! My skin usually takes a while to tan and I have used this product twice and can see a noticable difference. My skin is super sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothering me at all. It also makes my skin soft and came sealed in plastic, which I was very happy about.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15X Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion. I love this lotion. It is non greasy and has a nice smell too. It is also very affordable. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product from the local tanning salon that I frequent and was very pleased. It works great and I see a bronzing effect immediately. It has a nice smell and does NOT look blotchy should I not use it on all spots or spread it uneven. I have used others that have stained when I accidentally do not get them on even. Not so with Australian Gold Sinfully Black. I purchased it for close to ten dollars more at the salon and then it clicked to check Amazon.com. Very pleased that I did! I looked up a few others they sell and the price difference was amazing. Definitely stock up from Amazon.com before heading into the salon. Don&#x27;t want to be caught without your favorite lotions but the price tag markup is crazy high! Glad I found it online!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, and I LOVE the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product almost two weeks now and I have to say I am pretty satisified with the results. My complexion is kind of dark due to native american ancestry but this lotion has gotten me even darker. With this lotion I have been able to go the the tanning bed about every three days without it wearing off. This contains a moisturizer also to prevent skin from drying. If you are looking for an inexpensive way to go this could be the answer for you.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. It got to me on the estimated arrival date. The product smells good and works well. I plan on ordering again in the future. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve never been this satisfied with any of the ones I bought before I decided to get Sinfully Black. The price on here is amazing and the results are even better! I&#x27;m naturally really fair skinned and I developed a base tan before I started using this lotion, but the results I&#x27;ve gotten are the best I&#x27;ve gotten from a tanning lotion so far. It doesn&#x27;t give you that orange looking tan that some lotions give you, it gives you a really dark brown tan.. even naturally fair skinned people like me! It leaves your skin feeling really moisturized and the after smell isn&#x27;t too bad. The smell in general isn&#x27;t very appealing to me, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t use it. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a inexpensive tanning lotion that will keep your skin moisturized and give you fast results! My favorite lotion so far! I will definitely be buying this again :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I periodically go tanning just for a glow. However, I always hated going because after I was done I hated how the lotions made my skin feel (ex. kinda tacky)... This product doesn&#x27;t feel that way after tanning. My skin is dry to the touch and I can put my clothes back on without fear of smudging or streaking my tan. Plus, it gets you pretty dark (and natural-looking) after just one use! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> First of all, I was excited to find a good deal on this product on Amazon.  Also, I do love Australian Gold products and I&#x27;ve tried many of their more expensive ones- Beyond Famous, Crystal, HOT, and I really like this one for the value and the results.  It has a light smell that I found pleasant.  And it&#x27;s nice enough you can run to the store afterwards and not feel like you have to run home and shower right away because you reek.  Also as like other bronzers, you want to leave it on for at least a few hours to get the maximum effect, so it&#x27;s important that they don&#x27;t stink horribly.  It really is giving me nice color, and it doesn&#x27;t look fake or wash down the drain as soon as you shower.  Very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> This bronzer smells soooo good!!! You&#x27;ll not walk out with the &#x27;burned skin&#x27; smell so you wont feel the need to run home and take a shower right away. I love that. It also leaves your skin feeling softer which is a nice bonus. As far as the tan, it gives you that natural color that will last longer.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this lotion. I have tried everything out there and this gives me a nice dark color and it seems that my tan lasts longer using this over other lotions. I am normally really fair and this got me dark pretty quickly. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, I would definetly buy this again. Can&#x27;t beat the price, I saw this in the tanning salon for $45. Good deal!</li>
            <li> Makes skin brown and keeps skin very moist.  Think it has to do with the Hemp oil.  Ignore the silly reviews about Hemp oil making you test positive for drugs, etc -- as this is completely false.  Much cheaper than many of the boutique tanning oils which contain the same ingredients!</li>
            <li> Love this product, great value. I tan once a week and with this lotion I am maintaining a nice even tan. Will definitely purchase it again, works as well as the higher priced lotions sold at the salon, for half the price!</li>
            <li> My all time fav tanning lotion!!</li>
            <li> Produt provides great color to fair-skinned people like myself without looking fake.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Decided to switch it up but it was unsealed and didn&#x27;t work wonders like my old designer skin lotion did.. def will pay the extra 5 bucks for my other lotion I&#x27;ve used. I feel like I&#x27;m turning pale using this stuff...2 stars for the yummy smell and semi fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this product four stars, however, when you pay for 2 day shipping, that&#x27;s what you come to expect. Product is so-so. I saw gradual increase in bronzing. I have not gone more than a couple times so I do not know if it can give you the ultimate golden glow. We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the shipping, This product does make you darker and leaves you with a alright after tanning smell. Not putrid like some other tanners. Doesn&#x27;t tan the fastest, but gets you there if you keep going, just like all tanners. This was a great price as compared to the in store tanning prices that are RIDIC!</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Applies nicely, thick lotion, no streaks and I&#x27;m not orange. Gets a little difficult towards the end of the bottle to get out but nothing a few taps can&#x27;t fix. Smell is decent and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping for more dramatic change in color, however I only noticed I got a shade darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just starting to tan this is a great beginners lotion.</li>
            <li> The product was on time as granted my husband loves this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like this tanning lotion! It has a very pleasant smell to it and works really well! I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion  great for both indoor and outdoor tanning</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold products and have been using them for years. This lotion smells nice &amp; has decent bronzers. At this price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> didnt give me any color whatsoever, tried it inside and out</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, Ive used tons of different lotions and this one is deffiantly the best especially for the price. Really impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I was looking for a lotion that wouldn&#x27;t smell too girly and would get me the tan I was looking for. The attendant at my local salon recommended this to me. It smells clean and refreshing. The tan itself is dark, it got me to the next level up. I got a lot of compliments on my tan after using this lotion. It isn&#x27;t orange and the bronzers work really well and give an even appearance. This is my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> First of all, you can not give this a bad rating because you THOUGHT it was a self-tanner. Nowhere does it say that it is a self-tanner. So that&#x27;s your own fault for assuming so. Now for the review... I have used this lotion ONCE, and I notice a drastic difference. It smells awesome, like Fruity &amp; Bright by victoria&#x27;s secret, just like it. I tanned at 11:30am. It&#x27;s now 10pm, and I can still smell it. It also doesn&#x27;t give you that burnt smell after you get out of the tanning bed. And the color it gives isn&#x27;t orange. It&#x27;s nice and tan. I&#x27;m picky about lotions... I&#x27;ve used some by Millennium, and mostly Designer Skin. So when I saw this lotion for so cheap, I was weary about how well it would work, regardless of the good reviews. But I&#x27;m really glad I gave it a shot. I heard Going Ga-Ga is really good too, so I might try that next. Happy tanning!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for 3 weeks now. Yes, I am darker than when I started but I can&#x27;t tell any major results. It smells ok...nothing spectacular. Whenever you get out of the tanning bed it leaves a bad smell on your skin. The plus side of this lotion is that I have very fair skin and I have not burnt one time. I paid $22 for this at the salon - I would suggest anyone not to buy this lotion at this price because you could get a much better product (for the ones who want an instant difference).</li>
            <li> I like the way sinfully black smells and moisturizes my skin but I don&#x27;t think it is getting me much darker than when I used no lotion at all.</li>
            <li> My sister actually purchased this on my account, I did not personally use the product but I watched her use it and all I can say is it works amazingly. She has a hard time tanning, where I do not, I tan very easily and darkened up before midsummer. She can go the whole summer and only go a shade or so darker. With this product she darkened up nicely and did not even need to use a tanning bed. She would oil herself up with the product and sit out in the sun for fifteen minutes on one side and fifteen minutes on the other. Within a few weeks she was a shade that she was happy with and she bought more of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone who has a hard time tanning because it appears to work wonders.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Works just as good as the expensive brands sold in salons, but way cheaper!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> this lotion works too good. I wear it outside and in the tanning beds and I get so brown from it I love it! Already on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate people that takes a while to tan. I really like this product. It only took a few times to use it before I noticed some color.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of tanning lotions and found this one tobe the best!!  As a big fan of Australian Gold products, I looked forward to trying this one...I was not disappointed. I would highly recommend it to those that enjoy a deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great lotion!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is a great product.  Tan fast and tan dark with this lotion that also has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> For all the reviews saying it is fake, this lotion is the real thing. No, I have never bought from this company before this. But yes, I have used multiple bottles of this lotion from the salons. I never recall it having a seal (although don&#x27;t quote me, it could have one). To be honest, through the bottles I used I had NO idea this lotion had a &#x27;berry&#x27; scent, but the smell is the same from the salons. What I do know is that it gives you fast, practically one session results. I&#x27;m fair skinned naturally and I am faithful to this lotion, and this price is a steal. You get a nice brown color from this, and don&#x27;t get the yucky after tanning scent. I will defiantly purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I never really believed that tanning lotion actually worked, I felt like it was just a money making market. And even though I (for the most part) still feel that way, I actually felt like this lotion turned me bronze instead of orange. I followed this with the use of the moisturizer and my skin looked so healthy!</li>
            <li> Perfectly olive tan, NO orange! I&#x27;m Greek, so I tan well, but most tanning bed products eventually turn me orange; like most tanning excellerators do. This product makes me tan like I&#x27;ve been laying on the beach for two weeks.</li>
            <li> It was OK didn&#x27;t really do what it said. Hard to bronze</li>
            <li> I bought Sinfully Black after a long review process of the many different kinds for sale on Amazon. I really like Australian Gold products and this one is inexpensive ($13 when I bought it) and works well. I have went tanning in a level 2 bed for less than 60 minutes spread over the past week - after not having tanned indoors for 8 months - and already have distinct, noticeable color.  This lotion is clean-smelling and makes your skin feel good afterwards.  I think it brings out your natural tanning ability and doesn&#x27;t make you orange.  A really good, basic, inexpensive, everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> took my chances even after reading the review...i used the product..didn&#x27;t develop any rash or reaction to the lotion..it did not have a seal...it was watery...but I don&#x27;t know it this is how it is supposed to be...It was effective for tanning..did the job..</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 4 or five months now and hit a plateau, so i decided to use tanning lotion.  I&#x27;ve sampled a bunch at the salon, including Smoke Black Bronzer, Snooki black bronzer, and this one is my favorite! had a noticeable difference right after, and it had a little tingle to it.  smells like tanning lotion, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.  overall this is one of my favorite tanning lotions/bronzers and it is a good price too.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best lotion I have used for tanning.  Normal tanning lotion you get at the tanning salon never works for my skin tone but this one works wonderfully!  It leaves your skin a very nice dark tan.  If you don&#x27;t already have a little bit of a base tan - you will burn!  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING LOTION IS GREAT GOES ON SMOOTHLY. YOU DONT HAVE TO USE BUT A LITTLE AT A TIME ....  AND IT SMELLS REALLY GOOD TOO !</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this lotion, I absolutely love the results I get.  Great bronzer for an unbelievable price.  I always get darker quicker when I use this.  I definitely recommended it.</li>
            <li> Before using this product, I went indoor tanning about 3-4 times a week.  Now having this product, I only go indoor tanning once a week.  It keeps my skin tan and bronzed exponentially longer than regular lotion.  It makes my skin super smooth and it smells nice - no fake tanning smells you get from some products.  I use a stand up level 3 bed.  I looove my tan :-)</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, will buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion as a beginning tanner. I have pretty fair skin and it&#x27;s hard for me to tan or burn, but much easier to burn than tan.    From the first use of this lotion, I LOVED the smell (although getting out of the bed it didn&#x27;t smell as pretty) but it definitely gave immediate results.    DON&#x27;T expect to be super dark after one, or even a couple of uses. But it did work that way for me. Although I did get a little burnt, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my fault for over tanning. Lol    I would definitely recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> The thing I&#x27;ve read most in reviews about Australian Gold tanning lotions is how thin they are; making them go on easier.  Now I finally understand.  Its not thin as in watery, it just smooths out easier than most lotions I&#x27;ve used.  I used it the first time today, and the odor going on and after tanning is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  It had a fruity scent applying, but after getting out of the bed I barely noticed the odor at all.  When I got home, I applied some Playboy Vegas cologne to my clothes (not on my skin to avoid thinning out the bronzers in the lotion,) and I can&#x27;t smell the lotion at all anymore.  On top of that, I&#x27;m used to feeling at least a little greasy using any lotion (including Designer Skin lotions,) but I don&#x27;t feel greasy at all after using this.  The only drawback to this lotion is that it comes in 8.5oz instead of 13.5oz, but considering the price it doesn&#x27;t phase me at all.  Another tip for those who are serious about tanning and buy a lot of different lotions; I purchased this through Tan 4 Less, and they charge something like 6 or 7 dollars for shipping, but if you add a lotion to your order from them, they only add a dollar per item, so they are like a true wholesaler.  I got this, and 2 different bottles of Designer Skin lotions for a total of $54, and that price included shipping.  I would have spent around $140 in my salon for the lotions I purchased.  Props to Tan 4 Less.</li>
            <li> It was pretty good... I notice I&#x27;m a little darker then normal, The only downside I thought it smelled like paint. ;/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone had noticed this but this lotion is the exact same as [[ASIN:B004FEKA3E Australian Gold Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion, 13.5-Ounce]]. I&#x27;ve had both and I checked the ingredients and they are exactly the same...so that means the scent and texture are also the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion leaves your skin super soft, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in color after I used it a few times. I did feel I looked a little orange though. It also made my chest break out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Good bronzer for inside tanning. Fragrance is more bearable than most and leaves skin very soft. Downside is that it eventually rubs off especially if you use it on your face. It gives you the appearance of being tanner than you actually are.</li>
            <li> A few days after purchasing this product, I posted a review about it because I was pretty satisfied. However, I now know that this product is not genuine. I was a little skeptical when I received the bottle of this lotion and the label was misplaced. I also was skeptical of the scent, as it states on Amazon that it&#x27;s berry scented. This particular bottle smelled like hair dye. However, I decided to give it a try and after a couple days, I was satisfied with the tan that I got. However, after over a month of use, the product stopped working. Also, my friend has the same lotion, in which she purchased at her salon, and it smells completely different than the bottle that I received. Therefore, this product is not genuine. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok isn&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this because of all the great reviews, but it did not work for me.  I would give it zero stars because of that, but the lotion was kind to my skin, also, I did not care for the scent.</li>
            <li> This is my tanning lotion of choice. It&#x27;s cheap and works just as good as any expensive stuff. It also smells really good.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion for tanning. Smells good and gives a nice overall color. I usually buy this because it is so reasonable on price and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Love the color I love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference than not using anything at all. It does smell decent though. Next time I&#x27;ll get a more expensive one I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li> love this .. mom stole it from me tho &amp; uses it religiously lol .. love Australian gold products ! so cheap but do the best job !</li>
            <li> This product worked well, but be careful! I stayed in the bed too long because this product desensitizes you the heat. I didn&#x27;t feel when I started to burn (like i usually do). I looked brown, then super red for a couple of days, then tan. Hence the title, this stuff is great for color but WATCH OUT!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion in the past and have yet to find one that works better. There are some that are comparable but none get me any darker than this without the orange look and streaks like self tanner</li>
            <li> I love it. Works well!!!</li>
            <li> it give smoth feeel touch the body use&lt;br /&gt; got dark tan  three time a week&lt;br /&gt; nice smeeeth to to the air</li>
            <li> I love Austrialian Gold and how it darkens and bronzes so quickly.  I love how quickly I tan and I have very fair skin!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, and feels good on your skin but does not seem to work very good at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and great price! I love it! Would recommend to anyone that is hard to tan.</li>
            <li> This is just okay. Didn&#x27;t get me near as tan as the Australian Gold &amp;#34;Going GAGA&amp;#34;. I will stick with that next time..</li>
            <li> Works well. I have been using this for a while now.</li>
            <li> Many years ago, I was a lifeguard, and spent probably 50-60 hours a week in the sun... Using this lotion for three, 10-min sessions (4-days apart) and I&#x27;m almost as dark as I was back then.  The color is a nice bronze, not orange or fake looking... it brings out the natural tones of your body&#x27;s tan, and keeps it there.  I&#x27;ve not been to the tanning bed in nearly a week, and the color has faded only slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is a bit thick, but spreads evenly and easily, and soaks into the skin quickly - should apply it at least 10 min before tanning, but could be applied much earlier, or at the last minute, too.  The lotion also has excellent skin conditioners and moisturizers, as my skin is probably the softest it&#x27;s ever been in my life.  The fragrance is a bit fruity (berries), but not overpowering, and it does not fade to the burnt orange smell you get with some of the higher-priced lotions.  It&#x27;s not bad for a man, but probably better suited for the ladies (fragrance-wise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend that you do not wash this off (take a shower) for at least 4 hours after tanning, as it continues to work for several hours after your session.  I also recommend that you use a good lotion after your shower to maintain the health of your skin (and the glow of your tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many MUCH higher priced bronzers that don&#x27;t come close to the efficiency of this one.  The cost is perfect, and it just works well!</li>
            <li> better for newbs than the experienced!!! it smells AMAZING, i like it when i was stating back so it served its purpose</li>
            <li> Australian gold is my favorite brand of tanning lotion, I think it works best. Sinfully black does give you a nice tan. However it does not have any smell to it, I like when tanning lotions have a nice scent to them.</li>
            <li> This is a nice starter bronzer.  Does not have a tingle.  Is a light brown/tan color.  I saw results after 2 indoor tanning sessions.  Does not leave streaks that I can tell.  As far as smell is concerned, I don&#x27;t really notice after I have applied and tanned.  If you smell it from the bottle it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Package was nicely packed and sealed, I tan very well due to genetics but it takes a good lotion to get me to the brown I like during summer. I swapped out my normal lotion for this one the last few days and it&#x27;s working well. I get compliments on a daily about my tan, I reccommend this one :)</li>
            <li> This Lotion does the right job AND quick, plain and simple. Best I&#x27;ve tried so far and I&#x27;m sticking with it</li>
            <li> Always the best for tanning.  My daughter and I have been using Australian Gold for years. A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Average hard to use because little thick</li>
            <li> This lotion does contribute to a darker tan.  Of course there is no sunscreen in it, but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s meant for anyway.  It does have a light bronzer in it that lasts about a day.  It&#x27;s not an orange hue and doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothes.  Looks natural and is a superb moisturizer.  It works in tanning booths and outdoors.  Good after tan moisturizer too.  The scent is universal; men and women can use it without smelling funky.  I&#x27;ve got more on order.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I didn&#x27;t notice any huge differences between this and other lotions I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Perfect product professional</li>
            <li> I love love this lotion</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My husband and I tan about the same amount of time and I got so much darker because I used this product and he did not. I had so many people comment on my great tan this year and usually don&#x27;t get any comments. I will use this again!</li>
            <li> Yes, I like this lotion and it meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works as well as it claims and leaves an awesome tan. As well as a great price.</li>
            <li> It was great. It came early</li>
            <li> When using the product for tanning I certainly don&#x27;t get as red.  I have a fair complexion and do tan very nicely.</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY IT AGAIN!!MY TANS LOOKING GOOD AND IT SMELLS GOOD TO.HOPE TO GET DARKER BY USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It came promptly and it was exactly what I wanted. The lotion itself works really well, and the price is very fair.</li>
            <li> THIS GOT ME STARTED, BUT DIDNT SEEM TO BRONZE ALL THAT GREAT. DONT THINK I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN, BUT DO APPRECIATE THE LOW COST AND GOOD START ON MY TAN.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews questioning the validity of this actually being Australian Gold.  I cannot say yes or no, but what I can say is that it works.  It has a pleasant smell, very similar to AG products I have used before and the bronzing works.  I don&#x27;t have a negative thing to say about this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is a best seller at my gym where they have tanning. Bought on Amazon since it was more affordable and works great! Fantastic product and price.</li>
            <li> Is very good so good very i happy with this my names is ales and I loved the best tx</li>
            <li> Works great  will buy it again</li>
            <li> I use this product as soon as I got it. Didn&#x27;t use much though but I can tell you this.After only two applications on my face arms and neck ...I had the most beautiful tan ever. I would assume if you use it a lot you can get really dark .But for me was good enough. Love it  ..love it... love it .....</li>
            <li> Works great, no orange color. Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. they charge 59 plus at sun parlor. it is great/ silky. I tan easy. . It leaves no stain at all. It is delightful. Smells so  great. Totally a terrific lotion for real and artificial sunlight.  As well this lotion is just as great to use as a base lotion for everyday use. You cannot go wrong. I will be buying again very soon!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for inside tanning.  It gave me a nice golden tan. yes I would buy again. Great!!!</li>
            <li> This really find nothing but dry out my skin. No bronzing effect. It does have sn odor, not as bad as others though.</li>
            <li> Got me very dark after I had a base going, took it to that next level</li>
            <li> I have used (and loved) Australian Gold products in the past, but his didn&#x27;t work at all, which makes me think that it may not be real.</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and it was a bit thicker and harder to get out of the bottle than previous bottles I have bought. I know bronzers tend to be thicker lotions, but this was a little more difficult to work with. Left me wondering if it was a little older &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to work fine however.</li>
            <li> Horrible product and waste of money. The lotion has a weird, bad smell to it and the bottle is very cheap to the point where it feels like it&#x27;s about to break. It takes more effort than should be necessary to squeeze the lotion out as well. (But I will not be using any more of it.)</li>
            <li> Good product no issues.. I use this to tan evaluate it see to be the only one that works well with my skin</li>
            <li> Amazing! It smells so great! Goes on smooth and after you get done tanning there is no sticky residue. This is truly a great product that I have been wanting to try forever.</li>
            <li> Your tanner will tell you that you&#x27;re only guaranteed to get quality lotions if you buy directly from them because you know where you&#x27;re getting it from.  HA!  You&#x27;ll also pay 3 or 4 times as much.  This is the same stuff you buy for much more.  Excellent value and works great on my paleness! :)</li>
            <li> I use this product in a standard 15 minute tanning bed. Smells fine and works fairly well for the price... I would recommend spending 5 or 10 more dollars for a better product. This product does not accelerate my tan very much and I find I go through this stuff pretty fast. I will not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;*this product does keep my skin from drying out in the tanning bed so an extra star for that!</li>
            <li> I bought Sinfully Black a couple of months ago from my salon for around $30. It&#x27;s more liquidy and slippery than other lotions, which allows it to spread on easier. It smells really good, like a berry/citrus smell, even after tanning. The bronzers worked great. The lotion makes you brown &amp; bronze, not at all orange. It didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes or come off in the shower. I was darker after every session &amp; my color lasted for days. I used this after 3 months of tanning at the salon, so I was already past a base tan. Sinfully Black really boosted my tan. What I didn&#x27;t like at all about the lotion was that it made me feel really greasy after &amp; caused me to break out alot. If you use a lotion with bronzers in it, you should wait a couple of hours to shower after tanning so the bronzers take complete effect. So after tanning with this lotion, it&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable not taking a shower. I took a shower after anyway, but rubbed my skin really soft that way it didn&#x27;t wash away all the bronzers. This just made me feel a little more comfortable &amp; cleaner, I would still shower afterward to fully cleanse. I finished the bottle &amp; decided not to buy another one because of this. It made me feel gross &amp; the process became annoying. I&#x27;ve been trying other lotions since then &amp; Luminary by Designer Skin will most likely be my next choice. But, Sinfully Black might work for you. It might just not work well for my type of skin. Other than that, it works great, smells great &amp; its alot cheaper than others. You can buy it at the salon for around $30, or from the internet for half of that. Just make sure the site you order it from is legit.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a company that continues to produce good products that work.  Have had great results past and present!</li>
            <li> Australian Gold products are all worth the price for the ease of uniform application. Also, their products have a fragarance that is soft.</li>
            <li> To orangey for my taste Australian Gold is a good product. So this one just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Loved the scent and the results!</li>
            <li> Amazing! The price is great.</li>
            <li> Love it, no residual smell, great tan...My favorite tanning lotion. Gives a deep, dark tan...Anyone who wants a great tan, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I received the lotion before shipment arrival date. The lotion is excellent, I love the way it gives you color right away and the smell is great. It rivals many of the expensive brands by far.</li>
            <li> sinfully black is good stuff :) it smells good, its not a thick lotion like some i have used, and it did give me the tan i was looking for. def. buy this stuff again :)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It gives me great color. I love the smell and rubs in smoothly. I highly recommend this lotion for everyone who uses a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> aussie gold strikes again. this lotion smells soooo good. even after using the tanning bed! leaves your skin sinfully smooth too.</li>
            <li> works well.  fast shipping</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you want to get dark very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> I first using Australian gold and love the product, it very affordable and you will like the product. I gave it a 5 star because it a very product and will in fact do the job, and will not cost you a lot of money..</li>
            <li> They wanted $40.00 at the tanning salon and I got 2 of these for around $30.00. Great product and price.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff! She recommends it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This stuff sucked, it was way to thin, it took me about 2 wks to finish the bottle. When your tanning it smells a little like burnt skin, I would NOT recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what was in the bottle but what ever it was, was watery even my daughter said that it looked watered down but I used it any way and by the time I had used half the bottle I was losing my tan it was like it was blocking the tanning process. I will not use or order from this person again, I have talked to others who have used this lotion but did not get from this site and their was nothing like what I was using, theirs even had a real pleasant smell to it when mine didn&#x27;t. Will not order again if I do it will not be from here.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my gf and she used it once and she got dark !  I may even buy some myself.  She doesn&#x27;t tan as easy as I do so for her to get as dark as she did.  I was impressed !</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty good. I wish it had more fragrance. So if you want a slightly bronzing smooth lotion with less smell this is a good one for you.</li>
            <li> will turn you into a carrot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of lotions but I&#x27;ll have to admit this is by far my favorite! I first tried it when I bought one of those sample packets at my tanning salon and later that day I couldn&#x27;t believe how dark I was from one 10 minute session with that lotion!! The next time I went back they were all out of the sample packets (they said it was a very popular) so I had to get my own bottle and DAMN!! was it cheap on here...I was shocked since it worked so well. It glides on very well - not too thick, not too thin. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this lotion plus it has a nice smell that prevents me from having that strong gross tanning bed smell and since I go on my lunch break at work, that&#x27;s definitely a plus for me &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a week ago and when it arrived, the seal had already been cut (very cleanly I might add). I used the lotion anyway and it was definitely not the real stuff. I believe it was transplanted with something cheap and watered down. Avoid buying from Green Web Inc.</li>
            <li> I have perused the fine (very fine..) print on this product and nowhere does it say it is meant as simply  a pre/post tanning bed lotion. It is advertised as a SELF tanner, no beds needed.  But, three of us rather pale girls have put spots of it all over with absolutely no results!!!!   NOT acceptable,, how do i get a refund?  do you want the bottle back? Who makes this stuff, i would like to complain directly.  Thank you   Debbie</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a few different tanning lotions and I think I&#x27;ll be sticking with Designer Skin products. While I like the smell of this one as well as how soft it makes my skin I never got any darker using this. In fact, I think I got darker using nothing! For those people rating it low because you&#x27;re under the mistaken belief this is a self tanner- it&#x27;s not! So use it because it smells good and makes your skin soft, don&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re trying to get darker.</li>
            <li> Product does not offer any bronzing whatsoever.  It is also watery and seems cheap.  Other users have mentioned that the supplier may be refilling the bottles?  Not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. It does smell good although not amazing like some have proclaimed. The lotion is very thick so it seems to take a lot , I am worried about how long it will last but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. It does give you a nice glow without that burnt skin smell.</li>
            <li> It is a good lotion, however if you have sensitive skin like me it made me break out after a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Just tried for the first time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results !!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  Great color!</li>
            <li> My daughter was purchasing the over priced products that are sold at the tanning salons which did not work half as well as this product.  It gives you great natural color.</li>
            <li> Works great better than some of the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Great if your staring out completely white like myself. No nasty smell, it&#x27;s a nice lotion that rubs in easy. After I achieved a nice tan, I went up to another product by this company that was 30x -</li>
            <li> use to tan , and did tan for 20 yrs but now i realize the damage i have , my arms and legs are like leather, and i have always used lotions all the time, i buy at least 3 bottles of skin lotion a month to keep me moisturized</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this tanning lotion I have used better but it did arrive quick overall this product is all right in my book everyone skin is different so it might work for you all you can do is try it and seen I mean the price is right.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. My tan has come in quick and my skin feels hydrated.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love about this product is the after tan smell is horrible.  I&#x27;ve definitely tried lotions that smell worse, but I always end up showering shortly after tanning when I use this lotion just because the smell is a little overpowering Prior to tanning though, this lotion smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to use in my usual high-pressure bed. I was so excited when I opened the bottle - the lotion smells great! Much better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as other lotions. I usually start to get a noticeable tan after 2 or 3 sessions, but it&#x27;s been twice as long with this lotion and the only color I&#x27;ve gotten is a slight burn. Definitely recommend going with another lotion!</li>
            <li> This product works so well!! I bought it a week ago, and I had already had a base tan, but when I used this lotion, it deepened my tan so much! It also smells really fruity! ( Don&#x27;t know why others are saying it doesn&#x27;t ) Leaves skin soft and glowing :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This lotion is just fine. It does not make me any darker and the smell is ok. It is a cheaper lotion and I like it but I dont think I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service. Much cheaper than buying lotion at the salon. Got it shipped very quickly. Very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product from girls I know. And some people I know who work at salons. Said that this was the popular choice. So I bought it. And it is awesome! Started seeing results fast and it smells fabulous! No burnt smell. &lt;3</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of the bottle.  Have to keep banging it on a hard surface to get the lotion out.  I will go with a different kind once this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Used this product 7 times last summer. Didn&#x27;t do anything. I barely tanned at all. I think the only color was the little bit of bronzer that was in there. But at least it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion the other day because I purchased a tanning membership and didn&#x27;t want to buy any overpriced lotions that they sell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going every day for 4 or 5 days and have noticed that I&#x27;ve been getting a little darker, but also I used Level 1-4 beds.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this lotion isn&#x27;t anything amazing. It doesn&#x27;t turn you brown in one day or anything, but it smells really good and it works fine for the price you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for weird packaging, just make sure you order it through a place that has it fully sealed and you should be fine. I&#x27;m not a huge believer in lotions making a big enough difference to pay 50+ dollars for them, so this would be a good investment for anyone just needing a regular tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I love a lot of Australian gold products but this is by far the best! I wore this one time to the beach and instantly got color! It usually takes me a few times laying out to get a good tan but not with this product! Smells great too! I would def. recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have used this only 3 times. I&#x27;m very happy with it I&#x27;m very dark already. I have only tanned once a week with this. I get so many compliments. I love the deep dark color I get with it no orange color either. It&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this tanning lotion from Amazon twice in the past couple of months.  Previous orders have come from dedicated tanning lotion sellers, but this time I was in a bit of a rush, so I went with the \\&quot;Amazon-fulfilled\\&quot; GreenWeb seller.  Big mistake.  This lotion is absolutely watered down or cut with another type of lotion.  Compared to my last bottle of Sinfully Black, it is significantly lighter in color, has a much fainter smell, and is a lot runnier applying to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Australian Gold Sinfully Black.  It is a nice lotion for a good price.  But do NOT trust GreenWeb as your seller.</li>
            <li> Smells great and not greasy at all. I normally feel really oily and smell funny after the tanning beds but this lotion smelled great and didnt get that grimy feeling after. Worked great, got so many compliments on how tan I was and I was only using a level1 bed. Great lotion and great price!</li>
            <li> its a natural bronzer so you dont have to worry about turning orange but it really does help you get a nice tan! I love this lotion, the smell the way it rubs in and the color it gives me are all amazing! no after tan smell either yay!</li>
            <li> I always look at reviews before I buy a product and the ones I read about this one seemed okay till I tried it. It has a great smell and goes on pretty smooth but I am not impressed with my tan. I have used tanning lotions that make me fairly dark and I would like to get my tan back but this product did not give me the results I wanted. I do not see much of a different in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Works like magic perfect for that golden tan quick and delivery was really quick I recommend it highly ! Didnt take very long on the sun beds either</li>
            <li> awsome love it and the smell too</li>
            <li> My GF used this at the tanning salon several times and it leaves a nice bronze color on her. 2</li>
            <li> I just received the tanning lotion and it was packed by amazon. The bottle was not sealed and leaked in the box. It is also a self tanner..its says nothing about being used in a tanning booth. If it isn&#x27;t made for a tanning booth it will block the uv rays and you will not see any results. I am returning it and just gonna spend the extra money for something better.</li>
            <li> I do still berry much love my sweet&amp;sexy sugary sweetness bronzer &amp; it was my fave untill i decided.to Google &#x27;best indoor t.lotions&#x27;  and found the PoT of Aussie Gold.. After just 1 use I&#x27;m pretty brown, and I&#x27;ve maintained that color for over a a few weeks &amp; i still havent used any of my jegens gradual tanning lotion which i typically follow up with after a session, with that being said..The Gold holds it&#x27;s own fur sure.  Great product! Mos def a new ATF</li>
            <li> I was given this bottle as a gift from my local tanning salon for purchasing a level one tanning package.  I used this all summer and found that it gave me an even natural looking tan.  I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years and generally take the winters off.  I used this lotion from the very start of my tanning season and never burned.  It has a mild smell, not too strong and helps cover that \\&quot;just tanned smell\\&quot;.  I personally would prefer a lotion that is slightly thicker in consistancy, but really can&#x27;t complain.  It absorbed and dried quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft.  I feel this is a great lotion for those looking for a natural tan.</li>
            <li> tried worse and tries better..average.  I guess need to spend at least $35 on a lotion for it to be a 4-5 star</li>
            <li> Used to like Australian Gold products, but I was disappointed in this one. It was runny and seemed to have a problem absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li> Another quality lotion from Australian Gold. Being an avid tanner I strongly favor lotions that have bronzers in them. The darker the tan the better. This lotion is one of many I use to have that dark tan. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> Great service got my package very quickly, but for me it didn&#x27;t do much for my tan didn&#x27;t get any darker.  Just went on and bought an different one.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good once you 1st put it on but after you get out of the tanning booth or bed, you tend to smell a little bit burnt (no biggie for me though).  The product works but you have to tan several times, dont expect to come out black with tanning two or three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are better products but I was being cheap and decided to go with this one-- I can&#x27;t see myself paying $60.00 for a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> For the price i couldn&#x27;t pass it up. Before this lotion i was using a bronzing lotion called paramour that got me extremely dark. After starting to use this it didnt get me as dark as fast but definitely gave me a more natural look. So for the price i would buy it again. And it doesnt leave you smelling to strong of tanning lotion</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this tanning lotion for two years and it was absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, something changed in the last few orders i got. instead of a liquid lotion, the product was a thick paste. i thought it was a fluke, so i ordered again. the second time, it came in a clear sealed bag, so i thought it wouldn&#x27;t be the solid paste that i got, and would instead be the regular lotion that i love. i was disappointed to find the same thick paste on my hands when i poured it from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product was an amazing FIVE-stars. the color on my tan was perfect. instead of the lotion this became an unusable thick paste that DOES NOT WORK. i tested this paste four times and it seems to have absolutely no effect on my skin, completely unlike previous orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know if i got really unlucky and got two bad batches, or if this is now how they&#x27;re being made. i don&#x27;t remember if the bottles regularly come with a seal, but the last two bad batches came without a seal. perhaps they could have been tampered with? i don&#x27;t know, but i&#x27;ve already ordered 2 and they came that way.</li>
            <li> It was a good lotion to use when tanning because it made my skin feel good before and after tanning... I always put it on right before going into the bed. I would reccommend it if you are looking for something inexpensive but works well enough. I think it did help me get darker just because my skin was moisturized well. smells good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really greasy and makes my skin very oily. The bronze isn&#x27;t as dark as I expected. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a fan! The bronze makes the lotion an odd color and YOU an odd color after using it. I felt like maybe the lotion wasn&#x27;t genuine - but who knows. It felt uncomfortable on my skin and didn&#x27;t blend very nicely. I threw it out after a couple of uses. Not recommended. I am italian and tan very nicely (had a base tan when used), so it wasn&#x27;t funky because I was pale!&lt;br /&gt;Namaste</li>
            <li> Love the Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15x Deep Dark Bronzing Tanning Lotion, 8.5... Actually love all their products, would recommend to anyone... does give you that dark golden tan...</li>
            <li> This made my tan look really good this year. Its not thick or greasy and it intesified my skin color a lot. I would recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really good tanning lotion and I&#x27;ll likely buy again since they&#x27;re no longer making the Crystal X.</li>
            <li> Love the look and feel of this bronzer.  I use it for tanning in a salon or outside.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I understand everyone tans differently.  I usually tan fairly easily, especially once my base tan is developed.  I didn&#x27;t think there was anything extra special about this lotion.  Nothing better or worse than others I&#x27;ve tried.  A couple pros: It does smell good and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.  I would buy it again depending on what the current price is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and it works great!!! I have a great tan that happeneded almost instantly and stayed. No yellow effect..I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this product tanning only once a week and after the second use I was wow darker! Even my husband commented on my beautiful color. And we all know how hard it is to get a compliment out of a man out of no where I might add!</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold products so I knew what I was ordering.  It was much cheaper to go through Amazon than buying at a local salon.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion but have not used it yet but.. its lotion and it was cheaper then the tanning place!</li>
            <li> This product offered no color enhancement whatsoever. Regardless of natural or artificial sunlight. Should be classified as a lotion not a dark tanner.</li>
            <li> Great product great price and it work well in the tanning bed. It goes on smooth, smells nice and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive tanning lotions and Sinfully Black is the best that I&#x27;ve used.  It gives you a natural tanning color and makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Works great.</li>
            <li> first time using this product and I really like it nice color results, I would buy again.  The smell is fine, and it does not leave you with the feeling you need to shower as fast as you can after tanning. I had excellent and fast shipping.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Having worked in customer service all my life I know how important it is to keep your customers happy. DanniDeals went above and beyond to accomodate me and I will definitely be a returning customer in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Colton</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion and I really can&#x27;t see a big difference at all than any other lotions I have used. I think the bed makes a difference when worked with a lotion. Just a simple 20 min. bed and this lotion, I don&#x27;t see a big difference. Australian Gold used to be one of the best out there. I have been doing a more powerful bed and I do see some difference. I like it, but I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Nothing fantastic.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for something different. It wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Love it, smells awesome and I get great color...</li>
            <li> The only tanning lotion I buy.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a while and tried others, but by far this is the best tan in a bottle</li>
            <li> Shipping time was great, as well as the product. smells great, works very nicely. i tan very easily but this product defintely helped! The amount of lotion you recieve for the price is incomparable. good buy</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT, PERFECT BROWN TANNING! I recommend it 100% I WILL ALWAYS BUY. AND BEST OF ALL IS THAT DO NOT SKIN peel</li>
            <li> Scent--It smells pretty good, not amazing, but not bad. It&#x27;s a generic scent, nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;Results--I haven&#x27;t used this lotion in a long time, but it used to be my favorite. It always gave me great results, and I was never disappointed. The only reason I stopped using it is because I wanted to branch out and try more lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I noticed an immediate difference in my color after one tanning session! BE WARNED! When using this lotion for the first time (after using a weaker lotion) I recommend reducing your time you spend in the bed or you may get burnt! It&#x27;s what happened to me, but I also burn easily, so just know your skin!!</li>
            <li> Product gives good overall tan and has a nice smell.  Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like how watery this product is. Also the bronzed in there isn&#x27;t very good. Not terrible but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast!! Got it, noticed immediate results after use one. I typically don&#x27;t tan, but this makes it fun! It&#x27;s made me dark, a dream come true :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the burnt after smell, but it&#x27;s not a bug deal!! goes away quickly! Thank you Australian gold! :)</li>
            <li> Use for tanning indoor and out, nice smell will purchase this item again does not leave your skin feeling greesy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order for my own use, my niece asked me to order it for her.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t hear any complaints so I am assuming its good</li>
            <li> I bought this product then decided to look up reviews, noticed that green dot had bad complaints so I was nervous till it got here which I may add quickly, I opened and loved it, tanned last night and i only use loition on my legs but I&#x27;m darker I&#x27;ll say, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for YEARS and have mostly used Australian Gold. Their lotions keep getting better and better as time goes on.  I am fair skinned and burn easily.  I could see a great color within the first week (after 5 days of tanning).  The bronzer has helped me get a great tan - and the longer I&#x27;ve gone, the tan just gets better &amp; better. LOVE the color I have.  It&#x27;s tan, not orange - very natural looking.  The smell is pleasant - light and kind of flowery, but not at all overwhelming or too girly-scented.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the 30x - can&#x27;t wait to see how it works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this lotion is what it is described as. First of all, the bottle I received does not smell like berries. Also, I have been tanning a few times now with this lotion and haven&#x27;t noticed any results. I think this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for the price. I got super dark very quickly! Buy 2 bottles though if you tan a lot, went through this in less than a month. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I took this to the beach and I had such a great tan! ****You do need a really good base tan before using this product, other wise you will burn!.*** This took my tan to a much deeper level and left my skin silky smooth. I love the products from Australian Gold, I have used them for years. They have different products that suits everyone&#x27;s skin and are affordable.</li>
            <li> I like it alot as it is nice on the skin. The price was great compared to the tanning salons.</li>
            <li> I have tanned for at least 8 years and I now have my own tanning bed and Australian Gold is always number one!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! smells good and makes my body look tanner  &#x3D;) I use it for outdoor tanning not tanning beds!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was fair complicted and colored started showing within just a week of laying in the tanning bed with this lotion. It arrived quickly too. I will buy this product again when my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> This product I would recomend to anyone who is looking to build up a quick base. It smells better than most tanning lotions I have used in the past and I love that it has the bronzer without all the extra shimmer and tingle. I also recomend sinfully black to someone like me who love Australian Gold products.  I&#x27;ll be sure to order this again!</li>
            <li> Great starter lotion.  It creates a deep dark tan and the lotion absorbs well so It doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin after tanning.  The smell could be improved but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  Just a little organic.  I can over look this due to the great price and wonderful tan.</li>
            <li> This worked excellent on me, I am fair skinned ginger. Softens skin &amp; tans good but I didn&#x27;t care too much for the smell, it has the smell of most lotions AFTER you get out of the tanning bed. I recommend all AG products as they work great on any &amp; all skin types! :-) Candi</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with Devoted Creations White 2 Black Supre Advanced Bronzer Tanning Lotion... and the AG saved the day, so to speak. The Devoted Creations lotion is horrible, and the AG totally made up for that. It smells great in the bottle and still smells good after I tanned.&lt;br /&gt;The true brown color the bronzer leaves is very pretty and natural and lasted 3-4 days (even though I shower at least once daily). I was very happy with the product. I have always liked AG products but this is the FIRST lotion with a bronzer I have bought because I have always stayed away from them, not wanting a fake looking fake-bake.  :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this one though</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have ever used.  Bronzed my skin beautifully.  Would highly recommend it.  Also at the best price I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you much color.  I finally just used the rest of it on my face when tanning.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping! Amazing! Smells great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is the best tanning lotion I have ever used. For the price it is worth it though. I did break out and got a few pimples on my chest but my skin is very sensitive. And it seems really runny, like watered down or something I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s about but it does work overall I did get a nice tan from using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Helping me maintain my tan longer</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It does give a good tan.  It has a pleasant smell when applying it to your body.  I would recommend washing your hands after applying it to your body and before you tan.  It will color the palms of your hands.</li>
            <li> Never used this tanning lotion because I stopped going to the tanning bed. Risk is too high. Smells good though. May use it if I go to the lake etc.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion along with the Australian Gold Cheeky Brown as you could purchase both for a great price, they both can be used in the tanning aslon and outside, the smell is great, not that burnt skin smell, goes on so smoothly.  To purchase lotions in the tanning salon they are two times the price and you can only use in the salon.</li>
            <li> Works and smells great.</li>
            <li> This lotion is my go-to. Gets me SO dark!!! All of my friends now use it :)</li>
            <li> Bottle was half empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> I just got it today.  Leaving for Cancun Mexico in the morning.  Will write a review about this when I get back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/13/2012...I just got back.  First off this stuff super moisturizes.  It great to use even after you get out of the sun.  It does not leave any residue on the body it can be used before you go to bed as well. It dries quickly.  Where I was already tanned, arms/legs, I got dark.  chest and back where I wasnt that tanned I did burn a little but I didnt have the sun burned feeling.  My guess is if you do not have a good base tan don&#x27;t use this stuff because you will get hurt by the sun.  There is no SPF and it&#x27;s not water/sweatproof. My daughter had a better base tan than I did and she used it and got really dark with only two full days in the cancun sun.  If you have a base tan then this stuff is great.  Will I use this stuff  again ? Absolutely but only if I have a base tan.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good bronzer if you&#x27;re a beginner tanner and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a lotion. It gives a great color boost and doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky. The smell is nice as well. However, the after-tan-odor leaves something to be desired and it always left me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This does help boost my tan! I can tell! Planet fitness sells this exact same stuff for twice the price and even that is semi cheap for tanning lotion. Don&#x27;t pay 50 bucks. This is quality stuff for a crappy Walmart tanning lotion price</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the smell, cheap quality, zero tanning results.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. The bronzer definitely accelerates the tanning process; and the good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stain my hands. It doesn&#x27;t leave me an orange color. My only problem is that the bottle is kind of cheap and crackles and I struggle to squeeze the lotion out. I have to squeeze really hard and then sometimes it splatters out. A stupid complaint, I know, but the lotion itself seems to be working. I&#x27;m used to a higher end lotion, but so far this seems to be working as well for a 1/4 of the price. I would recommend this for new tanners, experienced tanners, and even men. The scent is berry-smells great</li>
            <li> The best tanning lotion out there. This stuff works and smells great! The only kind for me! Deff recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product! I didn&#x27;t tan for a week and lost my darkness. I bought this and started back. Day 1... Got my tan back! It&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> The product I received smelled extremely odd. I decided to use it anyway, not really knowing what it is supposed to actually smell like. After using it several times, I was not noticing a difference at all, and i broke out a little on parts of my body. I then researched and have found other reviewers mentioning the same thing! About the smell being strange, breaking out, etc. So beware when ordering. Maybe you will get lucky and receive the real deal.</li>
            <li> well if it is real then it is such a waste of time i get darker by not using it, i kindof wonder if its fake and has sunblock missed in it or something, the only good thing i can say about this product is that it smells good. my tanning salon tried to warn me about ordering stuff over the internet and i guess this is what iget for not listening.so is it real or fake? if its the real stuff no wonder it was so cheap if its the fake stuff list that its the knock of version so the buyer knows what they are getting there selves into! shoot people still by the walmart brand of of stuff and generic prescriptions just being honest about your product makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews AFTER purchasing this product, I got a little scared. Especially since everyone said not to order from Green Web. I received the package two days after I ordered it which was nice. I opened it and it looked fine. The next day I used it and it was okay then too. Just a little watery. It seemed to work though. I gave this 3 stars because I know there&#x27;s better tanning lotions out there, but what can you expect for $13?</li>
            <li> Produt provides great color to fair-skinned people like myself without looking fake. I would highly recommend this. Never had a tan last so long in my life!</li>
            <li> Great price. great product. The lotion is easy to apply smells good ect. You really do get your moneys worth out of it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the smell, but I did get good color with this lotion</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite tanning lotion. It doesn&#x27;t stink, and it works! I noticed a difference within one tan! And it&#x27;s so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> This product worked great. I use to go tanning without anything then I decided to try this and it made such a difference. It seemed like it improved the color and the smell was great. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the results of just using this after 3 times.  I started darkening after the first.  This lotion does a great job of bronzing. My daughter is using it now too and after a couple of sessions she is also gettng darker.</li>
            <li> Loved it! I tan easily anyway and this just helps ten times more! It gives that tan look you will just love</li>
            <li> Great product that doesn&#x27;t go on like custard and the bronzer doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothes either.  I&#x27;ve used Australian Gold products for years and this one turned me a nice brown without ever making me look orange.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> didnt like this. doesnt smell good and left me feeling very oily. you get what you pay for on this</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  It has a good smell and the bronzing results are great!  I&#x27;ll certainly be buying more of this product!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations but it&#x27;s more of a bronzer then dark. I would recommended it for someone who wanted to be bronze</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with freckles and this lotion works great for me. I know I should be wearing SPF2000 but let be realistic... I want a tan now and then. If you are light skinned like me, dont expect this lotion to work miracles. It will do what it says and give you an even tan better than any lotion I have ever used but it will take some time. I went on a cruise and used this the whole time. I never burned but I would tan 20 minutes on each side and then STOP. If the next day I felt I could handle 5 more minutes then I would add as needed. At the end of my trip I came home with a great tan and for the first time my friends and family actually admitted that I looked tan. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I only tan once a week but I feel like this helps me keep a nice hint of color.  No orange-y hue and not pale, just a nice bronze.  I was nervous the berry smell would be awful but once it&#x27;s applied I don&#x27;t even smell it.  It also goes on super well, not runny like others have mentioned.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  tan like I expected.</li>
            <li> It actually did nothing for me. I have been tanning indoor for a while now and used all sorts of products and I would not recommend sinfully black.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS.............ALWAYS LOVE THE X DEEP TANNING......USED MAYBE 3 TIMES, AND I AM BLACK.....JUST HAVE MORE TROUBLE GETTING TO THE POOL....BUT ONCE I DO, PUT MY TAN ON...............</li>
            <li> Label was skewed on bottle. Secondary sticker over original sku#... Not the real deal. The seal wasn&#x27;t even on the bottle, but oh! They were nice enough to put some scotch tape over the top of it instead. How stupid do you people think your customers are?? Do not buy.</li>
            <li> It was great and maximizes my tan! I feel fun and fresh. To get the best tanning results I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Australian gold makes great products for indoor tanning. This one has instant bronzers and it smells amazing. The bottle is smaller than expected but it is still a great value</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. I used to use a tanning lotion that was $40 a bottle. I was a little skeptical about buying a cheaper one because that usually means the quality is cheap. But I loved this. It smells good, it only took a week of tanning for me to get nice color, and its cheap! Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this yet, but it was recommended by my sister, who had some when we went on vacation a few weeks ago. My daughter used it around the pool and she got really dark in just a few days, so we ordered our own. We also have a tanning bed but haven&#x27;t used it for that yet either. Good price too!</li>
            <li> Love this indoor tanning lotion and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> It came in a timely manner and was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I got a beautiful color from this lotion, but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how kind of greasy it felt at first. Other than that, everything was great, including the smell, and the color I got from one week alone. Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, packaged nicely. It seems to be a fine product and the smell lasts and is quite good.</li>
            <li> It worked OK but I have used better. I would purchase again however.  Just wish it had a better bronzing agent</li>
            <li> This is the EXACT same lotion as JWOWW&#x27;s Black Bronzer. They both have the same scent and the same ingredients, but this is cheaper. I worked in a tanning salon briefly, and compared the ingredients on the bottles after noticing they both smelled the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent lotion. It&#x27;s cheap (even in salons), and it does the job. It is a bit thin and runny, but I liked that in the warmer months. I only gave it four stars, because I personally am not too crazy about natural bronzers. They tend to leave a yellow tint to my skin, as opposed to a DHA bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the people complaining that their lotion came without a seal, 99% of tanning lotions do not come sealed. I know from experience that a lot of salon owners sell tanning lotions online on the side for extra money. Don&#x27;t be so paranoid. All the product diversion stories come mostly from tanning lotion companies. I&#x27;m sure there are a few people who have done it, but I have never received a fake product. If you are that worried, buy a sample packet, and then compare it to what you have.</li>
            <li> ive had this product for over a year now &amp; use it about 2-3 x a week.  i use only a little bit &amp; it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I have tried much more expensive brands but always end up coming back to this one.  Works great.  Good color.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion i have ever used! To me it smells like PINK by Victoria&#x27;s Secret very girly very fruity</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing gives you deep dark tan even from the sun</li>
            <li> This lotion really works well on me. It smells great and leave my skin soft. It was hard for me to get a nice color but this lotion makes magic on my skin. After a few days applying it and staying in the pool for a couple of hours, my skin gets really dark bronze and looks wonderful, hidrated and soft. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Its ok, but deviously black is the best</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for both tanning beds and outdoors - just remember no SPF so be careful! Great bronze glow, no staining on hands, good scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion and at a great price</li>
            <li> Notice a different in just 2 days of using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, cheaper here than at the salon. Reached peak tanning with the product in about a week. Now need something stronger....</li>
            <li> It smells good.. and goes on well but I have not really seen much of difference form my other lotion but for the price I guess its okay</li>
            <li> This Is A Great Quality Tanning Lotion. The Smell Is Subtle And The Lotion Helps Enhance Color When Tanning. I&#x27;m Very Happy With My Tan :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Its ok not as good as I wanted it to be it was old feeling sticky feeling after tanning</li>
            <li> I dont feel or smell funny and it bronzes very well.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.  Loved it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great and non-greasy, but for obtaining a serious tan, I layer it with an oil. My skin tans very well and I figure the darker the better in Michigan summers. Unfortunately doesn&#x27;t have that Australian Gold signature scent, but a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn, but got a beautiful color.  i loved it and recommend it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. The bronzer isn&#x27;t really noticeable at all. I only know it has bronzer because when I shave my legs a little color comes out when I run the razor under the faucet. The smell is decent and it has a thick consistency. But it certainly feels like one of the more low quality lotions.</li>
            <li> Was very liquidity.... Not a good product at all</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion.  Smells great and gives a great tan.</li>
            <li> Good roduct, nice smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this product!!! It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t turn me orange after tanning every other day!!</li>
            <li> I have a base tan. I bought this hoping for additional color. After 5 tan sessions I have not noticed any additional color. Normally I can tan in the full sun for a couple of afternoons and get significant results that last more than a month. Unfortunately it is winter here in the NW so I have only the tan beds. This product did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing...I have not been to the tanning bed in a month and I still have a dark tint. I used this lotion for about a month everyday, it really lasts a long time and it smells so good! Not like most tanning lotions, defintiely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love all products from this company.</li>
            <li> best tanning lotion I have tried. Ull notice ur tan indoor or out door. I live in Hawaii and I use it outdoor and it works great with a australian gold SPF 4 over it</li>
            <li> Very liquidy, and has a very stong scent. Didn&#x27;t really help my tan get darker either. I would suggest to anyone to just spend the extra money on something you know will work great.</li>
            <li> Third time ordering this tanning lotion.  Really does help me attain a better tan after a long plateau.  Definitely one of my all time favorites, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell , you don&#x27;t burn and just develop a nice natural brown colour , realy moisturises the skin aswell no more dryy legs .</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold tanning lotions, this one is ok, but does give as good of tan as some of the others</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Unfortuantely I ordered a different lotion this time to see if I like it better, Black Storm 60x, Wish I had stayed with Australian Gold. This gives a nice brown color, and I really like the smell. Will be going back to this after, if not before, I finish the other product...</li>
            <li> Many other reviews spoke about instant color and a bronze glow after one use of this product. I never noticed an instant change. I don&#x27;t tan every day in an attempt to keep my skin from getting too dry so maybe that&#x27;s why it took a little longer to build color. But 3-4 times at week at 15-20 per session would give me one shade darker per week. And I&#x27;ve used this lotion every time. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy sticky feeling. It&#x27;s very light and thin too so a little goes a long way. In short, I did get darker but not as quickly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> smells good, not expensive. dont by lotion at the salon cuz its a huge rip off. This works well, smells good and gets me nice and bronze.</li>
            <li> I ordered it based on my requeat of dark bronzing lotion.....bottle looks like it should....does not!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not a change in my color at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a dark bronzing lotion...this is not it.</li>
            <li> Used this twice and already getting dark, love the Australian Gold line of tanning products but this my be my new favorite. Used JWOWW brown bottle and pink bottle but didn&#x27;t get these results</li>
            <li> I will always use this lotion! It&#x27;s definitely a great product that gives me the fullest tan possible.  Highly recommend.</li>
