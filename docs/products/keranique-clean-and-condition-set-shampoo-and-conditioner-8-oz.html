            <li>The hair is fuller and  has more body with this  shampoo and conditioner....</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather, the conditioner leaves so many tangles</li>

            <li>Love the product.  </li>

            <li>Love using these two products together.</li>

            <li>My hair is much more greasy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I continue to use it that I might see more of a difference</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love the commericials.</li>
            <li>Well, as the weeks (about 2-3) went on my hair was getting more and more course.</li>
            <li>it cost $20 more.  </li>
            <li>But when I use the shampoo  and conditioner I get compliments on how healthy my hair looks and it has a lot of body.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner .keep</li>
            <li>my hair looking healthy and makes it grow .</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product haven&#x27;t receu this shipment yet</li>
            <li>and i love it after you use it for the first day it makes your hair feel so good</li>
            <li>Conditioner leaves my hair nicely silky and full when blow-dried.</li>
            <li>working pretty good, but too soon to tell.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo for hair that is falling out or thin hair, great product.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much shampoo,  the conditioner i have bought before  good items.  </li>
            <li>strong smell</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo and conditioner in conjunction with the Keranique Follicle-Boosting Serum and have noticed a true difference and feel like I am winning the battle of thinning hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner does not seem to help my fine hair</li>
            <li>Let me just say that I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Does help if you have fine hair</li>
            <li>It has worked fabulously for me.</li>
            <li>My hair was bouncy, smooth and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>I got this &amp;#34;hair treatment&amp;#34; set as a free trial gift.</li>
            <li>I am very patient!!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for those of you who have the patience of Job!!!!</li>
            <li>I like the product, but the packaging is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>The one I bought from Amazon, however, is not the original Keranique product I am used to using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews online and buying from amazon with no hidden contract for refills each month, I&#x27;ve avoided all of the problems experienced by people ordering directly from the company.</li>
            <li>but i did not notice anything special with it..</li>
            <li>Scared me right off the product!</li>
            <li>Just as expected  Great</li>
            <li>when ever I&#x27;m ready to order more instead of keraniques&#x27; monthly payments.</li>
            <li>So refreshingly cool.</li>
            <li>It has no conditioning agents whatsoever, and the product is full of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Her hair has stopped falling out and now has more volume and is much healthier...</li>
            <li>too early to  tell but leaves hair nice  </li>
            <li>If you do they will charge the full size products to your card every two months.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any other hair product since I started since I really am happy with the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>After a quick research I found out they have thousands of ripped off customers like me trying to find  justice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and made my hair have body, shine, and volume.</li>
            <li>The very FIRST Time I used it my hair went from a mop to silky hair.</li>
            <li>Good quality shampoo - sulfate free - just a small dab lathers easily</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesnt weigh your hair down when you use it im also using the volume boosting pump spray and the minoxidil spray by keranique all great products it was worth it</li>
            <li>Before trying this product, I had experienced a great deal of hair loss particularly an area on top of my head that was badly thinning.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I question myself as to why I didn&#x27;t check Amazon first!  </li>
            <li>I cannot say that this will happen to everyone&#x27;s hair but very likely to people with more fine hair.</li>
            <li>so it is actually economical, too.  </li>
            <li>it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it well enough to write a review.</li>
            <li>it wad worth the money.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for about a month now, and she has reported that her hair feels clean and that it is not falling out as quickly or as much as it was.</li>
            <li>I store it upside down so the product comes out more easily.  </li>
            <li>I could tell after the first wash that it seemed thicker and shinier.  </li>
            <li>On 3rd purchase love it.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference with just the first time use.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I saw a difference, it made my hair look and feel a lot fuller.  </li>
            <li>Could be that it just stopped falling out, but pretty coincidental, if that is the case.  </li>
            <li>My mother ordered me the first set.</li>
            <li>and i believe it is bc of using this product consistently.</li>
            <li>You can tell the difference in first use.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to work on my hair and my hair appeared fuller.</li>
            <li>I tried the products in the trial period but returned the shampoo, conditioner, and spray because I really didn&#x27;t need them, I only need the regrowth treatment, in which I was able to purchase separately.  </li>
            <li>It takes about four months of continued use before I should see major results, this was even confirmed by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell most other products are inferior on the rare occasion that I use something else.</li>
            <li>Dry brittle hair and a skin rash that I have not been able to correct without help from my doctor.</li>
            <li>At this point, I would certainly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>When I finally used the shampoo and conditioner my hair started to fall out in huge amount.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much thicker and fuller since I started using this.</li>
            <li>I guess you really can&#x27;t believe everything you see on TV.</li>
            <li>I really like the products.  </li>
            <li>Cripes, I sound like a commercial!</li>
            <li>This product really do what they say is going to do on your hair.</li>
            <li>and it really does not make your hair grow.</li>
            <li>but I gotta say it really seems to do what it claims.</li>
            <li>you end up pulling out more hair with your wet comb through.</li>
            <li>It may take a while before I can really tell.</li>
            <li>I  really  </li>
            <li>I paid to much money for this item.</li>
            <li>As of yet I have not seen any very noticeable difference</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so I am really hoping that it will make a difference.</li>
            <li>What you need to ask yourself is do I really want hair or not?</li>
            <li>I got really scared and called their customer service.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown so much faster thid year</li>
            <li>I really can not rate this item, because it was ordered for my spouse and I have not had any feedback on the product.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>She mentioned that this product contains too much protein for my hair to handle and it was causing damage.</li>
            <li>I have never had so much hair come out in my brushes in years.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>Thanks my to wig.</li>
            <li>So this seems to be doing a decent job, so much so that I purchased her another bottle of the shampoo to use for another month.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any difference with this combo as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;It was highly recommended and I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll review the product again, once I finish the first shipment, thus far it seems to do what it promises.</li>
            <li>You can definitely tell the difference in the feel of your hair but as far as the volumizing and growth you cant tell a huge difference</li>
            <li>and I woke up my left part at the was bold</li>
            <li>It was obvious that a lot more hair fell out when I brushed it.</li>
            <li>and my body has to get rid of my old hair first in order to start growing new.</li>
            <li>It was because it raised my testosterone levels extremely high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and paid a high price for this.</li>
            <li>So far I really like the shampoo it does make my hair seem fuller.  </li>
            <li>In response to my concern I was assured that it&#x27;s a normal process</li>
            <li>SHAMPOO IS OK CONDITIONER DO NOT LIKE TO HEAVY AND LEAVES MY HAIR</li>
            <li>so I only wear wigs and weaves right now.  </li>
            <li>So it seems that it is doing a fine enough job, and I know individual results will vary.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one plus is that I did see new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the results of the new shampoo.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any new hair growth.</li>
            <li>The new packaging warns not to use together.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Since using this I have seen new hair growth and it makes the hair&lt;</li>
            <li>The areas where I was losing hair now had about two inches of new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Still too early to tell if this really does the trick, but so far, it seems to help avoiding hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I tried three different shampoos for thinning hair and this is the first one that \\&quot;seems\\&quot; to have worked.  </li>
            <li>First of all there are NO instant results.</li>
            <li>i have small patches on top of my head</li>
            <li>By the time I had my next hair appointment much of my hair was gone (thank goodness that I have hair extensions as well in my hair!)</li>
            <li>Way more than usual.</li>
            <li>really great on the hair-mine is waist long and the shampo really only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li>My 85 year old Mother has 6inches of new growth that took a year of using this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but was surprised at how small the bottles are verses the expense.</li>
            <li>I have very thin and fine hair and this shampoo and conditioner made my hair full and feels much thicker</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li>Si, far I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements with my hair.</li>
            <li>but still it is too early to rate this product.</li>
            <li>and as far as I know she likes it</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 65 year old mother whose hair is thinning in the front.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several weeks and really cannot tell the difference in my hair volume.  </li>
            <li>I am almost 60 years old.</li>
            <li>In one week of use of the products, the hair breakage completely stopped.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser has since put a conditioning treatment on my hair and filled in missing spots with my extensions.</li>
            <li>I purchased my 1st set of shampoo/conditioner straight from Keranique and it was almost double!  </li>
            <li>Good product but expensive.</li>
            <li>It good but expensive.</li>
            <li>Post partum hair loss has been halted thanks to this clean (dangerous chemical free) shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I was too lazy and not enough time to do the re-growth twice a day for more than 2 weeks and knew I would not commit to six months.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t start using it right the way due to traveling for couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Since then I have struggled to get my hair back to its normal condition.</li>
            <li>I know with time it will get back to normal.</li>
            <li>Due to Amazon having this for half the price that I paid I should not have any problems with this product and will be ordering more of the product.</li>
            <li>My hair is longer, but there isn&#x27;t new hair growth where I want it without using the Hair Regrowth Treatment religiously.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t heard anything more ridiculous then this in my entire life.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used the product once.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be noted that she has some medical conditions that require her to be on lots of medicine, oxygen, and she just got out of the hospital from being in ICU for nearly two months.</li>
            <li>to where I was having bare spots...</li>
            <li>After a while I went to a dermatologist who saw nothing apparent but asked if I had recently changed shampoos.  </li>
            <li>so hopefully I can remove my wigs and wear my natural hair soon, but I have one problem with this product it will grow your hair as long as you are using it daily</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Great buy!</li>
            <li> The best you can hope for is thicker if your comb doesn&#x27;t rip out every stand from the so called &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stripped the highlights of my hair even though it says it&#x27;s color safe</li>
            <li> I also would not spend any more money on their hair growth product.  </li>
            <li> love this product does every thing and more , And I tryed them all believe me .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I can afford to keep using it, it&#x27;s pricey for sure</li>
            <li> The hair is fuller and  has more body with this  shampoo and conditioner....</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather, the conditioner leaves so many tangles</li>
            <li> ** works like magic</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> I lost more hair using this product than most others</li>
            <li> more  </li>
            <li> Will order more when these are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love using these two products together.</li>
            <li> I love this product because the FDA would never approve this product if it did not work.</li>
            <li> It is fuller and  has more body.  </li>
            <li> It was an ok product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> If you have thinnig hair or just need more volume use this product.  </li>
            <li> and I Love IT!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it feels like my hair feels fuller more bounce</li>
            <li> im glad a tried it</li>
            <li> My hair is much more greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I continue to use it that I might see more of a difference</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love the commericials.</li>
            <li> Well, as the weeks (about 2-3) went on my hair was getting more and more course.</li>
            <li> it cost $20 more.  </li>
            <li> But when I use the shampoo  and conditioner I get compliments on how healthy my hair looks and it has a lot of body.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner .keep</li>
            <li> my hair looking healthy and makes it grow .</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product haven&#x27;t receu this shipment yet</li>
            <li> and i love it after you use it for the first day it makes your hair feel so good</li>
            <li> Conditioner leaves my hair nicely silky and full when blow-dried.</li>
            <li> working pretty good, but too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for hair that is falling out or thin hair, great product.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need much shampoo,  the conditioner i have bought before  good items.  </li>
            <li> strong smell</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner in conjunction with the Keranique Follicle-Boosting Serum and have noticed a true difference and feel like I am winning the battle of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does not seem to help my fine hair</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Does help if you have fine hair</li>
            <li> It has worked fabulously for me.</li>
            <li> My hair was bouncy, smooth and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> I got this &amp;#34;hair treatment&amp;#34; set as a free trial gift.</li>
            <li> I am very patient!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for those of you who have the patience of Job!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the product, but the packaging is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li> The one I bought from Amazon, however, is not the original Keranique product I am used to using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews online and buying from amazon with no hidden contract for refills each month, I&#x27;ve avoided all of the problems experienced by people ordering directly from the company.</li>
            <li> but i did not notice anything special with it..</li>
            <li> Scared me right off the product!</li>
            <li> Just as expected  Great</li>
            <li> when ever I&#x27;m ready to order more instead of keraniques&#x27; monthly payments.</li>
            <li> So refreshingly cool.</li>
            <li> It has no conditioning agents whatsoever, and the product is full of alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Her hair has stopped falling out and now has more volume and is much healthier...</li>
            <li> too early to  tell but leaves hair nice  </li>
            <li> If you do they will charge the full size products to your card every two months.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other hair product since I started since I really am happy with the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> After a quick research I found out they have thousands of ripped off customers like me trying to find  justice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and made my hair have body, shine, and volume.</li>
            <li> The very FIRST Time I used it my hair went from a mop to silky hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality shampoo - sulfate free - just a small dab lathers easily</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesnt weigh your hair down when you use it im also using the volume boosting pump spray and the minoxidil spray by keranique all great products it was worth it</li>
            <li> Before trying this product, I had experienced a great deal of hair loss particularly an area on top of my head that was badly thinning.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I question myself as to why I didn&#x27;t check Amazon first!  </li>
            <li> I cannot say that this will happen to everyone&#x27;s hair but very likely to people with more fine hair.</li>
            <li> so it is actually economical, too.  </li>
            <li> it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it well enough to write a review.</li>
            <li> it wad worth the money.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for about a month now, and she has reported that her hair feels clean and that it is not falling out as quickly or as much as it was.</li>
            <li> I store it upside down so the product comes out more easily.  </li>
            <li> I could tell after the first wash that it seemed thicker and shinier.  </li>
            <li> On 3rd purchase love it.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference with just the first time use.  </li>
            <li> After the first use I saw a difference, it made my hair look and feel a lot fuller.  </li>
            <li> Could be that it just stopped falling out, but pretty coincidental, if that is the case.  </li>
            <li> My mother ordered me the first set.</li>
            <li> and i believe it is bc of using this product consistently.</li>
            <li> You can tell the difference in first use.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to work on my hair and my hair appeared fuller.</li>
            <li> I tried the products in the trial period but returned the shampoo, conditioner, and spray because I really didn&#x27;t need them, I only need the regrowth treatment, in which I was able to purchase separately.  </li>
            <li> It takes about four months of continued use before I should see major results, this was even confirmed by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell most other products are inferior on the rare occasion that I use something else.</li>
            <li> Dry brittle hair and a skin rash that I have not been able to correct without help from my doctor.</li>
            <li> At this point, I would certainly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> When I finally used the shampoo and conditioner my hair started to fall out in huge amount.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much thicker and fuller since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I guess you really can&#x27;t believe everything you see on TV.</li>
            <li> I really like the products.  </li>
            <li> Cripes, I sound like a commercial!</li>
            <li> This product really do what they say is going to do on your hair.</li>
            <li> and it really does not make your hair grow.</li>
            <li> but I gotta say it really seems to do what it claims.</li>
            <li> you end up pulling out more hair with your wet comb through.</li>
            <li> It may take a while before I can really tell.</li>
            <li> I  really  </li>
            <li> I paid to much money for this item.</li>
            <li> As of yet I have not seen any very noticeable difference</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so I am really hoping that it will make a difference.</li>
            <li> What you need to ask yourself is do I really want hair or not?</li>
            <li> I got really scared and called their customer service.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown so much faster thid year</li>
            <li> I really can not rate this item, because it was ordered for my spouse and I have not had any feedback on the product.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> She mentioned that this product contains too much protein for my hair to handle and it was causing damage.</li>
            <li> I have never had so much hair come out in my brushes in years.</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> Thanks my to wig.</li>
            <li> So this seems to be doing a decent job, so much so that I purchased her another bottle of the shampoo to use for another month.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference with this combo as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;It was highly recommended and I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review the product again, once I finish the first shipment, thus far it seems to do what it promises.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell the difference in the feel of your hair but as far as the volumizing and growth you cant tell a huge difference</li>
            <li> and I woke up my left part at the was bold</li>
            <li> It was obvious that a lot more hair fell out when I brushed it.</li>
            <li> and my body has to get rid of my old hair first in order to start growing new.</li>
            <li> It was because it raised my testosterone levels extremely high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and paid a high price for this.</li>
            <li> So far I really like the shampoo it does make my hair seem fuller.  </li>
            <li> In response to my concern I was assured that it&#x27;s a normal process</li>
            <li> SHAMPOO IS OK CONDITIONER DO NOT LIKE TO HEAVY AND LEAVES MY HAIR</li>
            <li> so I only wear wigs and weaves right now.  </li>
            <li> So it seems that it is doing a fine enough job, and I know individual results will vary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one plus is that I did see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the results of the new shampoo.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any new hair growth.</li>
            <li> The new packaging warns not to use together.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Since using this I have seen new hair growth and it makes the hair&lt;</li>
            <li> The areas where I was losing hair now had about two inches of new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell if this really does the trick, but so far, it seems to help avoiding hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I tried three different shampoos for thinning hair and this is the first one that \\&quot;seems\\&quot; to have worked.  </li>
            <li> First of all there are NO instant results.</li>
            <li> i have small patches on top of my head</li>
            <li> By the time I had my next hair appointment much of my hair was gone (thank goodness that I have hair extensions as well in my hair!)</li>
            <li> Way more than usual.</li>
            <li> really great on the hair-mine is waist long and the shampo really only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> My 85 year old Mother has 6inches of new growth that took a year of using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but was surprised at how small the bottles are verses the expense.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair and this shampoo and conditioner made my hair full and feels much thicker</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> Si, far I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements with my hair.</li>
            <li> but still it is too early to rate this product.</li>
            <li> and as far as I know she likes it</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 65 year old mother whose hair is thinning in the front.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks and really cannot tell the difference in my hair volume.  </li>
            <li> I am almost 60 years old.</li>
            <li> In one week of use of the products, the hair breakage completely stopped.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser has since put a conditioning treatment on my hair and filled in missing spots with my extensions.</li>
            <li> I purchased my 1st set of shampoo/conditioner straight from Keranique and it was almost double!  </li>
            <li> Good product but expensive.</li>
            <li> It good but expensive.</li>
            <li> Post partum hair loss has been halted thanks to this clean (dangerous chemical free) shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I was too lazy and not enough time to do the re-growth twice a day for more than 2 weeks and knew I would not commit to six months.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start using it right the way due to traveling for couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Since then I have struggled to get my hair back to its normal condition.</li>
            <li> I know with time it will get back to normal.</li>
            <li> Due to Amazon having this for half the price that I paid I should not have any problems with this product and will be ordering more of the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is longer, but there isn&#x27;t new hair growth where I want it without using the Hair Regrowth Treatment religiously.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard anything more ridiculous then this in my entire life.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the product once.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be noted that she has some medical conditions that require her to be on lots of medicine, oxygen, and she just got out of the hospital from being in ICU for nearly two months.</li>
            <li> to where I was having bare spots...</li>
            <li> After a while I went to a dermatologist who saw nothing apparent but asked if I had recently changed shampoos.  </li>
            <li> so hopefully I can remove my wigs and wear my natural hair soon, but I have one problem with this product it will grow your hair as long as you are using it daily</li>
            <li> This shampoo/ conditioner  lasted me at least 4 -5 months so well worth the expense in the long run.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough.  </li>
            <li> it is really flat after using the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I am use to having long hair and would like to grow it back.</li>
            <li> Conditioner  left  my  hair dry and tangled</li>
            <li> It really works, my hair is very thin and the product has really helped.</li>
            <li> It does cause new hair to grow in time… with in a month I have seen new hair growth where hair was thin..</li>
            <li> To ship it back will cost the moon, unless you empty the bottles.  </li>
            <li> Be careful I started seeing blue spots in the corners of my eyes when using this product.</li>
            <li> I know it takes a long time before you see any improvements in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and fine</li>
            <li> It was my understanding that this is supposed to generate new hair growth or at least improve circulation for hair to potentially grow.</li>
            <li> Im still not sure it came very early for christmas for my mom</li>
            <li> I have been using other products such as boitin shampoo and conditioner and nioxin products.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair between daily and every other day.</li>
            <li> hair has been thinning over several years due to thyroid issues,&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li> It does tend to dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair dry.</li>
            <li> I do notice however, that it makes my hair very dry, not brittle just dry.  </li>
            <li> It have only been a little over a month since I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> really works on thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair never fell out during the time I spent in chemotherapy and radiation for inflammatory breast cancer.</li>
            <li> Shampoo left heavy film on hair.</li>
            <li> The next few times I purchased them from a &amp;#34;beauty supply&amp;#34; website and</li>
            <li> If only it made thick hair loss grow back as well, this product be a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Well, needless to say I stopped using it right away.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product and am sad to have to give it is such a poor rating.</li>
            <li> I have thinning flat hair and it gives it bounce, looks fuller and does not leave that really heavy, plastered to the head ,</li>
            <li> greasy look you can get with other products.  </li>
            <li> I do not enjoy having to take so long to wash and condition my hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo as well as the other products that go with it do work.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and nothing has stopped the breakage of my hair like this product.</li>
            <li> Dry like straw!!!</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about Keranique is the difficulty squeezing the shampoo bottle.  </li>
            <li> Definitely fixed my thin hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my very dry and not easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I have increased the use of conditioners and tried to keep the heat I use down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Works for hair loss due to menopause ladies!</li>
            <li> I also found that I have less hair loss when using the product.  </li>
            <li> hair is even be slightly dryer and frizzier.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Less hair in my brush</li>
            <li> But the items was not sealed tight and the shampoo and conditioner all leak out.</li>
            <li> My hair was SO dry, course and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> It was less messy to use.</li>
            <li> Have used as directed for three months, no significant difference noted.</li>
            <li> Leave a little in all day</li>
            <li> I also use the drops and yes they do tingle and it can also be a little irriatating to your skin.</li>
            <li> I came here to get the rest including the  8 little bottles of jump start serum.</li>
            <li> After I used it my hair felt a little fuller.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to get a refund the customer service representative was very rude and defensive, claiming that I agreed to pay $150 for this product when was putting an information for shipment and agreeing to terms and conditions (in tiny print).</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair so it felt like straw...  </li>
            <li> im missing hair.</li>
            <li> I see a difference, but it&#x27;s not a huge change in my hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner let my hair very limp until I used less.  </li>
            <li> My spit woulf condition my hair better than this crap!</li>
            <li> No more visible scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve witnessed no hair growth over the past three weeks</li>
            <li> thats why i gave it a 4( at least that what happen to me</li>
            <li> Scalp so dry it was itching like crazy....</li>
            <li> (are you serious Keranique people?), people need to file lawsuit against you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a teenager who got a bad haircut and wanted this shampoo to grow my hair back in a hurry, I am 73-years-old and have thinning hair on the sides and front of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> So after a short bad hair cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sad that they&#x27;re using such false advertising to stay in business.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get the shampoo and conditioner out of the bottles.</li>
            <li> my hair is still coming out &amp; just as thin as it alway&#x27;s was</li>
            <li> My hair began to  hair thin in February.</li>
            <li> Gives my thin hair body and volume.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin in the crown area..</li>
            <li> But for my finely thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very shady way Keranique uses to trick people into buying their very poor quality product.</li>
            <li> WEN HAIR PRODUCTS IS WHERE IT&#x27;S AT, POUR THIS CRAP DOWN THE DRAIN.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> Worse thing you will put in your hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product has some very bad side effects.</li>
            <li> Falling out like crazy and no physiologic reason could be found.  </li>
            <li> LOOKING DIRTY</li>
            <li> Dries it up so bad.</li>
            <li> Even worse, the company gives awful customer service.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product......</li>
            <li> Like the product but their customer service is the worst ever!</li>
            <li> Customer service for this company is the worst I have ever encountered.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, you do not need to buy this!</li>
            <li> I had terribly hair, falling out.</li>
            <li> One wash and I HATE the way it felt in my hair and how my hair felt after!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever use in my life, it&#x27;s  a scam.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and the price was very good.</li>
            <li> I like the product although I have it for a short time.  My hair looks healthier. I&#x27;ll review the product again, once I finish the first shipment, thus far it seems to do what it promises.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair so it felt like straw...  Scalp so dry it was itching like crazy.... Product did not work for me...</li>
            <li> Luv this product.  Works for hair loss due to menopause ladies!</li>
            <li> Good product but expensive. Don&#x27;t know if I will keep buying bc of the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, so I can&#x27;t review this product.</li>
            <li> When I use the Keranique products my hair feels thicker, fuller &amp; styles beautifully. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality shampoo - sulfate free - just a small dab lathers easily so it is actually economical, too.  Conditioner leaves my hair nicely silky and full when blow-dried.</li>
            <li> This product has been great for my hair - love it.</li>
            <li> Post partum hair loss has been halted thanks to this clean (dangerous chemical free) shampoo and conditioner.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> too soon ro report if product is working!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough.  I&#x27;m still losing hair.</li>
            <li> Not for me . Maybe will give it another try.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month I have seen a noticeable change in thickness and fullness of my hair. It has much more body.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  My hair is so much thicker and fuller since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I am noticing a thicker hair.</li>
            <li> It really works, my hair is very thin and the product has really helped.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for hair that is falling out or thin hair, great product.</li>
            <li> I love Keranique.  It has helped to restore my hair.</li>
            <li> I could tell after the first wash that it seemed thicker and shinier.  Also, I don&#x27;t seem to be losing as many hairs.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Keraniques are helpful! Love ordering through Amazon when ever I&#x27;m ready to order more instead of keraniques&#x27; monthly payments.</li>
            <li> I like it since I star used the product</li>
            <li> This is a SCAM! I am a hairdresser and all it is is Nioxin that deeply cleans out the pores of the hair shaft and Rogain for 4X the price. It WILL NOT make your hair grow faster or longer. The best you can hope for is thicker if your comb doesn&#x27;t rip out every stand from the so called &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;. My spit woulf condition my hair better than this crap!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller!</li>
            <li> hmmm. i will not know until I buy the second bottles</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair. I guess you really can&#x27;t believe everything you see on TV.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product has some very bad side effects. Dry brittle hair and a skin rash that I have not been able to correct without help from my doctor. If you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t use this product. The one plus is that I did see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and does exactly what it says</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Love the feel in my scalp. So refreshingly cool.</li>
            <li> Good for helping my hair loss</li>
            <li> I really like the products.  I have used it before and it really is great for volumizing.  I also found that I have less hair loss when using the product.  I am hoping that they will also help in regrowth of hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell the difference in the feel of your hair but as far as the volumizing and growth you cant tell a huge difference</li>
            <li> Love the product I like how my hair feels after I wash it.</li>
            <li> Like the product but their customer service is the worst ever! DO NOT buy from Keranique!</li>
            <li> Combined with the 3 step hair growth kit. Definitely fixed my thin hair. No more visible scalp. Plus it makes your hair feel like silk. On 3rd purchase love it.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is great.  Got my hair cut and my hairdresser wanted to know what was different.  I started out with the re-growth kit which this comes with.  I was too lazy and not enough time to do the re-growth twice a day for more than 2 weeks and knew I would not commit to six months.  Kept this stuff and when I saw the difference I go the larger size.  While not everyone has the same hair and might not work as well it is worth a try.  I have thinning flat hair and it gives it bounce, looks fuller and does not leave that really heavy, plastered to the head , greasy look you can get with other products.  The tingling scalp thing is nice feeling.  Cripes, I sound like a commercial!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so nice great product.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months. I can&#x27;t tell any difference my hair is still coming out &amp; just as thin as it alway&#x27;s was</li>
            <li> This product really do what they say is going to do on your hair. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It really works on thin hair.</li>
            <li> It is not what is advertised I use it did not like it. It stripped the highlights of my hair even though it says it&#x27;s color safe and it really does not make your hair grow.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 4 weeks and see no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is even be slightly dryer and frizzier.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent- thank u much</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair and this shampoo and conditioner made my hair full and feels much thicker</li>
            <li> Do not buy this shampoo and conditioner, as it is junk.  To ship it back will cost the moon, unless you empty the bottles.  It has no conditioning agents whatsoever, and the product is full of alcohol.  Customer service for this company is the worst I have ever encountered.  Take my adversity and save your money.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t even work well at all. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone having hair loss problems.  It has worked fabulously for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves my very dry and not easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Great duo set for your hair. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> wife likes it, so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Have used as directed for three months, no significant difference noted.</li>
            <li> I switched from Nioxin to Keranique hoping for a miracle.  After using Keranique for 5 months, I don&#x27;t see a big difference in hair loss.  I do find that it is more expensive though.  My hair does feel fuller, but I want a product that will lessen the hair I see on the floor and in the shower.  I also would not spend any more money on their hair growth product.  As someone said in an earlier review, you can get products like Rogaine a lot cheaper.  I liked their foam solution the best.  It was less messy to use.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the product once.  I saw a difference with just the first time use.  My hair was bouncy, smooth and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair ...</li>
            <li> Keranique is a good product, but after 2 months I have yet to see improvement in hair growth from the regrowth liquid.&lt;br /&gt;I know it can take up to 4 months, so will continue for another 2 mos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo &amp; conditioner, but my hair is no thicker or fuller.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need much shampoo,  the conditioner i have bought before  good items.  I think using biotin orally helps your hair too</li>
            <li> love this product does every thing and more , And I tryed them all believe me . People have even commented on my hair</li>
            <li> When I find something I like, they change it.  Didn&#x27;t like the results of the new shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great deal all around</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and conditioner. Works well.</li>
            <li> Be careful I started seeing blue spots in the corners of my eyes when using this product. It was because it raised my testosterone levels extremely high. Scared me right off the product!</li>
            <li> Made my hair frizzy and coarse. I didn&#x27;t notice any new hair growth. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter said this is the best! It makes her hair look so nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> I have just started using Keranique shampoo and conditioner.  So far I really like the shampoo it does make my hair seem fuller.  The conditioner does not seem to help my fine hair it is really flat after using the conditioner.  I like just&lt;br /&gt;using the shampoo and styling from that point.  It works best for me this way.</li>
            <li> I like Keranique volumizing shampoo and conditioner.  I do not enjoy having to take so long to wash and condition my hair.  It does tend to dry out my hair.  Every now and then I have to add a different conditioner to add moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but was surprised at how small the bottles are verses the expense. Don&#x27;t know if I can afford to keep using it, it&#x27;s pricey for sure but I gotta say it really seems to do what it claims.</li>
            <li> Just as expected  Great</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get and it dries out my hair....but smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t tell if my hair stopped falling out yet.</li>
            <li> The hair is fuller and  has more body with this  shampoo and conditioner....</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair dry. Loss of shine and vitality. Even worse, the company gives awful customer service.</li>
            <li> Horrible, you do not need to buy this! The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather, the conditioner leaves so many tangles you end up pulling out more hair with your wet comb through.</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell if this really does the trick, but so far, it seems to help avoiding hair loss.  It may take a while before I can really tell.</li>
            <li> This s*** works like magic</li>
            <li> 08-30-14&lt;br /&gt;I am using it and have been since about 3 weeks ago. Si, far I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements with my hair. I know it takes a long time before you see any improvements in my hair. I am very patient!!!</li>
            <li> Shorty after I started using these products, my scalp started itching constantly. After a while I went to a dermatologist who saw nothing apparent but asked if I had recently changed shampoos.  I switched back to what I was using before and the itching subsided.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Hope it does the trick for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I just started using it , it feels good but still it is too early to rate this product.</li>
            <li> Keranique Volumizing Shampoo-Conditioner 8 oz. for people who have thinning hair. This shampoo as well as the other products that go with it do work. I am sold on Keranique Shampoo and the Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with the speed in delivering these two items.</li>
            <li> Im still not sure it came very early for christmas for my mom its what she wanted. and as far as I know she likes it</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 65 year old mother whose hair is thinning in the front. She has been using it for about a month now, and she has reported that her hair feels clean and that it is not falling out as quickly or as much as it was. It was my understanding that this is supposed to generate new hair growth or at least improve circulation for hair to potentially grow. So it seems that it is doing a fine enough job, and I know individual results will vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that she has some medical conditions that require her to be on lots of medicine, oxygen, and she just got out of the hospital from being in ICU for nearly two months. So this seems to be doing a decent job, so much so that I purchased her another bottle of the shampoo to use for another month. At this point, I would certainly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what they claim.  I lost more hair using this product than most others</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product with great success. Her hair has stopped falling out and now has more volume and is much healthier...</li>
            <li> made my scalp sore. strong smell</li>
            <li> Conditioner works well. Leave a little in all day</li>
            <li> I have just started using it, but it sure makes my hair feel and look so much better!!  Am hoping I have good luck with it making my hair thicker!!  We will see!!</li>
            <li> I  really  like  the  product  and  will  continue  to  use  and  order  more  in  the  future.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo and conditioner.  My hair was getting thinner until I started to use this product.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Highly recommend these.  Will order more when these are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Babe</li>
            <li> I like the product, but the packaging is not user friendly.  It is very hard to get the shampoo and conditioner out of the bottles.</li>
            <li> When I received my on time. But the items was not sealed tight and the shampoo and conditioner all leak out. I paid to much money for this item. I reach out to the cell and they never contacted me back. I am going to contact Amazon and take care of this matter.</li>
            <li> wonderful product for your hair.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> 11/14/14- I’ve been using these products for about a month now.  After the first use I saw a difference, it made my hair look and feel a lot fuller.  I have very fine grade hair.  I do notice however, that it makes my hair very dry, not brittle just dry.  I have to oil it every day.  I have a hair disease so I only wear wigs and weaves right now.  I tried the products in the trial period but returned the shampoo, conditioner, and spray because I really didn&#x27;t need them, I only need the regrowth treatment, in which I was able to purchase separately.  It takes about four months of continued use before I should see major results, this was even confirmed by my dermatologist.  I understand this and hope for the best.  As of yet I have not seen any very noticeable difference but I do have hope.  I will be back in three months to tell my results.</li>
            <li> My neighbor recommended I try this product. It has made a difference in just 3 weeks. My hair is already feeling thicker and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent!</li>
            <li> Did not see an improvement in my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> very good product it has worked well. It does cause new hair to grow in time… with in a month I have seen new hair growth where hair was thin..</li>
            <li> THIS IS A S*** PRODUCT.  NOW THAT I&#x27;VE USED IT I&#x27;VE REALIZED I&#x27;VE BEEN HAD.  WEN HAIR PRODUCTS IS WHERE IT&#x27;S AT, POUR THIS CRAP DOWN THE DRAIN.</li>
            <li> too early to  tell but leaves hair nice  Have had good results with Keranique products.  Problem was using both the biotin and follical boosting serum...The new packaging warns not to use together.  I have called twice and no one can give me an answer.  I assume there was a problem or they wouldn&#x27;t  have gone to the expense of changing the packaging...The ingredients are the same.  Can anyone tell me what the problem is?  iIf there is a warning they should explain the problem...Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks and really cannot tell the difference in my hair volume.  I will continue to use and update my rating if things change.  My hair is very thin and fine so I am really hoping that it will make a difference.</li>
            <li> While I have not noticed my hair volume increasing, I bought it because my hair was thinning.  Falling out like crazy and no physiologic reason could be found.  I tried three different shampoos for thinning hair and this is the first one that \\&quot;seems\\&quot; to have worked.  I don&#x27;t have the handfuls coming out anymore.  Could be that it just stopped falling out, but pretty coincidental, if that is the case.  I think this shampoo helped.</li>
            <li> Love using these two products together.</li>
            <li> I am almost 60 years old. My hair began to  hair thin in February. My hair never fell out during the time I spent in chemotherapy and radiation for inflammatory breast cancer. I am a survivor now going on 3 years now. I have been using other products such as boitin shampoo and conditioner and nioxin products. The very FIRST Time I used it my hair went from a mop to silky hair. First of all there are NO instant results. My 85 year old Mother has 6inches of new growth that took a year of using this product. She only washes her hair 2x a week. I also use the drops and yes they do tingle and it can also be a little irriatating to your skin. What you need to ask yourself is do I really want hair or not? It takes dilegence and patience. My hair did not start falling out overnight and nether will be the regrowth happen overnight. I love this product because the FDA would never approve this product if it did not work. I wash my hair between daily and every other day. Do not go to their sight and do a trial sample. If you do they will charge the full size products to your card every two months. Read the fiine print and even if you do try to cancel they will talk to you until you are blue in the face. My mother ordered me the first set. I came here to get the rest including the  8 little bottles of jump start serum. I would highly recommend this for those of you who have the patience of Job!!!!</li>
            <li> I use Keranique Shampoo and conditioner and it is great!!  The one I bought from Amazon, however, is not the original Keranique product I am used to using. This must be a counterfeit version of the Keranique products.</li>
            <li> Gives my thin hair body and volume.</li>
            <li> I like it . Will order again. Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product ! Gives hair body and texture</li>
            <li> I got this &amp;#34;hair treatment&amp;#34; set as a free trial gift. I didn&#x27;t start using it right the way due to traveling for couple weeks. When I finally used the shampoo and conditioner my hair started to fall out in huge amount. I got really scared and called their customer service. In response to my concern I was assured that it&#x27;s a normal process and my body has to get rid of my old hair first in order to start growing new. I haven&#x27;t heard anything more ridiculous then this in my entire life. In addition to that they charged my credit card $84.94 because it was pass 30 days. When I tried to get a refund the customer service representative was very rude and defensive, claiming that I agreed to pay $150 for this product when was putting an information for shipment and agreeing to terms and conditions (in tiny print). This is a very shady way Keranique uses to trick people into buying their very poor quality product. After a quick research I found out they have thousands of ripped off customers like me trying to find  justice. I will keep disputing any charges they&#x27;re trying to put on my account and keep informing people about this rip off &amp;#34;hair treatment&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s very sad that they&#x27;re using such false advertising to stay in business.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference with this combo as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;It was highly recommended and I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I want to return the items.</li>
            <li> SHAMPOO IS OK CONDITIONER DO NOT LIKE TO HEAVY AND LEAVES MY HAIR LOOKING DIRTY</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner in conjunction with the Keranique Follicle-Boosting Serum and have noticed a true difference and feel like I am winning the battle of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> working pretty good, but too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about Keranique is the difficulty squeezing the shampoo bottle.  I store it upside down so the product comes out more easily.  The combination of the two products has revolutionized the condition of my hair.  It is fuller and  has more body.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> My hair has grown so much faster thid year and i believe it is bc of using this product consistently. My hair grew 1.5-2 inched this year ss compared to .5 inches last year and the only change ive made is this product.</li>
            <li> It was an ok product. my hair smelled good but i did not notice anything special with it.. i used it for about 1 month</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  I will be using it all the time now.  Very good product for thinning hair!</li>
            <li> Good product for fine hair. Have used the products for a year and plan on continuing.</li>
            <li> If you have thinnig hair or just need more volume use this product.  You can tell the difference in first use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product through keranique and I liked it well enough to write a review. It&#x27;s mild and made my hair have body, shine, and volume. However, I did  use their lift spray as well! This shampoo/ conditioner  lasted me at least 4 -5 months so well worth the expense in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and I Love IT!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been thinning over several years due to thyroid issues,&lt;br /&gt;got to where I was having bare spots...&lt;br /&gt;Since using this I have seen new hair growth and it makes the hair&lt;br /&gt;you do have bigger so the thinness is not as noticeable..&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s all I will use now!</li>
            <li> I really can not rate this item, because it was ordered for my spouse and I have not had any feedback on the product.</li>
            <li> I have experienced hair loss for over 8 years im only 28 i have small patches on top of my head were im missing hair. I have tried several different shampoos one was nioxin which didnt do anything. I have been using karanique for a week now and i love it after you use it for the first day it makes your hair feel so good it feels like my hair feels fuller more bounce it feels heaver now then what it did my hair has strengthen. This shampoo doesnt weigh your hair down when you use it im also using the volume boosting pump spray and the minoxidil spray by keranique all great products it was worth it im glad a tried it it wad worth the money. Im also taking biotin over the counter for my hair i currently bought a laser comb also its suppose to help with blood flow and strengthen the hair hope that works</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Best I can find so far.  I can really tell most other products are inferior on the rare occasion that I use something else.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried everything else to no avail. I am very satisfied with keranique from Amazon. I&#x27;ve read many reviews online and buying from amazon with no hidden contract for refills each month, I&#x27;ve avoided all of the problems experienced by people ordering directly from the company. If you have thinning hair, and have tried everything else, try keranique, from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had terribly hair, falling out. Karanique is strengthening it. I have had  a problem for 6 yrs. It definitely helps me</li>
            <li> I have only used the shampoo and conditioner for one week. Before trying this product, I had experienced a great deal of hair loss particularly an area on top of my head that was badly thinning. I am use to having long hair and would like to grow it back. In one week of use of the products, the hair breakage completely stopped. It is to soon to say that I am seeing hair growth. With the breakage stopping, I am convinced that my hair will regain the length I am use to. I may need to come back at a later date to let you know how well its working growth-wise. I have tried other products and nothing has stopped the breakage of my hair like this product. I am very happy with this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> NOT SO GREAT...OVERPRICED</li>
            <li> My hair is much more greasy and I&#x27;ve witnessed no hair growth over the past three weeks I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> After I used it my hair felt a little fuller.  I&#x27;m sure if I continue to use it that I might see more of a difference</li>
            <li> Shampoo left heavy film on hair. Used x 3 days. Stopped. Had a delayed allergic reaction (allergic dermatitis) and ended up in emergency room for IV steroids and antihistamines. Looking onto how to return it</li>
            <li> I read and followed the directions and have used the products for about 3 months.  I see no difference in my hair.  I&#x27;m not a teenager who got a bad haircut and wanted this shampoo to grow my hair back in a hurry, I am 73-years-old and have thinning hair on the sides and front of my scalp.  I could probably get the same results from a $4.00 bottle of volumizing shampoo from the drugstore.  If you have to use this for the rest of your life, then it doesn&#x27;t grow hair back.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I recommend it to anyone who has thinning hair. It really works. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product since it seemed to get mostly good reviews and I love the commericials. That is until I actually tried the product. At first it seemed to work on my hair and my hair appeared fuller. That lasted about 2 washes, and then it didn&#x27;t seem to be working as well. I continued to use it but just not every day. Well, as the weeks (about 2-3) went on my hair was getting more and more course. Let me just say that I have fine hair. I was noticing that my hair was getting dryer and didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; anymore. Thank goodness I was going to my hair dresser one day soon after and she noticed the problems as well. My hair was SO dry, course and hard to manage. I told her that I was using the product and she told me to stop immediately. She mentioned that this product contains too much protein for my hair to handle and it was causing damage. Well, needless to say I stopped using it right away. Since then I have struggled to get my hair back to its normal condition. I have increased the use of conditioners and tried to keep the heat I use down to a minimum. Over the course of a month after using then stopping the product my hair was breaking. I have never had so much hair come out in my brushes in years. By the time I had my next hair appointment much of my hair was gone (thank goodness that I have hair extensions as well in my hair!) My hair dresser has since put a conditioning treatment on my hair and filled in missing spots with my extensions. I know with time it will get back to normal. My WARNING here is that NOT every hair type is appropriate for this type of product and it would be a great idea to check with your hair dresser before trying it. I cannot say that this will happen to everyone&#x27;s hair but very likely to people with more fine hair. I really had high hopes for this product and am sad to have to give it is such a poor rating.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend swears by this stuff as she complains about her thinning and all I do is replace it for her birthday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Keranique shampoo/conditioner for about a year now.  I see a difference, but it&#x27;s not a huge change in my hair growth.  My hair is longer, but there isn&#x27;t new hair growth where I want it without using the Hair Regrowth Treatment religiously.  I haven&#x27;t used any other hair product since I started since I really am happy with the way my hair looks and feels. I purchased my 1st set of shampoo/conditioner straight from Keranique and it was almost double!  The next few times I purchased them from a &amp;#34;beauty supply&amp;#34; website and it cost $20 more.  I question myself as to why I didn&#x27;t check Amazon first!  Well, no question of where I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this!</li>
            <li> Worse thing you will put in your hair! It leaves your hair feeling like straw. Dries it up so bad. By the way no hair growth.</li>
            <li> One wash and I HATE the way it felt in my hair and how my hair felt after! Dry like straw!!! VERY Disappointed with this product......</li>
            <li> Worst product ever use in my life, it&#x27;s  a scam. I only use this product, I bought all of them,  within 2 weeks and I regret all my life, after using it the 2nd time and I woke up my left part at the was bold (are you serious Keranique people?), people need to file lawsuit against you. Thanks my to wig. Go hell keranique.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! My hair is thin in the crown area..But when I use the shampoo  and conditioner I get compliments on how healthy my hair looks and it has a lot of body.</li>
            <li> When I received the shampoo and conditioner, the shampoo wasn&#x27;t volumizing.  It was a scalp shampoo.  They are still a good product.</li>
            <li> i have been using shampoo and condition for 3 months and it really works,I am a afro american woman who has been wearing braids and weaves all my life, even thou my hair is growing and all my trouble spots is filling in I still feel as thou i have to wear a wig so hopefully I can remove my wigs and wear my natural hair soon, but I have one problem with this product it will grow your hair as long as you are using it daily but as soon as you stop your hair start falling out.  thats why i gave it a 4( at least that what happen to me everybody is different ) so i just stick with it becaase i want my hair back</li>
            <li> My hair is coming back!</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Shampoo is awesome.  Conditioner let my hair very limp until I used less.  Then it was perfect</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner .keep my hair looking healthy and makes it grow .</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using this product for 5 months. The areas where I was losing hair now had about two inches of new hair growth. I&#x27;m sold on this product</li>
            <li> I used this TWICE in my hair. It was obvious that a lot more hair fell out when I brushed it. Way more than usual. I do not recommend this to anyone. It won&#x27;t make your hair grow, you&#x27;ll just lose it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product. It has helped alot with my hair loss and my hair feels and looks fuller.</li>
            <li> The BEST shampoo I have ever used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and paid a high price for this. Due to Amazon having this for half the price that I paid I should not have any problems with this product and will be ordering more of the product. It really does grow my hair beautifully!!</li>
            <li> So after a short bad hair cut. It have only been a little over a month since I&#x27;ve been using. And I have to say it does work. It doesn&#x27;t grow drastically but it helps. Everyone is different. But for my finely thin hair. It&#x27;s has grew out about couple cm. I&#x27;ve notice a big difference as well.  If only it made thick hair loss grow back as well, this product be a 5 star.</li>
            <li> i believe it is helping my hair grow back.</li>
            <li> It good but expensive.</li>
            <li> Could not tell a difference between this and my regular product.</li>
            <li> Less hair in my brush</li>
            <li> Great for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Low suds from shampoo.  Felt like it  wasn&#x27;t  cleaning  my hair.  Conditioner  left  my  hair dry and tangled</li>
            <li> really great on the hair-mine is waist long and the shampo really only a small amount is needed. The conditioning is great leaves hair nice looking feeling well.</li>
            <li> Does help if you have fine hair</li>
            <li> Love the product haven&#x27;t receu this shipment yet</li>
    </ol>
