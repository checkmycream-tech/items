            <li>great, does what its supposed to do</li>

            <li>in all, a great product, though.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great battery life.</li>
            <li>The product works great and has a variety of features that make the trimmer versatile.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for the trimming of my Mustache and Beard.  </li>
            <li>found this one again and am happy.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this shaver, it looks very nice but does not cut well at</li>
            <li>Very nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very nice looking &amp; a well made product.</li>
            <li>Its easy because it cordless and trimmers are are the perfect size for the job.  </li>
            <li>Now for the good part: the bonus trimmer.</li>
            <li>Appears to be good quality.</li>
            <li>Looking at reviews and pictures on here this seemed like both a quality product and a good deal...</li>
            <li>I actually loved this.</li>
            <li>This is a really good trimmer, good adjustments and design however the battery lasts about about 10 minutes max.  </li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good motor.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression I was going with a good choice, but this Remington is subpar.</li>
            <li>He loved it.  </li>
            <li>WORKS GOOD AND CAME ON TIME</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s good about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s portable, fits snuggly in any toiletry bag</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>It is a great deal better than the Wahl trimmer I had, which died.</li>
            <li>Very Satisfied</li>
            <li>So, I think it is a great trimmer, but I wish it lasted more than two years.</li>
            <li>, it works SOOO much better than trying to use the full-size trimmer!</li>
            <li>This trimmer works great, I use it primarily as a beard stubble trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It looked like a nice shaver</li>
            <li>I liked the one I purchased two years ago</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is nice.</li>
            <li>It is a good buy for the most part, but I wanted something that could give me a 2 day shave look, not one day or three day.</li>
            <li>Nice to hold.  </li>
            <li>he requires his own shaver.  </li>
            <li>nice body, nice weight, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;i bought this unit many years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>He was always using my Remington so he bought his own trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all, it works great and holds a charge for a loooooong time -- I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice trimmer for the money, but I think Remington could have designed the combs better.</li>
            <li>This model has a more powerful motor and gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Actually the nose hair trimmer is very good, though it requires it&#x27;s own AA battery.</li>
            <li>It has a built-in battery, so don&#x27;t expect much more than 2 years lifespan.</li>
            <li>just some more overseas throwaway</li>
            <li>You will love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Most trimmers are plastic, but this one is so crappy it feels like it might break on the floor if I dropped it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, you&#x27;ll find something better.</li>
            <li>but maybe a yr at the most.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is okay, however.</li>
            <li>Seems ok.</li>
            <li>I have bought many, many items from AMAZON and never returned anything.  </li>
            <li>and I can assure you that is 1000 times better.</li>
            <li>In top of all is MADE in the USA.</li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it, but</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Like the feature of being able to plug in and use with cord if the battery isn&#x27;t charged.  </li>
            <li>We soon found it, it&#x27;s the same outstandng quality as years before, and now my husband and son are both very happy!</li>
            <li>I do use the spray lubricant on the blade, and have for many years on my Remington electric razor also.</li>
            <li>ok:</li>
            <li>hair cliper need more power dough...</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE REMINGTON BEARD AND MUSTACHE TRIMMER WITH THE BONUS NOSE AND EAR TRIMMER I WILL BY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li>I own a WORKING Remington shaver, that is older than the Braun, still with its original battery!!!</li>
            <li>Without going into too many details, I can say that this is working fine.</li>
            <li>But most importantly, it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li>I could have done better with a cheap Walmart shaver.</li>
            <li>Works easily.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend not to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly for trimming a full beard.  </li>
            <li>Quick posted.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally satisfied with everything.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>But liked it so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li>I liked that better than the different heads on this one because it stored more compactly with everything on one instrument.</li>
            <li>The price was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Precise.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>Battery life has been really good so far.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure he will get several years of good service from this Remington Trimmer.</li>
            <li>I should return it but do not have the original packaging and receipt.  </li>
            <li>I am truly impressed by this trimmer, it works well, and gets the job done better than most expensive trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li>I had grown my beard for about 3 weeks and then used this to make the line on my neck and clean it up.</li>
            <li>The thing poses as stainless steel but is actually very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly with a shipping label allowing me to return the original trimmer</li>
            <li>One full charge gets me through about 5-6 shaves over a period of about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>just keeps going &amp; going!&amp;#34; Remington is a product that we have only good things to say about.</li>
            <li>Only good thing is you can use the trimmer corded so its charge doesn&#x27;t matter;</li>
            <li>I have a full beard that I need to keep neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor, but it does not cut close enough for me.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer has 4 different length of grooming combs, and they provide a good choice of lenghts to choose from.  </li>
            <li>The Mb 1000 is adequate as a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Main unit Works better then $60 norelco...&lt;br /&gt;Nose</li>
            <li>However, if the product breaks the very first time you try to use it</li>
            <li>Firstly, the thing doesn&#x27;t even work!</li>
            <li>This one is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I rarely need to plug it in because of</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, happy with the trimmer, but will be more careful with the attachments in the future.</li>
            <li>But my two year old unit just burned out;  i like them so much more than the others on amazon, that i am just buying them again.</li>
            <li>my decepcion, im still using more my old hair trimeer for my bear</li>
            <li>Just snapped right off.</li>
            <li>He liked mine because it was so old but worked like new</li>
            <li>The MB-300 (now discontinued) had a small \\&quot;pop-up\\&quot; trimmer for sideburns that worked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days, but I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>In all other respects, though, I am very, very satisfied with this product.      </li>
            <li>I can trim faster and with more precision than ever before...and at only $35 its a steal.</li>
            <li>Once the hair was very short, I was able to use the with no guard against my skin without issue.</li>
            <li>The combs just snap on by pushing them onto the blade from the back or the top.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; approach just seems overall to be a better</li>
            <li>Use it consistently</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, the blade head came off of the trimmer and a plastic piece broke preventing reassembly.</li>
            <li>I have to cut my bear first with my hair trimmer, and then use this trimmer cause if i dont...</li>
            <li>Also be sure to keep a traditional razor with you, as this will not shave so close.</li>
            <li>The battery life seems to be very good and the wide T blade is great for edging my beard, but the combs are very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>I stated earlier my 30 year old made in the \\&quot;USA\\&quot; Remington is still working fine with its original battery.</li>
            <li>Could be improved with more power, sharper blades, a single adjustable length attachment, and some sort of deflection or catch guard for cut whiskers.</li>
            <li>The prior Remington model worked fine but now does not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>I use it to touch up my &#x27;stash after I trim with scissors, so I&#x27;m not asking much from it.</li>
            <li>This is a very versatile set of trimmers.</li>
            <li>Secondly, let me just say how cheap this thing is.</li>
            <li>The different attachments fit every need that my husband requires or should ever need in a trimmer.</li>
            <li>such cheaply made</li>
            <li>The blades on this one are much nicer and give a cleaner cut.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Very Robust and with a sleek design.  </li>
            <li>After much searching and hemming/hawing, I decided on this Remington.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
            <li>It helps me keep my sideburns straight and trimmed.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>not razor short but short enough, i do it every 3 days and battery life its great as well.</li>
            <li>This was better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Low sound.</li>
            <li>The maintenance instructions call for a few drops of \\&quot;trimmer of sewing machine oil into the blades\\&quot; every six months, but no oil of any kind is supplied with the unit.  </li>
            <li>So it seems it may be good for every other say type maintenance, but not the initial cut...    </li>
            <li>It cuts much better than other designs that use a rotary blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the guard covering the blades more like hair clippers or other beard trimmers that I have used.</li>
            <li>The battery life has diminished, but works fine as long as it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li>tried many others that were cheap and not nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>The added little trimmer that came with it is not the same good quality, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>The new trimmer is much heavier and overall much better made than the earlier one.</li>
            <li>If you have the previous model, Mb900, all the heads can be used on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than others I&#x27;ve used from this company and others as well.  </li>
            <li>However, i have to be sure to take it slowly with this, as even with full power, beard gets caught, hairs get stuck, face doesn&#x27;t get completely shaved.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend...</li>
            <li>The price was competitive and the product is high quality.</li>
            <li>would have bought something a little better</li>
            <li>USED item sold as NEW &#x3D;</li>
            <li>well anymore that is why bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I am 84 and it takes awile to start with a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I think will serve its limited purpose entirely adequately.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s facial hair is a little different, but this does a good job of neatly trimming and grooming mine.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and the first time I tried to use it the entire razor head fell off when I was changing the trimmer attachment.  </li>
            <li>After trying unsuccessfully to put this product back together and trying to call their 800 number (not open when I called), I am returning it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for a Conair trimmer which was about 6 years old with a battery that would no longer hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>rated the Remington 4 stars because I do like it but have only used it a couple times and it works very well and the quality seems good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with complete beard trimmer attachments too, BTW.  </li>
            <li>They look to be very well-made too, but I won&#x27;t comment on them further since I don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li>Not quite the quality of a professional class set of trimmers</li>
            <li>When you put the guard on this the blades are still completely exposed.</li>
            <li>nearly 7yrs ago.</li>
            <li>noticed the 10 minute battery life from the first week of the using this product so it wasn&#x27;t a matter of having this trimmer for a long time.</li>
            <li>I use this product nearly every day.  </li>
            <li>The battery life was consistent for as long as I had the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It tugs on your hairs, kind of rough on your face, takes a few passes to get everything, and one of the prongs broke</li>
            <li>The fit is snug and it is not easy to get the guards on and off.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is slightly too large and is harder to get a smooth trim on the lower edge of the mustache.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re only held on by two small fitting points on either side).    </li>
            <li>For those of us using it for basic trimming before shaving or simple sculpting of beards and mustaches, the trimmer is above adequate.</li>
            <li>Finally I have a mustache trimmer that is truly a high quality tool.  </li>
            <li>It charges very fast and holds the charge for a longer period of time than i expected.</li>
            <li>The trimmer options are rather limited and the trimmer has a wide head which takes some getting used to, but it makes a reliable, accurate cut.  </li>
            <li>I did a big research before buying a new trimmer for my - 3 times a week - beard trimming routine.</li>
            <li>I called Remington Customer Service and had a new trimmer in the mail the next day.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one because my clumsiness finally caught up to me and I dropped it on the on/off slider, which broke it.  </li>
            <li>This was not only surprisingly painful, but obviously incredibly ineffective.</li>
            <li>I have used Remington brand in previous years and have been very satisfied, although must admit this particular model is poor quality.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer for my van dyke, but I suspect the combs won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned about 5 trimmers in the last 6 years or so, and this one is by far the highest quality.  </li>
            <li>After much money spent, and timeless trips to the return line in stores.</li>
            <li>A while back my old Norelco beard trimmer finally gave out on me</li>
            <li>There the only trimmers my boyfriend uses when his old pair finally gave up after yrs of abuse</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is a great deal better than the Wahl trimmer I had, which died.</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> So, I think it is a great trimmer, but I wish it lasted more than two years.</li>
            <li> , it works SOOO much better than trying to use the full-size trimmer!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great, I use it primarily as a beard stubble trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It looked like a nice shaver</li>
            <li> I liked the one I purchased two years ago</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is nice.</li>
            <li> It is a good buy for the most part, but I wanted something that could give me a 2 day shave look, not one day or three day.</li>
            <li> Nice to hold.  </li>
            <li> he requires his own shaver.  </li>
            <li> nice body, nice weight, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;i bought this unit many years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> He was always using my Remington so he bought his own trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Not disappointed at all, it works great and holds a charge for a loooooong time -- I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer for the money, but I think Remington could have designed the combs better.</li>
            <li> This model has a more powerful motor and gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Actually the nose hair trimmer is very good, though it requires it&#x27;s own AA battery.</li>
            <li> It has a built-in battery, so don&#x27;t expect much more than 2 years lifespan.</li>
            <li> just some more overseas throwaway</li>
            <li> You will love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Most trimmers are plastic, but this one is so crappy it feels like it might break on the floor if I dropped it.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, you&#x27;ll find something better.</li>
            <li> but maybe a yr at the most.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is okay, however.</li>
            <li> Seems ok.</li>
            <li> I have bought many, many items from AMAZON and never returned anything.  </li>
            <li> and I can assure you that is 1000 times better.</li>
            <li> In top of all is MADE in the USA.</li>
            <li> Works OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it, but</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Like the feature of being able to plug in and use with cord if the battery isn&#x27;t charged.  </li>
            <li> We soon found it, it&#x27;s the same outstandng quality as years before, and now my husband and son are both very happy!</li>
            <li> I do use the spray lubricant on the blade, and have for many years on my Remington electric razor also.</li>
            <li> ok:</li>
            <li> hair cliper need more power dough...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE REMINGTON BEARD AND MUSTACHE TRIMMER WITH THE BONUS NOSE AND EAR TRIMMER I WILL BY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I own a WORKING Remington shaver, that is older than the Braun, still with its original battery!!!</li>
            <li> Without going into too many details, I can say that this is working fine.</li>
            <li> But most importantly, it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> I could have done better with a cheap Walmart shaver.</li>
            <li> Works easily.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend not to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly for trimming a full beard.  </li>
            <li> Quick posted.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally satisfied with everything.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> But liked it so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li> I liked that better than the different heads on this one because it stored more compactly with everything on one instrument.</li>
            <li> The price was fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Precise.</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> Battery life has been really good so far.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure he will get several years of good service from this Remington Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I should return it but do not have the original packaging and receipt.  </li>
            <li> I am truly impressed by this trimmer, it works well, and gets the job done better than most expensive trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li> I had grown my beard for about 3 weeks and then used this to make the line on my neck and clean it up.</li>
            <li> The thing poses as stainless steel but is actually very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly with a shipping label allowing me to return the original trimmer</li>
            <li> One full charge gets me through about 5-6 shaves over a period of about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> just keeps going &amp; going!&amp;#34; Remington is a product that we have only good things to say about.</li>
            <li> Only good thing is you can use the trimmer corded so its charge doesn&#x27;t matter;</li>
            <li> I have a full beard that I need to keep neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor, but it does not cut close enough for me.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer has 4 different length of grooming combs, and they provide a good choice of lenghts to choose from.  </li>
            <li> The Mb 1000 is adequate as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Main unit Works better then $60 norelco...&lt;br /&gt;Nose</li>
            <li> However, if the product breaks the very first time you try to use it</li>
            <li> Firstly, the thing doesn&#x27;t even work!</li>
            <li> This one is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I rarely need to plug it in because of</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, happy with the trimmer, but will be more careful with the attachments in the future.</li>
            <li> But my two year old unit just burned out;  i like them so much more than the others on amazon, that i am just buying them again.</li>
            <li> my decepcion, im still using more my old hair trimeer for my bear</li>
            <li> Just snapped right off.</li>
            <li> He liked mine because it was so old but worked like new</li>
            <li> The MB-300 (now discontinued) had a small \\&quot;pop-up\\&quot; trimmer for sideburns that worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days, but I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li> In all other respects, though, I am very, very satisfied with this product.      </li>
            <li> I can trim faster and with more precision than ever before...and at only $35 its a steal.</li>
            <li> Once the hair was very short, I was able to use the with no guard against my skin without issue.</li>
            <li> The combs just snap on by pushing them onto the blade from the back or the top.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; approach just seems overall to be a better</li>
            <li> Use it consistently</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, the blade head came off of the trimmer and a plastic piece broke preventing reassembly.</li>
            <li> I have to cut my bear first with my hair trimmer, and then use this trimmer cause if i dont...</li>
            <li> Also be sure to keep a traditional razor with you, as this will not shave so close.</li>
            <li> The battery life seems to be very good and the wide T blade is great for edging my beard, but the combs are very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I stated earlier my 30 year old made in the \\&quot;USA\\&quot; Remington is still working fine with its original battery.</li>
            <li> Could be improved with more power, sharper blades, a single adjustable length attachment, and some sort of deflection or catch guard for cut whiskers.</li>
            <li> The prior Remington model worked fine but now does not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I use it to touch up my &#x27;stash after I trim with scissors, so I&#x27;m not asking much from it.</li>
            <li> This is a very versatile set of trimmers.</li>
            <li> Secondly, let me just say how cheap this thing is.</li>
            <li> The different attachments fit every need that my husband requires or should ever need in a trimmer.</li>
            <li> such cheaply made</li>
            <li> The blades on this one are much nicer and give a cleaner cut.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Very Robust and with a sleek design.  </li>
            <li> After much searching and hemming/hawing, I decided on this Remington.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
            <li> It helps me keep my sideburns straight and trimmed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> not razor short but short enough, i do it every 3 days and battery life its great as well.</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Low sound.</li>
            <li> The maintenance instructions call for a few drops of \\&quot;trimmer of sewing machine oil into the blades\\&quot; every six months, but no oil of any kind is supplied with the unit.  </li>
            <li> So it seems it may be good for every other say type maintenance, but not the initial cut...    </li>
            <li> It cuts much better than other designs that use a rotary blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the guard covering the blades more like hair clippers or other beard trimmers that I have used.</li>
            <li> The battery life has diminished, but works fine as long as it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li> tried many others that were cheap and not nearly as good.  </li>
            <li> The added little trimmer that came with it is not the same good quality, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> The new trimmer is much heavier and overall much better made than the earlier one.</li>
            <li> If you have the previous model, Mb900, all the heads can be used on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than others I&#x27;ve used from this company and others as well.  </li>
            <li> However, i have to be sure to take it slowly with this, as even with full power, beard gets caught, hairs get stuck, face doesn&#x27;t get completely shaved.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> The price was competitive and the product is high quality.</li>
            <li> would have bought something a little better</li>
            <li> USED item sold as NEW &#x3D;</li>
            <li> well anymore that is why bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I am 84 and it takes awile to start with a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I think will serve its limited purpose entirely adequately.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s facial hair is a little different, but this does a good job of neatly trimming and grooming mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the first time I tried to use it the entire razor head fell off when I was changing the trimmer attachment.  </li>
            <li> After trying unsuccessfully to put this product back together and trying to call their 800 number (not open when I called), I am returning it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a Conair trimmer which was about 6 years old with a battery that would no longer hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> rated the Remington 4 stars because I do like it but have only used it a couple times and it works very well and the quality seems good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with complete beard trimmer attachments too, BTW.  </li>
            <li> They look to be very well-made too, but I won&#x27;t comment on them further since I don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li> Not quite the quality of a professional class set of trimmers</li>
            <li> When you put the guard on this the blades are still completely exposed.</li>
            <li> nearly 7yrs ago.</li>
            <li> noticed the 10 minute battery life from the first week of the using this product so it wasn&#x27;t a matter of having this trimmer for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this product nearly every day.  </li>
            <li> The battery life was consistent for as long as I had the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It tugs on your hairs, kind of rough on your face, takes a few passes to get everything, and one of the prongs broke</li>
            <li> The fit is snug and it is not easy to get the guards on and off.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is slightly too large and is harder to get a smooth trim on the lower edge of the mustache.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re only held on by two small fitting points on either side).    </li>
            <li> For those of us using it for basic trimming before shaving or simple sculpting of beards and mustaches, the trimmer is above adequate.</li>
            <li> Finally I have a mustache trimmer that is truly a high quality tool.  </li>
            <li> It charges very fast and holds the charge for a longer period of time than i expected.</li>
            <li> The trimmer options are rather limited and the trimmer has a wide head which takes some getting used to, but it makes a reliable, accurate cut.  </li>
            <li> I did a big research before buying a new trimmer for my - 3 times a week - beard trimming routine.</li>
            <li> I called Remington Customer Service and had a new trimmer in the mail the next day.</li>
            <li> I bought a new one because my clumsiness finally caught up to me and I dropped it on the on/off slider, which broke it.  </li>
            <li> This was not only surprisingly painful, but obviously incredibly ineffective.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington brand in previous years and have been very satisfied, although must admit this particular model is poor quality.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer for my van dyke, but I suspect the combs won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned about 5 trimmers in the last 6 years or so, and this one is by far the highest quality.  </li>
            <li> After much money spent, and timeless trips to the return line in stores.</li>
            <li> A while back my old Norelco beard trimmer finally gave out on me</li>
            <li> There the only trimmers my boyfriend uses when his old pair finally gave up after yrs of abuse</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take off a single strand of facial beards.</li>
            <li> Nothing more disappointing than receiving a defective product from a well known manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The MB1000 has truly been a complete waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t vouch for longevity as I havent had it long enuf.  </li>
            <li> However, the battery holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> i dont like long hair</li>
            <li> Long runtime.  </li>
            <li> The MB1000 is an absolute POS compared to the MB300 (and by POS, I don&#x27;t mean \\&quot;point of sale\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco trimmer for years (so long I don&#x27;t even remember the model!).  </li>
            <li> a point of interest I just disposed of a 25 year old Braun shaver with a bad battery, no parts available.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few months though, so we&#x27;ll see how the battery life holds up in the future.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Three years later, I still use the MB-300 (discontinued) on my sideburns (with the cord attached constantly because the battery is dead).</li>
            <li> I had it previously but an earlier model.</li>
            <li> I finally made him give up an inexpensive Remington trimmer, I paid  less than $15 for it</li>
            <li> I got this to replace the previous version of the same trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This one only comes with two heads whereas the previous model came with three.  </li>
            <li> Simply, the battery would not hold a charge (even for 24 hours after initial charging per the instructions), and I was never able to use the product, so the rating is for a defective condition and not user experience.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a zero star rating, but it seems that it is not possible to give less than one star on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I read carefully all the reviews and decided to go with it.</li>
            <li> I tried charging it multiple times - still dead.</li>
            <li> I had was aged and no longer working as it once did.</li>
            <li> The little moustache comb that it comes with is so sharp Homeland Security should classify it as a potential weapon.</li>
            <li> I tried other well known products, only to find out I&#x27;ve wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> They fit very tightly, as they should, but that makes them difficult to remove without twisting the blade itself.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to reach the source of those pesky nose and ear hairs.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t us the other attachment with it either.</li>
            <li> retired and subsequently grew a small beard as lots of us retirees do</li>
            <li> In all, buy this over any of the other $30 trimmers out there.</li>
            <li> The other products I bought were of poore quality and broke after a month or two.  </li>
            <li> I was so accustomed to the dial-like length adjustment comb on the old Norelco that getting used to the detachable comb guides for this one are little too hard to adjust to.  </li>
            <li> One attachment had broken &amp; another piece had been misplaced &amp; although it still works &amp; we never expected it to last</li>
            <li> Hard to believe that a big name like Remington would sell</li>
            <li> My only complaint:</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I remember the attachments falling off as I used it</li>
            <li> This item was previously used and it had black hair on the blades and inside the packaging.</li>
            <li> But the head snapped off after less than a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very odd to me, but perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t be to other who are used to this style.    </li>
            <li> The packaging looked original but the product had been used before and for that I am disappointed as I am a PRIME member</li>
            <li> But that little cordless trimmer was like an energizer battery-&amp;#34;it</li>
            <li> and I always have trouble not twisting the blade head when trying to remove the combs.</li>
            <li> The smaller mustache blade cuts so poorly I will now have to replace it.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a lot of mileage out of the few dollars you spend on this item.  </li>
            <li> I am tired of throwing out the cheaper ones that don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Feels heavy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this shaver a few years ago and never had a problem.</li>
            <li> I had same exact trimmer for about 4 years until battery went bad!</li>
            <li> The blade heads are interchangeable by giving them a small twist and they unlock.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, the blade guards are held in place by two clips behind the blade.</li>
            <li> So to sum it up, it fails at what it&#x27;s designed to do and is a cheap, flimsy piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I used to use a hair cutting kit with much larger attachments.</li>
            <li> The stand is horrible and shaver don&#x27;t easily fit.  </li>
            <li> CONS: Pulls thick and wavy type whiskers.</li>
            <li> Bought a new $30 Norelco one and am so disappointed with it that I&#x27;m going to buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so dull and the little motor is so weak that it doesn&#x27;t even trim my beard!</li>
            <li> It was a scary thing to because it had already bit me on the previous attempt.</li>
            <li> ; height options are just too shallow for me.</li>
            <li> Rather than actually cutting my beard it just grabbed onto single hairs and ripped them out.</li>
            <li> No good</li>
            <li> Poor quality control on Remington&#x27;s part, I guess.</li>
            <li> I was wrong on both assumptions.</li>
            <li> I will try another Remington model and if this fails I will then give up on Remington.</li>
            <li> Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I guess that is not so bad for a product these days.  </li>
            <li> Mediocre design and terrible blades</li>
            <li> And it was the base part that broke, so the</li>
            <li> Speaking of the detachable guides, I think the recharging base that came with the unit would have been nicer if it had a place to store the attachments -- without it, they sit in a plastic bag in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As others mentioned, the battery is also horrible.</li>

            <li> I would not recommend this shaver, it looks very nice but does not cut well at all&lt;br /&gt;I suppose you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> This is good for Beard which I don&#x27;t have but not for mustache which I do! Also, the attachments are not well constructed.</li>
            <li> The Mb 1000 is adequate as a trimmer. I use it to touch up my &#x27;stash after I trim with scissors, so I&#x27;m not asking much from it. It has a built-in battery, so don&#x27;t expect much more than 2 years lifespan. I bought it to replace a cheaper unit that used AA batteries. It had a 2 year life span too. Now for the good part: the bonus trimmer. It is small enough to reach the source of those pesky nose and ear hairs. It cuts much better than other designs that use a rotary blade.</li>
            <li> This item was previously used and it had black hair on the blades and inside the packaging. The packaging looked original but the product had been used before and for that I am disappointed as I am a PRIME member and I buy almost EVERYTHING from Amazon. I will think twice before purchasing from Amazon.     USED item sold as NEW &#x3D; No good</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a Conair trimmer which was about 6 years old with a battery that would no longer hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I rated the Remington 4 stars because I do like it but have only used it a couple times and it works very well and the quality seems good.&lt;br /&gt;As a point of interest I just disposed of a 25 year old Braun shaver with a bad battery, no parts available. I own a WORKING Remington shaver, that is older than the Braun, still with its original battery!!! It was made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am editing this review because after only 19 months the battery is failing to hold a charge!! They tell me the battery can not replaced because its soldered in. Also if I could get the battery it might cost about $35.00 This is just some more overseas throwaway junk.&lt;br /&gt;As I stated earlier my 30 year old made in the \\&quot;USA\\&quot; Remington is still working fine with its original battery.</li>
            <li> This the best trimmer that I have ever had. I had it previously but an earlier model. Had it for about 3 years. Battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge vary well anymore that is why bought a new one. You will love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days, but I am very impressed.  Finally I have a mustache trimmer that is truly a high quality tool.  The \\&quot;bonus ear trimmer\\&quot; is a totally separate battery-powered unit that is not the quality tool that the mustache trimmer is, but I think will serve its limited purpose entirely adequately.  My only complaint: The maintenance instructions call for a few drops of \\&quot;trimmer of sewing machine oil into the blades\\&quot; every six months, but no oil of any kind is supplied with the unit.  In all other respects, though, I am very, very satisfied with this product.      It comes with complete beard trimmer attachments too, BTW.  They look to be very well-made too, but I won&#x27;t comment on them further since I don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li> This is a present, but came in a timely manner. Appears to be good quality.</li>
            <li> This is a very versatile set of trimmers. I like the fact that I can trim the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving. Not quite the quality of a professional class set of trimmers but it&#x27;s a great value. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Without going into too many details, I can say that this is working fine. I like having the separate nose and ear trimmer, too. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned about 5 trimmers in the last 6 years or so, and this one is by far the highest quality.  I can trim faster and with more precision than ever before...and at only $35 its a steal.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great, I use it primarily as a beard stubble trimmer.  Battery life has been really good so far.  I have only been using it for a few months though, so we&#x27;ll see how the battery life holds up in the future.  One full charge gets me through about 5-6 shaves over a period of about 2 weeks.  I would give it 5-stars, but I feel the designers should have also made it fully operational through the charging cord.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot before buying this product. I read carefully all the reviews and decided to go with it. I can report that this is the best Remington I have ever owned. It charges very fast and holds the charge for a longer period of time than i expected. I recommend this product to everyone without any reserve. I do not regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> A while back my old Norelco beard trimmer finally gave out on me so I thought I&#x27;d try a different one. Looking at reviews and pictures on here this seemed like both a quality product and a good deal...I was wrong on both assumptions. Firstly, the thing doesn&#x27;t even work! It&#x27;s so dull and the little motor is so weak that it doesn&#x27;t even trim my beard! This is after charging it fully of course. Rather than actually cutting my beard it just grabbed onto single hairs and ripped them out. This was not only surprisingly painful, but obviously incredibly ineffective. Secondly, let me just say how cheap this thing is. The pictures suggest that Remington made an effort to give us a sleek, sturdy trimmer. The thing poses as stainless steel but is actually very cheap plastic. For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything mind-blowing here but this is just inexcusable. It&#x27;s like when people put fancy looking plastic hubcaps on cheap cars, it&#x27;s just unnecessary and embarrassing. Most trimmers are plastic, but this one is so crappy it feels like it might break on the floor if I dropped it. So to sum it up, it fails at what it&#x27;s designed to do and is a cheap, flimsy piece of crap. I ended up just buying the newest version of my Norelco and I&#x27;ll stick with them after this experience.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly. It looked like a nice shaver but there was only one problem....it didn&#x27;t work.  I tried charging it multiple times - still dead. Poor quality control on Remington&#x27;s part, I guess. Amazon was great about returning it and I received a prompt refund.</li>
            <li> No the greatest. I had grown my beard for about 3 weeks and then used this to make the line on my neck and clean it up. All it did was pull my neck hair out constantly. I had to use my hair clippers with no guard to cut it short, then come at it with this. It was a scary thing to because it had already bit me on the previous attempt. Once the hair was very short, I was able to use the with no guard against my skin without issue. So it seems it may be good for every other say type maintenance, but not the initial cut...    Also don&#x27;t like how the guards are used with this. I&#x27;m used to the guard covering the blades more like hair clippers or other beard trimmers that I have used. When you put the guard on this the blades are still completely exposed. It&#x27;s very odd to me, but perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t be to other who are used to this style.    Overall I would not purchase this trimmer again. Onward and upward!</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer for my van dyke, but I suspect the combs won&#x27;t last long. The battery life seems to be very good and the wide T blade is great for edging my beard, but the combs are very difficult to remove. The blade heads are interchangeable by giving them a small twist and they unlock. The combs snap onto the blade heads and I always have trouble not twisting the blade head when trying to remove the combs. The combs just snap on by pushing them onto the blade from the back or the top. They fit very tightly, as they should, but that makes them difficult to remove without twisting the blade itself. This is a nice trimmer for the money, but I think Remington could have designed the combs better.</li>
            <li> There the only trimmers my boyfriend uses when his old pair finally gave up after yrs of abuse i knew i had to find them or nothing else would do!</li>
            <li> stopped working after 2 years.  I guess that is not so bad for a product these days.  Before that , it performed well.</li>
            <li> I travel weekly and this trimmer has held up for over a year.  Still cuts close.  The battery life has diminished, but works fine as long as it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how this thing works as a \\&quot;beard trimmer,\\&quot; since I don&#x27;t use it for that purpose, but what I will say is that it does NOT work for trimming sideburns. In fact, I have yet to find any use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my trusty Remington MB-300 began to die, I bought the Remington MB1000 as a replacement. The MB1000 is an absolute POS compared to the MB300 (and by POS, I don&#x27;t mean \\&quot;point of sale\\&quot;). I was hoping to use this for trimming sideburns. The MB-300 (now discontinued) had a small \\&quot;pop-up\\&quot; trimmer for sideburns that worked great. The MB1000, however, does NOT work for sideburns; it can shorten hair, but doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to make \\&quot;edges\\&quot; or shorten sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later, I still use the MB-300 (discontinued) on my sideburns (with the cord attached constantly because the battery is dead). The MB1000, meanwhile, sits in a drawer...useless. As others mentioned, the battery is also horrible. The MB1000 has truly been a complete waste of money for me. Hopefully, you&#x27;ll find something better.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer. Remington is the only brand of trimmers that I have bought for my husband. I finally made him give up an inexpensive Remington trimmer, I paid  less than $15 for it nearly 7yrs ago. One attachment had broken &amp; another piece had been misplaced &amp; although it still works &amp; we never expected it to last but maybe a yr at the most. But that little cordless trimmer was like an energizer battery-&amp;#34;it just keeps going &amp; going!&amp;#34; Remington is a product that we have only good things to say about. This trimmer is very nice looking &amp; a well made product. The different attachments fit every need that my husband requires or should ever need in a trimmer. And I&#x27;m sure he will get several years of good service from this Remington Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington brand in previous years and have been very satisfied, although must admit this particular model is poor quality. The plastic trim lengths break when you try to change them. The trimmer itself is okay, however.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace the previous version of the same trimmer.  This model has a more powerful motor and gives a great shave.  This one only comes with two heads whereas the previous model came with three.  If you have the previous model, Mb900, all the heads can be used on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than others I&#x27;ve used from this company and others as well.  Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> I actually loved this. But the head snapped off after less than a year. Just snapped right off. While I was using it. Wasn&#x27;t applying pressure to it, didn&#x27;t drop it.  And it was the base part that broke, so the I can&#x27;t us the other attachment with it either. Hard to believe that a big name like Remington would sell such cheaply made products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update: I thankfully kept the product info sheet, and saw that there was a 2-year warranty on the product. I returned it and had a replacement in one week. Hopefully, this one will last...)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning to operate it but it&#x27;s working.Seems ok.I am 84 and it takes awile to start with a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The smaller mustache blade cuts so poorly I will now have to replace it.  I should return it but do not have the original packaging and receipt.  The prior Remington model worked fine but now does not hold a charge.  The model no longer is made.  I will try another Remington model and if this fails I will then give up on Remington.</li>
            <li> retired and subsequently grew a small beard as lots of us retirees do&lt;br /&gt;works great, does what its supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;no complaints, would buy again</li>
            <li> I like the rechargeable battery. It is a great deal better than the Wahl trimmer I had, which died. The new trimmer is much heavier and overall much better made than the earlier one. It does take a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> This is a really good trimmer, good adjustments and design however the battery lasts about about 10 minutes max.  Only good thing is you can use the trimmer corded so its charge doesn&#x27;t matter; which is what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the 10 minute battery life from the first week of the using this product so it wasn&#x27;t a matter of having this trimmer for a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery does not hold any charge so it has to be plugged in before every use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four different trimmers and all of them are only a fart in a whirlwind compared to this one.  A Great trimmer.  You&#x27;ll get a lot of mileage out of the few dollars you spend on this item.  Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> Nothing more disappointing than receiving a defective product from a well known manufacturer.  Simply, the battery would not hold a charge (even for 24 hours after initial charging per the instructions), and I was never able to use the product, so the rating is for a defective condition and not user experience.</li>
            <li> Well, this is the second for me.  I liked the one I purchased two years ago so well, that when it died I ordered another of the same model.  So, I think it is a great trimmer, but I wish it lasted more than two years.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for years until I burned it up using it in europe. Bought a new $30 Norelco one and am so disappointed with it that I&#x27;m going to buy this again. The blades on this one are much nicer and give a cleaner cut. I have a full beard that I need to keep neatly trimmed. My Norelco gives me split ends on my beard which irritate the hell out of me. Anyway, this is nice. My only complaint is that I remember the attachments falling off as I used it (they&#x27;re only held on by two small fitting points on either side).    In all, buy this over any of the other $30 trimmers out there. I&#x27;ve used three by now (Norelco, Wahl, Remington) and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the first time I tried to use it the entire razor head fell off when I was changing the trimmer attachment.  After trying unsuccessfully to put this product back together and trying to call their 800 number (not open when I called), I am returning it for a full refund.  I have bought many, many items from AMAZON and never returned anything.  However, if the product breaks the very first time you try to use it then it is simply defective and I should not have to pay for it.  I strongly recommend not to buy this product.  When I go to the store tomorrow to buy a replacement trimmer, I will not choose any Remington product.  I wanted to give this a zero star rating, but it seems that it is not possible to give less than one star on Amazon.</li>
            <li> works well. can&#x27;t vouch for longevity as I havent had it long enuf.  good price. no complaints about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift.  He absolutely loves it.  The price was competitive and the product is high quality.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a lot of options and appears to be built to last with low maintenance.  The trimmer options are rather limited and the trimmer has a wide head which takes some getting used to, but it makes a reliable, accurate cut.  The nose trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to cut all the hairs in there and takes some time to get the job done.  Maybe I;m not used to it as I have never used one before.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor, but it does not cut close enough for me.  It is a good buy for the most part, but I wanted something that could give me a 2 day shave look, not one day or three day.</li>
            <li> No Star rating for this trimmer I purchased cause it doesn&#x27;t take off a single strand of facial beards. So pissed</li>
            <li> I had same exact trimmer for about 4 years until battery went bad! But liked it so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li> Trimming combs could be smaller for a closer trim. Seems like a good motor.</li>
            <li> Very Robust and with a sleek design.  This product trim beard in a range of triple of its cost.</li>
            <li> The battery is shot after about a year. It tugs on your hairs, kind of rough on your face, takes a few passes to get everything, and one of the prongs broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have bought something a little better but it&#x27;s still kickin&#x27; so I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I did a big research before buying a new trimmer for my - 3 times a week - beard trimming routine. I was under the impression I was going with a good choice, but this Remington is subpar. Mediocre design and terrible blades&lt;br /&gt;I later bought a [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]] and I can assure you that is 1000 times better. In top of all is MADE in the USA. I rest my case</li>
            <li> Spend the money and buy this one. I am tired of throwing out the cheaper ones that don&#x27;t last. This one is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works OK. My prior trimmer had a dial that set the length of the trim. I liked that better than the different heads on this one because it stored more compactly with everything on one instrument. The beard trimmer is slightly too large and is harder to get a smooth trim on the lower edge of the mustache.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law - he loves it, which makes me happy! Delivered as promised!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco trimmer for years (so long I don&#x27;t even remember the model!).  Since that thing gave up the ghost (battery no longer held a charge), I decided to look around for a replacement.  After much searching and hemming/hawing, I decided on this Remington.  Not disappointed at all, it works great and holds a charge for a loooooong time -- I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two reasons that I docked a star on my rating --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I was so accustomed to the dial-like length adjustment comb on the old Norelco that getting used to the detachable comb guides for this one are little too hard to adjust to.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it, but the &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; approach just seems overall to be a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Speaking of the detachable guides, I think the recharging base that came with the unit would have been nicer if it had a place to store the attachments -- without it, they sit in a plastic bag in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product, though.  I especially liked the bonus Nose/Ear hair trimmer, it works SOOO much better than trying to use the full-size trimmer!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Nice to hold.  Feels heavy and sturdy.  Works easily.  Like the feature of being able to plug in and use with cord if the battery isn&#x27;t charged.  However, the battery holds a charge for a long time. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have an attachment for nose and ear trimmer.  Got one separately, so no big deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Use it consistently and it always does a terrific job.  Reasonably priced and it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
            <li> I use this product nearly every day.  It helps me keep my sideburns straight and trimmed.  I rarely need to plug it in because of it&#x27;s great battery life.</li>
            <li> The facial hair trimmer set I had was aged and no longer working as it once did. I purchased this as the price was reasonable. The product works great and has a variety of features that make the trimmer versatile. For those of us using it for basic trimming before shaving or simple sculpting of beards and mustaches, the trimmer is above adequate. Actually the nose hair trimmer is very good, though it requires it&#x27;s own AA battery.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this shaver a few years ago and never had a problem. He loved it.  It&#x27;s still going strong.  Now my son is at the age he requires his own shaver.  I tried to find this one in stores but always came up short.  I tried other well known products, only to find out I&#x27;ve wasted my money.  The other products I bought were of poore quality and broke after a month or two.  After much money spent, and timeless trips to the return line in stores. I finally decided to see if I could find the same one my husband purchased years ago.  Low and behold, there it was on Amazon.  The price was fabulous.  I decided to purchase it on line, and hope for the best.  We soon found it, it&#x27;s the same outstandng quality as years before, and now my husband and son are both very happy!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, the blade guards are held in place by two clips behind the blade. The fit is snug and it is not easy to get the guards on and off. The first time I used this product, the blade head came off of the trimmer and a plastic piece broke preventing reassembly. I called Remington Customer Service and had a new trimmer in the mail the next day. It arrived quickly with a shipping label allowing me to return the original trimmer I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, happy with the trimmer, but will be more careful with the attachments in the future. Also very impressed with Customer Service in the manner and efficiency they handled my problem.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 6 months of once a week use.  The battery does not charge, and it does not work even when it&#x27;s plugged in !!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! I got it as a Christmas gift for him and it arrived on time and undamaged!</li>
            <li> ...good set of clippers.  But my two year old unit just burned out;  i like them so much more than the others on amazon, that i am just buying them again.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to shave my head cause i dont like long hair works great leaves my hair perfect just the way i like it not razor short but short enough, i do it every 3 days and battery life its great as well. I totally recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected for the price. It cuts well and is well built. The added little trimmer that came with it is not the same good quality, but it does the job. I do use the spray lubricant on the blade, and have for many years on my Remington electric razor also.</li>
            <li> My husband has use this trimmer for years. He is very happy with its performance.  For the price it can not be beat.</li>
            <li> PROS: Precise. Light weight. Low sound. Long runtime.  CONS: Pulls thick and wavy type whiskers. Flings cut hair everywhere… be prepared for trimmings to go up your nose! Could be improved with more power, sharper blades, a single adjustable length attachment, and some sort of deflection or catch guard for cut whiskers.</li>
            <li> WORKS GOOD AND CAME ON TIME</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for the trimming of my Mustache and Beard.  I used to use a hair cutting kit with much larger attachments. Its easy because it cordless and trimmers are are the perfect size for the job.  Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Quick posted.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally satisfied with everything.&lt;br /&gt;Best price.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of workmanship.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has 4 different length of grooming combs, and they provide a good choice of lenghts to choose from.  Everything works as advertised.  The little moustache comb that it comes with is so sharp Homeland Security should classify it as a potential weapon.</li>
            <li> I received this product for Christmas some years ago and it worked like a charm.  I use it mostly for trimming a full beard.  The battery life was consistent for as long as I had the trimmer.  I bought a new one because my clumsiness finally caught up to me and I dropped it on the on/off slider, which broke it.  I had dropped it numerous times before, so it&#x27;s not a durability concern, just user error.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Everything it´s ok: nice body, nice weight, but when it comes to make &amp;#34;the thing&amp;#34; is 5 of 10. I have to cut my bear first with my hair trimmer, and then use this trimmer cause if i dont...OUCHHHH&lt;br /&gt;For my decepcion, im still using more my old hair trimeer for my bear</li>
            <li> update - battery died and no longer holds a charge, happened after 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought this unit many years ago and loved it.  after 5 yrs of abuse / dropping it finally cracked apart.  tried many others that were cheap and not nearly as good.  found this one again and am happy.</li>
            <li> I am truly impressed by this trimmer, it works well, and gets the job done better than most expensive trimmers on the market. What&#x27;s good about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s portable, fits snuggly in any toiletry bag and it&#x27;s rechargeable.But most importantly, it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> Main unit Works better then $60 norelco...&lt;br /&gt;Nose hair cliper need more power dough...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE REMINGTON BEARD AND MUSTACHE TRIMMER WITH THE BONUS NOSE AND EAR TRIMMER I WILL BY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I could have done better with a cheap Walmart shaver. The stand is horrible and shaver don&#x27;t easily fit.  It also don&#x27;t shave well. However, the nose/ear shaver works well..</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my son.  He was always using my Remington so he bought his own trimmer.  It wasn&#x27;t a Remington with titanium blades.  He liked mine because it was so old but worked like new so I got him the MB1000 because the one I had was discontinued.  He absolutly loves it.</li>
            <li> Not enough comb options for height of cut. I prefer a 1/2&amp;#34; comb. The 1/4&amp;#34; and 3/8&amp;#34; height options are just too shallow for me.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s facial hair is a little different, but this does a good job of neatly trimming and grooming mine. However, i have to be sure to take it slowly with this, as even with full power, beard gets caught, hairs get stuck, face doesn&#x27;t get completely shaved. Also be sure to keep a traditional razor with you, as this will not shave so close.</li>
