            <li>Excellent for.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>the best product for under a swim cap - hair stays moisturized and shielded from the chlorine!</li>
            <li>Very nice product!</li>
            <li>It did the job beautifully.</li>
            <li>Great hair protectant if you are going to be in salt water or in a pool.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for diving, kayaking (sea and river), camping at the beach and in some lakes too with great results as protection comes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair looks GREAT</li>
            <li>It has a good tack which is what aids in adhering to the hair cuticle.  </li>
            <li>and she was so happy about finding this magical product.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>My hair feels better already!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>, styles nicely and is highlighted.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant and positive experience.</li>
            <li>This product is rich and leaves a great barrier for the hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Rapid safe delivery.</li>
            <li>and it works fantastic!  </li>
            <li>as it air dries it doesn&#x27;t get all frizzy. :)</li>
            <li>It also held the curl much better.</li>
            <li>I could easily run a comb through it.  </li>
            <li>The product washes out easily</li>
            <li>and my hair loooked fine afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The instructions on the bottle say to warm it in your hands, and it certainly spreads easier when I do that.  </li>
            <li>, it was so silky smooth</li>
            <li>Obviously I don&#x27;t use a lot of styling products, LOL, but I decided to give this a try to see if I could protect my hair from the elements.  </li>
            <li>They keep my hair bounce and smooth.</li>
            <li>It works really well to protect my nice swim suit: remove the chloride smell and keep it in shape.</li>
            <li>It seems to work well, as my hair is in good shape and not dried by the chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I have loved every Kerastase products I have used.</li>
            <li>I slathered it on before I went in the ocean and my hair washed clean no problem.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my hair before we go out to the pool, and my hair stays nice and soft, plus</li>
            <li>The Aqua-Seal made it feel soft and it looked more shiny.</li>
            <li>When you put this product on, do not go out shopping as it really does not make you look tooo pretty!  </li>
            <li>My stylist recommended wetting my hair first and then putting the product throughout, and then putting on my swim cap.</li>
            <li>I was anxious to get my own product to be able to use this summer, especially at the pool and beach.</li>
            <li>I have been trying many similar products but non-as effective and last longing as this one; you just add a small amount and you will immediately feel the softness effect and the clean scent.</li>
            <li>Nothing really helped.</li>
            <li>This really works to protect your straightened hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been long and healthy all of my adult life.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend Summer Solutions Suit Solutions.</li>
            <li>(Somehow, I feel that 3 pumps is still too little for long hair, but so far, my hair looks fine, so I did not use more than 3 pumps).</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised how much I like this product.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, so am also using a pump or two to protect my hair from the sun when I&#x27;m not swimming.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money, worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and my hair remained soft and minimized damage.  </li>
            <li>When I got out of the pool after my first use, not only was my hair NOT dry and matted</li>
            <li>I will take the trouble to use good products that help preserve my hair while I am outdoors everyday!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it takes a few minutes to distribute it evenly through long hair, and you won&#x27;t look ready to go out to the club once it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li>Left it shiny and soft after I washed my hair.</li>

            <li> I love this product but I still haven&#x27;t received my purchase</li>
            <li> My hair has been long and healthy all of my adult life. A few weeks ago I added swimming laps to my daily fitness routine. The exercise was great, but the effect on my hair was BRUTAL! After a few days in the chlorinated pool my hair had the texture of matted hay, I could barely drag a brush through it, and my once vibrant color took on a brassy orange tinge. My hairdresser was mortified when she saw it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a variety of solutions, including both retail products and homemade hacks. Nothing really helped. Although the price seemed staggering for the amount of product, I decided to try Kerastase Soleil Aqua-Seal. Wow! What a difference! When I got out of the pool after my first use, not only was my hair NOT dry and matted, it was so silky smooth I could easily run a comb through it.  Once I showered and shampooed (with Ultra Swim) my hair actually felt as if it had been deep conditioned. What a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those that complain that it&#x27;s too much trouble or makes your hair look oily after application must not be as desperate as me. It&#x27;s true that it takes a few minutes to distribute it evenly through long hair, and you won&#x27;t look ready to go out to the club once it&#x27;s in. But it does coat the hair with a protective seal that will save years of growth from utter destruction. If that&#x27;s what you need, look no further. Add to cart and swim on!</li>
            <li> This product was touted in a magazine as being a barrier for the hair against the chlorine in swimming pools. I used it as directed, and my swim cap wouldn&#x27;t stay on and I had to wash my hands with soap and water. Too much trouble.</li>
            <li> Excellent for. Swimmers, my husband loves it!!!!  We&#x27;re using it for 4 weeks and our hair looks and feels a lot shinier and softer</li>
            <li> Protected my hair during a swim and conditioned it as well. Left it shiny and soft after I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> Rapid safe delivery. Very pleasant and positive experience. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought it to protect my hair from the sea water when I went scuba diving a few months ago. It did the job beautifully. I slathered it on before I went in the ocean and my hair washed clean no problem.</li>
            <li> I use four pumps for my just-past-shoulder length hair.  The instructions on the bottle say to warm it in your hands, and it certainly spreads easier when I do that.  It coats my hair well and I have not had any green in my blonde highlights in the three months I have been using it (I swim 3-4 times a week).</li>
            <li> I wear Kerastase when I am expose to the sun boating, fishing and swimming and it works fantastic!  It keep my hair protected</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how much I like this product. I am a scuba instructor and in the sun and ocean all day. (Noooo, I am not complaining!)  Obviously I don&#x27;t use a lot of styling products, LOL, but I decided to give this a try to see if I could protect my hair from the elements.  At the beginning of the day I squirt a dab in my hand and run it through my hair and wear a bandana, repeat if needed later in the day. My hair hasn&#x27;t gotten nearly as dry and faded as it did before I used this product.</li>
            <li> Great hair protectant if you are going to be in salt water or in a pool.  Like others have commented it is thick and your hair will look greasy so it is truly meant for water activities.  I used it while diving for a week and my hair remained soft and minimized damage.  The product washes out easily</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is like a serum for your hair that protects it from the sun, saltwater &amp; pools. I have been trying many similar products but non-as effective and last longing as this one; you just add a small amount and you will immediately feel the softness effect and the clean scent. I have been using it for diving, kayaking (sea and river), camping at the beach and in some lakes too with great results as protection comes.&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend that has long and messy hair (she always complaints about it when we go camping at the beach) so I gave some of this aqua-seal and she was so happy about finding this magical product.</li>
            <li> the best product for under a swim cap - hair stays moisturized and shielded from the chlorine!</li>
            <li> I just got two of these bottles from the Kerastase website.  I will keep a stock of this product since I am a daily swimmer.  This product is rich and leaves a great barrier for the hair.  I use a swim cap and did not find this product to be trouble. It has a good tack which is what aids in adhering to the hair cuticle.  After swimming I follow with Malibu Swimmers Shampoo and conditioner than I add a Kerastase deep conditioner.  My hair looks GREAT, styles nicely and is highlighted.  I will take the trouble to use good products that help preserve my hair while I am outdoors everyday!  Worth the money, worth the trouble.  When you put this product on, do not go out shopping as it really does not make you look tooo pretty!  Just for swimming! ha,ha,ha!</li>
            <li> Very nice product! Smells nice. I apply it to my hair before we go out to the pool, and my hair stays nice and soft, plus as it air dries it doesn&#x27;t get all frizzy. :)</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair before swimming in the pool. It seems to work well, as my hair is in good shape and not dried by the chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use: 2 pumps and spread over the hair. I use 3 pumps for my long hair (Somehow, I feel that 3 pumps is still too little for long hair, but so far, my hair looks fine, so I did not use more than 3 pumps). The cream gives the hair a waxy coat, but my hair doesn&#x27;t look too greasy for me to feel embarrassed on my way to gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After swimming, I wash my hair w/ Kerastase Bain 2 shampoo and Nutritive Masquintense. They keep my hair bounce and smooth. So far, I have loved every Kerastase products I have used. This one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I also highly recommend Summer Solutions Suit Solutions. It works really well to protect my nice swim suit: remove the chloride smell and keep it in shape.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my hair before swimming to protect my color. My stylist recommended wetting my hair first and then putting the product throughout, and then putting on my swim cap. I think it helps make my color last longer, even when I am swimming three times a week.</li>
            <li> I swim several days a week and started using this to protect my hair.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks, but it seems to do the job.  I live in Florida, so am also using a pump or two to protect my hair from the sun when I&#x27;m not swimming.  My hair feels better already!</li>
            <li> I used my daughter&#x27;s while on a cruise in April. My hair was dry and felt almost like straw. The Aqua-Seal made it feel soft and it looked more shiny. It also held the curl much better. I was anxious to get my own product to be able to use this summer, especially at the pool and beach. I love it!</li>
            <li> This really works to protect your straightened hair.  I went swimming in the ocean 4 days in a row with it and my hair loooked fine afterwards.  Kerastase is way to go with straightened hair anyway.</li>
