            <li>That said, this one comes from a company with a great reputations for organice products and the smell is so light an refreshing, it feels like you are applying sunshine to your face.</li>
            <li>I trust John Masters products because I believe them to be safe and they are organic and you can&#x27;t do better than that !</li>

            <li>My face felt very comfortable after using it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>I have very problematic skin, and this is one product that applies easily and makes my skin feel very good.</li>
            <li>Very light and absorbs quickly...really love it.</li>
            <li>I love it for that alone.</li>
            <li>Nourishing Oil 2 fl oz (59 ml)]] (which I also love)</li>
            <li>Some instructions would have been better..</li>
            <li>Hopefully with continued use I will see more of an</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>My skin looks okay.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love using a product that is Organic</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I really like John Masters Organics products and this face serum is as great as all the others.  </li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used in a long time though!</li>
            <li>it does a good job of treating the skin in a positive manner</li>
            <li>Love the light texture, not sticky or smelly.</li>
            <li>I still have a nearly full bottle and nothing to do with it!</li>
            <li>If you go easy a bottle lasts just over a month.</li>
            <li>Tried and true :)</li>
            <li>and it seems like it&#x27;s helping me with some fine lines.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth and smell citrus-like.</li>
            <li>I just pat on a light layer (one pump) all over my face before the rest of my skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it every night and like the light but rich feel on skin.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any significant improvements.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>It leaves the face feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This serum absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cellex-C High potency serum is a FAR superior vitamin C product if you are looking for one.  </li>
            <li>The product came in good shape and just as I expected.</li>
            <li>IT SAYS IT WILL, HELPS TO KEEP THOSE WRINKLES IN-CHECK AND KEEPS MY SKIN LOOKING FRESH AND YOUTHFUL.  </li>
            <li>I always use this and people always tell me that I have such nice skin.</li>
            <li>As I said before it only is a little bit moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>and I didnot stop right away.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I wash my face and before the makeup as well as</li>
            <li>right before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>Received it recently, I guess cant tell much yet, but to be honest not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>Does feel natural, and smells nice, but what I do not like is the fact that vit C percentage is not mentioned, and you dont really know what you are really getting.</li>
            <li>Also, for a moisturizer that completely absorbs and makes skin look AMAZING, try the original Clinique dramatically different face lotion.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I do like this face serum very much.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and natural and doesn&#x27;t hang around on your face all day.</li>
            <li>I am willing to shell out money, but I expect to see visible results.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating, makes your face look Dewey and glowing!</li>
            <li>As with all JM skin products, this one smells really good, and not in a cloying, heavy way.</li>
            <li>I will be going back to using Le Mieux vita-c serum, which really does absorb into the skin and shows greater improvement in brightness and clarity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It glides on very nicely and I haven&#x27;t had any kind of bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li>It eventually fades, but it is strong initially.</li>
            <li>I have very high standards when it comes to anti-aging products.  </li>
            <li>I am really looking for product that reduces fine lines and acne scars, and I didn&#x27;t notice difference after using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I got this from The Whole Food store.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a light moisturizer, altho some might not find it to be moisturizing enough for that.</li>
            <li>I will most likely go back to that for my vitamin C needs.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am in my 40s with fairly straightforward skin - not too greasy, not too dry.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend told me it smells like the camping section of Walmart (lol) because it has a vaguely citronella-esqe scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to smell it as you&#x27;re putting it on, but then dissipates over the next hour.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderfully light moisturizer that I can use every day or every other day without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I only use organic products on my face, neck, &amp; body so this product is my first choice for the skin &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>Not a very good moisterizer, more like just a serum.</li>
            <li>am in my mid-20s and am starting to see more dryness in my skin and fine little wrinkles on my eyes and forehead, and I&#x27;ve noticed that this smooths them out very nicely and keeps my skin from getting red and irritated, even in the cold!</li>
            <li>Maybe you need to use it longer to see any difference, but then I just feel like I am completely gambling with my money.</li>
            <li>if 1 pump is supposed to be enough for your whole face or not.</li>
            <li>Stopped using it yesterday and my skin feels soft again with the breakouts clearing up.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list for this item is wrong, the first ingredient is actually aloe vera juice, followed by sunflower seed oil and rose flower water.</li>
            <li>Basically, science says that we don&#x27;t need to spend a ton of money on \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; moisturizers because very few of them do much more than simple pharmacy moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light in texture, but a small pump of the serum goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I only use organic skin care products, and this seemed nice, but not good enough to buy repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Other vitamin C serums are higher priced.</li>
            <li>After using a very expensive face cream for a few months with no results, I was very happy to switch to this product as my new daily face care product!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to using this serum, unlike many other purportedly natural skincare I&#x27;ve used in the past (e.g. Korres).</li>
            <li>which I hear is crazy good too.</li>
            <li>My skin felt a little itchy right away</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with my regular moisturizer (I use Sephora&#x27;s brand mattifying daily moisturizing lotion with SPF in the day, and Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin night cream at night).</li>
            <li>No long lists of unreadable ingredients like some of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products have.</li>
            <li>This product does NOT absorb quickly as the reviews say, in fact, it hardly absorbs at all.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received it recently, I guess cant tell much yet, but to be honest not crazy about it. Does feel natural, and smells nice, but what I do not like is the fact that vit C percentage is not mentioned, and you dont really know what you are really getting. Before used to use Obagi vit C serums, will go back to it once this one is over</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and smell citrus-like. Not sure if it&#x27;s really working, but I would like to think it is. Very light feeling. Not a very good moisterizer, more like just a serum.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!  I add one drop of jojoba oil, otherwise it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough. I &#x27;ve noticed improvements in my skin!</li>
            <li> This is a light citrusy product that makes me happy when I put it on my face. Basically, science says that we don&#x27;t need to spend a ton of money on \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; moisturizers because very few of them do much more than simple pharmacy moisturizers. That said, this one comes from a company with a great reputations for organice products and the smell is so light an refreshing, it feels like you are applying sunshine to your face. I love it for that alone. (And, I suppose, kudos to the perfumers who did the balancing of the essential oils!) If you go easy a bottle lasts just over a month. If you double it up with the [[ASIN:B001943US0 john masters organics Pomegranate Facial Nourishing Oil 2 fl oz (59 ml)]] (which I also love) it goes even longer.  I am in my 40s with fairly straightforward skin - not too greasy, not too dry. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the product. The product came in good shape and just as I expected. Also, the product came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Oily and isn&#x27;t effective!</li>
            <li> I only use organic skin care products, and this seemed nice, but not good enough to buy repeatedly. I am really looking for product that reduces fine lines and acne scars, and I didn&#x27;t notice difference after using the entire bottle. Maybe you need to use it longer to see any difference, but then I just feel like I am completely gambling with my money.</li>
            <li> My skin is brown, dry with some dark patches here and there. I had a kick ass Vitamin C serum but when I ran out of it, tried to use this one. It was not too moisturizing.. I still had to put cream on after it. Some instructions would have been better.. if 1 pump is supposed to be enough for your whole face or not.I ended up using 2 pumps and then my face cream I have been using for 3 months without any issues. My skin felt a little itchy right away and I had small breakouts on my face and neck. I tired using lesser serum but the same thing.     I had breakouts from a serum by Ole Henriksen and I didnot stop right away. They just got worse and it took my skin months to get back to normal..    Stopped using it yesterday and my skin feels soft again with the breakouts clearing up. I still have a nearly full bottle and nothing to do with it! The saving grace is that it wasn&#x27;t scary pricey.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I&#x27;D BEEN USING A COUPLE YEARS AND IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this product! I use it every night and like the light but rich feel on skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I have very problematic skin, and this is one product that applies easily and makes my skin feel very good.</li>
            <li> A wonderful serum. Used at night &amp; you get up with the smoothest glowy face. wonderful citrus fragrance &amp; so well priced. Other vitamin C serums are higher priced. This is organic, you don&#x27;t need alot to cover face, very good quality.</li>
            <li> Seriously. I am only 30 so I didnt think that I would need an anti aging serum but I do weekly facials and I use a killer moisturizer after them but it is too heavy for regular use. I needed a little something for a little moisture after I take my makeup off every day (ish). I want something lite on my face after using the rose face wash (also by JM- whish is also incredible) to take my makeup off. So I tried this and I cant believe what a difference it makes. I thought the reviews were lying or only for older people, but seriously, my skin has cleared up, dark spots have evened out in days of using it( I didnt even realize I had &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34; till they disappeared). I dont even use it every single day, just after I wash my face, and thats only on the days I wear makeup. Its smells super good and is very refreshing. As I said before it only is a little bit moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin which is perfect for me. I have been VERY impressed with this line of products. I think I will have to make the change to the hair care too which I hear is crazy good too.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and it seems like it&#x27;s helping me with some fine lines. Hopefully with continued use I will see more of an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides on very nicely and I haven&#x27;t had any kind of bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> It smells greatly and my skin looks instantly better when I apply it! It feels great and looks great. Period.</li>
            <li> I love this product...I am 50 and it is terrific for the clarity of my skin. Highly recommend! Tried and true :)</li>
            <li> This product does NOT absorb quickly as the reviews say, in fact, it hardly absorbs at all.  In the morning when I wash my face, I first have to wash off the thick layer of the product that is left behind on my face. I will be going back to using Le Mieux vita-c serum, which really does absorb into the skin and shows greater improvement in brightness and clarity. Also, for a moisturizer that completely absorbs and makes skin look AMAZING, try the original Clinique dramatically different face lotion. Plumps up and softens skin.</li>
            <li> Great product at the end of the day</li>
            <li> The ingredient list for this item is wrong, the first ingredient is actually aloe vera juice, followed by sunflower seed oil and rose flower water. The vitamin c comes from ascorbic acid which is listed as the sixth ingredient. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month in lieu of a daily night moisturizer and have noticed a difference in radiance i.e. my skin isn&#x27;t as dull and a small sun spot on my cheeks has faded a little. I can see the smell being a little too funky for some people - it doesn&#x27;t disturb me, but I don&#x27;t think of it as being \\&quot;citrusy\\&quot;. It&#x27;s very light in texture, but a small pump of the serum goes a long way. I&#x27;m 29 years old with a Dorian Gray complex and would classify my skin as sensitive. I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to using this serum, unlike many other purportedly natural skincare I&#x27;ve used in the past (e.g. Korres). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the light texture, not sticky or smelly.</li>
            <li> I blend this with Hylauronic acid and after only a few days I could see and feel a difference. Very light and absorbs quickly...really love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for two weeks. My skin looks okay. I have not noticed any significant improvements.  I do not care for the scent. It eventually fades, but it is strong initially.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 YEARS.  IT IS WONDERFUL!  DOES EVERYTHING IT SAYS IT WILL, HELPS TO KEEP THOSE WRINKLES IN-CHECK AND KEEPS MY SKIN LOOKING FRESH AND YOUTHFUL.  THANK YOU JOHN MASTERS.</li>
            <li> Facial product may suit me but not you.  I got this from The Whole Food store.  I love it.  It is refreshing.  My face felt very comfortable after using it.  It smells good too.  I bought it when it was $30 dollars.  Now the price comes down.  I would get some more.  YEAH!</li>
            <li> I really love this product! My skin gets so dry and red when the cold weather starts, but this year I&#x27;ve been using this Vitamin C Anti-Aging Face Serum and my skin is better than it&#x27;s ever been! I will definitely use this all year round and I will recommend to my friends and family. I love the smell! My boyfriend told me it smells like the camping section of Walmart (lol) because it has a vaguely citronella-esqe scent but it&#x27;s very light and I think it&#x27;s very refreshing! I use this in conjunction with my regular moisturizer (I use Sephora&#x27;s brand mattifying daily moisturizing lotion with SPF in the day, and Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin night cream at night). I just pat on a light layer (one pump) all over my face before the rest of my skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid-20s and am starting to see more dryness in my skin and fine little wrinkles on my eyes and forehead, and I&#x27;ve noticed that this smooths them out very nicely and keeps my skin from getting red and irritated, even in the cold!</li>
            <li> As with all JM skin products, this one smells really good, and not in a cloying, heavy way. The scent is light and natural and doesn&#x27;t hang around on your face all day. It&#x27;s strong enough to smell it as you&#x27;re putting it on, but then dissipates over the next hour. I can&#x27;t stand face products with a heavy smell that lingers and have thrown away entire bottles for that reason alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I use it as a light moisturizer, altho some might not find it to be moisturizing enough for that. Does it work for anti-aging? Time will tell. I never assume that I&#x27;m going to see enormous changes overnight with anti-aging skin products, but I do like using this \\&quot;in the moment.\\&quot; It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, smells good, and I know vit C is good for the skin, so that&#x27;s enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, JM is one of the few natural brands out there that is truly natural. No long lists of unreadable ingredients like some of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products have. I think he runs his business with a lot of integrity from what I&#x27;ve read, so good for him for sticking to his ideals.</li>
            <li> A coworker of mine who has great skin recommended this product to me.  I put it on right after I wash my face and before the makeup as well as right before I go to bed.  It gives your skin a dewy, fresh glow without feeling greasy and is a great moisturizer.  After using a very expensive face cream for a few months with no results, I was very happy to switch to this product as my new daily face care product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is a wonderfully light moisturizer that I can use every day or every other day without feeling greasy. Smells great and helps to keep my skin radiant. I don&#x27;t know if I can ever be without it.</li>
            <li> I have very high standards when it comes to anti-aging products.  I am willing to shell out money, but I expect to see visible results.  Unfortunately, this is much harder when trying to use natural organic products.  Without the yucky chemicals I&#x27;m sadly starting to think that anti-aging is not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best I can say about this product is that the packaging is nice and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  But I see no anti-aging effect whatsoever.  And it&#x27;s not even moisturizing enough to be a stand alone product.  Given how hard it is to stabilize Vitamin C and give it a shelf life, it&#x27;s probably down right impossible without unnatural  chemical intervention.  I will finish the bottle since I paid for it and it can&#x27;t hurt me, but it&#x27;s begun to feel like a pointless step in my skin care routine and I await the end of the bottle so I can try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cellex-C High potency serum is a FAR superior vitamin C product if you are looking for one.  I will most likely go back to that for my vitamin C needs.  This is cheaper but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love using a product that is Organic it is a great deal better for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have bad sun/age spots on my face and after the first use, the dark spots diminished.  I need extra moisturizing so I added some of my usual face cream after applying this serum. I did get a small pimple but it is gone.  Not sure if it was caused by the serum although I hardly ever get pimples.  Maybe it was the combination of serum and face cream?  I will keep using it hopefully the dark spots will be gone. Best product I&#x27;ve used in a long time though!</li>
            <li> Love it and have used for years!</li>
            <li> I do like this face serum very much. The only negative thing I have to say about it is it is a bit sticky.but it does a good job of treating the skin in a positive manner so I will continue to use it. I only use organic products on my face, neck, &amp; body so this product is my first choice for the skin &amp; neck. I trust John Masters products because I believe them to be safe and they are organic and you can&#x27;t do better than that ! Holly</li>
            <li> Great product.  Absorbs well into the skin I use it every night before bed.  Good for sensitive skin to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Have been using it for a long time!</li>
            <li> I really like John Masters Organics products and this face serum is as great as all the others.  It leaves the face feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating, makes your face look Dewey and glowing! Will always use this product! Worth the price! I always use this and people always tell me that I have such nice skin.</li>
