            <li>but this year I did and found them at an excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for winter months, ideal for radiant and dewy skin.  </li>
            <li>I use them at night and the hydration is incredible.  </li>
            <li>They were packaged in the attractive gold rimmed case that can be used as a pill box once you are finished using capsules.  </li>
            <li>this product is a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 and my face looks and feels great.</li>

            <li>The contents are as good as what I would buy at a Eve Arden counter.</li>
            <li>Thought I was buying the eye version  -- nice but not as good as the eye capsules.</li>

            <li>i love them, they havent changed in 15 years and they remain the one beauty product that is a must have, they change the texture of my face leaving it more radiant.</li>
            <li>I have always been more of an Estee Lauder fan for make-up and for skin care</li>
            <li>I have used this product for YEARS and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I think it has made my skin look better.</li>
            <li>They are very rich and oily, so it made sense for me to have them work on my skin overnight.  </li>
            <li>so it is pretty amazing</li>
            <li>This is preservative free, so I do fine with it.</li>
            <li>and I had forgotten how fantastic this product is for the Chicago winters.  </li>
            <li>I am often told my skin looks great and that I look much younger than I am.</li>
            <li>cheap is the first.no box,why?</li>
            <li>My skin is dewy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love these capsules, they really leave my skin in better condition than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is very lubricating and yet is absorbed nicely.</li>
            <li>so I use it at bedtime and it does feel great on dry aging skin.</li>
            <li>First product that helps fine lines and medium ones to fade that I have used.</li>
            <li>Was very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li>Most recently I have received a one week sample of Ceramide Gold Ultra Restorative Capsules.  </li>
            <li>I was 20 when I first used this product</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed, but the vendor made good on the product, with excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>I had ordered several containers due to the great price, and tried two of them.</li>
            <li>The product is excellent but is more expensive here than other places I used to buy it.</li>
            <li>The capsules themselves are easy to open and apply to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Some consumers may find it too much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the reason that I purchase this product is because I used this product before for my face and really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the Ceramide lotion on my face in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that does not clog my pores, and makes my skin smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes nicely, but the beads are REALLY hard.</li>
            <li>For consumers living in cold climates, this may be ideal skin solution for the winter season to prevent skin cracking and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Very soothing for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have used these capsules for a few years and love them.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the Ceramide capsules in the past and I liked them but discontinued as I was constantly getting so many samples of other products since I work in the skincare industry.  </li>
            <li>But I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I have dry skin so it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I usually go with more organic products but for the winter...</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY other products, but only get compliments on my skin when I use these.</li>
            <li>I will never waste my $$ again</li>
            <li>I used these for about a year and didn&#x27;t see any real change in my skin, but I am only 36</li>

            <li> The capsules are all stuck together and tough to twist open, not what I normally find with this product.</li>
            <li> Love Elizabeth Arden products, but this one smelled rancid-- like vegetable oil that&#x27;s gone bad.</li>
            <li> it is a pity.</li>
            <li> It was to much trouble to send it back</li>
            <li> I never really thought of searching for them on Amazon</li>
            <li> They are not cheap if you buy them from a big chain store which I had done for the past number of years.</li>
            <li> I received this merchandise in just a few days and it was exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I do whatever it takes to track them down again.  </li>
            <li> The capsules are a little hard to twist open.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, no scent, does not clog pores or aggravate acne.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest using it in the evening because it is a bit oily and takes a little time to soak into skin.</li>
            <li> Have used in the past, but no longer have any &amp;#34;on hand&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I normally love all of this product line but the smell of the capsules is DISGUSTING.  </li>
            <li> gets mistaken for being in her 30&#x27;s all the time when she is a number of years past that mark.</li>
            <li> I have been using product on and off for the past 24 years.  </li>
            <li> reason I gave this product 4 stars is the fact that product is very heavy and oily.  </li>
            <li> I use the ceramide advanced/extreme time complex capsules every morning and night.  </li>
            <li> Not really remarkable in any way, so use substitutes.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I am a fan of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s \\&quot;Red Door\\&quot; fragrance so any time I can I choose some of her skin products.  Most recently I have received a one week sample of Ceramide Gold Ultra Restorative Capsules.  They were packaged in the attractive gold rimmed case that can be used as a pill box once you are finished using capsules.  The capsules themselves are easy to open and apply to the skin.  I ended up using them in the evening.  They are very rich and oily, so it made sense for me to have them work on my skin overnight.  Every morning, my skin looked radiant and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each capsule does not have enough content to be used on the throat.  So if you are applying moisture to your throat area, I suggest you use another cream for that purpose (I use Orlane products at the moment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this product 4 stars is the fact that product is very heavy and oily.  Some consumers may find it too much.  But I live in Florida so I can never have enough of moisture.  For consumers living in cold climates, this may be ideal skin solution for the winter season to prevent skin cracking and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love Elizabeth Arden products. I have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> I was sent the eye ceramide instead of the face and neck that I ordered, but I decided to keep it and use it on my face.  It seems to be doing a good job, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 Ceramide(60-Capsules) for my friend. But I got 4 (30-capsules) boxes. My friend may not like it. The seller should ship the same things as they were showed and charged at the website.</li>
            <li> I received this merchandise in just a few days and it was exactly as I expected.  I would use this seller again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> It works. The lines I had on my forehead are almost gone. First product that helps fine lines and medium ones to fade that I have used.</li>
            <li> Have used in the past, but no longer have any &amp;#34;on hand&amp;#34;. Not really remarkable in any way, so use substitutes.</li>
            <li> These are like liquid gold. i love them, they havent changed in 15 years and they remain the one beauty product that is a must have, they change the texture of my face leaving it more radiant.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Ceramide capsules in the past and I liked them but discontinued as I was constantly getting so many samples of other products since I work in the skincare industry.  I recently purchased them again and I had forgotten how fantastic this product is for the Chicago winters.  I use them at night and the hydration is incredible.  In one capsule, I have enough for the face, neck and hands.  At 50 cents per day... this product is a great bargain.  I am prone to breakouts but the purity of this product seems to keep that at bay. I highly recommend this product. I have always been more of an Estee Lauder fan for make-up and for skin care I usually go with more organic products but for the winter... this is it!</li>
            <li> Been using Elizabeth Arden time capsules since they came to market. I am often told my skin looks great and that I look much younger than I am. I do believe that this product contributed to those comments. I have been using 1 per day for something like 20 years. I have dry skin so it absorbs quickly.  Also, these do not leave a sticky residue. I am 52 and look 40. I have tried MANY other products, but only get compliments on my skin when I use these. Works great as a base under makeup.</li>
            <li> Love these capsules, they really leave my skin in better condition than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.Every time I run out I do whatever it takes to track them down again.  This is a fair price.</li>
            <li> I normally love all of this product line but the smell of the capsules is DISGUSTING.  I had to break them all apart too because they were stuck in a clump.  I will never waste my $$ again</li>
            <li> the reason that I purchase this product is because I used this product before for my face and really like it.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner, but upon using it-- found it to be defective. Love Elizabeth Arden products, but this one smelled rancid-- like vegetable oil that&#x27;s gone bad. I had ordered several containers due to the great price, and tried two of them. I was very disappointed, but the vendor made good on the product, with excellent customer service. (THANK YOU!)</li>
            <li> Moisturizes nicely, but the beads are REALLY hard. I had to open mine with scissors, which subsequently meant that I lost some of the product from each bead. I used these for about a year and didn&#x27;t see any real change in my skin, but I am only 36 and I&#x27;ve been using lotion since I was a child. The gold Arden beads are way better, though!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for YEARS and love it.  I am very happy to have found it again and at a reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> I use the product in the evening before going to bed.  It absorbs well so that I can follow up&lt;br /&gt;with my night repair cream.  I feel it is beneficial to my skin.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. I shall continue to use this. I am 49 and my face looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> cheap is the first.no box,why? is it really?only use by yourself ,no to be a gifts. it is a pity.</li>
            <li> I use the ceramide advanced/extreme time complex capsules every morning and night.  This is the only product that does not clog my pores, and makes my skin smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thought I was buying the eye version  -- nice but not as good as the eye capsules.</li>
            <li> The capsules are all stuck together and tough to twist open, not what I normally find with this product.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item.  You sent cream instead of capsules.  It was to much trouble to send it back so I just stuck it in the drawn.  Was very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> My wife has used these for years. They are not cheap if you buy them from a big chain store which I had done for the past number of years. I never really thought of searching for them on Amazon but this year I did and found them at an excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gets mistaken for being in her 30&#x27;s all the time when she is a number of years past that mark. Guess that means they work.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of the Ceramide lotion on my face in the mornings.  It is very lubricating and yet is absorbed nicely.</li>
            <li> I have used these capsules for a few years and love them.  I&#x27;m over 70 so it is pretty amazing how well they work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Elizabeth Arden cosmetics for years.</li>
            <li> The product has been discontinued from new production but is still available on the secondary market.  The product is excellent but is more expensive here than other places I used to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Is not greasy and I definetely notice a difference when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Love it! This was a great price to try for the first time.</li>
            <li> The capsules are a little hard to twist open. The contents are as good as what I would buy at a Eve Arden counter. I would order this item again.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to preservatives. This is preservative free, so I do fine with it. I like how my skin looks and feels. My skin is dewy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a short period of time. I would suggest using it in the evening because it is a bit oily and takes a little time to soak into skin. I don&#x27;t have the time to wait in the mornings for it to absorb so I use it at bedtime and it does feel great on dry aging skin. This is just my suggestion and how I use this product. I think it has made my skin look better.</li>
            <li> No change yet.  Use every day and still waiting for something to happen.</li>
            <li> I have been using product on and off for the past 24 years.  I was 20 when I first used this product, I remember applying before going to bed and waking up the next morning to glowing skin. Absorbs quickly, no scent, does not clog pores or aggravate acne.  Perfect for winter months, ideal for radiant and dewy skin.  I keep trying other products, but I keep coming back to this one. This is it!</li>
